Jerry Brown holds strong hand on prisons,"SACRAMENTO — Three liberal federal judges — relics of the Jimmy Carter era — are trying to force Gov. Jerry Brown to release nearly 10,000 criminals from state prisons. Politically, it doesn’t get much better for a governor.

The judges are threatening to hold Brown in contempt of court if he refuses to free the felons.

Go ahead, to paraphrase a former Carmel mayor, make his day. Fine him.

That’s one fine, I suspect, most California taxpayers would gladly pay for a governor trying to keep bad guys behind bars.

Except if I were an ambitious state controller like John Chiang, I’d refuse to write the check.

Then what? The federal government could retaliate by withholding funds from the state, such as money to help pay for poor people’s medical care. Would President Obama really allow that? He has more political smarts. You’d think.

The judges could order federal marshals to open the cell doors. Brown then could stand in one, a la segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace. That certainly didn’t hurt Wallace politically.

And Wallace was shamefully standing in the schoolhouse door trying to protect a university’s bigotry from integration by black students. Brown would be heroically protecting citizens from thugs.

The marshals could slap cuffs on the governor and drag him off to jail. Can’t visualize that, either. But there’d be no better way for him to campaign for reelection next year.

Although a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that most voters favor the early release of low-level, nonviolent offenders, they also don’t want to sacrifice public safety by dumping more criminals on the street.

Brown clearly holds a solid hand politically in this escalating confrontation. It’s long past time, however, to pull the curtain on the little drama.

“Enough already!” Brown told reporters, and that was in January. “Our prisons are not overcrowded.”

The three-judge panel since then has emphatically disagreed and recently ordered Brown to shed 9,600 inmates — about 8% of the prison population — by year’s end. And by the way, the judges said, commence “forthwith, notwithstanding any state or local laws.”

Brown is asking the panel for a stay while he appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, which two years ago ruled that California prison conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

The federal panel consists of three liberals originally appointed by President Carter: U.S. District Judges Thelton Henderson, 79, of San Francisco and Lawrence Karlton, 78, of Sacramento; and U.S. 9th Circuit appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt, 82, of Los Angeles.

Their jurisdiction over the state’s prison population stems from two separate class-action suits, one filed in 1990 on behalf of mentally ill inmates, the other in 2001 for medically ill prisoners. The jurists have ruled that overcrowding caused inadequate healthcare.

And for many years that was hard to dispute.

In 2007, the state had 173,000 inmates crammed in prisons built for fewer than 100,000. They were stacked like cordwood in some lockups — triple bunked in gyms, day rooms and hallways, leaving little space for rehab, education or drug treatment. But that’s no longer the case, prison officials assert.

“The prison systems were screwed up,” Brown admitted in January. But “we’ve done a lot to fix them.... Most people in prison get better [healthcare] inside the prison than they’ll get once they’re released.”

But the federal judges aren’t buying it. In a recent ruling, they accused the Brown administration of “defiance,” “intransigence” and “deliberate failure” to provide inmates with adequate care.

“The judges aren’t giving the state enough credit for everything it’s done,” insists Jeff Beard, the governor’s new corrections secretary.

“This is really a huge states’ rights issue. Maybe there needs to be more attention to this before we just start releasing people or go to contempt citations.”

Advertisement

In 2008, Beard was Pennsylvania’s prisons chief and testified as an expert witness against California’s lockups in federal court. After he retired in 2010, Beard was hired as a California prisons consultant and became impressed.

He doesn’t think the federal judges have been doing their homework and are focused on outdated numbers, stuck in old assumptions.

Advertisement

“The state has spent almost $2 billion since 2008 on upgrades,” he says. “The prison population also has been reduced quite a bit more than the judges seem to recognize.”

Beard says it’s down by 43,000 inmates from the peak, partly because of Brown’s controversial “realignment” program that places many low-level felons under county control.

Advertisement

The governor has sent the Legislature a plan to further reduce the prison population by leasing beds in county jails and private pens. It would cost $450 million over two years. But not even Brown likes the idea. And it’s DOA in the Legislature.

California already is planning to spend nearly $9 billion on prisons during the new fiscal year. That’s more than 9% of the general fund.

Advertisement

“We get criticized regularly for spending more than we have,” says Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). “I don’t want to put more money into building prisons or jails. That’s throwing money down a rat hole.”

“If we’re really serious about overcrowding,” Steinberg continues, “we have to keep people out of prison once they leave. The crying need is for more mental health services.”

But who knows what would satisfy these federal judges.

“Will they take three-fourths of a loaf?” asks UC Davis law professor Gabriel Chin. “That wouldn’t surprise me.”

Advertisement

The judges should find a way to declare victory and move on. Proclaim their mission accomplished.

If not, they’ll be tossing Brown a fat pitch down the middle, one he can’t miss.

Alex Johnson', 'Staff Writer']",Public input limited as Texas anti-abortion bill comes back up for debate,"Texas Republicans began trying again Tuesday to pass one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. as thousands of people jammed the state Capitol in Austin for the first public hearing since a chaotic Democratic filibuster killed the measure two weeks ago.

More than 2,000 people signed up to testify before the House State Affairs Committee on the renewed measure, which is being considered again in Austin because Gov. Rick Perry called a second special legislative session after the bill failed June 25.

But the committee chose a room with only 64 seats for the day of public testimony, which began at 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) and was scheduled to end at midnight. The limited space meant few members of the public could attend, and only about 100 would be able to speak, even with the brief time limit of 3 minutes.

Public testimony ended just after midnight, and the committee voted 8-3 to approve the measure, the Texas Tribune reported early Wednesday.

The enormous crowd stayed inside the Capitol despite the selection of the small room, threatening to overwhelm police, before nine other rooms were set up so they could watch the hearing on closed-circuit TV, NBC station KPRC of Houston reported from Austin. One woman fainted amid the crush.

Supporters and opponents alike said they weren't going anywhere.

""My boys are adopted. They could have been aborted,"" Lori Lett of Crosby, northeast of Houston, told KPRC.

""That's why I wanted to come,"" she said.

The Rev. Steve Washburn, pastor of First Baptist Church in Pflugerville, north of Austin, told NBC station KXAN of Austin that he and his supporters were ""here to stay as long as we need to stay in order to have our voices heard.""

""We're fighting for the lives of individuals,"" Washburn said. ""They're tiny, but they're still individuals.""

The full House is expected to take up the bill next week. The Senate has yet to take up the bill, but it's also expected to approve it.

Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat from Houston who opposes the measure, acknowledged that Republicans have the votes to pass it, but he vowed that his side would keep fighting.

""Regardless what happens on this particular bill, I think this discussion, this debate, this exercise is not over,"" Turner said.

It appeared that Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature, were in position to do that late last month. But Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, launched an 11-hour filibuster against the bill in a final-day debate that delayed a Senate vote until after the deadline to end the legislative session.

Davis' epic speech was watched live by hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. on streaming video, turning her into a national figure who's already being touted as a possible future candidate for governor.

In a move that opponents said disregarded the will of the people, Perry, an ardent opponent of abortion, called the Legislature back for another special session this week to try again.

Speaking Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Davis said that ""even if this bill passes, obviously there will be other challenges to it going forward.""

A similar battle could be brewing in North Carolina, where the Senate gave preliminary approval to a measure Tuesday night that would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as walk-in surgical centers to get licenses.

It's believed that only one clinic in the state meets that requirement, The Charlotte Observer reported.

During a Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon, several anti-abortion proposals were attached to a bill that would ban Islamic Sharia law in the state. Suzanne Buckley, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, accused lawmakers of ""trying to pull a Texas.""

""It seems to me that they're trying to pass under cover of darkness legislation that would not otherwise be passed,"" she said.

The measure must still be approved again by the Senate before it goes to the House.

The decision was announced Friday evening, hours after the Associated Press published a story about the flag, which officials said was part of an historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863. The flag had been planned to hang in the House chamber until April 2015, the 150th anniversary of the arrival of federal troops in Raleigh.

""This is a temporary exhibit in an historic site, but I've learned the governor's administration is going to use the old House chamber as working space,"" Cultural Resources Secretary Susan Kluttz said Friday night. ""Given that information, this display will end this weekend rather than April of 2015.""

Kim Genardo, the spokeswoman for Gov. Pat McCrory, said the exhibit that includes the Confederate battle flag will be relocated, possibly across the street to the N.C. Museum of History.

The decision was a quick about-face for the McCrory administration, which initially defended the decision. Many people see the flag as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry.

State Historic Sites Director Keith Hardison had said Thursday the flag should be viewed in what he called the proper historical context.

""Our goal is not to create issues,"" said Hardison, a Civil War re-enactor and history buff. ""Our goal is to help people understand issues of the past. ... If you refuse to put something that someone might object to or have a concern with in the exhibit, then you are basically censoring history.""

North Carolina NAACP president Rev. William Barber was shocked Friday when he was shown a photo of the flag by the AP.

""He is right that it has a historical context,"" Barber said. ""But what is that history? The history of racism. The history of lynchings. The history of death. The history of slavery. If you say that shouldn't be offensive, then either you don't know the history, or you are denying the history.""

Barber couldn't immediately be reached Friday night, after the decision to take down the flag.

Sessions of the General Assembly moved to a newer building a half-century ago, but the old Capitol building is still routinely used as a venue for official state government events. McCrory's office is on the first floor, as are the offices of his chief of staff and communications staff.

The Republican governor was in the House chamber where the Confederate flag hangs as recently as Thursday, when he presided over the swearing-in ceremony of his new Highway Patrol commander.

The presentation of the Confederate battle flag at state government buildings has long been an issue of debate throughout the South. For more than a decade, the NAACP has urged its members to boycott South Carolina because of that state's display of the flag on the State House grounds.

Prior to taking his current job in North Carolina in 2006, Hardison worked as director at the Mississippi home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which is operated as a museum and library owned by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The group has led the fight in the South for the proud display of the Confederate flag, which it contends is a symbol of heritage, not hate.

Hardison said the battle flag was displayed with other flags described in the diary of a North Carolina woman who visited the Capitol in 1863. A large U.S. flag displayed in the Senate chamber is reminiscent of a trophy of war captured from Union troops at the Battle of Plymouth.

""I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to recreate this?"" Hardison said. ""I think we were all thinking along the same vein. ... The Capitol is both a working seat of government, in that the governor and his staff has his office there. But it is also a museum.""

Hardison also pointed out that the national flag used by the Confederate government, with its circle of white stars and red and white stripes, is still flown over the State Capitol dome each year on Confederate Memorial Day. The more familiar blood-red battle flag, featuring a blue ""X"" studded with white stars, was used by the rebel military.

David Goldfield, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and author of the book ""Still Fighting the Civil War,"" said the battle flag can hold starkly different meanings depending on a person's social perspective.

""The history of the Confederate battle flag, how it was designed and formulated, how it has been used through the years, clearly states that it is a flag of white supremacy,"" Goldfield said. ""I know current Sons of Confederate Veterans would dispute that, saying `Hey, I'm not a racist.' But the fact remains that the battle flag was used by a country that had as its foundation the protection and extension of human bondage."""

Last week Oprah Winfrey made the very naughty observation that racism still exists in America and that—gasp—president Obama probably faces some of it. Worse, she made the equally naughty and equally true observation that racism will likely only get better when older generations of racists die. Since black people are not allowed to talk about racism, this has resulted in a network-wide Fox News freakout Hannity, for his part, seems to be under the impression that Oprah threatened to personally knock off elderly racists one by one, which for a movement still convinced that Obama is secretly raising an army of black people is probably not much more of a stretch.

This is just a thought, but it seems to me that people who were not racist are just not as prone to getting worked up about people talking about racism as racists are. Conversely, breaking out in network hives whenever someone brings the subject up is probably not the best way to show you understand the topic. The network push against Oprah might also have something to do with the White House awarding her the Medal of Freedom for her achievements; it seems many in the network get very worked up when black Americans visit the White House.

The bill bans abortions after 20 weeks

Protesters loudly sang%2C %27Give choice a chance%27

Gov. Rick Perry has said he intends to sign the bill into law

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed an omnibus abortion bill that is one of the most restrictive in the nation, but Democrats vowed Saturday to fight both in the courts and the ballot box as they used the measure to rally their supporters.

More than 2,000 demonstrators filled the Capitol building in Austin to oppose the bill, and state troopers drug six out of the Senate chamber for trying to disrupt the debate. The Republican majority ultimately passed the bill unchanged just before midnight, with all but one Democrat voting against it.

""Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life,"" said Gov. Rick Perry who will sign the bill into law in the next few days. ""This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women's health.""

Democrats, though, promised a fight in the courts.

""There will be a lawsuit. I promise you,"" Dallas Sen. Royce West said on the Senate floor, raising his right hand as if taking an oath.

Democrats offered 20 amendments to the bill, which will ban abortions after 20 weeks, require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and require all abortions take place in surgical centers. They ranged from exceptions for rape and incest to allowing doctors more leeway in prescribing abortion-inducing drugs. But Republicans would have none of it.

The bill is just one of many across the nation championed by anti-abortion groups set on a constitutional challenge to Roe vs Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a woman's right to decide on an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.

Texas falls under the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has shown a willingness to accept more stringent limits on abortions. Passing the law also pleases Christian conservatives who make up the majority of Republican primary voters.

But the measure has also sparked protests in Texas not seen in least 20 years, with thousands of abortion rights supporters flooding the Capitol to draw out normally boring committee hearings and disrupting key votes. Protesters finished a filibuster started by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth by jeering for the last 15 minutes of the first special session, effectively killing the bill.

That's when Perry called lawmakers back for round two. But opponents said the fight is far from over and used the popular anger to register and organize Democratic voters.

""Let's make sure that tonight is not an ending point, it's a beginning point for our future, our collective futures, as we work to take this state back."" Davis told 2,000 adoring supporters after the bill passed.

The Texas Republican Party, meanwhile, celebrated what they considered a major victory that makes Texas ""a nationwide leader in pro-life legislation.""

""As Democrats continue to talk about their dreams of turning Texas blue, passage of HB2 is proof that Texans are conservative and organized and we look forward to working with our amazing Republican leadership in the Texas Legislature as they finish the special session strong,"" a party statement said.

Friday's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight, and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.

Those arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery while singing, ""All we are saying is give choice a chance."" One of the women was successful in chaining herself, prompting a 10-minute recess.

Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill's Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.

Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home.

Cecile Richards, the daughter of former Gov. Anne Richards and president of Planned Parenthood, said Texas Republicans and abortion opponents won this political round — but it could cost them down the road.

""All they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's health care away,"" she said.

The dedication of those activists will be tested during the 2014 elections. Democrats have not won a statewide seat in Texas since 1994, the longest such losing streak in the nation."

This year the former secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union is feasting on nothing but water as he marks the 17th day of his hunger strike to protest Washington’s inaction over immigration reform.

While the rest of the nation is gorging on Thanksgiving meals, the immigration activist and two other fasters will be in a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol.

“We are a little thinner,” said Medina, who has lost 19 pounds. “It’s a good diet.” He said the goal of the fast was to bring attention to the plight of immigrants. “We are trying to connect with people on a human level, not on a policy or political level.”

Gaunt, with a patchy beard and a wooden cross hanging from his neck, Medina says he hopes that his fast will pressure House Republicans, who have held up action on an immigration overhaul.

“We want to see it sooner rather than later because of all the deaths and the deportations,” he said, referring to the roughly 200 people a year who die trying to cross the Sonora Desert along the southwest border with Mexico.

Some high-profile Democrats have dropped by his tent to lend support, including Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, as well as two Republican members of Congress, Jeff Denham and David Valadao, Californians who support an immigration measure.

“It is a tremendous commitment, what they have been through,” Denham said in a telephone interview. “I think it’s going to have an impact with more and more members.... It helps us bring great recognition to the overall issue.”

Denham says he pressed House Republican leaders last week to act more quickly. But prospects for legislative action before the end of the year appear dim.

Medina, 67, says his family is worried about his health.

“It’s normal that people that love you are really worried,” he said.

At night, Medina sleeps in a room of bunk beds with the other fasters at the Washington Seminar Center, a religious retreat on Capitol Hill.

A full-time nurse checks vital signs twice a day for Medina and two other fasters — Dae Joong Yoon, 43, and Christian Avila, 23 — who also stopped eating Nov. 12. The three risk damaging their livers and other organs as the nutrients in their bodies become more depleted.

During his fast, Medina has found that he needs less sleep. “I wake up and start thinking about what more I should be doing. Then I drive my staff crazy,” Medina said. “At 1 o’clock in the morning, every idea I have is brilliant.”

Medina isn’t surprised that some Republicans have dismissed the fast as a publicity stunt. ""[They see us as] these ragtag people sitting at the foot of the Capitol reminding them of what they have to do,” he said. “It’s a hard thing for them.”

Others say Medina’s fast is raising public awareness in the tradition of labor leader Cesar Chavez.

Advertisement

“It moves people who have been getting complacent and saying, ‘It is not going to happen and we should move on and focus on some other issues,’” said Miriam Pawel, a former Los Angeles Times editor and the author of a forthcoming biography, “The Crusades of Cesar Chavez.” “It reminds people of the injustices.”

When Biden sat with the fasters Friday, he told them to call him “Joe,” not “Mr. Vice President,” Medina said.

Medina would like to see the White House do more. Congressional action is needed to address the problems of the immigration system, but the Obama administration, he said, could use executive orders to slow the rate of deportations and keep more families together. (Pressed by a protester in San Francisco on Monday, President Obama said that he was doing all he could legally.)

Medina recalls being stunned in 1968 when he heard that Chavez was fasting to draw attention to labor conditions on farms. Medina was 22 and had been helping Chavez by organizing a boycott of table grapes in New York City. He remembers thinking to himself, “Is he going to die? What will happen to us?”

Chavez abstained from food for 25 days until New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was about to launch his campaign for president, traveled to Delano, Calif., and gave Chavez a piece of bread to break the fast. “It was a big validation of what we were trying to do,” Medina said.

He says that 1968 fast drove him to get more involved in union activity. He devoted his career to encouraging immigrants to join unions, eventually rising to the No. 2 position at SEIU, which represents janitors, security guards and other service workers. He quit that post earlier this year to lead an advocacy program in Washington for immigration reform.

He expresses hope that his fast will spur the same kind of change that Chavez’s inspired in him.

“It’s been 45 years since that fast, and I’ve never been let down by the American people,” Medina said.

Some of the inmates are being forced to comply with medication orders; others are to be moved to new cells.

The six tapes, created by guards abiding by a state policy to record all cell extractions, were shown in court in October as part of a lawsuit by inmates’ lawyers seeking a ban on the use of pepper spray against the mentally ill. The tapes were ordered released by U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton, who is holding hearings on the issue in Sacramento.

In one tape shot in July of last year at California State Prison at Corcoran, a screaming, naked prisoner is sprayed five times in 15 minutes before being tackled to the ground by about half a dozen guards and then strapped to a gurney.

His prison psychiatrist testified that the psychotic inmate had lost touch with reality and needed emergency medication.

“When we order involuntary medications, the inmate is told they will receive medications whether they like it or not,” said the psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest Wagner.

Lawyers representing some 30,000 mentally ill prisoners say the tapes show excessive force, the abuse of men who may have little understanding of what is happening to them or why.

“The mentally ill are being punished for their mental illness,” Jeffrey Bornstein, a San Francisco attorney representing inmates, told the judge.

Witnesses for the state, including California’s director of adult prisons, said in court that in all of the taped incidents guards followed proper procedure. It is safer to remove prisoners from their cell at a distance rather than use physical force, they said.

The corrections department filed the videos with the court Thursday and issued a statement calling the use of force “always a last resort for our staff.”

Extracting inmates from their cells is typically done to keep them “from harming themselves or others and to ensure that they are placed in a more appropriate mental health setting,” the statement said.

“What you don’t see on these videos,” it said, “is the hours of discussions that take place between the inmate and clinical staff before a cell extraction is ordered and the video camera starts rolling.”

The agency said that it is in the process of revising rules to limit the amount of pepper spray used at any one time.

The 31-year-old inmate in the footage from Corcoran last July had been suicidal, Wagner testified — refusing to eat food, consuming his feces and hearing voices. Eventually the court ordered the man medicated, and he was brought out of his cell to have the drugs administered.

Without the medication, Wagner told the court, the prisoner “would have died.”

After being removed from his cell, the inmate remained strapped down, under Wagner’s orders.

Advertisement

He was released when a different doctor came on duty and then was moved to an isolation cell, according to medical files read in court. His prison sentence was extended by three months as punishment for refusing orders.

In November of last year, the inmate was admitted to a prison psychiatric hospital, where his condition improved, court documents show. He was then returned to the general prison population and paroled in February, according to courtroom testimony.

Advertisement

Karlton had ordered that the names of prisoners be removed or covered up in the videos, out of concern for their medical privacy. The state also obscured the names of all staff involved in the incidents.

Three of the six tapes were aired in court without editing. The others had only the names of inmates blocked or erased.

A black South Carolina man says a restaurant in North Charleston refused to seat his party of 25 family and friends and asked the group to leave after a white customer complained of feeling threatened, according to reports.

The man, Michael Brown, also known as Mike London, could not be reached but his Facebook post in which he gave details of this experience indicates the group waited two hours to be seated at the Wild Wing Cafe before a manager approached and later refused to seat the group.

The chief marketing officer for the chain of restaurants based in Mount Pleasant, S.C., said the manager involved in the alleged incident is on leave until an investigation can be completed. She confirmed the group had been offered an apology and meals all around and said the restaurant has a meeting planned for later this week with some members of the restaurant party.

""It's not an us vs. them — we really join them in their concern,"" said the chief marketing officer, Debra Stokes. ""We have a zero tolerance of any kind. We have a diverse collection of individuals within our organization. We have always prided ourselves on inviting everyone into our restaurants.""

Michael Brown's Facebook post has attracted the attention of news media in this country and overseas and the post had been shared about 3,000 times as of Monday evening.

Brown and his group arrived at the Wild Wing Cafe to celebrate his cousin's last day in Charleston, according to the Daily Mail. The group waited ""patiently"" before being told a white customer was ""threatened by us,"" Brown wrote in his Facebook post.

Wrote Brown on Thursday on Facebook, ""The manager looked me dead in the face and said she was refusing us service because she had a right to and simply she felt like it.""

Brown told WCSC TV in Charleston that the shift manager told the group there was a ""situation.""

""She said, 'There's a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by your party, so she asked us not to seat you in our (sic) section,' which totally alarmed all of us because we're sitting there peaceably for two hours,"" Brown told the news organization. ""Obviously, if we were causing any conflict, we would have been ejected out of the place hours before.""

At that point, Brown said, someone in his group began to videotape the conversation. The manager became upset and refused to seat the group, Brown told WCSC.

""I said, 'So, you're telling me I have to leave?' She said, 'I have a right to deny you service.' I said, 'So you're asking me to leave because you're upset because he was recording you, after we've waited for two hours, and after you've already pretty much discriminated on us?' And she answered, 'Yes.' ""

Stokes told WCSC that she had a ""really good conversation"" with Brown about the incident.

""He and many of his family and friends were there about a month ago, and they are regular customers of ours,"" she said. ""They were having a going-away party and they just didn't receive the experience that they have come to know and love.""

Brown said the restaurant's apology and offer of free meals are not good enough.

""This is not a situation where you can just give us a free meal and everything is OK,"" he told the news organization. ""It goes deeper than that."""

Teens' Facebook posts monitored by school district,"GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) - A Southern California school district is trying to stop cyberbullying and a host of other teenage ills by monitoring the public posts students make on social media outlets in a program that has stirred debate about what privacy rights teenage students have when they fire up their smartphones.



Glendale Unified School District hired Geo Listening last year to track posts by its 14,000 or so middle and high school students. The district approached the Hermosa Beach-based company in hopes of curtailing online bullying, drug use and other problems after two area teenagers committed suicide last year, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.

The company expects to be monitoring about 3,000 schools worldwide by the end of the year, said its founder, Chris Frydrych.

In Southern California, the district is paying $40,500 to Geo Listening, and in exchange, the company's computers scour public posts by students on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, blogs and other sites. Analysts are alerted to terms that suggest suicidal thoughts, bullying, vandalism and even the use of obscenities, among other things. When they find posts they think should spur an intervention or anything that violates schools' student codes of conduct, the company alerts the campus.

The Glendale district began a pilot program to monitor students online last year at its three high schools, Glendale, Hoover and Crescenta Valley.

""We think it's been working very well,"" said the district's superintendent, Dick Sheehan. ""It's designed around student safety and making sure kids are protected.""

Some students say they are bothered by the monitoring, even if it's intended to help them.

""We all know social media is not a private place, not really a safe place,"" said Young Cho, 16, a junior at Hoover High. ""But it's not the same as being in school. It's students' expression of their own thoughts and feelings to their friends. For the school to intrude in that area — I understand they can do it, but I don't think it's right.""

The company does not have a list of students' names and instead uses ""deductive reasoning"" to link public accounts to students, Frydrych said. It also only looks at public postings.

Brendan Hamme, an attorney with the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the district is walking a fine line with its social media surveillance.

The program is ""sweeping and far afield of what is necessary to ensure student safety,"" he said.

Daily reports to school administrators include a screen capture of the flagged posts, along with details of whether they were made on or off campus, the time and date, the user's name, if available, and a description of why the post caught the attention of analysts, Frydrych said.

It's up to administrators to decide to act and, so far, no students have been disciplined because of a post discovered under the pilot program, Sheehan said."

She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.

(CNN) —

“The stupidity is simply staggering,” Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, told Roll Call. He was referring to the political miscalculation of anti-abortion forces in the House Judiciary Committee who insisted this week on reviving the culture wars, years behind us, still again, with yet another proposed abortion bill.

This bill, championed by Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks, sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. “I’ll be very frank: I discouraged our leadership from bringing this to a vote on the floor,” Dent said.

My e-mail box was flooded with headlines that began “This again?” and “This … is the GOP’s idea of outreach to women? Really?” and “He said what?” The latter referred to a remark by Franks, chairman of the committee, that “incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,” as a justification for the bill ignoring rape and incest victims.

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were apparently willing to allow the time when an abortion is legal to be reduced by one month. They sought to add exceptions for rape, incest and the woman’s health – all of which were rejected by Republicans on the panel.

But it appears the House Republican leaders, recognizing a train wreck, added the language to the bill anyway to avoid an embarrassing defeat. The bill will also include an exception for a medical emergency in which the woman might die. This new altered version goes before the Rules Committee on Monday. There are, by the way, 22 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. All men. Not a single woman.

It’s hard to avoid inflammatory remarks when discussing rape. And the line between inflammatory and insulting is thin. It’s also porous. So if Franks thought he had to address the issue of rape, he should have done so judiciously.

His remark says to women impregnated by rape: You don’t count. There aren’t enough of you to matter. That’s not just insensitive; it’s immoral.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, first pounced on the statement’s factual inaccuracy. “I just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low,” she said. “There’s no scientific basis for that.”

Then Lofgren, one of five women among the Democratic minority on the committee, added, “And the idea that the Republican men on this committee can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous.”

It might be that Franks’ argument, such as it is, echoed a comment by Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin, who claimed during his Senate campaign last fall that women’s bodies have a built-in mechanism to prevent impregnation from “a legitimate rape.” Aiken’s candidacy went into a tailspin from that misinformed remark, and never recovered.

Fact checkers have pointed to studies that indicate Franks’ claim is as suspect as Akin’s. One study by St. Lawrence University found that pregnancies resulting from rape were higher than from other instances.

Franks later walked back his low-pregnancy-from-rape argument, saying he was not claiming it was harder to get pregnant from rape. Franks apparently based his claim on there being fewer pregnancies from rape than from consensual intercourse. Even so, that’s a “Duh, do the math” excuse.

GOP aides now say Rep. Marsha Blackburn will be managing Franks’ anti-abortion bill. Given her record – “no” votes on major equality or women-protection legislation and “yea” for issues like ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood – that’s hardly an improvement.

And it misses the point. It’s not the who, it’s the what – the argument itself does not stand.

During the Judiciary debate, Franks said, “When you make that exception, there’s usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours. And in this case that’s impossible. … And that’s what completely negates and vitiates the purpose for such an amendment.”

So, Franks’ argument then became a technical one, that if a rape wasn’t reported, a decision after 20 weeks to abort was made too late. But why is it too late? Does psychological trauma have a timetable? Each case of rape that produces a pregnancy is as individual as the woman who was raped. And the ordeal – psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual – is not term-limited.

The issue of abortion raises real and poignant moral questions. Franks made many remarks that show his obvious, deeply felt, conviction that abortions after 20 weeks are wrong.

But majorities in Congress and of Americans, also with deep conviction, came to a different conclusion: They feel compelled to support exceptions for rape, incest and health.

Franks’ outrageous comment and the viewpoints of other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee illustrate that when one party becomes so narrowly composed that it represents a particular religious culture, we’re headed to what people in other countries face when a ruling party begins making laws from religious theology, without regard to a democratic, secular society – thus excluding other religious viewpoints and dismissing those who suffer as too few to matter.

Post-Apprendi and Booker, a federal district court judge must use the guidelines as a starting point, but is free to depart from them (in either direction) based on stated reasons so long as it is deemed a reasonable use of the judge's discretion.

Justice Sotomayor's decision starts with Calder v Bull, a 1798 decision of the Court, which held that the Ex Post Facto clause applies to:

“1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.”

That a district court may ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the Guidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that an incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error ensures that they remain the starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system.... Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicating that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges. Even after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases imposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences that depart downward from the Guidelines on the Government’s motion. In less than one-fifth of cases since 2007 have district courts imposed above- or below-Guidelines sentences absent a Government motion. Moreover, the Sentencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guidelines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move with it. The federal system adopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.

First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended Guidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive a harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guidelines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply with §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in essence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sentence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological goals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve such pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create a risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The Government does not challenge these holdings but rather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise to an ex post facto violation.... On the Government’s account, the Guidelines are just one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court can consult, no different from a “policy paper.” The Government’s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that district courts are not required to consult any policy paper in order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must they “consider the extent of [their] deviation” from a given policy paper and “ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance."" Courts of appeals, in turn, are not permitted to presume that a sentence that comports with a particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of appeals, in considering whether the district court’s sentence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure from a given policy paper in determining whether the district court abused its discretion. It is simply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely a volume that the district court reads with academic interest in the course of sentencing…. District courts must begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense and use them to calculate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines will anchor both the district court’s discretion and the appellate review process in all of the ways we have described. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the status of one of many reasons a district court might give for deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is simply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.

The arguments put forward by the Government and the dissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh’s case falls within Calder’s third category of ex post facto violations. “[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [government] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering the substantive ‘formula’ used to calculate the applicable sentencing range.” Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is precisely what the amended Guidelines did here.

And so, Justice Sotomayor argues, the guidelines are binding enough so as to effectively change the sentencing rules midstream:To which the dissenters (led by Justice Thomas) argue, no, wait, a guideline is not a ""law"":To which Justice Sotomayor and the majority responds:Oh, snap. Justice Thomas wrote the Morales decision.

So that's that. Almost. Because I need to flag one more instance, where, yet again, Justice Thomas flies solo, going much further into originalist precedent-destroying than any of his conservative colleagues. See, Justice Thomas would have also held that ""nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post Facto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that prisoners and defendants have about how many days they will spend in prison,"" and hold that so long as the longer sentence was possible under the earlier sentencing regime, it would not violate the Ex Post Facto clause to impose it on the defendant. Everyone who's been interpreting Calder in the subsequent 200+ years, Justice Thomas believes, has been doing it wrong (even though he, himself, did the same thing in Morales in 1995):

Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a defendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not implicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual contemplating the commission of a given offense knows he may be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed range. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he may even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But he does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U. S., at 258 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment) (“Discretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the sentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of the risks that the offender knowingly assumes”). The law provides the defendant with only one assurance: He will be sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by statute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not deprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the concerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was an error to which I succumbed.

As to his undermining his own decision in Morales, Justice Thomas sheepishly drops a footnote:Again: Only Thomas went there. (He also clearly loses points for the wussy use of the passive voice. How about ""As the author of Morales, I erred in failing to apply original meaning""?)

Indeed, Justices Alito and Scalia issued a separate dissent just to make clear to everyone that they wouldn't (yet). In its entirety, it reads:

I agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that retroactive application of amended advisory Guidelines does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause under our “sufficient risk” test. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 509 (1995). I do not have occasion in this case to reconsider that test’s merits or its relation to the original understanding of the Clause.

So Peugh goes to jail (for less time, probably), and Justice Thomas goes his own way. Again."

At some point, John Boehner is going to have to step up and actually lead his caucus.

House Republicans held a big closed-door meeting Wednesday to discuss what they were going to do about immigration reform. And since while the meeting was closed-door, they apparently all came out and started dishing to every reporter in sight, we know quite a lot about what was said. The bottom line was a given: House Republicans don't like brown people, they don't like immigration, they don't like President Obama, they would like insane amounts of border security. Beyond that, well, they're in disarray.

As much as Republicans emerged from the meeting railing against an Obama administration that they say ""cannot be trusted to deliver on its promises to secure the border and enforce laws as part of a single, massive bill like the one passed by the Senate,"" there are also clear signs that many Republicans still know they're going to be in electoral trouble if they don't do something significant on immigration:



“I think the majority of Republicans want to get something done,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador of Idaho, adding that he thinks the majority of the conference stands behind perhaps not a pathway to citizenship but at least a pathway to legalization that would grant status to so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who opposes any immigration overhaul, described the party’s split over a citizenship or legalization pathway as about “fifty-fifty.”

Lawmakers are also still divided on whether it’s even necessary to pass immigration reform in the 113th Congress. Though the Senate passage creates some sense of urgency for the House to act, many Republicans don’t believe that action is crucial. As it is, the new school of thought is that no action on a House immigration measure would happen until after the August recess.

But given the conflict between those who know the party's future will be endangered by inaction and those who want to take punitive action against immigrants, Republicans seem inclined to kick the can down the road:Because when you're in this much disarray, delay has to look good. The question then is how the passing time will wear on John Boehner"

Invited by the school's principal and hosted by a fundamentalist organization called ""Believe in West Virginia,"" which advertised the event by circulating flyers with the tag-line God's plan for sexual purity, Stenzel's mission was to convince students that condoms aren't safe and that those who use birth control have mothers who hate them.

High school student Katelyn Campbell, a senior, had another mission: let students know her message was bunk. She filed a complaint with the ACLU and began speaking out against Stenzel's visit.

And that's when her principal began threatening her.

This from ThinkProgress:



A West Virginia high school student is filing an injunction against her principal, who she claims is threatening to punish her for speaking out against a factually inaccurate abstinence assembly at her school. Katelyn Campbell, who is the student body vice president at George Washington High School, alleges her principal threatened to call the college where she’s been accepted to report that she has “bad character.” [...] Despite being threatened, Campbell is not backing down. She hopes that filing this injunction will protect her freedom of speech to continue advocating for comprehensive sexual health resources for West Virginia’s youth. “West Virginia has the ninth highest pregnancy rate in the U.S.,” Campbell told the Gazette. “I should be able to be informed in my school what birth control is and how I can get it. With the policy at GW, under George Aulenbacher, information about birth control and sex education has been suppressed. Our nurse wasn’t allowed to talk about where you can get birth control for free in the city of Charleston.”

According to Campbell, her principal said, “How would you feel if I called your college and told them what bad character you have and what a backstabber you are?” Campbell alleges that Aulenbacher continued to berate her in his office, eventually driving her to tears. “He threatened me and my future in order to put forth his own personal agenda and make teachers and students feel they cant speak up because of fear of retaliation,” she said of the incident.

The bravery of Campbell should not be underestimated, for her principal's threats were quite severe, particularly when viewed through the lens of a prospective college student.Speakers like Stenzel cause irreparable harm by frightening students with misinformation into believing that contraception is dangerous; approximately 60 percent of teens are misinformed about contraception, and speakers like Stenzel and fundamentalist figures are often to blame for this.

Luckily for George Washington's students, this misinformation is coming to the fore, and students are rallying around Campbell's cause, planning to take the matter before the school board.

The assembly was supposed to publicly shame high school students. The ones being shamed now? School officials and a conservative speaker who has no business talking to a group of young people.

Starting Monday, that's the law.

July 1 marks the start of the fiscal year, which means hundreds of new state laws go into effect. Many of the laws focus on topics that are part of a national debate like gun control, abortion rights drone surveillance and Internet privacy. On a lighter note, some of Monday’s laws affect smaller-scale changes, such as ordering edible landscaping to be grown around the Statehouse in Maine or finally being able to play the lottery in Wyoming.

Colorado’s gun legislation in effect today is similar to the kind of comprehensive gun control reform President Barack Obama’s administration is trying to pass on a national level.

Just shy of a year after the deadly movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., where James Holmes killed 12 people and injured 58 during the midnight premier of The Dark Knight Rises, Colorado passed one of the most progressive gun reform laws in the country. Starting Monday, the state now requires background checks for both private and online gun sales. It also banned high-capacity ammunition magazines like the one Holmes used.

Despite major mass shootings like Aurora and December’s school massacre that left 20 children and 7 adults dead in Newtown, Conn., 18 states actually passed loosened gun laws that also take effect Monday. In Kansas, individuals can carry guns into more public buildings. Most notably, school employees can now carry concealed handguns.

State legislators in many states are looking to crack down on abortion limits. About 13 states passed stricter abortion laws after state legislators proposed more than 300 bills aimed at limiting abortions in 2012, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. North Dakota passed the strictest abortion law in the country, which takes effect in August, banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

Currently, Texas legislators are battling over a bill that would restrict abortions in the state after 20 weeks. Texas Gov. Rick Perry convened a special legislative session to push the abortion bill through despite state Sen. Wendy Davis’ historic 11-hour filibuster June 25. The session starts July 1 and can last up to 30 days, making it unlikely Texas Democrats will be able to block the bill.

Legislators in eight states passed laws that protect employees’ social media accounts. Individuals no longer have to provide their social media passwords to their employers.

U.S. legislators continue to enact stricter laws involving mobile devices in moving vehicles. Hawaii and West Virginia drivers are now part of the growing number of states that ban the use of handheld devices while driving. Some states banned texting while driving or enacted more stringent punishments for those who try to multitask by texting and driving.

States are also looking to take advantage of mobile devices as four states can now use their smart phone to show proof of car insurance.

Over the past year, Americans learned through leaked top-secret documents about heightened drone surveillance. Six states, including Idaho and Virginia, passed stricter drone laws that take effect Monday. Virginia’s ban prevents authorities from using drones for the next two years.

Other notable laws include:

Washington state lawmakers are stripping the state’s books of sexist language. As of Monday, words that include men will become more gender neutral. For example, “his” will appear as “his or her” and college “freshmen” will become “first-year students.”

Kentucky lifted a longstanding Prohibition-era law that banned the sale of alcohol while the polls were still open. Now, Blue Grass State residents can enjoy a drink on election day.

New Jersey has a checkered past with its relationship with tanning, as the cast of Jersey Shore is famous for its orangey glow. It is one of dozens of states that passed stricter tanning laws to keep minors away from the fake sun. Spray tans for Jersey’s youth are also banned as of July 1.

Wyoming residents can finally take part in the lottery, leaving only a few states that do not offer the big prize drawing.

Wade,"For more than two decades, the ruling in the Roe vs. Wade case, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, has been a rallying point for millions. Opponents and supporters continue to fight for their cause.



The opinion has turned political novices into activists and has been a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees and political appointees. It has been a cornerstone of campaigns at every level nationwide. It also has led some to commit deadly violence.



Defining moment in history



""Roe vs. Wade was a defining moment in our history. It has touched all of our lives in one way or another,"" said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""It has fundamentally altered the legal, medical and political landscape of this country.""



Today, the ruling remains legally complicated, emotionally explosive and politically divisive. The controversy shows no signs of abating as new issues have surfaced, including proposed bans on late-term abortions and a push for new laws to protect the rights of fetuses.



Even Jane Roe, the Texas woman who sued for a woman's right to have an abortion, has remained in the fray. The woman, Norma McCorvey, is now in her 50s, a grandmother and vehemently anti-abortion -- to the consternation and skepticism of pro-choice organizations. She said she became a Christian in 1995 and regrets her role in the case.



""I signed an affidavit that brought the holocaust of abortion onto this nation,"" said McCorvey, who has written a book about her life and conversion. ""I'm just really grateful I'm in the kingdom of God now, and all is forgiven.""



A deeply divided public



Public opinion on abortion, however, has not changed dramatically during the last 33 years. Since the first polls were done in the wake of the 1973 ruling, Americans have held deeply contradictory views on the issue: Most think abortion should be legal, but most also believe it is murder.



""The public is at once pro-choice and pro-life,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studied polls on the issue. ""Americans want to keep abortion legal and at the same time support restrictions on its use.""



New strategy by protestors



What has changed is the nature of the conflict. Since the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe in 1992, opponents have all but conceded defeat at directly attacking it. As a result, they are seeking to chip away, fighting for bans on late-term abortions, pushing for greater state regulation of abortions and encouraging malpractice lawsuits against abortion providers.



Foes also point to new developments in the law that give fetuses greater protection. In some states, a woman can be prosecuted for harming her fetus by drinking or taking drugs. That same woman, however, could have chosen to abort her fetus legally.



""You cannot have abortion on demand as a fundamental right and at the same time start criminalizing fetal damage caused by drug use or alcohol use,"" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice.



Complicating matters are advances in medical technology, which mean doctors can operate on fetuses in the womb and deliver them earlier.



Blackmun's choice



Justice Harry Blackmun could not have possibly foreseen these issues when he crafted the majority opinion in Roe vs. Wade, which ruled a Texas statute unconstitutional because it prohibited abortion.



Blackmun spent the rest of his tenure on the court defending Roe and a woman's right to an abortion, but his majority decision has been harshly criticized by legal analysts and people on both sides of the abortion issue.



It is thought of by many as a poorly reasoned exercise in judicial overreaching that usurps the legislative branches of government.



""It's an outrageous constitutional ruling,"" constitutional scholar Bruce Fein said. ""The court is supposed to be interpreting the Constitution, not writing a treatise on the evolution of abortion.""



There were two dissents to Roe, each of which foreshadowed the criticism to come. Justice Byron White wrote that the court had no grounds for making such a decision, calling it an ""exercise of raw judicial power."" Justice William Rehnquist, who later became chief justice of the United States, also dissented and would vote to overrule the decision.



Indeed, the Rehnquist Supreme Court, while refusing to overrule Roe, seemed to want to distance itself from the decision. The ruling's reasoning was never mentioned in other opinions, and it never was extended to other areas such as physician-assisted suicide. Even abortion-related opinions, such as one written by Rehnquist in 1989, don't mention the constitutional right that was the basis for Roe.



Roe vs. Wade challenged



The biggest threat to Roe came in 1992 when the court decided Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, a case challenging Pennsylvania restrictions on abortion. Abortion supporters feared the court would use the case to overrule Roe, but the court, in a 5-4 decision, reaffirmed it.



Even so, the court upheld several restrictions, including a 24-hour waiting period. It also adopted a new standard for determining when laws restricting abortion violate the Constitution. The court now asks whether a law would impose an ""undue burden"" on a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus is viable.



Most states have adopted some restrictions on abortion. Thirty-nine states have passed laws that require minors to get the consent of a parent or judge before getting an abortion but the law is not being inforced in at least nine states."

She Is Now Based In San Francisco.']",Sponsors of Prop. 8 file petition to stop same-sex marriages,"ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of Proposition 8, filed an emergency petition to the U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday to stop same-sex marriages from continuing in California.

The petition says the decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to permit weddings starting Friday afternoon was “premature.”

“When the Ninth Circuit originally put in place its stay to prevent same-sex marriage pending Supreme Court action, it stated clearly that ‘the stay shall continue until final disposition by the Supreme Court,’ ” the group said in a written statement.

“Under Supreme Court procedural rules, ‘final disposition’ comes when the Supreme Court issues a ‘mandate’ to the Ninth Circuit, at least 25 days after announcing its opinion in the case. The 25-day waiting period is provided to allow parties such as Prop. 8’s proponents to petition the Supreme Court for a re-hearing of the case.”

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote Wednesday’s decision that gutted the anti-gay marriage Defense of Marriage Act, usually decides such petitions from California.

“People on both sides of this debate should at least agree that the courts must follow their own rules,” said Andy Pugno, chief counsel for ProtectMarriage. “This kind of lawlessness just further weakens the public’s confidence in the legitimacy of our legal system. We hope the Supreme Court will step in and restore some order here.”

On Friday, the appeals court bypassed a normal waiting period in lifting a hold on a trial judge’s order that declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional.

“It couldn’t come a moment too soon,” Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sparked the legal effort for gay marriage in California when he was San Francisco mayor, said on Friday.

“What extraordinary timing, right before [gay] pride weekend,” he said. “All that time, all the struggle, and the moment has arrived.”

Supporters of Proposition 8 were furious that the 9th Circuit acted before the normal waiting period. ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of the ballot measure, has 25 days from the ruling to ask for reconsideration.

“It is part and parcel of the utter lawlessness in which this whole case has been prosecuted,” Chapman University constitutional law professor John Eastman said. “Normally, courts let the parties kind of pursue their legal remedies before they issue a mandate.”

He said the 25-day period for asking the Supreme Court to reconsider still applied, and a rehearing, though extremely unlikely, remained a technical possibility.

“Tonight it is chaos and lawlessness, and anyone who is concerned about the rule of law ought to be deeply troubled by what happened here,” Eastman said.

Moral Monday #6: 89 arrested; Charlotte Observer reporter detained,"U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (Dem., N.C. District 1) and former U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge were among the speakers at the protest and rally on the rain-soaked and muddied Halifax Mall that lies between the General Assembly and the Legislative Office Building in downtown Raleigh. Other speakers included representatives from the NAACP-North Carolina, clergy members from around the state, and members of other coalition partners sponsoring the weekly Moral Monday gatherings.

Butterfield called the avanlanche of nearly 2,000 GOP- and Tea Party-sponsored bills put forward in this legislative session ""absolutely disgusting"" and ""devastating to low-income people."" The list of bills, many of which were put forward verbatim from the playbook of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), is exhaustive and clearly indicative of a concerted effort to gut public education, suppress voter rights, encourage gun ownership, deter public transparency of governance and corporate workings, and overhaul the state's tax system to encourage regressive sales taxes. You can read an abbreviated listing of the key bills here.

But Butterfield also noted that his colleagues in Washington and the U.S public are taking notice of what's being done under the cover of ALEC-funded ""reform"" in the Tar Heel State.

""It is a widespread movement that is gaining momentum,"" Butterfield said to the crowd of hundreds huddled under umbrellas taking refuge from a stormy downpour. ""The nation is watching.""

After the main speeches, the crowd of protesters accompanied the 84 people sporting green armbands to designate their willingness to enter the General Assembly building and refuse to disperse when ordered to do so by law-enforcement officers. We walked to the second-floor hallway in between the N.C. Senate and N.C. House chambers and gathered near the fountains while singing ""Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round."" Clergy members from all around the state led us in prayer and words of support and encouragement.

The G.A. and Raleigh police allowed us to sing and pray for 15-20 minutes, then made an announcement that we had five minutes to disperse or we would be arrested. At that point, a few people peeled away and moved up to the third floor to support us, but most of those gathered outside the House Chambers remained, holding up signs (a prohibited act in the legislative building), singing, and praying.

Police were without except gentle and kind as they approached us, one by one, and asked each of us whether we were aware that if we did not leave, we would be arrested. When we acknowledged that we understood this, the officers respectfully encircled our wrists with plastic zip-ties, documenting each arrest carefully with videocameras. Each of us was gently guided to a nearby elevator and taken to a basement cafeteria, which is converted each Monday afternoon to an ersatz detention intake station. We sat quietly, some a little nervous, some in physical discomfort from the handcuffs, all buoyed by the determination that we've lawfully asserted our constitutional right to peaceably assemble and make our grievances known to our legislators.

As the room filled with arrestees, we were walked through the steps of the process and then taken to waiting buses. Quietly and surreptitiously, many of the detention and police officers let us know they supported what we were doing. It was a little difficult to hold back tears as they gently guided us into the buses while whispering their support.

Our five buses pulled out of the loading docks of the NCGA building to the cheers and claps of hundreds of supporters. Those of us whose hands were cuffed in front of us waved as best we could; others pressed their heads against the windows and shouted thanks for the encouragement. It was a great morale boost to be greeted by the voices of those who stood by us.

It was at the Wake County Detention Center (WCDC) where we noticed the small signs that our weekly protests are making a difference in North Carolina. With the arrests of nearly 400 protesters (not 400 arrests but 400 arrested protesters, as once you're arrested for failure to disperse, you're not permitted back into the General Assembly until your case is adjudicated in 2-3 months), the WCDC has tweaked its processes to more easily accommodate the growing number of arrests each Monday. Last week, for instance, the 151 people arrested on ""Mega Moral Monday"" were submitted to the usual fingerprinting process, but detention officials have eliminated that step for the Moral Monday arrestees to speed up the process and decrease the strain and discomfort of those of us who are charged and processed.

This and many quietly supportive statements by detention and police officers let us know that Moral Mondays are no longer being taken as flashes in the pan, that state and county officials understand that Moral Monday has become a movement, not just a moment.

Our five buses arrived at the WCDC around 6:30-7:00, and by 10 p.m., the last of us who were on the first bus were heard before the County Magistrate and signed the papers acknowledging the three charges against each of us:

Fail to disperse on command;

Second-degree trespass;

violation of Legislative Building policy, ""willfully creating a disturbance in the N.C. State Legislative Building with loud singing and yelling, and/or displaying unauthorized signs in violation of G.S. 120-32.1(B).""

I was a little nervous when I was held for a few minutes alone in the magistrate's vestibule. Unlike the others in my group, I was accompanied by not just one officer but three. My name was carried on a Post-It Note to the G.A. police officers outside and brought back with a fourth officer. I admit I got a little shaky and my eyes began to tear up, wondering whether something was wrong.

But the fourth officer who accompanied me turned out to be Wayne, the G.A. Police officer who's been a constant support for me in these past four months of regular ""GA sanity inspections"" as a citizen lobbyist 2-3 days a week at the General Assembly. Wayne always makes sure I have access to a private area to recharge my electronic devices after I return to the GA building from a morning of meeting with legislators and staff and take up my place in one of the indoor courtyards to write and blog. He stops by my ersatz courtyard ""office"" each time to check on how I'm doing, make sure I have water, and joke about my not drinking coffee to support my ""mad manic typing skillz.""

Without saying anything, Wayne and one of his colleagues led an increasingly nervous me out of the magistrate's offices and into the release area, and as we turned a corner and the three of us were alone in a hallway, Wayne leaned in and said with a wink and a smile, ""I just knew you were going to be here one Monday. Thank you for all you've been doing these past weeks and months, and thanks to all of you for what you're doing tonight. It matters."" Teary-eyed, I leaned into his hug as we entered the release area and I was given back a large envelope with my water bottle, cell phone, keys, and identification. Wayne and I shook hands as I headed toward the door and freedom.

Outside, I was greeted with claps and cheers. I got a big hug from N.C. Sen. Earline Parmon, who's been one of my constant supporters each and every day I spend as a citizen lobbyist at the NCGA. One of the leaders of the N.C. Black Legislative Caucus and an ordained minister, Sen. Parmon comes to the WCDC every Monday night to greet every single arrestee, staying until the very last person is processed and released -- even last week, when 151 civil-disobedience participants were arrests and processing took until 5 a.m.



Once released from the Wake Co. Detention Center, I was presented with buttons commemorating the Moral Monday civil-disobedience arrests and protests.

Bedraggled and a little stiff from the handcuffs, we were nonetheless exuberant about our release and the quiet words of support from the various law-enforcement and detention personnel who processed us.

There was a little more paperwork (decidedly less somber) from the NAACP regarding its legal-defense system for the Moral Monday arrests, and then we all joined the growing number of those released who stayed to clap and cheer for those who were released after us.Sen. Parmon joined me on one of the benches and we discussed the effects of the growing Moral Monday movement and how we can move forward. So far, N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory has refused to meet with any of us who are opposed to the odious raft of ALEC-sponsored legislation. He refused again on Monday when asked to meet with clergy members who came from all over the state to bring the voices and appeals of their parishioners to the capital. Sen. Parmon suggested one next step might be to camp out at the governor's mansion. Those of us who've been arrested are prohibited from stepping foot into the General Assembly building and the Legislative Office Building until our cases are fully adjudicated (although we can make appointments with individual legislators and have them or their staff escort us from the reception area to their offices and back). But we are not prohibited from the grounds of the governor's mansion and offices, just a couple blocks away.

By midnight, all of us had been processed and released. Throughout the evening, NAACP volunteers shuttled processed arrestees back to the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, where we'd started the afternoon with legal briefings by the NAACP legal-defense team, for welcome food and water. We talked about the Moral Monday movement and how it is taking root in North Carolina, how the whole nation is starting to notice what we're doing and why we're doing it, how we have a long and tough slog ahead of us.

And then, exhausted and sore but buoyed by the spirit of ""peaceably assembling"" together, we went home to our families, our kittehz, our beds. And we knew we are moving forward together taking not one step back.

Please join us for a Moral Monday at the N.C. General Assembly. You will not be asked to join those who risk arrest (but you will be well-supported and cared-for if your conscience prompts you to volunteer), and your support and claps and cheers will matter a great deal to those who do make that choice. Even if you can't come to Raleigh, you can support our civil disobedience movement by making a contribution of food or funds for legal defense.

Forward together! Not one step back!

Gruninger was stripped of his job, his reputation was trashed, and it's only now, more than half a century after the fact, that his town is beginning to acknowledge and honor him. During his lifetime, he was a pariah. His chapter is entitled ""Disobeying the Law.""

Aleksander Jevtic, a Serb swept up in a round-up of Croats in his small home town in northern Serbia. Since he was a hometown guy, the Serbs asked him to separate the Croats from his fellow Serbs so the enemy could be identified and detained (and presumably killed). Moving slowly through the decrepit cowshed where they were huddled, he slowly began—he'd pick out a Serb, another Serb, another Serb …. and then a Croat, whom he would stare at forcefully and give a new (Serbian) name. He did this repeatedly, saving as many Croats alongside Serbs as he could. After the war, few hometown Croats thanked him or acknowledged the risk he'd run in saving their lives. His chapter is entitled ""Defying the Group.""

Avner Wishnitzer, an Israeli born on a kibbutz, who enters the ranks of Sayeret Matkal, the most elite commando unit in the Israeli Defense Force, for his mandatory military service. After he was discharged after three-and-a-half years of service, he joined a civilian convoy on a mission to deliver blankets to Palestinian farmers in the West Bank because his conscience had been pricked by a documentary he'd seen regarding Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Upon arriving at a checkpoint where Israeli police told the group to turn back because they were breaking the law, he and others in the group defied the orders. He'd never served in the occupied territory; indeed, he'd never spoken directly to a Palestinian. But his anger over Israeli treatment of them bubbled over, and even though he still performed regular service in the reserve unit of Sayeret Matkal, his awakened conscience led him to join with a few other reservists in his unit to take a very public, and risky stand: they signed a letter proclaiming they would refuse to ever serve if called upon in the occupied territories. Needless to say, he met quite a bit of public shaming. His chapter is entitled ""The Rules of Conscience.""

Leyla Wydler, a financial advisor with Stanford Group Company, part of Stanford Financial Group and brainchild of prominent financier Allen Stanford, who was charged with ""massive ongoing fraud"" for swindling investors out of billions of dollars. Wydler was the whistleblower who alerted the SEC (several times, actually, which they chose to ignore) and other regulators of the Ponzi scheme. Her testimony earned the enmity of her fellow former financial advisors, and she could not find work in her chosen field after her whistleblowing. A single mother, she risked much—Stanford fined her for ""breaking her contract""—and today she works … in real estate. Her chapter is entitled ""The Price of Raising One's Voice.""

There are no statues erected in their honor (although 60 years after the fact, Gruninger finally received a plaque on his grave). There are no proclamations, laurels or monuments in their name. They are, if not despised, then ignored. Indeed, some are still thought of by their former fellow workers or ""tribe"" members as traitors to their cause. As author Press puts it:



To judge by the sanctimonious tributes made to those who ""confront evil"" in places like Rwanda or by Time magazine's tribute to whistleblowers who spoke out about accounting fraud in the United States, we live in a world where overcoming passivity and acquiescence is seen as honorable. In reality, we all know that doing so is risky and dangerous, not least because there is precious little agreement about where the line between duty and conscience should be drawn. Around torture, which much of the world officially banned centuries ago? Not according to those who vilified the handful of dissenters who challenged the abusive interrogation policies that were institutionalized during the Bush era. Around concocting clever ways to defraud people of their savings? Not according to the traders on Wall Street who did exactly that and profited, without pausing to apologize, during the period that preceded the 2008 financial crash (and who were not asked to apologize by politicians who proceeded to weaken or scuttle efforts to regulate their industry afterward). What about stealing people's land? Not according to Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who see this as a fulfillment of God's plan. Even people who do regard these things as unconscionable might find it unnerving to see a soldier, a public official, or a colleague at work take an uncompromising stand on the matter. For if we agree that something blatantly wrong is happening, shouldn't we be taking a similar stand? Do we really want to be reminded of the compromise we've made?

Those who dare to take a stand, Press claims, really only have one thing in common in the end: they're idealists (some would even say, naive idealists), true believers. Gruninger honestly believed Switzerland was a kind, neutral, compassionate and freedom-loving country; he thought he was upholding the values of his nation when he let in refugees, despite the law. Jevtic truly believed his fellow townsmen would have done the same rescuing in the name of shared history and humanity. Wishnitzer truly believed that Israelis, as a persecuted people with a horrendously victimized past, would refuse to act as persecutor of others. Wydler truly believed in the principles and ethics her chosen profession claimed to hold dear—that serving the interests of clients came first, not lining their own pockets.

All learned the hard way that for the most part, they stood alone or with a very small and often reviled minority.

And the Wishnitzer chapter in particular raises a question that seems unanswerable: How does one judge the ""true believer"" who holds beliefs in direct opposition to other ""true believers""? In Israel's case, there are true righteous believers on both sides—IDF members who refuse to participate in the eviction of Palestinians on the West Bank … and IDF members who are devout Zionists who refuse to comply with orders from the Israeli government to evict Jewish settlers who are squatting in recognized Palestinian territory. Both fervently believe in their cause. Both types are willing to accept the punishment for refusal.

The closest author Press comes to teasing out the differences in cases like this, is to resort to a thought experiment in empathy:



Measured by depth and sincerity of conviction, perhaps there wasn't much difference between left- and right-wing refuseniks in the Israeli army. Measured by moral content, there clearly was. One way to draw it out, it seemed to me, was by applying the standard Adam Smith might have proposed, assessing the ability—or inability—of those saying no to stretch their moral imaginations by putting themselves in the shoes of people who were suffering and extending sympathy to them.

In Press' mind, the resistors like Wishnitzer were refusing to evict out of empathy, but they weren't dehumanizing those who didn't agree with them. In the case of the Zionist refuseniks, most of them resorted to justifying Israeli occupation by vilifying the Palestinians as vermin or worse. This strikes me as a very difficult standard with which to draw a distinction, although a handier one for this thorny predicament does not leap to mind.

And with Edward Snowden in the news, it's interesting to discuss what society should do with these true believers and which category he falls into. Is Snowden in the same class as the ""beautiful souls"" author Press discusses in his book? I took the opportunity this past week to ask Press his opinion of Snowden and if he too typified the nonconformist resistor he's studied. As you can tell from his response, he is at least slightly puzzled about one aspect of the whistleblower:



With the obvious caveat that there is a lot we don't know about Snowden, there are some parallels to the people I wrote about. Like them, he appears to have started out full of idealism—volunteering to fight in Iraq—only to grow bitterly disillusioned. This is often the trajectory whistleblowers follow. And like them, he appears to have been motivated by one thing: his conscience. I'm a bit puzzled why someone so fiercely committed to privacy ever went to work for the intelligence community in the first place, but I suppose we'll learn more about that in due time.

Howsociety deal with inconvenient truth-tellers and those who act out of moral conscience? And how do we as individuals judge the rightness or wrongness of another's actions? Should we make more of an effort to honor these ""beautiful souls?"" Or do we hold back, learn more, let history sort it out?

These questions are not easy, nor are they painless. As Press says:



Inevitably, then, displays of moral courage sow discord and make a lot of people uncomfortable—most of all, perhaps, the true believer who never wanted or expected to say no. It is never easy to incur the wrath of an offended majority, to ""fall out of step with one's tribe,"" observed Susan Sontag. And it's true: no one finds this painless. But it's considerably harder for insiders who've spent their lives fiercely identifying with the values of the majority than for dissenters accustomed to being on the margins, with their like-minded comrades by their side."

(CNN) —

Tavis Smiley: Bitter, party of one.

What else can you say about an accomplished but jaded black scholar who continues to behave like a Twitter troll when it comes to President Obama? Why does he unfairly criticize Obama? Could it be because of a bruised ego?

It may have started back in February 2008.

Smiley, an author, media personality and leading voice in the black community, invited then-Sen. Barack Obama to speak at his “State of the Black Union” forum in New Orleans. Obama declined, opting instead to campaign because he was locked in a tough primary with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who did attend the forum.

ESPN LZ Granderson

In his place, Obama offered to send his wife, Michelle. Anyone who has seen the first lady speak knows this is hardly a consolation prize.

Smiley said no thanks.

Obama sent a letter, reiterating the importance of the forum, and asked Smiley to reconsider.

He didn’t.

And thus, the rift.

In 2011, Smiley was on C-Span claiming that Obama was “the first president in my professional career that hasn’t invited me to the White House.” Though truth be told, I’m not prone to inviting people who diss my better half over to the house either.

Not that I’m suggesting Smiley shouldn’t be able to interview or criticize the president.

In fact, I have challenged some of President Obama’s policies and decisions for years in my columns, on TV and over radio. But I’ve always tried to do so in context. So, for those of you enamored with Smiley’s recent criticism of the president’s remarks about race, which he described as “weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid,” remember it’s all about context.

In this case, the context includes their bumpy history.

Same goes for Smiley’s partner-in-whine, Cornel West, who was so upset that he received one ticket to the 2009 inauguration instead of the requested three that afterward he compared Obama to Machiavelli.

Before ticket-gate, West went on the trail for Obama.

After the incident, West went off on Obama.

Last year, West called the Democratic president a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface” while supposedly on an awareness tour with Smiley to talk about poverty. The idea behind the initiative was a noble one. Unfortunately, when they weren’t talking about the poor, they would throw random haymakers at the president, like West’s “blackface” remark.

As a result, media coverage spent more time focused on the jabs than on ways to lift the poor out of poverty.

This week, West called Obama a “global George Zimmerman” in an interview with Democracy Now. Also while a guest on Smiley’s radio show, the Princeton University professor said that MSNBC host and Obama supporter, the Rev. Al Sharpton, “probably deep down wants to be critical of the president, but he can’t because he’s still on the Obama plantation.”

West also insinuated that other blacks who aren’t as critical of the president as he and Smiley are also residents of this so-called plantation.

Perhaps we should make that: Bitter, party of two.

In fairness, it is hard to prove that the vitriol the pair spews in Obama’s way all stems from perceived snubs from a few years ago. But the timing of it all is curious. And the personal attacks – West once said Obama was afraid of “free black men” – make it difficult to believe yesteryear’s leftovers are not still on today’s menu.

Now, I do believe poverty is the least talked about major issue we have in this country. And it seemed like the entire 2012 general election was focused on the rich and declining middle class, with little to no talk about where the middle class was declining to.

West and Smiley’s criticism of Obama for this omission is reasonable, especially since silence on this issue has a big impact on the black community.

A recent study released by Harvard University shows how difficult it is for people born in the lower 5% to reach the top 5%. In some parts of the country, the chances of moving up the income ladder are as high as 35%. But in regions with a large black population, such as near Charlotte, North Carolina; Memphis, Tennessee, and Atlanta, it is as low as 4%.

To be born in poverty and then die in poverty is an American nightmare. So I applaud West and Smiley for using their platform to draw attention to the often overlooked problem.

But if they’re motivated by personal grievances, shame on them for displaying their pettiness while touting important policy critiques.

First of all, it’s self-serving.

Second, it’s obvious. Earlier this year Tom Joyner, who once featured Smiley on his syndicated radio show but parted ways with him after his unjust attacks on Obama in 2008, said, “Tavis is fascinated with his own legacy, and that’s not good. He wants more than anything to be remembered the way Dr. King was, and to somehow make that kind of mark on the world.”

Translation: It’s all about Smiley.

When Obama didn’t accept the invitation to speak at Smiley’s forum in 2008, Smiley interpreted it as an affront to his influence in the black community. When Obama opted not to attend in 2009 – although he did address the crowd via video conference – that was the proverbial final straw.

Smiley and West have been aggressively attacking the president, sandwiching legitimate concerns about poverty in between over-the-top comments that far too often detract from what they claim is their primary focus – helping poor black people. Their comments may grab headlines and land them on Sunday morning talk shows, but how have they engaged with the administration in finding solutions on poverty?

Instead, Smiley and West appear to be two egocentric men who believe they alone are the face of black intellectualism. And any black talking heads who don’t side with them have, in West’s words, “sold their souls.”

Welcome to the ivory tower version of black on black crime.

Again, I’m all for fairly criticizing the man in the White House. But it feels that West and Smiley are more upset that Obama didn’t kiss their rings before he walked through the door than about anything he’s done since he got inside.

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/oz-pm-apologises-mums-forced-adoptions-045228510.html,,[],Julia Gillard Apologises For Forced Adoptions,"Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has apologised to up to 150,000 mostly unmarried mothers who were forced to give up their children for adoption during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

The historic national apology was delivered in front of more than 800 people, many of them in tears, in Parliament House in Canberra.

The apology was recommended a year ago by a committee in the Australian Parliament's upper house, the Senate, that investigated the impacts of the now discredited policies.

""We apologise,"" Ms Gillard said. ""We acknowledge your loss and grief.""

The women were either tricked or forced to sign adoption papers by medical and welfare professionals who believed it was in the best interest of the babies.

There were even cases of women being strapped to their hospital beds or sedated as their newborn children were taken away.

Gaye Kelly gave birth aged just 15 and was told if she did not sign adoption papers her new baby girl would end up in an orphanage.

She previously told Sky News: ""I was crying and crying and crying and then the nurse came and said 'what's up with you?' - and I said 'I don't want to give my baby up for adoption, I want to keep my baby' - and she snapped at me: 'Girls like you don't keep their babies, stop being silly, pull yourself together' and she about faced and just left.""

Gaye tracked down - and was eventually reunited with - her daughter but only after years of depression and heartache.

""This apology is extended in good faith and deep humility,"" Ms Gillard said.

""It will be a profound act of moral insight by a nation searching its conscience.""

Ms Gillard said it took courage to say sorry.

""What we see in that mirror is deeply shameful and distressing,"" she said. ""A story of suffering and unbearable loss.""

In 2008 the then Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised to the so-called stolen generation, thousands of aboriginal children removed from their parents over many decades.

Now Australia is saying sorry again, not only to mothers but to adoptees who were removed from their natural mothers.

Other countries, including the UK where similar adoptions were carried out, are considering taking a similar step."

Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, who both blasted Florida in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting and the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Martin's death, with Jackson calling it an ""apartheid state"" and ""our Selma,"" have not spoken publicly of the brutal beating aboard a school bus caught on cellphone and surveillance video. Neither Jackson nor Sharpton responded to requests for comment from FoxNews.com.

“Three 15-yr-old black teens beat up a 13-yr-old white kid because he told school officials they tried to sell him drugs,” former congressman Allen West, an ex-Army Colonel who is African-American, wrote on his Facebook page. “Do you hear anything from Sharpton, Jackson, NAACP, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, liberal media, or Hollywood? Cat got your tongues or is it that pathetic hypocrisy revealing itself once again? Y'all just make me sick.”

Robert Zimmerman Jr., who vociferously defended his brother against charges the shooting of Martin was racially motivated, also chimed in, taking Sharpton and Jackson to task for staying silent on the beating.

“It's time 2 ""unplug"" their mic if U ask me...“@JimmieFleek: @rzimmermanjr @TheRevAl @RevJJackson apparently racism only works one way?” Zimmerman tweeted.

More On This...

The attack took place July 9 in the St. Petersburg-area community of Gulfport. But the horrific cellphone and surveillance video came out only recently. Police say the three youths, all African-American, attacked the boy after he told officials at their dropout prevention school that one of them had tried to sell him marijuana. The unidentified boy was left with a broken arm and two black eyes.

Joshua Reddin, Julian McKnight, and Lloyd Khemradj, all 15 years old, were arrested a short time later. All three were charged with aggravated battery and have since been released. Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery.

Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told Fox News the attack does not appear to be racially motivated and was due to the younger boy reporting that one of the assailants had tried to sell him marijuana.

West, who represented southeastern Florida in the House, denounced Jackson and Sharpton as “race-baiters” and “faux leaders” during the Zimmerman trial for making the death of Martin into a racial issue.

“Do you really want to talk about the issues that are confronting the black community or do you want to talk about the politically manufactured crises that you have these faux leaders and these race-baiters that are out there, you know, promoting it,” West said in a July interview on Fox News Radio.

Rev. Dr. Manuel Sykes, president of the St. Petersburg chapter of the NAACP, told FoxNews.com his group is aware of the bus beating and is monitoring it closely.

“We would want to see if any and all information out there has determined if there are any disparities,” he said.

All three of the assailants were expelled from school and are due back in court for a hearing early next week."

So it's sort of your job to uphold and enforce the law, even the laws you don't like, because that's part of the job. You know what isn't part of the job? Advising people to break the law you've sworn to uphold.

While that might seem obvious, apparently it isn't so obvious to a certain attorney general and wannabe governor whose name is Ken Cuccinelli. (As is so often necessary when discussing Republicans, please note this is not from The Onion.)



Cuccinelli recounted an exchange with his own bishop in which he counseled the cleric to embrace civil disobedience: “My local bishop said, ‘Well, you know I told a group I’m ready to go to jail.’ And I said, ‘Bishop, don’t take this personally: You need to go to jail.’”

“You know, Abraham Lincoln has many good quotes, but one of them is ‘the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it vigorously.’ And here we’re going to have an example of what tyranny means when it’s played to its logical conclusion,” Cuccinelli said. “Because forcing business owners and businesses to do this is not consistent with our history of preserving religious liberty, one of the most important protections we have in this country.”

Lest you think Cuccinelli and his bishop were casually discussing breaking the law in a righteous battle for some greater good, you can stop that right now. Because the greater good for which these two fine Catholics think law-breaking is worthwhile is, of course, the fight to stop women from having access to basic health care because Abraham Lincoln had some good quotes about stuff and also religious liberty:If you're scratching your head trying to figure out how encouraging civil disobedience is actually a form of ""vigorously"" enforcing the law, don't bother. It doesn't make sense, and it isn't supposed to. We're talking about Republicans, after all, and they never let a little thing, like not making a goddamned bit of sense, stop them.

For almost a year, wingnuts and Catholic bishops (and yes, in the Venn diagram, that's basically just one big circle) have been whining and stamping their feet and reciting their favorite old timey quotes because it makes them super sad to think about women having basic health care. This has not actually persuaded anyone that women having health care is a bad thing. Quite the opposite, as demonstrated by about a bazillion polls on the issue. Not like that ever stops them.

So Cuccinelli, in his run for governor, is definitely doing his best to appeal to the wingnuttiest wingnuts in his base, and damnit, he'll even advise breaking the law—contrary to, you know, his current job description—to prove that he's just the guy for them.

You can listen to the audio here. You know, if you can stomach it."

It's because people can be invariably counted on to do horrific things, including enslaving other human beings or handcuffing children to work stations for 12 hours a day. But what's going on in the job market now is far less overt, far more subtle:

Companies don’t like to talk about it, but some job seekers, lawyers, researchers and people who help the unemployed say age discrimination in hiring exists. The Age Discrimination and Employment Act protects workers 40 and older, and forbids treating a job applicant or employee less favorably because of his or her age. But proving age discrimination is difficult, said Robert Canino, an attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Dallas. A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2009 raised the burden of proof in age discrimination lawsuits. Now, a person must show that age was the determining factor leading to an employer’s action, not just a contributing factor. Still, age discrimination complaints related to hiring, firing and promotions increased 45 percent in the last 15 years, according to the EEOC. “What we do know from talking to people is that hiring discrimination is really rampant out there,” said Laurie McCann, a senior attorney for AARP.

This is rarely policy per se, it's probably not even done consciously in many cases. It happens when the 20-year-old assistant manager at the fast food joint doesn't quite know what to make of the 45-year-old candidate applying for the advertised cashier job. It happens when the 31-year-old software engineer feels irrational dislike for the 55-year-old veteran standing in the reception room awaiting an interview. It happens when a company is buried in resumes after posting a job, and is looking desperately for any reason to reduce their workload to something manageable. Your degrees, certifications, or experience may help you survive those initial cuts. But there may come a point when your file comes up in front of a hiring manager staffing a team, they see your photo or DoB, and hand the file back to the recruiter saying ""Get rid of this guy."" These are all examples of potential age discrimination.

There are three angles of attack on this. The first is to educate job screeners on both ethics and the law. Not only is age discrimination illegal, it's utterly counterproductive. I was in on plenty of hiring decisions in the past when I lived in Florida. Time after time, retirees, folks in their 60s, 70s, even their 80s, on Social Security and Medicare, were as good of a gamble as any other demographic. Age discrimination can also kill. I know of at least two middle-aged, talented, degreed, experienced people who were laid off and could not find work, who eventually died as a result of easily treated medical conditions. They didn't even know they had those problems, they hadn't been able to afford a doctor in years.

While we're on this topic, it does no good when close friends and family shame the unemployed. A minor imperfection is not open season to blame the person who got laid off and can't find work. I remember one case where the reason a person could not find a job—and ultimately died—somehow became their failure to have their priorities straight. That postmortem diagnosis was hung on the flimsiest evidence: The deceased had purportedly once said they wanted to get some used ski boots during the period they were looking for work. They never got any boots, they just mentioned one time to one friend they saw some advertised online.

What Was He Doing Wasting Time Looking At Ski Boots On Craigslist! Aha! That Explains Everything!

The second option is to use existing laws to file a complaint. Even in Texas of all places, where I live in near poverty thanks to underemployment and the inability to find a job that pays a living wage, we have the Texas Workforce Commission. Most states have similar orgs. In addition there is the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Complaints like this don't always get filed away. They can generate investigations and lead to mediation or arbitration, where the employer has to appear, turn over internal documents, and answer questions under oath. I'm told this can be damn satisfying. Especially when the employer, who previously clammed up and wouldn't answer anything, sits there sputtering under repeated questioning, unable to back up any rationale for why that person was not hired beyond ""We just didn't think he was right for this job ... that we hired three dozen other people for who all happened to be under the age of 35.""

When you are unemployed or underemployed, your friends and family will often tell you to ""keep trying, don't give up."" The same applies to going after an employer who may have violated your rights. Keep trying, don't give up. It may not help you get that job (although it might, or it might help you win a judgement) but one complaint can mean everyone who comes along after you will have a fairer shot. Sooner or later, that person might even be you. Plus, you have no way to know how many complaints have been filed against that same company, or one person acting on that company's behalf. You could be the first or the hundredth, the latter looks terrible to investigators. It looks terrible to the company. If there is a bad apple, this how they are identified and removed.

Lastly, there are private practice lawyers who specialize in discrimination suits. Call a bunch of them. Share your experience on social media, see if there is someone who is interested in pursuing it for you, or others who have experienced it at that same employer. You would be amazed how fast those dominoes can start to tumble, indeed, how fast a company will throw it's own personnel under the bus, as the number of complaints and the evidence grows.

A few points to keep in mind:

Senior management for most companies is looking for the most qualified people they can get for the pay offered, they don't usually give a shit how old you are. This kind of thing usually happens at the one-to-one, mid-management level far below them.

It is rare for someone to be genuinely dropped from consideration because they are ""overqualified."" If it does happens to you or you see it happen to others, I've been told by experts it might well be an instance of discrimination.

There are not many jobs where being under age 40 is legally justified. Writing code, driving a delivery truck, making sandwiches, talking to customers on the phone, etc., are not generally among them.

It's reasonable that the company's management has to be aware a problem really exists if they are going to address it. We have to be willing to step up and use the tools that those before us fought for and in some cases even died for. And in the rare case where it is systemic, if age discrimination or any kind of discrimination really can be shown to be policy or culture, spoken or unspoken, the only way we stop it is to expose it."

A Senate immigration proposal has garnered enough votes to clear a key hurdle, though late-arriving lawmakers continue to vote.

Supporters of the proposal being voted on Monday have attracted at least 66 votes. The measure needs 60 to pass.

Flight delays have kept some lawmakers from the floor, but the Senate is keeping the vote open.

The measure being voted on Monday is an amendment to the main bill, but is considered a key test of whether the bill itself has enough support to pass the full chamber.

More On This...

ORIGINAL STORY ...

A top Senate Republican sounded the alarm ahead of a major test vote on Monday that could clear the way for passage of a sweeping immigration overhaul, saying the chamber was about to vote on a bill ""no one has read.""

Lawmakers have since begun voting and should wrap up shortly after 6 p.m. ET.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who for months has been fighting against the bill, accused the Senate of rushing to vote on the legislation amid a late push to modify it. At issue is a border security amendment being touted by supporters as a bipartisan compromise that could attract a large majority.

But Sessions accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of cramming the amendment into the rest of the ""1,200-page"" bill with the goal of advancing the legislation late Monday afternoon.

""The Majority Leader's motion will stifle amendments and accelerate the vote on final passage before anyone has vetted the modified legislation,"" Sessions said in a statement.

Sessions took to the Senate floor on Monday afternoon to complain that the updated language was only filed Friday.

""This is exactly what happened with ObamaCare,"" Sessions said.

Reid, meanwhile, declared that ""the immigration bill will pass with Democratic and Republican votes.""

Reid, speaking to Fox News, later said he anticipates the bill will pass with between ""68 and 71 votes.""

Tensions were high ahead of the vote, which is technically on the amendment itself. Reid needs to gather at least 60 votes to advance toward final passage, possibly before the holiday recess. Some conservative Republicans acknowledged the bill is likely to pass the Senate, but warned that the House is another matter.

""It's dead on arrival in the House,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Sunday.

But the sponsors behind the border security amendment -- Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John Hoeven, R-N.D. -- staunchly defended their effort ahead of Monday's vote.

""I've seen reports of a '1,200 page bill' no one has read or had time to read,"" Corker said in a statement, presumably in response to Sessions. ""To be clear, the tough border and interior enforcement provisions that Sen. Hoeven and I offered on Friday make up 119 pages added to the 1,100 pages that have been public since May.""

His office said the proposal would require an ""unprecedented surge of security"" on the border.

President Obama is also hosting a meeting Monday at the White House with eight CEOs, business owners and entrepreneurs to discuss immigration reform, and to push for support of the bill among the business community.

Obama is expected to emphasize a report released by the Congressional Budget Office last week that said the bill would increase the real GDP by up to 3.3 percent in 2023, and by 5.4 percent in 2033.

The group of senators that crafted the legislation is trying to get 70 votes to show the bill has widespread bipartisan support in the Democrat-controlled chamber and to give it momentum as it heads into the Republican-controlled House with a more uncertain future.

Last week, senators proposed the so-called Border Surge amendment, which included 70,000 additional U.S. border agents and 700 more miles of border fencing, to garner support from lawmakers who said the influx of illegal immigrants remains a problem and to put added political pressure on House conservatives.

But some conservative groups were skeptical. The Heritage Foundation on Monday warned that the amendment would allow illegal immigrants to ""receive amnesty now,"" with the possibility of more border security ""somewhere down the road.""

Paul told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that lawmakers in the House ""think border security has to come first before you get immigration reform.""

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer -- a Democratic member of the bipartisan, so-called Gang of Eight that crafted the legislation -- also predicted the bill will get 70 votes and would ""change the dynamic in the House.""

Schumer told CNN the bipartisan support for the legislation that should result in the 70 votes also will put ""huge pressure"" on House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, not to block immigration reform.

If the bill passed the Senate, Boehner will be faced with honoring the will of the majority of House Republicans who don't appear to want to pass the legislation or honoring the majority of the chamber -- some Republicans and some Democrats -- that appears to want at least a full floor vote.

He also must consider what message blocking the legislation will send to Hispanic voters, who gave President Obama roughly 70 percent of their vote in the 2012 election.

Still, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah said passing the roughly 1,200-page bill is a mistake. He continues to argue that Congress should take a more step-by-step approach, starting with further securing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""It could take years to implement the border-security measures,"" he said.

Lee said the lawmakers crafted the bill with the ""best intentions"" but failed.

""They said it is tough and fair, but it's neither,"" he said.

The bill would provide a years-long path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the U.S.

Lee was joined on Fox News by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the Gang of Eight.

""We are very, very close,"" Graham said. ""The amendment gets us over the top."""

(CNN) —

If you serve in the U.S. military and you rape or sexually assault a fellow service member, chances are you won’t be punished. In fact, you have an estimated 86.5% chance of keeping your crime a secret and a 92% chance of avoiding a court-martial.

These disturbing statistics illustrate an ongoing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta believes amounted to 19,000 incidents just in 2010. A culture of acceptance combined with few prosecutions against assailants and the conflicted chain of command structure discourages victims from reporting crimes.

Service members who report being sexually assaulted by a commanding officer or military colleague do so at their own peril. They face ridicule, demotion, investigation that includes a review of their sexual history and even involuntary discharge.

Betrayal of Trust? Allegations of rape at West Point, Annapolis

In 2006, when Marine Lt. Elle Helmer reported to her commander that a superior officer assaulted and raped her the night before, her colonel discouraged her from obtaining a rape kit. In spite of his objections, she sought a thorough medical investigation.

Helmer appealed to her rapist’s supervisor, who still refused to press charges or significantly punish the assailant. He said, “You’re from Colorado – you’re tough. You need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off. … I can’t babysit you all of the time.”

Rape victims say military labels them ‘crazy’

Jackie Speier

Instead of Helmer’s attacker being prosecuted, she became the subject of investigation and prosecution. She was ultimately forced to leave the Marine Corps. Her rapist remains a Marine in good standing.

Elle’s story is featured in the documentary “The Invisible War,” which will be screened in five major cities for a week, starting Friday.

The powerful film includes interviews with former U.S. service men and women who were raped by co-workers or superior officers. The survivors explain that they felt the greatest betrayal was from the military itself and the conflicted chain of command structure that did not protect them from avoidable harm or support their need for justice.

Victim testimony from a widespread and ongoing sex scandal at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas, sheds light on another tragic component of the epidemic: Service members are trained to follow the orders of all superior officers, no matter what.

Two of the women who have come forward were called over an intercom shortly after they graduated from basic training and asked to leave their dorm to meet their instructors, an unusual order. The victims told a military court that they were lured to a dark supply room where two instructors engaged them in sexual acts.

“I didn’t know what to think or what to do,” one woman, an airman first class, said when a prosecutor asked what she was thinking as her training instructor performed oral sex on her.

Female service members sue U.S. military for alleged rape, sexual assault

“I was frozen,” she said. Thirty-five instructors have been removed from their jobs during the past year at Lackland, but the military refuses to disclose how many are accused of sexual assault. We know that four military training instructors have already been charged with sexual misconduct with at least 24 trainees. One of the instructors is charged with having sexual contact with 10 women, including sodomy and rape.

Another, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, admitted in a plea bargain to having sex with one woman. His punishment is 90 days in jail, 30 days of hard labor, reduction in rank and forfeiture of $500 a month in pay for four months. He will be forced to leave the Air Force but without a bad-conduct discharge.

After striking this deal with prosecutors, Vega testified that he actually had improper contact with 10 trainees. He is not immune to further prosecution, but his admission of guilt cannot be used against him in future procedures. Each victim will have to come forward, and the prosecution will have to start from scratch.

I have called for a congressional hearing to investigate the systemic abuse of power at Lackland Air Force Base.

It is clear that the inherent conflicts within the chain of command structure are at the core of the epidemic of military rape and sexual assault.

Last fall, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would create a path to justice for service men and women who are victims of rape or sexual assault. H.R. 3435, the Sexual Assault Training Oversight and Prevention Act (STOP Act), has 125 co-sponsors. It would take these cases out of the normal chain of command and place the jurisdiction, still within the military, in the hands of an impartial office staffed by experts – both military and civilian.

Right now, it is far too easy for a sexual predator in the military to rape or sexually assault a fellow service member and get away with it. Until these crimes are taken seriously and assailants are punished as the felons they are, the epidemic will continue.

Victims of military rape deserve justice

We should not have to hear another story like Elle Helmer’s, watch another movie like “The Invisible War,” and have to investigate yet another scandal like the one at Lackland Air Force Base.

In the words of Defense Secretary Panetta, “One assault is one too many.”

(CNN) —

The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration reform bill on Tuesday, sending the measure to the Senate floor for consideration and giving the bill’s backers their first major legislative victory.

Members of the Democratic-controlled panel voted 13-5 in favor of the measure.

If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation’s immigration policy since 1986.

“The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform. I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said.

Spectators cramming the committee room applauded and cheered loudly following the vote.

The panel’s 10 Democrats were joined in supporting the bill by three Republicans: Arizona’s Jeff Flake, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, and Utah’s Orrin Hatch. Flake and Graham are two of its four Republican authors.

Opinion: ‘Rogue’ DHS unions follow Obama’s lead on deportation

Both party leaders in the Senate appeared supportive of the effort, a positive sign for backers hoping to win a solid majority in the full chamber.

“I think the ‘Gang of Eight’ has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. “I’m hopeful we’ll be able to get a bill that we can pass here in the Senate.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, praised the “masterful” job of Leahy in navigating roughly 300 proposed amendments and advancing the 844-page bill to the floor.

Immigration reform is a priority for both parties in Washington and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided Congress.

A key political aim involves Republicans hoping to attract more Hispanics to their side, while Democrats wishing to keep that growing voter bloc squarely in their camp.

Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Barack Obama’s re-election. He congratulated the committee on its work and urged the Senate to bring the bill to the floor at its earliest possible opportunity.

“The legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system,” he said in a statement. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”

The measure approved by the Judiciary panel would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering, Republican warns

It aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms and elsewhere.

Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country’s immigration laws.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is leading the charge against the “Gang of Eight” proposal and is a tough critic.

He has tried to derail the bill at nearly every turn, arguing that adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the American work force. He also has raised security and other concerns.

“This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workers—both immigrant and native born,” Sessions said in a statement after the vote.

“This bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers and—as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hear—a threat to public safety and the rule of law,” he said.

In a defeat for backers of expanded gay rights, the committee did not approve a pair of Leahy-sponsored amendments bolstering federal support for bi-national same-sex relationships.

Specifically, Leahy had proposed recognizing same-sex marriages in which one spouse is an American, and allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign-born same-sex partners for green cards given proof of a committed relationship.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the “Gang of Eight,” was among those who called Leahy’s amendments a poison pill virtually certain to destroy GOP support for the measure.

Immigration bill is Democratic plot, House conservative says

Leahy’s amendments could be considered again when the bill is taken up by the full Senate. Doing so, however, would be little more than a symbolic gesture, as the proposals have virtually no chance of winning the 60 votes almost certainly needed to clear the 100-member chamber.

Earlier this month, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, noted the possibility that an upcoming ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the federal Defense of Marriage Act could render the whole issue moot.

“The DOMA ruling could change this whole debate,” Durbin said. “They could eliminate DOMA and impose obligations on our federal government (relating to) same gender marriage, and that would dramatically change what we’re trying to achieve.”

The House is working on its own version of immigration reform."

Now, it wasn't that long ago that pundits were calling California a failed state and saying it was ungovernable. But in 2010, when other states were busy electing whatever Tea Partier claimed to hate government the most, we elected a guy who actually liked it — Jerry Brown. And without a Republican governor and without a legislature cock-blocked by Republicans, (audience laughter) a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus.

How? Well it's amazing, really. We did something economists call cutting spending and raising taxes. (audience applause) I know, it sounds like crazy science fiction, but you see, here in California, we're not just gluten-free and soy-free and peanut-free, we're Tea Party free! (massive audience cheering and applause)

Yes, we can live in reality! I mean, Texas could do it too, but they love ""freedom"" too much. Like when that unregulated fertilizer plant blew up. In California, when things blow up, it's because we're making a Jason Statham movie. No, California is not perfect, but it is in our nature to try new things. For example, now that it's clear Obamacare is going to be a success here, the movement to just go all the way to single payer is gathering steam. (audience applause)

In lots of areas, California has decided not to wait around for the caboose part of America to get on board. Yokels can mock ""European style democracies"" all they want. We're building one here — gay marriage, pot smoking, regulating carbon. And people like it. The same way when Americans come back from a vacation in Europe, they all say the same thing: ""I saw titties on the beach!"" (audience laughter) But they also remark on the modern airports and train stations over there, and the absence of beggars in the street, and food that tastes like food. (audience applause) And they wonder, ""Why can't we get that here?""

Well, you will be getting that here, courtesy of the Golden State. Why? Because we're huge. We're huge! 40 million of us! (audience cheering) When we demand something, the market must supply it. Like when California set a high mileage standard for cars sold in this state, Detroit had to make more efficient cars. California by itself is the 8th largest economy in the world, the fifth largest agricultural exporter, and of course, #1 in laser vaginal rejuvenation. (audience laughter) Oh, I pat myself on the back.

You know, it's so ironic, the two things conservatives love the most — the free market and states rights — are the two things that are going to bend this country into California's image as a socialist fagtopia. (audience cheering and applause) Maybe our constipated Congress in Washington can't pass gun control laws, but we just did. Because we don't give a shit about the NRA. Out here, that stands for ""Nuts, Racists, and Assholes."" (massive audience cheering and applause)

And while other state governments are working with Jesus to make abortion more miserable — because otherwise women would just use it for weight loss (audience oohs) — California is making it easier. And while immigrants are demonized in Washington and elsewhere, in California we just OK'd driver's licenses for undocumented aliens. (audience applause) That's right, we're letting them drive cars — just like white people! Because we can't be worrying about all the nonsense that keeps Fox News viewers up at night, when they should be in bed adjusting their sleep apnea mask. (audience laughter)

So in conclusion, my message to the rest of America is just this: DO NOT RESIST!! Kneel before Zod! California has been setting the trend in America for decades, and it's not going to stop now. We say jump, you say, ""Please, sell me new exercise clothes for jumping."" (audience applause) We said put cilantro in food, and dammit, you did, you put cilantro in food, even though neither one of us knows what it is. And almond milk? Come on! We just had some extra almonds and thought we'd fuck with you. (audience laughter)"

Editor’s Note: Eugene Declercq is professor and assistant dean at the Boston University School of Public Health. He is founder of Birth by the Numbers, a website that provides information on childbirth practices and outcomes in the U.S. and abroad.

(CNN) —

Across the U.S., many families know firsthand how high maternity care costs are. As noted in The Times recently, giving birth in the U.S. is more expensive than any other country in the world. Total costs average $18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for a C-section, with the bulk of the bill going to insurers. However, families with insurance still have to pay about $3400 out of pocket.

What’s ironic is we can’t even claim that the extra expense pays off in healthier mothers and babies. According to a study by the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. ranks at or near the bottom on virtually all maternity care outcomes.

Eugene Declercq

So who’s to blame for these high costs?

Partly, mothers themselves. Americans are obsessed with the notions that “newer is better” and “more technology is always a plus.” When it comes to medical technology, the U.S. public becomes Oliver Twist, continually asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.”

I was part of a team that recently conducted a pair of national surveys of mothers. Among the many questions, we asked if mothers agreed with the statement, “Newer maternity tests and treatments are generally improvements over older ones.” An overwhelming majority of mothers (74%) agreed while only 10% disagreed.

Likewise, when given the statement, “Maternity tests and treatments that work the best usually cost more than those that don’t work as well,” mothers were twice as likely to agree than disagree. Mothers were also far more likely to agree that women get too few tests during pregnancy rather than too many.

“Newer equals improvement” and “More is better than less” have long been effective marketing themes in American culture. But the problem is that in the case of medical technology, the results don’t consistently bear that out.

While other countries have set up elaborate systems to assess new medical interventions for their cost effectiveness compared to existing practices before approving them, until recently that has not been a priority in U.S. medical care. The result is that public infatuation with newer technologies merges smoothly with the medical industry’s desire to profit from providing more services.

A prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife-led birthing centers. These have been found in the U.S. and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals. Freestanding birthing centers (as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a “birthing center”) are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers. The cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies, a shorter stay (mothers typically return home within 24 hours) and lower personnel costs.

While the numbers of birthing centers have increased in the last decade, less than 1 in 300 U.S. births occur in a center. How come?

Consider who loses money if birthing centers become popular: Large hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, obstetricians and anesthesiologists – all powerful groups who believe deeply that the use of their products and services is not only a source of income, but the safest option for mothers and babies.

The result is that an array of regulatory (restrictive state licensing laws) and financial barriers (denial of insurance coverage) combined with informal constraints (hospital refusal to provide backup) limit their use.

Freestanding birthing centers aren’t for everyone. They are meant to serve women with lower risk pregnancies and there’s about a 1 in 8 chance a woman would need to be transferred to a hospital during labor. Nonetheless, it is of concern that so many women who are interested in it are denied an option that can provide a safe and far less expensive experience for mothers and babies.

Medical technology has done wonders for our lives, especially in select, high-risk cases. But rising maternity care costs reflects the downside of our societal obsession with newer, bigger and shinier technology.

The U.S. needs to seriously rethink how we approach maternity care. The first question that needs to be addressed is: Do more tests and reliance on the biggest, most expensive hospital settings actually improve the health of mothers and babies? When they do, great. But when they don’t, we need to overcome the financial, institutional and cultural barriers to use reasonable options like birthing centers.

Brown wins 30-day extension to cut prison crowding,"SACRAMENTO -- Three federal judges have given California Gov. Jerry Brown a 30-day extension on their order to reduce prison crowding, buying time for confidential talks between lawyers for the state and those representing inmates.

The order, delivered Tuesday afternoon, was well-received by prisoners’ lawyers, who had largely been left out of negotiations between Brown and the Legislature over prison-crowding solutions.

“We’re always willing to try and negotiate an agreement that will benefit the state and the prisoners,” said Don Specter, lead attorney for the Prison Law Office. He said he did not believe a one-month delay in reducing prison crowding would make a big difference in the 23-year-old litigation.

Brown’s lawyers had asked the federal courts for a three-year delay in the Dec. 31 deadline to remove roughly 9,600 inmates from California’s overcrowded prison system, where medical and psychiatric care is so poor that incarceration has been deemed unconstitutionally cruel. The governor offered to use that time to invest in community probation and rehabilitation programs, with the aim of reducing the number of repeat offenders being sent to prison.

The judges directed lawyers for the state and for prisoners to immediately begin confidential talks, and to report back by Oct. 21. In the meantime, the deadline to reduce crowding has been pushed to Jan. 27.

Both sides are directed to discuss “a durable solution to the prison crowding problem,” including California’s three-strike laws, detention of juveniles, the elderly and medically infirm, as well as the detention of individuals on federal immigration holds. The judges are also requiring lawyers from both sides to discuss early release of low-risk prisoners, and “any other means, including relocation within the state” that have been offered as solutions.

As part of those talks, the judges’ order said, “the parties may also discuss any necessary or desirable extension” of the population cap, “as well as any other matters they deem appropriate.”

The provision, proposed by Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Co.), was voted down 224-189, with Republicans constituting the majority.

""This is a very simple amendment that really does two things,"" Perlmutter told the House Thursday, before the vote. ""It helps the individual protect his right to privacy and it doesn't allow the employer to impersonate that particular employee when other people are interacting with that person across social media platforms.""

While Perlmutter warned of breached privacy and the potential to impersonate employees, as U.S. News & World Report notes, CISPA sponsor Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) called the Democratic congressman's proposal an attempt to kill the bill.

Perlmutter denied the claim, but Rogers still suggested that he instead address the employee privacy issue with separate legislation.

After initially introducing the password privacy measure in 2011, Perlmutter explained in a statement:

People have an expectation of privacy when using social media like Facebook and Twitter. They have an expectation that their right to free speech and religion will be respected when they use social media outlets. No American should have to provide their confidential personal passwords as a condition of employment. Both users of social media and those who correspond share the expectation of privacy in their personal communications. Employers essentially can act as imposters and assume the identity of an employee and continually access, monitor and even manipulate an employee's personal social activities and opinions. That's simply a step too far.

Though CISPA passed the House, 288 to 127, it could very likely be killed in the Senate -- as the first version of the cybersecurity legislation was -- or face a veto from the White House, which has already threatened the controversial legislation.

In the meantime, Anonymous has called for an Internet blackout on April 22 to protest CISPA.

In late November he approached a 79 year old Black elderly man.

According to the press release from the Department of Justice,



According to the complaint, Barrett comments in a video that “the plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?” The complaint further alleges Barrett claims he would not hit “defenseless people” just moments before punching the elderly man in the face. Barrett allegedly hit the man with such force that the man immediately fell to the ground. Barrett then laughed and said “knockout,” as he ran to his vehicle and fled, according to allegations. The complaint indicates the victim suffered two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days as a result of the attack.

According to ABC13 Conrad Alvin Barrett was taken into custody this morning. Barrett got caught because he was bragging about the incident in a Fulshear bar on the night of the attack. He allegedly showed the video to an off duty police office.

His phone had 10 other implicating videos. In one of his videos he uses the N-word and said that blacks “…haven’t fully experienced the blessing of evolution.”

Following is the ABC13 story.







CNN reports that George Parnham, Conrad Alvin Barrett’s attorney, said his client has a bipolar disorder and takes medications. He said the affidavit does not pull back Barrett’s layers of mental health.

Earlier today Poppy Harlow appeared as guest on CNN’s Out Front with Don Lemon. She told him she spoke to Barrett’s attorney. She was shock by one of his comments. She said the attorney told her that his client studied anthropology. He said his anthropology professor made almost word for word, the comments Conrad Alvin Barrett made about blacks and evolution. She wonders if that college course would be used as a part of the defense. If Conrad Alvin Barrett is convicted he faced up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The irony of this incident is that in the last few months many on the Right have been attempting to make this supposed knockout game a black on white crime. They have been using overblown incidents of this type by the media to show some false racial divided. In fact Larry Elder wrote a piece in which he said,



The “knockout game” – and the media underreporting of it – combines the breakdown of the family with the media's condescending determination to serve as a public relations bureau for blacks.

Don Lemon asked Marc Lamont Hill on CNN’s Out Front whether this case turns the stereotype on its head or of there is more to this type of story. Hill said the narrative of the supposed surge of this type of crime of black youth against white people was never the case. He said this vicious crime, the so called knockout game, is perpetrated by people of all races. There is no racial pattern. It is simply irresponsible people executing a violent irresponsible act.

NCAA has beefed up its police force under Emmert by 44 percent

Emmert wants NCAA%27s Committee on Infractions to work faster on violation cases

NCAA deserves an %27A%27 for its stronger academic progress standards for athletes%2C Emmert says

INDIANAPOLIS -- No other chief executive in the history of the NCAA has stirred up a storm quite like this.

Since the hiring of President Mark Emmert in 2010, the NCAA has handed down 48 major rules violation cases against member schools – a rate that is far higher than any of Emmert's predecessors, according to a review by USA TODAY Sports. It's 25% higher than the previous NCAA president and doesn't even include the two most controversial punishment cases under Emmert's watch – Penn State and Miami.

Emmert, 60, also created some strife at NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis, having ousted several well-regarded NCAA management officials with decades of experience.

He's beefed up the rules enforcement staff – the NCAA's police force – by 44%, from 41 in 2010 to a new high of 59.

By August, Emmert hopes to see a broader and faster crackdown on rule-breaking schools by increasing the NCAA's committee on infractions – its judge and jury -- from 10 to as many as 24 members.

""That's as aggressive as we can possibly be with it,"" Emmert told USA TODAY Sports in an exclusive interview last week at NCAA headquarters.

It's all part of a jolting reform process designed to change the NCAA – step up rules enforcement in college sports while speeding up the process with a rulebook that's less complex. But it's a mission that has been hounded by resistance to some proposals and controversy, particularly over the handling of the Miami and Penn State cases. While Emmert says he is trying to transform an organization with nearly 1,100 member schools, he's faced lawsuits and accusations of moving too fast, overstepping his bounds and firing employees who thought they were doing what he wanted.

""You get confronted with all the schools and interests (in the NCAA) and all the reasons why things move slowly come up, and it hit him in the face,"" said Jo Potuto, a Nebraska law professor and former chair of the NCAA infractions committee.

Under the supervision of his bosses on the NCAA executive committee, Emmert's task is to lead major reforms at the NCAA. The agenda has three main components, all stemming from a retreat Emmert held with college presidents in August 2011: improve the academic performance of athletes, get tougher on rule-breakers and simplify its notoriously complex rulebook.

Many member schools also wanted reform to help curb the runaway costs in college athletics – an effort that has failed to take off because of disagreement about what to do about it between schools with athletic programs struggling to pay bills versus the powerhouses that drive the price tag ever higher.

Overall, Emmert says the reform effort ""has been quite successful despite all the noise that's been screaming around in the background.""

A progress report:

Academic performance: The NCAA increased the Academic Progress Rate standard and enforced a postseason ban for teams that fall below it. If you're not on track to graduate at least half your players, you don't play in the postseason. ""Sitting here today, I'd say we got an `A' on that one,"" Emmert says.

But there is a side effect that can form in college sports when academic expectations are increased. Some athletes flock toward majors that give them more flexibility to remain eligible for competition. For example, at LSU, where Emmert was chancellor from 1999-2004, the 2004 LSU football media guide listed about 44 of 90 football players as general studies majors. It's an issue that has continued at many schools.

Emmert acknowledged the tradeoff.

""Whenever we increase academic expectations… we run the risk of student-athletes having a more difficult time filling in specific majors, and you see fewer students gravitating toward engineering majors or other majors where they don't have as much flexibility,"" Emmert says. ""It doesn't surprise me.""

Rules enforcement: More rules enforcement staff has led to more infractions cases. The rate of major infractions cases under Emmert is more than double that of longtime NCAA chief Walter Byers, who retired in 1987, according to NCAA data. Of the 48 major infractions cases under Emmert, 13 were in major college football and another 13 were in Division I men's basketball

""We set up a penalty structure that reinforced the serious concerns – those infractions that were serious threats to integrity – in a way that the penalty structure was shifted so there was much greater emphasis on those and not so much worry about little things,"" Emmert says.

Emmert said this effort is ""on track."" But more aggressive enforcement has brought controversy. The NCAA lacks subpoena power – the power to compel witnesses to cooperate. Instead, ""innovative"" investigative techniques were encouraged, at least until they backfired during the NCAA's recent investigation of the University of Miami football program. In that case, an NCAA investigator arranged to pay the attorney of a Miami booster to gather evidence through the booster's bankruptcy court proceeding.

After the tactic became public, Emmert and Miami President Donna Shalala condemned it. The investigator was fired, and so was the NCAA's vice president for enforcement, Julie Roe Lach, who recently was replaced by attorney Jon Duncan on an interim basis. To critics, it seemed Emmert was feigning outrage and sacrificing his subordinates in the face of criticism over his own agenda. Moreover, what innovative tools can the NCAA use to gather evidence and stay on the right side of ethics?

""That's a conversation we're having right now in the enforcement department,"" Duncan told USA TODAY Sports last month.

Deregulation: In 1952, the NCAA published its first rulebook. It was 25 pages and included just three paragraphs to regulate recruiting. In 1977, the rulebook had grown to 148 pages. In 1987, it was 299. Now it's over 700 pages covering three divisions. The Division I rulebook is ""overly complex,"" Emmert says.

Emmert says the effort to reduce it is making ""good progress, but we're going have to debate some of the more controversial pieces and see where they go.""

It probably won't be easy.

One example came recently when coaches and athletic directors objected to NCAA plans to deregulate restrictions on recruiting staff size and printed materials that can be sent to recruits. Without limits, many coaches and athletic directors grew concerned it would lead to an ""arms race"" to outdo and outspend the competition, more like the NFL.

""Historically any time the association has tried to have any significant reform, it learns those rules were all put there for a reason,"" former NCAA President Cedric Dempsey told USA TODAY Sports.

Misunderstood job?

Emmert says the hardest part of his presidency so far is dispelling what he says are ""mythologies"" about the way the NCAA makes decisions and the power of his office. Unlike the heads of pro sports leagues, Emmert does not decide punishments. He also doesn't make the rules. Those generally are the duties of the NCAA's committee on infractions and the representatives of NCAA schools.

""I always tell people, Don't think about it as a command-control structure,'"" Emmert said of the NCAA's balance of power. ""Think of it like the United Nations. The decision-making structure looks and feels much more like that. In many ways, it's more complex than Congress.""

Some Penn State supporters argue the structure is less democratic than that. Last year, the NCAA slammed Penn State with a four-year bowl ban and $60 million fine last year related to the alleged cover-up of child sex abuse by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.

Instead of investigating the case on its own, the NCAA bypassed its judicial arm -- the NCAA infractions committee – and accepted the findings of an investigation commissioned by the university. The case was fast-tracked by Emmert, the NCAA executive committee and the Division I board of directors. Penn State ultimately agreed to the penalties under the threat of even harsher punishment from the NCAA.

The state of Pennsylvania is now suing the NCAA, saying the aggressive action was an overreach to ""boost the reputation and power of the NCAA's president.""

Yet, to some degree, Emmert is herding cats – nearly 1,100 schools have 1,100 different and often conflicting interests. At the same time, critics wonder where the buck stops at the NCAA when things go wrong. Emmert is the public face of the NCAA but often notes the limitations on his power. He also points out the NCAA president doesn't get involved in infractions cases.

""It is as if each entity or individual within the (NCAA) system can point a finger at another entity or individual actor,"" says Richard Southall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of North Carolina.

Southall described it as a ""deflection of responsibility."" To Emmert, he is serving the wishes of his membership.

""I think it's important to differentiate Mark Emmert's agenda, from what's the membership's agenda,"" he says. ""The confusion that occurs most frequently with the NCAA is people tend to think of the NCAA as like the NFL or NBA. In fact, we're this very complex 1,100-member voluntary association, and every rule, every policy, every bylaw is a creature of that membership.""

That is the question the court is facing this week in the case of Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.

The court last considered an affirmative action case out of Michigan in 2003, when it upheld the race-conscious admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. In response to that ruling, opponents of affirmative action put on the ballot an amendment to the State Constitution banning any consideration of race or sex in public education. Michigan voters approved the amendment in 2006, and since then black undergraduate enrollment at the University of Michigan is down 33 percent.

Advocates of affirmative action sued the state on grounds that the amendment violates the United States Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. They argued that it impermissibly altered the political process that determines admissions policies in a way that places special burdens on racial minorities.

For instance, an applicant who wants alumni connections to be considered in admissions could ask the admissions committee to adopt that policy, or she could lobby the university administration or its popularly elected governing board. But an applicant who wants the university to consider race as a factor has only one path available: to work to pass a new amendment that repeals the anti-affirmative-action amendment — which a federal appeals court called “a lengthy, expensive and arduous process.”"

A three-judge panel unanimously decided Stacie Halas, 32, was unfit for the classroom. Halas was fired in April from her job as a science teacher at Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard after online videos of her in porn were discovered by students and teachers.

""Although (Halas') pornography career has concluded, the ongoing availability of her pornographic materials on the Internet will continue to impede her from being an effective teacher and respected colleague,"" Judge Julie Cabos-Owen wrote in a 46-page decision issued Friday by the Commission on Professional Competence.

Halas was continually deceitful about her nine-month career in porn before she went to work at the school, the decision said.

Her lawyer Richard Schwab said Halas had tried to be honest but was embarrassed by her previous experience in the adult industry.

""Miss Halas is more than just an individual fighting for her job as a teacher,"" he said Tuesday. ""I think she's representative of a lot of people who may have a past that may not involve anything illegal or anything that hurts anybody.""

Halas has been on administrative leave since the video surfaced in March.

Student claims that the teacher was moonlighting as a porn star were initially dismissed after school officials said they couldn't find any images of her on the Internet — but they were using the school's computers, which don't allow access to porn.

Teachers then showed administrators downloads of Halas' sex videos from their smartphones.

In hearings, former assistant principal Wayne Saddler testified that at the start of a sex video, Halas talked about being a teacher and he felt her effectiveness in the classroom had been compromised.

After rumors of her performance surfaced, profanity was etched on Halas' classroom window, a teacher testified.

Schwab has said Halas did not star in pornographic movies while teaching in any district. He said she took parts only during an eight-month period from 2005 to 2006 because of financial problems after her boyfriend abandoned her.

District superintendent Jeff Chancer applauded the commission's ruling.

Halas' decision to ""engage in pornography was incompatible with her responsibilities as a role model for students and would present an insurmountable, recurring disruption to our schools should she be allowed to remain as a teacher,"" Chancer said in a statement."

Five different Republican committees this morning released a joint memo

pushing back on the “Democrats’ War on Women” messaging to highlight

the sex scandals of a group of Democratic men and argue that Democrats

are hypocrites who only care about women when it is politically

convenient. It’s a fine message as far as it goes, which is as a kind of a summer

doldrums GOP base-riling play, reminding Republican women that there

are a bunch of Democratic men out there who they — and others! — think

are creeps.

Two things about this. First, Democrats underestimate how much stuff like this really gets under the skin of people on the other side. The entire “war on women” campaign is offensive to GOP women and to men who have wives and daughters.

But making a political point by crafting an obnoxious bit of hyperbole is something Democrats excel at lately. Whether it’s comparing the GOP to hijackers or terrorists over budget negotiations, the party has fully embraced argument by demonization. I’m not talking about a loose comment here or there, which always happens on both sides, I mean a coordinated campaign from the top down which includes the President.

Franke-Ruta argues that instead of acting on our entirely justifiable irritation with the left’s obnoxious memes we should design a more reasoned campaign built around women and security issues. I think it’s well intended and probably even a good idea. But–and this is point two–it fails to appreciate the extent to which policy arguments are merely backdrops for more energetic attacks in our elections these days.

To give a current example, these “no slutbags” flyers appearing around NYC are going to do more to hurt Anthony Weiner than any policy argument about his 64 points for a strong middle class. And the same applies to the 2012 election.

The left is kidding itself if it thinks the “war on women” was about expanded funding for birth control. It was about Rush calling Sandra Fluke a slut. That was the headline and the source of outrage onto which all the policy baggage was later loaded. Similarly, Todd Akin’s comments about rape did more to make the war on women a reality than any policy papers posted by the DNC. Populist outrage first, policy backstopping afterwards.

Don’t believe me? Have a look at this move on ad from last year. Notice the focus is on offensive statements not policy arguments. In fact, American Crossroads tried to respond

with their own “war on women” policy arguments, not

unlike what Franke-Ruta is suggesting the GOP try now. But as we all

know, those arguments did not get nearly the same level of media or popular traction.

Rush and Akin’s comments are to Democratic cultural politics what Jaws was to movies about killer sharks. The fascination on the left may have devolved into Sharknado-level parody by now, but there’s no doubting that a new genre was spawned. And to extend that metaphor, there’s no point responding to these memes with policy prescriptions anymore than there is giving the Sharknado sequel a stern and serious negative review. There is no policy response to “binders full of women.” None that matters.

Filner, Weiner and Spitzer give the GOP an easy (and potentially effective) opportunity to respond in kind. It may not be a reasoned policy argument but as we

learned in 2012 that’s not what wins elections."

Editor’s Note: Robert Blecker is a professor at New York Law School where he teaches criminal law and constitutional law. His crime and punishment memoir, “The Death of Punishment: Searching for Justice Among the Worst of the Worst,” will be published by Palgrave Macmillan in November.



(CNN) —

No matter how vicious the crime, no matter how vile the criminal, some death penalty opponents feel certain that nobody can ever deserve to die – even if that person burned children alive, massacred a dozen strangers in a movie theater, or bombed the Boston Marathon. Other opponents admit the worst of the worst of the worst do deserve to die. They just distrust the government ever to get it right.

Now that pharmaceutical companies refuse to supply the lethal drugs that U.S. corrections departments have used for years to execute criminals – whether from their own genuine moral objections or to escape a threatened economic boycott – states have begun to experiment. Death penalty opponents, who call themselves abolitionists, then protest the use of these untried drugs that just might cause a condemned killer to feel pain as he dies.

Let the punishment fit the crime. We’ve mouthed that credo for centuries, but do we really mean it? We retributivists who believe in justice would reward those who bring us pleasure, but punish severely those who sadistically or wantonly cause us pain. A basic retributive measure – like for like or giving a person a taste of his own medicine – satisfies our deepest instincts for justice.

When the condemned killer intentionally tortured helpless victims, how better to preserve some direct connection short of torture than by that murderer’s quick but painful death? By ensuring death through anesthesia, however, we have nearly severed pain from punishment.

Robert Blecker

An unpleasant life in prison, a quick but painful death cannot erase the harm. But it can help restore a moral balance.

I, too, oppose lethal injection, but not because these untried new drugs might arbitrarily cause pain, but because they certainly cause confusion.

Lethal injection conflates punishment with medicine. The condemned dies in a gurney, wrapped in white sheets with an IV in his veins, surrounded by his closest kin, monitored by sophisticated medical devices. Haphazardly conceived and hastily designed, lethal injection appears, feels, and seems medical, although its sole purpose is to kill.

Witnessing an execution in Florida, I shuddered. It felt too much like a hospital or hospice. We almost never look to medicine to tell us whom to execute. Medicine should no more tell us how. How we kill those we rightly detest should in no way resemble how we end the suffering of those we love.

Publicly opposing this method of execution, I have found odd common ground with Deborah Denno, a leading abolitionist scholar who relentlessly attacks lethal injection protocols. Although Denno vigorously opposes all capital punishment, we both agree that the firing squad, among all traditional methods, probably serves us best. It does not sugarcoat, it does not pretend, it does not shamefully obscure what we do. We kill them, intentionally, because they deserve it.

Some people may support the firing squad because it allows us to put blanks in one of the guns: An individual sharpshooter will never know whether he actually killed the condemned. This strikes me as just another symptom of our avoidance of responsibility for punishment. The fact is, in this society, nobody takes responsibility for punishing criminals. Corrections officers point to judges, while judges point to legislators, and legislators to corrections. Anger and responsibility seem to lie everywhere elsewhere – that is, nowhere. And where we cannot fully escape responsibility – as with a firing squad – we diffuse it.

My thousands of hours observing daily life inside maximum security prisons and on death rows in several states these past 25 years have shown me the perverse irony that flows from this: Inside prisons, often the worst criminals live the most comfortable lives with the best hustles, job opportunities and sources of contraband, while the relatively petty criminals live miserably, constantly preyed upon.

Refusing to even contemplate distinguishing those few most sadistic murderers who deserve to die painfully, states seem quite willing haphazardly and arbitrarily to expose prisoners in general, regardless of their crimes, to a more or less painful life, or even death at the hands of other criminals.

Ironically, even as we recoil from punishing those who most deserve it, we readily over-punish those who don’t. A “war on drugs” swells our prisons. We punish addiction and call it crime; we indiscriminately and immorally subject a burglar or car thief to the same daily life in prison we also reserve for rapist murderers.

The time has come to make punishment more nearly fit the crime. To face what we do, and acknowledge, with regret but without shame, that the past counts.

So part of me hopes the abolitionists succeed with their latest campaign against death by lethal injection. We should banish this method. Let the abolitionists threaten to boycott gun manufacturers. See where that gets them. Meanwhile, the rest of us will strive to keep our covenants with victims, restore a moral balance, and shoot to kill those who deserve to die.

Rest assured, when we can only achieve justice by killing a vicious killer, We, the People will find a constitutional way to do it.

The Republican-controlled legislature has sent a bill to Gov. Rick Scott that, if signed, would require the governor to sign execution warrants 30 days after the state Supreme Court reviews cases. It would require the state to execute a prisoner within 180 days of a warrant being signed.

The legislation also sets new deadlines for death row appeals.

The bill arrives on Scott’s desk just days after Maryland became the sixth state in as many years -- and the 18th state overall -- to abolish the death penalty. Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed the bill Thursday, ending what supporters said was decades of racial and socio-economic disparity in death penalty sentencing.

Supporters of the Florida legislation claimed their bill was aimed at improving -- rather than abolishing -- a broken system. They argue it puts an end to condemned prisoners sitting for years on death row -- often through what they consider unnecessary delays in the so-called “post conviction” process.

Republican state Sen. Joe Negron, the bill's sponsor, on Monday called that situation a “mockery” of the criminal justice system.

“We believe in due process,” Negron told FoxNews.com. “But this is about cases in which there is no allegation of innocence and a succession of motion after motion.”

He and fellow state Sen. Rob Bradley also argue the bill ends the long waits that surviving families and others must endure between a murder and the justice they seek.

“This bill is about closure,” Bradley told The Florida Courier.

The average stay on Florida’s death row before being executed is roughly 13 years, according to state records.

Critics of the legislation, however, question why legislators would want to, in effect, accelerate the appeals process, considering 24 people on death row have been exonerated since Florida resumed executions in the 1970s, which is more exonerations than in any other state.

“It is both tragic and ironic that the state that sends the highest number of wrongfully convicted people to death row is considering speeding up executions,” said Mark Elliott, of the group Innocent on Death Row. “Speeding up executions virtually guarantees that innocent people will be executed.”

The legislation attempts to fix the problem of the accused getting shoddy legal services by suspending lawyers for five years from handling death appeals if they are found twice to have provided deficient representation.

In Maryland, those who advocated for the abolition of the death penalty argued the drawn-out execution process was more expensive for the state. They cited a 2008 Urban Institute study that found it costs $1.1 million to prosecute a death penalty-eligible case in which execution is not sought, compared with $3 million to prosecute a case that resulted in the death penalty.

Some Republicans in the Democrat-controlled legislature argued that ending the death penalty entirely was tantamount to putting out a welcome sign for killers.

“I made the argument: What if a terrorist came to Maryland and killed a million residents with a dirty bomb or something like that? Will you keep the death penalty just for that?” Republican Delegate Michael Smigiel told FoxNews.com on Monday. “They wouldn’t do it.”"

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Black Republicans try to appropriate Martin Luther King,"Now it can be told: All the prominent black Republicans in America really can fit into one room.

In fairness, it was a pretty big room.

Republicans, who got just 6 percent of the African American vote in 2012, saw this week’s 50th anniversary celebration of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s March on Washington passing them by. So they held their own commemoration. They sent an invitation “far and wide,” as one party official put it, asking black conservatives to lunch at party headquarters. About 150 accepted the invitation for chicken, cheesecake and cheeky suggestions that the late civil rights leader would have supported the causes of today’s conservatives.

Unfortunately, the Party of Lincoln discovered that its technical capability was still rather 19th century. The wireless sound system failed, and the microphone picked up only every few words. The national anthem became: “O’er the rampar . . . ah . . . ah . . . nn . . . oof . . . nigh . . . that . . . ill . . . of the . . . ay.” The hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing” came out, in part, like this: “Skies . . . ow . . . ow . . . ing see . . . aw . . . ah . . . sing a song . . . rah . . . nah.” Its final verse went something like, “Lest our hearts . . . drunk . . . vil . . . eh . . . ub . . . eh . . . eeh . . . shadow . . . meeeeee.”

As the speakers fired staccato fragments of the speeches at the participants, techs scurried to repair the system, an RNC official sighed and the droning of a power drill on a nearby floor added to the mayhem.

“You know, Republicans can’t turn on a microphone,” quipped Ada Fisher, RNC committeewoman from North Carolina, when she came onstage to say the Pledge of Allegiance.

After a pause, the audio troubles were fixed for the rest of the event. But there remained a good deal of static in the message that came out over the next two hours. Those speaking to the group agreed on the desirability of appropriating King and the anniversary, but they proposed different and contradictory ways.

Alveda King, niece of the great man and champion of conservative causes, sang “Oh, Freedom” but gave the old spiritual evangelical lyrics:

“Oh, freedom, oh, freedom/Oh, freedom over me/I no longer am a slave/Christ is risen from the grave/Christ is Lord, I am saved and I’m free.”

She said, “For me, it’s not as much anymore about politics and affiliations,” adding, “I am a Republican and I’m glad to be a Republican.”

Robert Brown, who worked in the Nixon White House, suggested that Martin Luther King’s spirit might inform leaders in Congress and the White House that “this nation was built on compromise and if we don’t get it all together, we’re going to sink this ship and we can’t afford to do that.” This received scattered applause.

A similar response greeted Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), who criticized the Supreme Court decision that invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act and vowed to repair the law so that it is “impervious to another challenge that will be filed by the usual suspects. I’m with you on that.” The light applause suggested that most of those in attendance were not with him.

But Bob Woodson, a conservative activist, got a standing ovation after he said “We should not wait for evil to wear a white face before we get outraged” and urged his listeners to condemn “corrupt” black politicians. “I think if Dr. King were alive today, he would step on some of these sacred issues.”

It’s anybody’s guess what King would do, but it seems a bit of a stretch to think he would do what T.W. Shannon, speaker of the Oklahoma House, told the audience.

“The key to fulfilling the dream” of King’s, he said, included “quality education for all our children whether in public or private schools,” a “limited government” and curbing a “ferocious appetite for bigger government.” The dream, he went on, must be protected from “contaminants of government dependence, class warfare, socialism and any other pollutant that would muzzle the ring of freedom.”

Shannon proceeded to cite the case of an Alaska woman who beat a moose with a shovel to save her husband — evidence, he said, of “the raw heroic nature of our nation.”

RNC officials who spoke took no position on the moose, and they were less creative in attempting to turn King into a conservative Republican. Sharon Day, RNC co-chairman, noted that it was a Republican Congress that passed the women’s suffrage amendment — in 1919. Reince Priebus, RNC chairman, made the requisite references to the party’s birth and the Great Emancipator.

“We’ve lost the history of this party because we don’t tell it,” he said, “but we’re going to.”

Just as soon as he can get the microphone working.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday accused two major companies of indirectly discriminating against African Americans by using criminal background checks to screen out workers.

The commission said BMW effectively fired 70 black employees with criminal histories from a facility in South Carolina, even though many had been there for years. One woman with 14 years under her belt was let go after a misdemeanor conviction surfaced that was more than 20 years old and carried a $137 fine, according to the EEOC’s lawsuit.

The agency also alleged that retailer Dollar General revoked job offers to two black women after conducting criminal background checks. In one case, the EEOC said that the records were inaccurate but that Dollar General declined to reconsider the woman’s application. The other involved a six-year-old drug conviction.

“It is a fairness issue,” said David Lopez, the commission’s general counsel. “Litigation is really, truly the last resort.”

The growing use of criminal background checks in hiring decisions has become a flash point in the broader debate over high unemployment rates among African Americans. Not only did blacks lose more jobs and more wealth than other racial groups during the recession, they also have struggled to gain a foothold in the recovery — an issue some community leaders have called the next front in the civil rights movement. A criminal record, advocates say, is an economic scarlet letter that can send otherwise qualified applicants to the bottom of the pile.

The EEOC lawsuits were brought under the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination against job applicants on the basis of race. Both BMW and Dollar General denied the allegations and said they complied with all laws.

Although the commission said employers are allowed to conduct background checks, it charged that the companies’ blanket policies of not hiring candidates with criminal records amounted to discrimination against African Americans. Justice Department statistics show that blacks accounted for 37 percent of those behind bars last year, even though they make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population.

The EEOC is not alone in focusing on the role of criminal background checks in black employment. Since the recession, seven states — including Maryland — have adopted laws that prohibit employers from including questions about criminal history on job applications.

The movement has been nicknamed “ban the box,” after the box that offenders often are required to mark. Bills are pending in four other states, and at least a dozen local governments have enacted versions of the ban. Business groups have not mounted organized opposition to the measures.

Del. Aisha N. Braveboy (D-Prince George’s), the leader of Maryland’s Legislative Black Caucus, helped spearhead the legislation, which applies only to state government jobs. She said the tight employment market is the top concern in her community, and she connects the problem to the county’s high rates of foreclosure and crime. Helping people find jobs is the first step to addressing broader issues, she said.

“They should pay . . . but should they pay for it for the rest of their lives?” Braveboy said. “We have a responsibility as a society to provide people with opportunities to be gainfully employed and to make better choices.”

The link between race and crime has long been a highly charged and difficult debate rooted in factors such as discrimination and socioeconomic status. The EEOC emphasized that companies have a right to consider criminal history in hiring. Guidelines updated last year say that when evaluating job candidates, employers should weigh the nature of a crime, how long ago it occurred and its relation to the position. Offenders are generally prohibited from working in day-care facilities or prisons, for example.

But the EEOC said it is wary of the way hiring policies can disproportionately hurt minorities.

A landmark study by Princeton sociologist Devah Pager found that white offenders were only half as likely to get a callback from a potential employer and that the effect was even greater for blacks. A separate study by the Pew Center on the States found that even when offenders do land jobs, men with criminal histories earn about 40 percent less than those in similar circumstances without records.

A survey last year by the Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, found that more than two-thirds of companies conduct criminal background checks. About a quarter of them said nonviolent misdemeanors, such as drug convictions, could influence their hiring decisions, and 60 percent reported that violent crimes could disqualify a candidate. Almost all indicated reluctance to hire someone who had been convicted of a violent felony such as murder. A majority said they allow candidates to explain their records.

In a statement Tuesday, BMW said it has “complied with the letter and spirit of the law” and touted its diverse workforce.

According to the lawsuit, the automaker banned those convicted of crimes ranging from murder to drug use to “theft, dishonesty and moral turpitude.” In 2008, when BMW switched contractors that were handling logistics at its facility in Spartanburg, S.C., it asked employees to reapply for their jobs under BMW’s criminal-background policy. The EEOC suit said 88 people were not rehired. Eighty percent of them were African American.

In its case against Dollar General, the EEOC said the low-price retailer does not adequately evaluate criminal records when hiring. The result was that 10 percent of offers made to black candidates were rescinded after a background check, compared with 7 percent of offers to whites.

In a statement, Dollar General said it seeks to foster “a safe and healthy environment” through its background checks.

But Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said too many minorities are running into roadblocks.

“It’s such a tough economy that there’s a lot of concern about the barriers that people are facing to employment beyond the fact that there’s just not enough jobs,” she said.

Ryan Moragneel of Baltimore was 18 when he received a felony conviction for distributing marijuana. A few years later, he was put on probation after robbing a pawnshop with some friends. In 2011, he received a misdemeanor charge and spent several months in jail. He said employers take one look at his history and toss his application aside.

“I never really got a chance to be an adult without a record,” Moragneel said. “I’ve never been hired off a computer.”

Now 30 with two kids, Moragneel is set to graduate this month from a skills training program in Baltimore that he hopes will open the door to a job in electrical engineering. If he could talk to an employer, he said, he would say that he has learned from his mistakes and wants to move ahead.

But that can happen only if he lands an interview.

“So far,” Moragneel said, “it’s no calls back.”"

If they valued their lives, and the lives of their families, the last thing they would have done was voiced a complaint about ""white people"" to a man like Robertson.

The corpse of 16-year-old Freddie Moore, his face showing signs of a severe beating, hands bound, remained hanging for at least 24 hours from a metal girder on the old, hand-cranked swing bridge spanning Bayou Lafourche. Hanged by the neck the night of Oct. 11, 1933, in a mob lynching, the black youth had been accused in the death of a neighbor, a white girl ... Arrested Oct. 10, 1933, in the slaying days earlier of Anna Mae LaRose, a 15-year-old girl who was his friend, Moore was pulled from the parish jail in Napoleonville the next night by an angry mob of 50 to 200 armed and unmasked people who had the prison keys.

After being hauled from the jail, Moore was brought to the field where LaRose’s body was found, according to an Oct. 14, 1933, account in the black-owned New Orleans newspaper, The Louisiana Weekly. With a rope around his neck and clothes stripped to his waist, the teen was then marched, while being beaten, from the murder scene to the bridge and subjected to a branding iron whenever he fell. Hanging from his body, a sign offered the final indignity: “Niggers Let This Be An Example. Do-Not-Touch-In 24 Hr. Mean it.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates thinks he understands why Phil Robertson didn't see any Louisiana black folk complaining about ""doggone white people"" as they happily toiled in the cotton fields of pre-Civil Rights-era Louisiana. His thought is that blacks' reluctance to express their grievances too loudly may have been tempered by certain events in their state's record on matters of racial tolerance:Ah, 1933. The same year our white European brethren began their novel legislative experiments in civic gentrification, the American South for its part continued to take care of its business the old-fashioned way--by mob rule.In his folksy diatribe about his purported experiences in the cotton fields working alongside ""godly"" blacks humming spirituals, Phil Robertson refers to himself as ""white trash,"" apparently in an effort to align himself with their experience (""I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash.""). He never stops to think about why he had to say ""white."" After all, trash is trash, right?

Well, not exactly. Without blacks there'd be no need for Robertson to describe himself as ""white trash.""

Michael Pfeifer, associate Professor of History at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has identified 422 victims of lynching in Louisiana between 1878 and 1946. These are among approximately 2500 lynchings in the South that occurred after Reconstruction. The number of lynchings prior to Reconstruction was in the thousands. Whether Moore was actually guilty of the killing has faded from the public record (some witnesses claimed the girl's stepfather later confessed, although distant members of the girl's family disputed this). Other witnesses identified two deputy sheriffs from the Assumption Parish as leading the lynch mob, an allegation also disputed by the Parish sheriff, Lizen H. Himel. A Federal Jury in 1936 ultimately held Himel liable for his deputies' actions and awarded Moore's parents a judgment of $2500.

To his credit, Coates is less concerned about the statements of self-promoters like Robertson than he is about making a ""teachable moment"" out of this media fiasco. The idea that Robertson could ever place himself in the shoes of these black farm workers--or any other black person in Louisiana -- simply ignores the reality of the times:

That is because governance in Phil Robertson's Louisiana was premised on terrorism. As late as 1890, the majority of people in Louisiana were black. As late as 1902, they still lived under threat of slavery through debt peonage and the convict-lease system. Virtually all of them were pilfered of their vote and their tax dollars. Plunder and second slavery were enforced by violence, as when the besiegers of Colfax massacred 50 black freedmen with rifles and cannon and tossed their bodies into a river. Even today the Colfax Massacre is honored in Louisiana as the rightful ""end of carpetbag misrule."" .

The black people who Phil Robertson knew were warred upon. If they valued their lives, and the lives of their families, the last thing they would have done was voiced a complaint about ""white people"" to a man like Robertson.

The belief that black people were at their best when they were being hunted down like dogs for the sin of insisting on citizenship is a persistent strain of thought in this country. This belief reflects the inability to cope with an America that is, at least rhetorically, committed to equality.

The ""Colfax"" massacre , as it became known, occurred in 1873 in Colfax, Louisiana, and is described as the worst instance of racial violence in Reconstruction. This atrocity as well as the Moore slaying and the never-ending specter of the lynch mob were the realities of black life in Louisiana before the Civil Rights movement.Coates sees a familiar pattern in statements like those of Mr. Robertson--the deliberate willful retreat into a mythical past that never existed:From the struggle of African-Americans for civil rights, Coates draws a direct parallel to the modern-day struggle for same-sex equality, noting that Robertson's tirade against gays follows the same reliance on Biblical proscriptions, the same type of proscriptions that were once used to justify slavery:

“Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God.""

Phil Robertson

[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.

Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America

http://en.wikipedia.org/...

Coates concludes that the bigot's song remains the same:

This is not just ignorance; it is a willful retreat into myth. And we must have the intellectual courage and moral strength to follow the myth through. If swindlers, goat-fuckers, and gay men are really all the same—disinherited from the kingdom of God—why not treat them the same? How does one argue that a man who is disfavored by the Discerner of All Things, should not be shamed, should not jeered, should not be stoned, should not be lynched in the street? Further retreat into the inanity of loving the sinner but hating the sin—a standard that would clean The Wise Helmsman himself—will not do. Actual history shows that humans are not so discriminating. Black people were once thought to be sinners. We were rewarded with a species of love that bore an odd resemblance to hate. One need not be oversensitive to be concerned about Phil Robertson's thoughts on gay sex. One simply need be a student of American history.

Phil Robertson is simply a sad, deluded little man. What he thinks or says is of no particular importance except what it reveals, however unwittingly, about America's ongoing struggle with itself over race. The fact that his supporters and detractors have lined up yet again along political lines just shows how little the country has changed in a hundred and fifty years."

Stop being the stupid party.

I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment. It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended.

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who famously blasted federal funding for volcano monitoring just days before a volcano eruption in covered Sarah Palin's home town in ash, had a message for Republicans earlier this year And now, one year later, Jindal has weighed in on A&E's decision to suspend Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson for making crude homophobic comments in a GQ interview, saying that Robertson and his family are ""great citizens of the state of Lousiana"" and:I'm not about to defend Miley Cyrus as a musician or performer, but if Bobby Jindal can't tell the difference between getting your First Amendment rights violated and getting suspended from a TV show, or the difference between someone promoting sales of a music album and someone starring on an advertiser-supported TV show, or the difference between raunchiness and bigotry, well, then he should take his own advice, and stop being stupid."

That miracle may be in the making, helped along by Christians who want to put their faith into action.

FOR THE RECORD:

Immigration: An Aug. 8 Op-Ed article said 300 evangelical Christians confronted members of Congress on July 25 in support of immigration reform. It was July 24. —



On July 25, 300 evangelical Christians from 27 states had 110 meetings with their mostly Republican representatives on Capitol Hill to ask them to let personal faith replace political fear. Republican leaders told us we represented a “new factor” in the debate on immigration, a grass-roots constituency for reform that can influence the political right.

We offered a clear message to every member of the House, but especially those who consider themselves people of faith. Christians, including millions of evangelicals, believe fixing our broken immigration system is long overdue.

We aren’t primarily motivated by political considerations or even by the clear economic benefits immigration reform would bring. It is the biblical call to “welcome the stranger” and Jesus’ concern for “the least of these” that inspires us. Congress needs to pass immigration reform because it is the morally right thing to do.

Of course, God never ordains or endorses particular pieces of legislation — bills are always the product of compromises and limitations. But the principles contained in the common-sense immigration bill put forward by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are the right ones. The proposal could bring 11 million people out of the shadows, reunite families, provide an earned, achievable pathway to citizenship, respect the rule of law and secure the border — all goals that are broadly consistent with biblical values.

When three of the largest Republican constituencies — evangelicals, law enforcement officials and business leaders — are in favor of an immigration overhaul, it’s hard to fathom the arguments against it. Those whose position on reform is based on political fear, unacknowledged racial prejudice or worries about losing primaries to far-right ideologues are too often the same people who trumpet their religious convictions as guiding their decisions in public life.

Our claim to them is simple: Politicians who are professing Christians need to consider what their faith has to say about immigration. If they oppose reform and refuse to offer compassion to our immigrant brothers and sisters, they should justify their positions on moral grounds. We join with other faith communities in asking for a moral and religious conversation about immigration reform — not just a political one.

We don’t think a faith-based argument exists against immigration reform, at least if you’re reading the Bible closely. God’s passionate, abiding concern for immigrants and foreigners, strangers and travelers — and for our neighbors — is obvious to anyone reading through Scripture.

In the Old Testament, the Lord commands:

“When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself … "" (Leviticus 19:33-34).

The biblical word “ger” for the foreigners in our midst occurs an astounding 92 times in the Hebrew scriptures, with the consistent instruction to protect them.

In the New Testament, the stranger, and all who are vulnerable, are at the very heart of the Gospel. In the book of Matthew, Jesus offers a vision in which caring for them is the defining mark of God’s kingdom:

“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me” (Matthew 25:35-36).

That evangelical Christians would finally act to reform the immigration system should surprise no one, and not just for theological reasons. Undocumented immigrants have joined our congregations; we understand the problem firsthand. They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ. And we know that by reforming our immigration laws, we can create a system that also reflects the best values of our nation and the highest ideals of our faith. We act because, as the book of James reminds us, “faith without works is dead.”

Conservative Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has connected his faith with his vote:

“I think the biggest change hasn’t been in the pulpit; it’s been in the pews.... It’s one thing when 11 million is a statistic. The other thing is when one of those 11 million is your friend, a human being who you now know … as a father, as a husband, as a mother, as a worker, as a worshiper.... Our faith has always been about compassion and it compels you to do something. If you took compassion or the principle of compassion out of the Bible, it would be in tatters because it’s all over the place.”

Compassion is indeed all over the Bible. I pray it will also be found in the House of Representatives. It’s time for Christians in the House to stand up in support of immigration reform, or to explain why they won’t — as Christians. If they follow their faith, we will see the miracle we need.

NC NAACP Responds to the Disturbing Repeal of the Racial Justice Act

On Juneteenth Holiday

June 19, 1865–or Juneteenth–is celebrated around the world as the day of liberation for millions of enslaved African Americans in the southern states. Although all enslaved people in the southern states that were still engaged in an open rebellion against the United States had been declared free in January 1, 1863, in most of the states there were not enough U.S. military forces to enforce the end of slavery. When the U.S. Navy fleet sailed into the Galveston Harbor in Texas, however, with sufficient U.S. military forces to back up his words of freedom, U.S. General Gordon Granger read U.S. Army General Order #3: ”The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.”

“Gov. Patrick McCrory picked Juneteenth–of all the days in the year, –to reinstate North Carolina’s proven race-based system of death, to sign an unconstitutional and flawed law that repeals North Carolina’s nationally-acclaimed Racial Justice Act, ” said Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, President of the NC State Conference of over 100 adult and youth branches across the state. ”The extremists who racially gerrymandered themselves into power with obscene donations from Art Pope and national secret political societies have now placed their approval on the proven racist system of death in our courthouses. The Racial Justice Act – which raised the window and turned on the lights on the racism in death penalty cases, was a major step in our efforts to carry out General Order #3, and to achieve “absolute equality of rights” between former masters and slaves.”

“It is not disputed that the repealed Racial Justice Act was a huge success and allowed death row inmates to present overwhelming evidence that the criminal justice system which resulted in their convictions was fatally flawed. If past cases, where four death row inmates were able to establish the existence of racial bias in jury selection during their trial, are any indication of the evidence which exists in these pending cases, more death sentences will be struck down”, said NC NAACP Lead Attorney Irving Joyner. “It is a ‘down right – dirty shame’ that our political leaders, in light of these past revelations of a systemic breakdown and misuse of our prosecutorial process, chose to destroy a viable remedy, rather than to repair the race-based defects found in the system. Gov. McCrory’s repeal seeks to make the new law apply retroactively, blunting appeals by death row inmates to assert their discrimination claims. Applying the repeal retroactively is clearly unconstitutional, since it is an ‘ex post facto law.’ This poorly disguised discriminatory attempt to strip the rights of death row inmates will now cost the State substantially more money in legal fees, as it must defend the tea party zealots’ agenda to disregard and diminish the constitutional protections of poor and working people.”

Juneteenth, which should be a day of rejoicing, has been turned into a day of sadness in North Carolina. Governor McCrory had the opportunity to veto this bill, and separate himself from the Pope-Tea Party zealots who have seized control in the legislature. Instead, he joined the forces of denial, which see no racism, hear no racism, in the back rooms and court rooms of our legal system of death. The citizens of North Carolina have not and will not sit by and allow the extremists to take control of the State. Governor McCrory, you have been put on notice.

The NC NAACP has always opposed the death penalty. The Racial Justice Act passed in 2009 to allow men and women on death row to change their death sentences to life without parole, if they could prove racial bias in their death sentences. Irrefutable research has shown that racial bias remains prevalent in North Carolina’s justice system. Ignoring this fact is an embarrassment to all the people of North Carolina."

You Can Follow Him At', 'Dangainor On Twitter', 'Submit Suggestions There.']",The monstrous abortion trial the media don’t want you to know about,"When the Newtown shooting took the lives of 20 children, the nation was justifiably horrified. Journalists reported round the clock on ways to change public policy to prevent another shooting. But when seven children and a mother died in a Philadelphia abortion clinic dubbed a “house of horrors,” the major media couldn’t have cared less.

It’s a news story that reads more like a Hollywood torture plot – “Saw” or “Hostel” or some other movie so foul that it makes you want to take a shower just having viewed it.

Only this case is real and the media are keeping it real quiet because it betrays the barbarity of the abortion industry in open court, where they can’t hide. It’s all about abortion “doctor” Kermit Gosnell and the purportedly Medieval facility he ran to kill babies – both before they were born and after, claim prosecutors. Eight clinic employees have already pleaded guilty to “various charges.”

[pullquote]

“Gosnell is charged with killing seven babies born alive, along with Karnamaya Mongar a newly-arrived, 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan. Prosecutors say Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers during a 2009 abortion,” according to the Associated Press.

More On This...

ABC has never carried that story. Not once. Neither has NBC. CBS did … back in 2011 when Gosnell was first arrested. The rest of the media landscape is an equal travesty. CNN did one story on it in 2013, even though the trial has been going on for more than three weeks. Fox has covered it more than most of its TV kin, but it has surprisingly not done a lot.

It’s OK, they’ve been too busy with basketball. Yes, ABC, CBS and NBC have spent 41 minutes and 26 seconds telling viewers about the Rutgers basketball scandal. And not a second about baby murder in Philadelphia. Of course, Rutgers Coach Mike Rice did throw basketballs at grown men, deploy “abusive behavior” and, worst of all, use “homophobic slurs.”

Gosnell’s charges seem mild by comparison. He is charged with murdering seven viable, born-alive babies “by plunging scissors into their spinal cords.” Sherry West, who worked for Gosnell, recently testified she saw an 18- to 24-inch-long newborn. “It didn't have eyes or a mouth but it was like screeching, making this noise. It was weird. It sounded like a little alien,” she told the court.

“A former clinic worker who grew up in Mt. Lebanon testified on Thursday that he routinely saw babies born and then killed with scissors in an inner-city Philadelphia clinic that catered to minorities, the poor and women with late-term pregnancies,” reported AP. The worker estimated the number of babies he saw killed at about 100.

Despite all that, print publications haven’t covered the story much either. The local papers, such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, have done a fantastic job covering a story that is so ghastly that its reporters will probably never stop having nightmares. Lexis-Nexis credits the Inquirer with more than 140 stories about the topic, each more gruesome than the last.

But the national papers have largely ignored it. The New York Times, the land of “All the News That's Fit to Print” only found this mass murder story “fit” four times, just once in 2013. The Washington Post has mentioned it three times, but not since April 11 of 2012.

The liberal press has been almost as silent. Lefty Salon had a few AP stories, but only ones that undermined the charges against the doctor. Those include: “Doc disputes ‘killings’ at Philly abortion clinic” and “Med. examiner, lawyer clash at doc’s murder trial.”

The liberal Huffington Post, on which so many journalists rely for their news, was equally dismissive. It’s run a couple wire stories, but those conveniently left out the most heinous aspects of the trial.

Surprisingly, the whacko site Alternet included one condemnation of Gosnell, but it did to hold the line on unlimited abortion. The site ran the text of a speech by Dr. Jennefer Russo of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. While she admitted, “what happened in Philadelphia in the office of Kermit Gosnell is an atrocity,” she still defended abortion as a way to “protect women’s health.” Perhaps she hasn’t been following the trial.

Or maybe she has and the abortion industry doesn’t care what happens as long as it adds to the 50 million aborted babies since Roe v. Wade. That was certainly the impression given by Alisa LaPolt Snow, the lobbyist representing the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates. She testified that how to handle a child born from a botched abortion “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.” Someone needs to teach Planned Parenthood that abortions after a child is born are murder.

Sadly, that story also has received no attention. Journalists are quick to worry about “extreme” ways states are trying to curtail abortion. But clearly, murdering babies is not the news media’s definition of “extreme.”

Twenty conservative leaders including L. Brent Bozell, of the Media Research Center, Tony Perkins, of the Family Research Council, and Jeanne Monahan, of March for Life Education and Defense Fund, have all demanded the media stop censoring this ghoulish trial. In an open letter, they concluded: “This cover-up is a national disgrace.”

The oddest thing about the media blackout is how it defies everything news folks ordinarily do. Journalists aren’t just predictable, they are stunningly so. Give them a Casey Anthony, Amanda Knox, Scott Peterson and more, and they will be reporting it, desperate for the attention and ratings.

That is, unless it makes the Merchants of Death at Planned Parenthood look bad. Then that story will be ignored, no matter how many babies die in the process."

The new class is the most diverse in the city’s history, and the graduation last week was the culmination of years of litigation over entrenched discrimination in the Fire Department. But while department leaders have promoted the class as a success, the recruits have been a source of animosity and suspicion in some firehouses.

In the report, which was issued on Friday, the court monitor, Mark S. Cohen, said the arrival of the new class would present “both opportunities and challenges for the F.D.N.Y.”

Mr. Cohen noted the department had issued anti-retaliation and anti-harassment policies, but said officials must ensure that “firehouse culture does not operate to deter” any of the new firefighters."

Manning Granted Stay of Execution,"A Mississippi man scheduled to be put to death on Tuesday was granted a stay of execution by the State Supreme Court, after the United States Department of Justice sent lawyers and officials involved in the case several letters disavowing the degree of certainty expressed by F.B.I. forensic experts at the man’s trial.

About 2 p.m., just four hours before the scheduled execution, the court voted 8 to 1 to grant a reprieve “until further order” to Willie Jerome Manning, 44, who was convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students.

The justices in favor did not explain their reasoning or put a time limit on the reprieve. The dissenting justice issued a blistering objection, saying Mr. Manning had exhausted the challenges to his conviction and attacking the Justice Department for the letters, along with several other unrelated issues.

Starting Thursday, the Justice Department sent three letters calling certain aspects of the trial testimony of two F.B.I. experts “erroneous.” Defense lawyers cited these letters as reasons to put off the execution until DNA tests could be conducted on crime scene evidence, including a rape kit, a request that Mr. Manning had made unsuccessfully several times before."

""The word racist is truly hurtful,"" he told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""It's not who I am. It's not who I ever was. It's just not fair. It's just not right.""

The Washington Post columnist came under fire on Tuesday for writing that ""people with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children."" He insisted that he was expressing the views of some people within the Tea Party and not his own.

""I didn't write one line, I wrote a column,"" Cohen said. ""The column is about Tea Party extremism and I was not expressing my views, I was expressing the views of what I think some people in the Tea Party held.""

And those views are not held by the entire Tea Party. ""I don't think everybody in the Tea Party is like that, because I know there are blacks in the Tea Party,"" he said. ""So they're not all racist, unless I'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there.""

When asked if he believed that people who do “have a gag reflex” at the idea of interracial marriage are in fact racist, he said that he did. “I could have picked a better word, but it didn't ring any bells with anybody, it didn't ring any bells with me,” he continued. “But there is a context to the column. You've got to read the whole column and if you read the whole column you can't honestly think that these are my views or I endorse the views that I articulated in the column.”

Fred Hiatt, editor of the Washington Post editorial page, said Tuesday that he should have edited Cohen's ""conventional"" line to prevent misunderstanding.

Cohen said that no editors objected to the phrasing the first time around. ""Nobody, not a single one of my editors -- and believe me, they're super sensitive to this sort of stuff -- said, 'Wait a minute.' They all knew what I meant because of the context of the column. I was talking about tea party extremism. And it's clear.""

He added, ""Look, maybe the word was inappropriate or maybe I could have used a different word. But you're talking to somebody who has written, I don't know, 100 columns in favor of homosexual rights, many columns in favor of same sex marriage.""

Cohen has been criticized for his comments on race in the past. When asked why he thought it was that he keeps getting caught up in racially charged arguments, he said that it's because people view him as a liberal and find some of his positions unconventional. ""Every once in a while I take an unconventional stance as a liberal -- as someone who has always been called a liberal,"" he said. ""If someone on the right wrote this, no one would care. No one would make a big deal about it but because I veer every once in awhile from orthodoxy, or maybe more than once in awhile, I get plastered this way.""

ORIGINAL STORY: Richard Cohen is back at it again, this time with incendiary comments about interracial marriage and lesbians.

In his November 11 column in the Washington Post entitled ""Christie’s tea-party problem,"" Cohen said that the GOP has had trouble embracing some of the country's cultural shifts. He wrote:

Today’s GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled — about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde. People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.

In fact, according to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, 87 percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage between blacks and whites."

But the Justice Department's leak investigation is different. Mainstream outrage is built into the scandal, because it directly affects mainstream news reporters. And so, The Daily Beast's Daniel Klaidman reports, when it became public that the DOJ had subpoenaed Associated Press phone records and gotten a search warrant a Fox News reporter's emails, Holder ""was also beginning to feel a creeping sense of personal remorse."" The remorse came not when he approved the Rosen search warrant, but once everyone found out about it. The DOJ went into ""damage-control mode."" That Holder takes this controversy very seriously is clear in all the things he's doing to fix his image.

2. Promise it will never happen again. Holder ""and his advisers began exploring ways to reform the Justice Department’s internal guidelines for investigating leaks to safeguard the media against overly intrusive tactics,"" Klaidman reports. He offers a few reasons for the decision Holder now regrets: he was under a lot of pressure to prosecute leaks, the White House didn't push back against that pressure, there were gaps in the DOJ guidelines, and prosecutors tend to try to collect as much evidence as possible -- forgetting to think about the bigger picture.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), called black and Hispanic voters “uninformed” and “deceived"" during a speech to conservative activists in February.



After attending a panel on minority outreach at the FreedomWorks grassroots summit, Cruz, a Cuban-American, born-again Christian, spoke at the conference. He noted that a previous speaker ""mentioned something about Hispanics being uninformed or deceived.""

""Well, the same thing is true of the black population,” Cruz said.

Cruz also suggested how blacks and Hispanics should vote. “As a matter of fact, if we could communicate the truth, not only to the Hispanics but to the black population, all blacks should be Republican,"" he said.

“Highly religious, strongly pro-family, strongly pro-life” values and high military enrollment rates align Hispanics’ principles with the Republican Party’s, said Cruz.

Exit polls from the 2012 election, however, indicated that a majority of Latino voters, 59 percent, supported same-sex marriage, while an even larger majority, 66 percent, supported abortion rights. Fifty-two percent of black voters supported same-sex marriage, the polls showed.

Cruz has made headlines lately with similarly controversial comments. At an event sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project in November, Cruz claimed that God ordains capital punishment.

“You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis Chapter 9 and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis Chapter 9 ... God ordains the death penalty!”

Cruz also argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would lead to an unjustified outpouring of hate-speech accusations. “You preach Romans Chapter 1 in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech,” Cruz said.

In his February speech, Cruz promoted the abolishment of political correctness. “We have been guilty of following two things that we totally have to throw aside. Number one is political correctness,” Cruz said. “We have been destroyed by political correctness. And we must learn to tell the truth unequivocally.”

The 74-year-old tea party icon also attributed “all the civil rights” that African-Americans have achieved to Republicans.

“Let’s talk about the black population. All the civil rights that the African Americans have obtained have come from Republicans,” Cruz said. “But you know what, Democrats took the credit.”"

As far back as the Revolutionary War, sodomy was forbidden in the military and, in many instances, punished harshly. After World War I, when homosexuality was just trickling down into public discourse from medical professionals who had defined the homosexual as a ""sexual invert,"" the military began to make efforts to exclude gays and lesbians from service. This continued throughout the 1930s.

Then, Pearl Harbor happened and the United States went to war. Suddenly, excluding gays and lesbians from military service wasn't as important. After all, every warm body was needed to win the war. Women were allowed to enlist in the Women's Army Corps (WAC), and every patriotic American was expected to join in the war effort in some way. This isn't to say that gays and lesbians were well-treated or allowed to be open in the military. But, from 1939 to 1945, they were policed much less and, in many cases, allowed to flourish within the confines of the military.

World War II was quite unusual in the way that it so fundamentally changed American society. Over fifteen million Americans moved to urban centers to work in defense jobs, and just about as many men were drafted. Women entered the job market en masse. African Americans moved to the North. Ethnic Mexicans were shipped into California to replace the ""relocated"" Japanese-Americans. Normalcy was turned on its head as just about every facet of life, from family structure to gender roles, changed. The war also had quite an effect on American gay life, even if we don't talk about that as much when we discuss World War II.

Like many other Americans, gays and lesbians flocked to the military. Some simply wanted to serve their country in its time of need. Some lesbians saw WAC life as a way to meet and live with other lesbians. Some joined the military not realizing they were gay or lesbian until they were exposed to others of their kind. Whatever their individual reasons, many gays and lesbians rushed to enlist after Pearl Harbor. As I said above, policing of gays and lesbians did not end during World War II, and this extended to the recruitment process. Medical professionals were ""trained"" to spot homosexuals based on physical characteristics, behavior, and vocabulary. The interview screening process that each man and woman entering the military had to go through took all of three minutes, during which time homosexuality was supposed to be spotted by the interviewer. As you can imagine, not many were ""spotted."" Bob Ruffing, a gay man who enlisted in the navy, recalls:



I walked into this office, and there was this man who was a screaming belle--lots of gold braid but he was a queen if ever I saw one. And he asked me the standard questions, ending up with, ""Did you ever have any homosexual experiences?"" Well, I looked him right in the eye and said, ""No."" And he looked right back and said, ""That's good."" Both of us lying through our teeth!

Sometimes [a relationship] can become an intimacy that may eventually take some form of sexual expression. It may appear that, almost spontaneously, such a relationship has sprung up between two women, neither of whom is a confirmed active homosexual.

...women having the appearance of perverts have been observed at Fort Oglethorpe;...these women affect mannish appearance by haircut, by the manner of wearing the clothing, by posture, by stride, by seeking ""to date"" other girls such as a man would, and when with other girls pay all the bills...These addicts have certain signals by which they recognize each other...The signal is said to be a whistle of the ""Hawaiian War Chant.""...Expressions common between them are said to include, ""We're going to have a gay time tonight""; ""Are you in the mood?"" and ""Messing around.""

Getting in was easy. And the reality was that, once in, it was not that easy to be discharged for homosexual activity, especially in the WAC. WAC policy was made clear in a secret lecture given in 1943 which warned against ""indulging in witch hunting or speculation."" The lecture also acknowledged:This policy became all the more clear in an incident that took place in 1944. After a complaint from the mother of a WAC recruit, the Inspector General's office sent a team to investigate. Witnesses testified:Yet, despite this ""damning"" evidence, the team concluded that no homosexual ""addicts"" existed in the WAC, and an effort was made to retain all of these women. The need for bodies trumped the need for purity.

Gay men had a slightly less easier time in the military. If a man was caught having sex with another man, it was treated as a very serious crime. The guilty could be sent to the brigs, where guards enjoyed beating gay prisoners. They also faced discharge (covered in more detail below).

In spite of this, gay male culture, in many ways, flourished in the military. Drag shows were quite popular during the war, and many men gladly dressed up in women's clothing to put on a good show for their comrades. Homoerotic behavior was prevalent in the barracks. One wartime psychiatric study of barracks life noted:



In the barracks, usually when the men are getting undressed...various persons will ""kiddingly"" assume the role of overt homosexual. One soldier, returning from the shower in the nude, will be greeted with catcalls, salacious whistling, comments like ""Hey Joe! You shouldn't go around like that--you don't know what that does to me!"" Joe will respond by wriggling his hips in feminine fashion after coyly draping a towel around himself...Others act the part of active solicitors for sexual favors. ""How much do you want for sleeping with me tonight?""; ""Come into my bed and I'll give you the time of your life.""

In addition to the blatant homoeroticism in barracks life, there were ample opportunities for gay men to meet other gay men and form queer social networks and even romantic and sexual relationships. Such networks were often referred to as the ""fruit corner"" or the ""fruit salad."" As derogatory as these terms seem, there was not much discrimination perpetrated against gay soldiers by their fellow comrades. Long before DADT, it was very much a ""don't ask, don't tell"" environment. If you were gay and in a sexual relationship, nothing could be proven unless you were caught.

Not to mention, there were numerous opportunities for gay men to explore the queer nightlife on weekend passes and furloughs in American urban centers. Gay servicemen could be found in gay bars, cruising parks, and hooking up with queer civilians. Despite the rhetorically anti-gay policies of the military, there were many ways for gay soldiers to fly under the radar during World War II.

Of course, not everybody was so fortunate. Many gays and lesbians were discharged for homosexual activity. These were called ""blue discharges""--a sort of middle ground between honorable and dishonorable, since homosexuality was considered a psychiatric condition. But the blue discharges ruined many lives. They were reserved for ""undesirable"" men and women and were often marked ""HS"" or some other code for homosexual. This would effectively disqualify the veteran from receiving any GI rights or benefits, and it barred many discharged soldiers from getting civilian jobs. In addition, during the discharge proceedings, accused gays and lesbians were often locked away in military psychiatric wards, where psychiatrists performed experiments on them to develop new techniques for identifying other gays and lesbians. One such ""discovery"" was the ""Gag Reflex Test,"" which was said to identify a gay man by sticking a tongue depressor down his throat. If his gag reflex did not kick in, the study concluded, it was because he had performed fellatio so many times that the reflex would no longer work. These are the kinds of sick studies the government paid for to keep as many gays and lesbians out of the military as possible.

After World War II ended, life returned to ""normal"" in many ways. Women were forced from the job market in great numbers and expected to return to being housewives. Men returned to civilian jobs. And gay and lesbian witch hunts resumed in the military, in greater force than ever. Without the urgent need for bodies, authorities made every effort to weed out as many homosexuals as possible. At a WAC unit in Tokyo, 500 women were discharged at once. Gay men stationed in Europe were loaded onto ""queer"" ships and sent home with dishonorable discharges. The anti-gay backlash after the war was swift and vicious.

This backlash, of course, extended to the civilian world. State legislatures cracked down on homosexuality. Congress held hearings on gays and lesbians in the government, leading to the purge known as the Lavender Scare. Gay and lesbian bars were placed under surveillance. Anti-gay crusades were launched in towns and cities across the United States. The semi-tolerance of the World War II years was short-lived indeed.

In spite of this, World War II and the ensuing anti-gay backlash had a profound impact on gay and lesbian life in America. Rural gay men and lesbians were able to leave their small towns and experience a gay and lesbian culture they never knew existed. Military life enabled many men and women to accept themselves as gay and lesbian and to devote their post-war lives to working for their rights. Among the first gay rights activists in twentieth-century America were those affected by the blue discharges. Many gay and lesbian veterans--discharged for homosexual activity or not--came out completely. Some participated in homophile organizations such as the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis. In short, the war and its semi-tolerance--as well as its more repressive side--helped solidify gay and lesbian identity. World War II spawned many gay and lesbian activists, allowed many men and women to live openly about their sexuality, and laid the groundwork for the homophile movement. It is not an exaggeration to say that the war helped lay the foundation for Stonewall and the resulting gay liberation movement. We gays and lesbians have much to owe to World War II.

The material in this diary was taken from two sources, both written by gay historian Allan Bérubé. His chapter in the edited collection Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past entitled ""Marching to a Different Drummer: Lesbian and Gay GIs in World War II"" is a useful brief overview of the subject. For a more detailed account, I wholeheartedly recommend his incredible book Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II. If you're interested in this subject, you should definitely read this book, as there is so much material that I was not able to adequately cover in this short diary."

Not going far enough for Texas Republican legislators.

The bill will also issue a $10,000 fine to any doctor who knowingly provides abortion services after 6 weeks, unless it is dubbed a medical emergency.



@DrJaneChi Cardiac cells have inherent contractility. They beat in a single cell layer in a petri dish. Personhood ain't in it. #HB59



@DrJaneChi At six weeks, the embryonic ""heart"" is a hollow tube one cell layer thick. #HB59

This subchapter is not enforceable until the 91st day after the date of publication in the Texas Register of a finding of fact made by the attorney general that:

(1) the United States Supreme Court has issued a decision overruling Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973);

(2) any other state or federal court has issued an order or judgment restoring, expanding, or clarifying the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion under the United States Constitution; or

(3) an amendment to the United States Constitution that restores, expands, or clarifies the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion has been adopted.

That didn't take long. The very same day that Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a sweeping anti-abortion bill that would close most of the state's clinics, forcing many women to travel hundreds of miles for care, Republican legislators introduced an even more restrictive anti-abortion bill . The new bill would ban abortion from the moment something resembling a fetal heartbeat could be detected, usually at six weeks. It has teeth, too:Here's something to know about ""fetal heartbeat"":If passed—and there's limited time in the current special session of the Texas legislature to do that— the bill wouldn't go into effect right away:The big question there is what (2) means, because the Supreme Court overturning Roe is a very different thing than ""any other state or federal court"" saying a six-week ban is fine.

Regardless of whether this bill is passed and, if passed, when it would go into effect, it's clear that Texas Republicans are not done—closing most of the clinics in the state and banning abortion after 20 weeks was not enough for them when it comes to restricting women's right and access to abortion."

Pelosi said Edward Snowden broke the law%2C called for balance between security and privacy

Pelosi argued Obama%27s approach to surveillance was an improvement over Bush%27s policies

She was the keynote speaker at the event

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has disappointed some of her liberal base with her defense of the Obama administration's classified surveillance of U.S. residents' phone and Internet records.

Some of the activists attending the annual Netroots Nation political conference Saturday booed and interrupted the San Francisco Democrat when she commented on the surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency and revealed by a former contractor, Edward Snowden, The San Jose Mercury News reports.

The boos came when Pelosi said that Snowden had violated the law and that the government needed to strike a balance between security and privacy.

As she was attempting to argue that Obama's approach to citizen surveillance was an improvement over the policies under President George W. Bush, an activist, identified by the Mercury News as Mac Perkel of Gilroy, stood up and tried loudly to question her, prompting security guards to escort him out of the convention hall.

""Leave him alone!"" audience members shouted. Others yelled ""Secrets and lies!,"" ''No secret courts!"" and ""Protect the First Amendment!,"" according to the Mercury News.

Perkel told the newspaper that he thinks Pelosi does not fully understand what the NSA is up to.

Several others in the audience walked out in support of Perkel.

""We're listening to our progressive leaders who are supposed to be on our side of the team saying it's OK for us to get targeted"" for online surveillance, said Jana Thrift of Eugene, Ore. ""It's crazy. I don't know who Nancy Pelosi really is.""

Netroots Nation is an organizing and training convention for progressive political leaders. Pelosi was Saturday's keynote speaker at the event, which opened Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center and was scheduled to conclude Sunday.

Her remarks criticizing the Republican majority in the House and encouraging powerful women brought applause, cheers and laughs."

The text of the decision, ordering an expedited hearing of the appeal itself.:



This is an appeal from a district court order concluding that Utah’s prohibition on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional as a violation of due process and equal protection.

Defendants-Appellants seek a stay pending appeal and a temporary stay while the court considers the stay request. Plaintiffs-Appellees have filed a response. A stay pending appeal is governed by the following factors: (1) the likelihood of success on appeal; (2) the threat of irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; (3) the absence of harm to opposing parties if the stay is granted; and (4) any risk of harm to the public interest. Homans v. City of Albuquerque, 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir.2001); 10th Cir. R. 8.1. The first two factors are the most critical, and they require more than a mere possibility of success and irreparable harm, respectively. Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 434-35 (2009).

A record number of women and racial minorities were elected to the 113th Congress, which was sworn in Thursday. Among them was the first Buddhist to join the Senate, as well as the first Hindu and the first openly bisexual woman in the House.

House Democrats became the first caucus in the history of either chamber not to have a majority of white men. It was a watershed moment for the Democratic Party, which has adopted diversity as one of its chief selling points and has marketed itself as the party that looks more like a fast-changing United States.

“It was a decision,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview about boosting the number of Democratic women in Congress. “We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to try to expand the number. We made a decision for women to help women, and also for the Democrats as a party to help recruit women and help fund campaigns.”

The overwhelming majority of lawmakers sworn in Thursday were white men. But the new Congress, while still lagging behind the nation as whole in diversity, reflects national demographic changes that hold significant implications for American politics.

Democrats think those changes­ give them a distinct political advantage in a nation in which whites make up a smaller part of the electorate. It also opens new avenues of fundraising to support their campaigns.

View Graphic Find out all about the new faces in the 113th congress — sort by state, party, gender and chamber and see who was elected where and why.

Republicans, too, see the value of diversity and have sought to highlight changes in the GOP. When Jim DeMint (S.C.) recently stepped down from the Senate, for instance, he was replaced by Tim Scott, giving Republicans a chance to claim the only African American in the Senate. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), a Cuban American, also became an instant star among Republicans when he was elected.

Overall, though, Republicans have struggled to diversify their ranks, and the party was criticized after the presidential election for mainly appealing to an older, whiter coalition. Whether the GOP will adjust its positions to lure more votes from an increasingly diverse electorate is a key question likely to play out in the new Congress.

The Democratic diversity was on display Thursday during the vote for House speaker. Pelosi beamed as dozens of women and minorities called out her name as their choice over Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who was narrowly elected by the Republican majority. Twice, her name was read aloud in Spanish.

For Pelosi, the moment probably paled in comparison to the day six years ago when she, in her words, “broke the marble ceiling” and was elected the nation’s first female speaker.

But for Pelosi, 72, who was one of 23 female lawmakers when she was first elected 25 years ago, Thursday had different rewards. Maybe no Democrat has been more central to the party’s diversity push than she has.

The House has 81 women, 61 of them Democrats. The Senate includes 20 women — still just a fifth of the chamber but an achievement striking enough that ABC News gathered the group together for a joint interview that aired on Thursday night.

The contrast between the two parties has been stark in recent weeks.

A look at the 113th Congress (Sources: Staff reports)

When Republicans first circulated a list of their committee chairmen for the 113th Congress, showing that every committee would be headed by a white man, Pelosi’s office quickly followed up with a flier with photos of the ranking Democrats on the panels.

Half of top Democrats on committees are minorities or women. In the debate that followed, Boehner named Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) to chair the House Administration Committee, a panel on which she had not served.

“The more diversity of opinion at the table, the more consensus you can build, the more sustainability of the solutions, and the more respect it commands,” Pelosi said of her efforts to advance women and minorities into leadership.

There will be now be 42 African Americans in the House and one in the Senate — Scott, the first black Republican in the Senate since 1979.

Two of the Senate’s three Hispanics will be Republicans (Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida). Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) is a Democrat.

But of the 29 Latinos in the House, 24 are Democrats. In opening-day speeches to the House by Pelosi and Boehner, only the Democratic leader mentioned the need for comprehensive immigration reform, to a standing ovation from Democrats and temperate applause from a handful of Republicans.

Democrats see tangible political advantages in their diversity.

“Part of our happiness is that we know the wind’s behind us,” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (Ariz.), explaining enthusiasm from Democrats on Thursday. “Obama’s victory is owed to that demographic, and you see more of that happening here, especially in our party. And you’re going to see more of it going forward.”

Meanwhile, the spirit among Republicans — who are still smarting from a divisive vote late Tuesday for legislation that will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans — was more muted.

For Pelosi, the growing number of female lawmakers has been a source of particular pride. The gains came in a year when Democrats campaigned aggressively on women’s issues.

“We’re a little past the time where people are pioneers,” Pelosi said. “We’re not just going out there and saying we want women to vote for us. We’re saying we want to give women a seat at the table, and you know what? A seat at the head of the table.”

Half of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “red to blue” candidates, recruited to run in competitive districts that Republicans held, were women. Pelosi hosted women’s fundraising lunches nationwide and ultimately saw the number of Democratic women expand, even in a year when Republican numbers dropped from 24 to 20.

“She was tireless. She would do four events in a day,” said newly elected Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), an Iraq war veteran who took a position of honor next to Pelosi during a class photo of Democratic women taken on the Capitol steps on Thursday. “We were working hard. But she was working just as hard around the country for us.”

The women say their increased numbers could inject civility into a bitter and gridlocked process.

“By and large, they understand that extremism — whether it’s on women’s issues or fiscal issues — we’re not going to make progress if they’re on the far ends, the fringe,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who was reelected in November after her Republican opponent claimed that pregnancies rarely result from “legitimate rape.”

“We’ve got to find that middle where we can all be a little unhappy, but we can actually get something done,” she said.

USA TODAY

Dr. King%27s ringing%2C rhythmic speech brought tears to my eyes.

The speech reinforced the themes that drove Dr. King%27s work.

Dr. King%27s vivid language forced white Americans to see the issue in both moral and personal terms.

Most of us who are old enough remember exactly where we were on Aug. 28, 1963. I watched the March on Washington unfold on national television from a reclining chair in the den of my house in Hot Springs, Ark. Dr. King's ringing, rhythmic speech brought tears to my eyes, and I remember thinking that, when it was over, my country would never be the same.

By late August, the summer of 1963 had already been a memorable one for me; I'd turned 17, and I'd shaken hands with President Kennedy during a Boys Nation event at the White House.

Personal commitment

But the march and the speech had an even more profound impact on me and millions of others all across the country who felt a deeper, more personal commitment to racial equality and justice than they ever had before.

The speech reinforced the themes that drove Dr. King's work: that we are bound together in an inescapable web of ""mutuality,"" and, whether we like it or not, when basic human rights and economic security are denied to some of us, we all suffer; that true equality and justice can best be achieved through determined, non-violent action, as Gandhi demonstrated; and that building a world of shared opportunities and responsibilities requires us to reconcile with our adversaries to create an inclusive community.

'Jobs and Freedom'

The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom — its full name — was a demand for both racial equality and economic justice. ""We're in this together,"" rather than ""You're on your own,"" meant that all Americans willing to work hard should have a chance to build a decent life together in what Georgia Rep. John Lewis — who as a young man marched alongside Dr. King that day — describes in his wonderful memoir as ""the beloved community.""

John Lewis must have felt one step closer to his beloved community when he and other Freedom Riders were welcomed back to Montgomery, Ala., this spring, where 52 years ago they had been abused and beaten while attempting to desegregate the interstate bus system.

In 1961, the Montgomery police refused to protect the Freedom Riders from the mob. In 2013, Police Chief Kevin Murphy not only apologized on behalf of his predecessors, he presented John with a medal from his own uniform.

Seeing anew

Dr. King's vivid language — the longing to see ""the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners sit down together at the table of brotherhood,"" to see his four children judged ""not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"" — forced white Americans to see the issue in both moral and deeply personal terms.

Like Lincoln's second inaugural address, the ""I Have a Dream"" speech lives on as a hymn to the ""better angels of our nature,"" its words still inspiring and spoken by children whose parents were not even born then.

God willing, their grandchildren will also be inspired and moved to become better and bigger because of what was said and done on that distant summer day.

Attorney General Eric Holder, a political lightning rod for Republican critics of the Obama administration, is under fire for two cases involving secret subpoenas or searches for phone records and other information of journalists involved in reports about leaked classified information.

1. What’s the problem?

In the first case, the Justice Department last year obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press as part of a probe that the news service said was focused on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012.

The second case involves subpoenas and search warrants in 2010 to obtain phone records, e-mails and security badge tracking of a Fox News correspondent who reported on classified intelligence about North Korea in 2009.

Leak probe notification called into question

Members of the press and critics led by Republican foes of Holder complained the covert surveillance amounted to targeting journalists as potential criminals, which would chill investigative reporting and potentially violate First Amendment rights of a free press.

Lawmakers question whether Holder gave false testimony

Shield law might have kept feds from prying

In the investigation of leaks to the AP, employees of the news service were never singled out as potential criminals.

However, the affidavit for a search warrant in the Fox case included an FBI agent’s statement that a network reporter – later identified as James Rosen – could potentially be an “aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” to the crime of disclosing secret information.

In addition, Justice Department officials confirmed that Holder took part in “discussions” about seeking the search warrant.

The Justice Department did not prosecute Rosen, nor did it file charges against him. While he was listed as a “co-conspirator,” that often does not mean he would be considered a target.

Last week, President Barack Obama ordered Holder to review government practices in investigating leaks of secret information.

Obama wants review of leaks probe

His administration has been more aggressive in probing classified leaks than those of his predecessors, but Obama said he was “troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.”

Some Republicans complained that Holder’s involvement meant he would be reviewing himself, due to the affidavit that said he took part in discussions on a search warrant of Rosen’s phone records and emails.

Choice of Holder to lead leak review questioned

2. What are the latest developments?

On Wednesday, the GOP leaders of the House Judiciary Committee sent Holder a letter asking for further information about whether he lied to Congress when he said at a May 15 hearing that he never took part in any “potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material.”

“… That is not something that I have ever been involved in, heard or, or would think would be wise policy,” Holder said in response to questioning by Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia on possible use of the Espionage Act to prosecute members of the news media for publishing classified information.

The letter to Holder from committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin noted that the affidavit for the search warrant for Rosen’s phone, e-mail and security badge information only became public after the May 15 hearing.

They questioned whether Holder’s response to Johnson’s question amounted to lying under oath because of subsequent media reports that the Justice Department confirmed Holder took part in discussions on seeking a search warrant.

“How can you claim to have never even heard of’ the potential prosecution of the press but were, at a minimum, involved in discussions regarding Mr. Rosen?” asked the letter by Goodlatte and Sensenbrenner.

While Holder was asked about the AP case at the May 15 committee hearing, the issue of the Fox reporter never came up.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the Fox case, and therefore it was “self-evident” that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was “inaccurate.”

Implying that Republicans were playing politics, Carney said reporters should “be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true.” Pressed further, he added that reporters were “conflating a subpoena with prosecution.”

Asked if Obama still had full confidence in the attorney general, Carney replied: “He absolutely does, yes.”

On Tuesday, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said Holder “was forthright and did not mislead the committee” on May 15.

“Certainly, there are policy disagreements as to how the First Amendment should apply to these series of leak investigations being conducted by the Justice Department and that is and should be an area for the committee to consider,” Conyers said in a statement. “However, there is no need to turn a policy disagreement into allegations of misconduct.”

Meanwhile, a Justice Department official said Wednesday that Holder will meet with officials from media organizations this week as part of his review of how the federal government handles leak investigations.

The meetings with chiefs of Washington bureaus will begin Thursday and include representatives from newspapers, wire services, radio and television broadcasters, and online organizations, the official said.

3. What’s the background?

With an eye toward the 2014 congressional elections and the 2016 presidential campaign, Republicans are trying to depict the Obama administration as rife with scandals.

These include the two cases involving Holder as well as IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points about the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack.

Benghazi: GOP digs in for long haul

Like many attorneys general, Holder has been a focus of political attacks throughout Obama’s White House tenure.

In particular, conservative Republicans have taken aim at Holder over efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, a decision to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, and the handling of the botched “Fast and Furious” gun-walking program.

At the same time, Holder has been praised by Obama and liberals for taking a lead role on socially progressive issues such as gay marriage and immigration.

Last year, House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California led a GOP effort to cite Holder for contempt of Congress in a dispute over documents the panel sought in the “Fast and Furious” investigation.

Issa and other Republicans said Holder refused to turn over requested documents necessary for a full inquiry of the program in which federal agents allowed illegal weapons sales across the border with Mexico, then lost track of the firearms.

Holder maintained the House contempt vote boycotted by most Democrats amounted to political theater, and he recently criticized Issa for what he called a pattern of incomplete or misleading statements.

“It is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress,” Holder said at the May 15 hearing of the judiciary panel that includes Issa. “It is unacceptable and it is shameful.”

4. What does Holder have to say?

At the May 15 hearing, Holder testified under oath that he had recused himself from the AP case because he had previously been questioned regarding who knew what about the classified leak. Therefore, he said, he had no role in last year’s decision by Deputy Attorney General James Cole to seek the secret subpoena of AP phone records.

Holder has yet to comment specifically on Rosen’s case. On Tuesday, he told reporters he was “not satisfied” with some federal guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters.

“We’re going to have a real frank, good conversation about this,” Holder said. “And I think, we’re going to make some changes because I’m not satisfied with where we are.”

5. What happens now?

There will be more congressional hearings and investigations, more political rancor and the possibility of some fallout if further disclosures reveal Holder knowingly misled Congress or inappropriately concealed information.

His defiance in the face of the House contempt citation indicates Holder won’t voluntarily step down unless pressured to do so by Obama, who has steadfastly maintained confidence in him.

The question will be whether Holder becomes a liability for the president.

If the multiple controversies (IRS targeting, Benghazi, reporters phone records) continue to dominate the political discussion, Obama could decide a drastic gesture is needed to try to move past a climate of crises. However, nothing at this point suggests that is imminent or under consideration.

The event, first announced in January, is being organized by the American Muslim Political Action Committee (AMPAC), a fringe group led by M.D. Rabbi Alam, a professed 9/11 truther who has pushed controversial anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the attacks. Last year, he made a failed bid for Missouri’s secretary of state, and his group has been doing little besides trying to attract national attention ever since.

AMPAC was finally successful on Thursday, when Breitbart News reported on the event, calling it ""tasteless"" and including an unrelated picture of hundreds of Muslims praying in front of the Capitol. Fox News later broke from their coverage of the violent military crackdown in Egypt, which has left nearly 600 dead and thousands injured, to give viewers an ""alert"" on the so-called ""Million Muslim March,"" and going so far as to note that the total supporters of the event could currently be counted on two hands. A Facebook page for the ""Million Muslim March"" -- which previously showed less than 10 people planning to attend -- had been taken down by the time of publish.

Organizers of the ""Million Muslim March"" have defended the timing of their event by noting that ""Muslim[s] and Non Muslim[s] alike were traumatized"" on Sept. 11, 2001. True, but beneath the group's insistence that the march will be about civil rights, indefinite detention, and ""slanderous"" statements about Islam, lies a toxic strain of trutherism. That fact led Corey Saylor, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to tell U.S. News last month that CAIR would definitely not support the event.

Most groups and individuals have responded similarly, though the event did reportedly receive some backing last month from other truther groups and at least one Pennsylvania tea party organization.

At the time of the U.S. News report, AMPAC had even changed the title of the event to ""Million American March Against Fear,"" perhaps in an effort to get more mainstream support. The name apparently didn't catch on, however, so it looks they've since decided to revert back to the more controversial name."

“People immediately started making fun of me in their own way,” he said. ‘Why are you wasting your time? No. 1, most of them are illegal. And even if you get some to register, they never vote.’ ”

As he made inroads, Mr. Reid said he reminded Hispanics that the only way to gain political power was to vote. Through his efforts to encourage greater political participation, Mr. Reid said he developed deeper personal ties and a new affinity for the community as he regularly attended local festivals and Christmas and Cinco de Mayo celebrations.

“They were kind of fun,” he said of the events. “They had music and food and people were happy.”

When it came to the music, Mr. Reid saw a way to help. Never one to shy away from pushing an earmark through the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Reid in 2004 secured a $25,000 grant for Clark County schools in Las Vegas to begin a mariachi program. The federal spending was ridiculed by Citizens Against Government Waste as “La Pork-a-Racha,” but it was immensely popular with Hispanic students and their parents.

“That is one of the best things I have ever done in my political life,” said Mr. Reid, who still cannot help smiling about the earmark.

For Mr. Reid, the true test of growing Hispanic political might in Nevada came in 2010, when he was deemed to be in jeopardy of losing his seat.

With Nevada among the states with the highest concentration of unauthorized immigrants, Mr. Reid’s opponent, Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite, moved aggressively to undercut Mr. Reid on his immigration stance with ads and mailers that described him as “the best friend an illegal alien ever had.”"

Nebraska law requires that girls 17 or younger must have written, notarized consent from a parent or guardian in order to have an abortion. In this case, the teenager, identified only as ""Anonymous 5,"" is in foster care, but did not want to involve her foster parents out of fear that they would be so angry about her pregnancy that she could lose her placement at their home, according court documents.

A girl can bypass the consent provision in certain cases. Minors do not need parental permission in cases of medical emergencies, if they are victims of abuse, or if they can prove they are mature and well-informed enough to make the decision alone.

When she initially went before Judge Peter Bataillon in July, he ruled that she did not provide evidence she was a victim of abuse, and also ""failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she is sufficiently mature and well informed.""

However, as Slate points out, Anonymous 5 showed some pretty mature reasoning at her appeal last week.

According to court documents, she testified that she could not ""be the right mom that [she] would like to be right now"" and could not support a child financially. She also feared her foster parents would likely take out their anger not only on her, but on her child.

Finally, she pointed out that putting the baby up for adoption ""would be worse"" for her and her two siblings because of the resentment her foster parents would have towards her. The siblings, ages 7 and 9, are under the care of the same couple.

The girl's attorney, Catherine Mahern, declined to tell Omaha.com whether or not the girl, who was 10 weeks pregnant at her first hearing in July, is still pregnant. Mahern did note that there are other ways to circumvent the parental consent law, including traveling to another state.

Nebraska is one of eight states that require notarized consent for a minor to obtain an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Thirty-nine states require at least some level of parental involvement."

Ms. Garcia, 40, is an autoworker from Detroit and an American citizen. She said she and her husband, a Mexican who has been living in the United States illegally for decades, since he was 10, had spent more than $50,000 over eight years on lawyers’ fees trying to fix his immigration status, to no avail.

Speaking emotionally in the senator’s office during a brief protest, Ms. Garcia said her two children, also American citizens, live on edge, fearing they could be separated from their father at any time. She and other advocates chose to focus on Mr. Rubio because he has been a leader in talks among a bipartisan group of senators who are working to craft immigration legislation.

Steve King (R-Iowa) in 2012 that he was a huge fan, and now it turns out that the two share a knack for drawing controversial comparisons when it comes to immigration policy.

Cuccinelli made his strange remark during a radio interview in 2012. Speaking on the conservative radio show ""The Morning Majority,"" the attorney general launched into a critique of Washington, D.C.'s pest control policies, which he claimed protected rats from being killed.

""They have to relocate the rats. And, not only that, that’s actually not the worst part, they cannot break up the families of the rats!"" Cuccinelli said, incorrectly suggesting that the District’s 2010 Wildlife Protection Act forced pest control specialists to dump them across the river in Virginia.

Cuccinelli then made his comparison.

""So, anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy,"" he said. ""You can't break up rat families. Or raccoons, and all the rest, and you can't even kill 'em. It's unbelievable.""

It's unclear what Cuccinelli meant by that -- perhaps that he believes the nation's immigration policy is better because it allows for immigrant families to be broken up -- but the comments come to light as the gubernatorial candidate attempts to finesse his position on immigration reform. In the past week, he's expressed positions that make him sound like both a moderate and a hardliner on the issue, depending on the audience.

As for King, one of Cuccinelli's favorite congressmen, he recently drew widespread criticism from both sides of the aisle after suggesting that many undocumented immigrants who had been brought here as children were acting as drug mules. He said they'd developed ""calves the size of cantaloupes"" from their illicit work.

King has been one of the most rigid opponents of immigration reform efforts over the past years, a stance that he's developed not just through legislative efforts, but also through divisive comments he's made about immigrants themselves. He recently was forced to explain remarks he made in 2012 in which he compared immigrants to dogs."

WASHINGTON -- Moderate Democrats working to gather support from Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform sent an ultimatum Friday to Speaker John Boehner: introduce a bill by Sept. 30 or they'll introduce their own.

""[W]e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess,"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition, a 53-member group, including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).

""Therefore, we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship, helps grow American jobs, and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th, we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill,"" the letter continues. Read the letter here.

Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform, if Boehner would allow for a vote, by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans.

Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess, a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year.

Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead, House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills, such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship, though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language.

The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

“We have the support of the American people,"" it concludes. ""We hope we can count on your support."""

The former Florida governor has a new book on immigration

Some politicians are unhappy with his comments

He previously said Republicans were alienating Hispanic voters

WASHINGTON -- Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is angering Democrats and some in his own party over his opposition to allowing illegal immigrants to attain U.S. citizenship, a stance he reveals in his new book on immigration.

In the 2012 presidential campaign Bush said that the GOP was being ""tone deaf"" on the issue of illegal immigration and what to do about it, saying the Republicans were alienating Hispanic voters.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney did not favor amnesty for the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. He supported securing the border and improving the ability of businesses to know whether a job applicant was an illegal immigrant, which he said would reduce the number of illegal immigrants who ""self-deport"" because there would be no work for them here.

GOP primary contender Herman Cain suggested, among other things, building a moat on the border to keep people from entering the country illegally.

At the time Bush was saying the government needed to allow illegal immigrants a chance at legal residence and U.S. citizenship. But Bush's new book Immigration Wars said he opposes granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.

In a story that appeared Monday in USA TODAY, he talked about his book and the self-inflicted wounds he thinks cost Republicans a winnable presidential race in 2012. One wound he said was the GOP's poor outreach to fast-growing demographic groups such as Hispanics that he said should be natural allies.

A ""pathway to citizenship"" is an integral part of immigration bills being considered by the White House and bipartisan groups in Congress. Bush explained that his idea is for illegal immigrants who came to the country as adults to attain a level of legal status. But he said that it should not be full U.S. citizenship, arguing that ""those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship.""

The idea is one that has been floated in conservative circles as a way to solve the thorny issue of illegal immigration: recognize that millions of illegal immigrants will not leave nor should they be forced to leave, but at the same time do not reward them for breaking U.S. immigration laws.

The Florida Democratic Party said Bush's credibility on immigration has ""vanished."" Senate President Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Bush ""made a fool of himself.""

""Poor Jeb Bush. So far from God and so close to the Tea Party,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. ""This is why things are the way they are, because Republicans let themselves be bullied by the most extreme members of their party.""

Republican members of the bipartisan Senate group working on an immigration overhaul bill with Democrats were not pleased with Bush's comments. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Bush's stance ""undercuts what we're trying to do."" Another member of the group, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he was ""a bit perplexed"" and ""disappointed"" to learn of Bush's approach.

Flake has said that he opposes ""blanket amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. But because of the different components of the bill they are working on with Democrats -- including added border security and a requirement that all U.S. businesses check the immigration status of prospective workers -- Flake and other Republicans in the group agreed to Democrats' priority of granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.

Bush -- the son of one president, brother of another and a possible contender himself for the 2016 race -- took to the airwaves Monday to promote his book and defend his position.

On the Today Show he said many illegal immigrants don't want citizenship and that granting it to those who do want it could open the door for future waves of illegal immigrants.

""Our proposal is a proposal that looks forward. And if we want to create an immigration policy that's going to work, we can't continue to make illegal immigration an easier path than legal immigration,"" Bush told host Matt Lauer, alluding to immigrants who apply legally to come to the United States and often wait several years for citizenship. ""I think it's important that there is a natural friction between our immigrant heritage and the rule of law.""

On MSNBC he suggested he may agree to citizenship or illegal immigrants here already if it was part of a package that sufficiently reduced the magnets for future illegal immigrants.

""If you can craft that in law where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn't an incentive for people to come illegally, I'm for it, I don't have a problem with that,"" Bush told host Joe Scarborough. ""I don't see how you do it, but I'm not smart enough to figure out every aspect of a really complex law."""

Hours after voting rights advocates were hailing Monday’s Supreme Court decision, officials indicated that Arizona will take advantage of a provision in the ruling allowing the state to seek to continue requiring the added documentation while it appeals to a federal agency. In effect, the Supreme Court’s ruling, which was viewed as a step forward in national voter registration law, could have a less of an immediate impact within the state.

“The next step is going to the EAC,” Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne said of the federal Elections Assistance Commission, the agency that developed the federal form. After that agency, the state can go back to the courts where the state believes it can win and get to keep the requirement of added documentation on citizenship, Horne said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.

“The state form will not change, only the federal form,” Matthew Roberts, director of communications for Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, said in a telephone interview. Roberts said officials will continue distributing the Arizona form, which is used for about 95% of all voter registration. Only about 5% of the registrations come via the federal form, he said.

The decision by state officials was expected since Arizona has been fighting for the tougher requirements for years. Local advocates, however, had earlier said they hoped to work with the state to revise the Arizona registration form in light of the Supreme Court ruling.

“We certainly hope our election officials would not continue to fight this,” said Sam Wercinski, executive director of the Arizona Advocacy network, one of the groups involved in seeking to overturn the Arizona citizenship requirements. “This is a very clear decision,” he said in a conference call by several groups involved in the case.

Earlier Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it had had thrown out Arizona’s requirement that a prospective voter show proof of citizenship. It ruled against Arizona, 7-2, in Arizona vs. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona Inc. The court said that the state policy, approved by voters as Proposition 200 in 2004, was at odds with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “motor voter” law.

The federal law was designed to increase participation, particularly among minorities, by making it more convenient for people to sign up to vote by filling out a form when getting a driver’s license, for example. On the federal form, the applicant has to swear that he is a citizen under penalty of perjury. But Arizona went one step further, requiring proof of citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate.

Advocates sued, arguing that the federal form didn’t require such documentation and should be the standard. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that National Voter Registration Act is the controlling law rather than Proposition 200. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court.

Federal law “precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself,” Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court’s majority. In his ruling, however, Scalia said the state could continue to make a case before the federal agency and depending on that ruling, again appeal to the courts.

“I think the court has given us a clear path to victory,” Atty. Gen. Horne said. He argued that the court affirmed the right of states to set their own standards for voting.

Opponents of the Arizona law said they see it as an effort to limit participation by minorities and immigrants. In the conference call, they said more than 31,000 potential voters were blocked from registering. Voter registration through community-based drives dropped by 44% in Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa, according to Maldef, the Latino civil rights group.

“We don’t think it will be successful,” Nina Perales, Maldef’s vice president for litigation, said of Arizona’s continuing effort to fight for its law. She argued that the state had a chance to provide documentation that the added requirements were needed, but had failed to do so.

“Proposition 200 was a new starting point in the war on voters in Arizona,” Wercinski said.

“Individuals want to register and vote,” he said during the conference call. “Opponents have tried to increase barriers over and over again.... When people register they will vote.”

For groups opposed to the Arizona law, including the ACLU and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Monday’s ruling was major step forward.

“Today’s decision is a significant victory for U.S. citizens and their ability to register to vote without burdensome requirements,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “In our democracy, if you don’t vote, you don’t count, and the Arizona law was a blatant effort to keep some citizens from making their voice heard in our elections.”

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/25/barack-obama-hecklers-immigration_n_4338945.html,2013-11-25 00:00:00,['Deputy Enterprise Editor'],Obama Confronts Hecklers At Immigration Speech,"WASHINGTON -- Hecklers interrupted President Barack Obama during a speech on Monday to demand he halt deportations, which have risen to record levels during his time in the White House.

""Our families are separated,"" a young man yelled during remarks in San Francisco at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center. ""Mr. President, please use your executive authority to halt [deportations]. We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, you have the power to stop deportations.""

""Actually, I don't,"" the president replied, ""and that's why we're here.""

Other people in the crowd began to yell as well: ""Stop deportations. Yes, we can.""

As Obama delivered a speech calling on House Republicans to press forward with immigration reform, the interruption served as a reminder that many advocates are frustrated and ready for the president to take immediate action. Most have been calling for Obama to slow or halt deportations for months or years, but as progress on legislative reform has slowed, they say there's no more time to wait. This year 1,100 people will be forced out of the country each day if removals continue at the same rate as the previous year.

Obama has said that he can't simply halt deportations by executive action, although he did so more narrowly for undocumented young people who entered the U.S. as children. He asked for the hecklers to remain in their seats, and said again that such an action would be illegal.

""What you need to know, when I'm speaking as president of the United States and I come to this community, is that if in fact I could solve all of these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" he said. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition.""

""So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" he continued. ""What I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.""

Before the interruption, the president made his pitch to the House GOP to take up immigration reform to deal with a number of different issues, even if they do it through a more piecemeal approach. ""It's Thanksgiving,"" he joked. ""We can carve that bird into multiple pieces.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week that immigration reform is ""absolutely not"" dead, although without answering questions about the timetable. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who previously said immigration bills won't go for votes until next year, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that reform ""is going to happen in a step-by-step method.""

But so far, it's not clear what pieces House Republicans plan to include. While there are already proposals on border security, high-skilled worker visas and interior enforcement, the GOP has not put any bills on the table to give legal status to undocumented immigrants. House Democrats, joined by three Republicans, introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in October and are urging a vote, but House leadership has indicated they won't get one.

A poll released Monday from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 63 percent of Americans support allowing undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens if they meet certain criteria, while 14 percent said they should be given legal residency without a path to citizenship. Only 18 percent said all undocumented immigrants should be deported.

Obama said he hopes that Boehner will not let a small minority of immigration reform opponents block the process, and called it ""good news"" that the speaker had repeated his commitment to reform last week.

""I believe the speaker is sincere,"" he said. ""I think he genuinely wants to get it done, and that's something we should be thankful for this week.""

CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the average number of deportations per day last year. An earlier version listed the daily figure as the total for the year."

Penalty is up to six months in jail and %241%2C000 fine

Revenge porn is a growing problem in age of social media

American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill on free speech grounds

SACRAMENTO, California (AP) — California Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible jail time for people who post naked photos of their exes after bitter breakups.

Senate Bill 255, which takes effect immediately, makes it a misdemeanor to post identifiable nude pictures of someone else online without permission with the intent to cause emotional distress or humiliation. The penalty is up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

""Until now, there was no tool for law enforcement to protect victims,"" the bill's author, Sen. Anthony Cannella, said in a statement. ""Too many have had their lives upended because of an action of another that they trusted.""

Cannella, a Republican, has said revenge porn is a growing problem in the age of social media, when photos and videos that were made privately during a relationship can find their way onto hundreds of websites.

Before the criminal law was enacted, California allowed victims to sue their virtual assailants, but that is an expensive and time-consuming option.

The American Civil Liberties Union had opposed the bill, arguing it might restrict free speech rights, which has been a concern in other states as well.

Florida lawmakers rejected a similar bill this year after constitutional free speech concerns surfaced there. Last year, the Missouri Supreme Court cited concerns about free speech in striking down part of a 2008 law enacted after a teenager who was teased online committed suicide."

Schumer, awakened from a nap in his office, bounded to the Senate floor, staff in tow. It was approaching 2 a.m. The New Yorker joined fellow Democratic Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who was presiding wearily over an almost empty chamber.

The two senators and six others, Republicans and Democrats, had finished writing the most comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in a generation. Now the bill was ready to be introduced.

“I would like to thank everybody ... who worked so hard on this great legislation whose voyage begins now,” Schumer said.

On the marble stairs outside the chamber, the senators and bleary-eyed staff who had brokered the deal gathered around. They gave a thumbs-up. It was a picture-perfect moment.

That unity will be tested this week as the Senate opens debate on the historic bill and the eight senators face the sobering task of bringing more colleagues on board.

Immigration reform has eluded Congress in the decades since President Reagan signed the last substantial overhaul. But this time may be different. Top Republicans have begun to join Democrats in supporting a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.

With a vote to start debate set for Tuesday, the legislation faces a gantlet of amendments that could attract needed Republicans or upset the delicate balance celebrated that night on the Senate steps.

“Look, I always thought there were land mines along here, and you just got to go through them,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who led the last failed attempt at immigration reform and is one of the key players in this one. “It’s not a smooth path.”

Advertisement

The bill has so far threaded past those land mines. How the bill’s authors handled them illustrates their determination to succeed as well as the risks that they could fail.

Border security has long been a partisan battleground.

Advertisement

Republicans want an impermeable southern border to prevent illegal entries; Democrats view that as an unrealistic goal that will stall other changes, including the path to citizenship for those lacking proper papers.

One crucial Republican in the bipartisan group, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has never been completely satisfied with the border security agreement he worked out with the other senators.

Advertisement

The night before the bill was introduced in April, Rubio and his staff met with an influential critic. Chris Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a federal immigration and customs officers union, was told to come alone.

As written, the legislation provides $4.5 billion for more drones, 3,500 customs officers and a double-layer fence in some areas along the border, with the goal of stopping 90% of illegal entries. Once the plan is in place, immigrants who pay fines, work and learn English will be eligible in 10 years for permanent legal status. After 13 years, they can become citizens.

Advertisement

Crane had blasted the senators for not consulting his union. He believed the deal was riddled with loopholes that would prevent agents from deporting immigrants in the country unlawfully.

In Rubio’s office, along with a handful of staffers and Rubio, Crane argued for an enhanced exit system with biometric screening, such as checking the fingerprints of foreign travelers. About 40% of those in the country illegally stayed on expired visas.

Advertisement

Rubio mentioned that his fingerprints are scanned when he visits Disney World.

At Rubio’s urging, the Judiciary Committee added a provision that would launch a pilot biometric exit program at 30 of the nation’s busiest airports.

Advertisement

Senators are now seriously considering a proposal from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to expand the exit system to all airports; opponents point out that the cost would be enormous.

Cornyn is just the type of Republican the bill’s authors want to bring on board. He’s a border-state senator familiar with the problems of the immigration system and sensitive to the growing Latino electorate. The chamber’s No. 2 Republican, he would provide momentum not just in the Senate, but in the House, where the conservative majority has been cool to the effort.

Advertisement

But some Democrats wonder if Cornyn is just dangling the possibility of support. He wants an additional $1 billion a year for more drones, 10,000 officers and other equipment. That is a nonstarter for Democrats and raises alarms for deficit hawks.

“It’s such an un-Republican idea to throw money at a problem,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the bill’s authors. “We’re not going to be able to add billions and billions of dollars in cost unless you can justify and find a way to pay for it.”

Advertisement

In exchange for the path to citizenship, deals were cut to stem future illegal immigration by dramatically expanding guest-worker programs, including for farm laborers and highly skilled professionals.

But these compacts reached in backroom talks between business and labor have come under fire from opponents who say they taint the bill, which has grown from 844 pages to 1,077.

Advertisement

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is leading the Republican opposition, said, “I’m not sure that’s the right thing to do … to have some secret agreement reached with a group of people we hardly know trump the ability to do the right thing for the American people.”

One of those deals, for a new visa for low-skill jobs such as maids and gardeners, proved so volatile it almost blew up the immigration overhaul. And it remains a top roadblock in the House.

Advertisement

Senate Democrats also have demands that could torpedo the bill. Among the most fraught is their desire to allow gay Americans to obtain visas for foreign-born spouses, as heterosexual couples can.

The measure would keep a promise to gay rights advocates, but chase off Republican votes.

Democrats hope the Supreme Court will make that issue moot by striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act this month. If it doesn’t, they will face an agonizing choice.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/01/Exclusive-US-Civil-Rights-Commissioner-Amnesty-would-violate-blacks-civil-rights,2013-09-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Exclusive-US Civil Rights Commissioner: Amnesty Means Special, Not Equal, Treatment","Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, told Breitbart News that Attorney General Eric Holder’s claims that amnesty for illegal immigrants is a civil rights issue “profoundly ahistorical.”

“If you take a look at the basis of the civil rights movement, it was to have blacks treated in all respects the same as whites or everybody else,” Kirsanow (pictured) said in a phone interview. “What amnesty is doing is setting aside a special class of individuals who are going to put forward and treated more favorably than others. In other words, they’ve already broken the law and are being given amnesty.

“In terms of immigration policy… it would severely affect the rights of blacks generally and all low-income Americans. What it is going to do is displace those individuals from the labor market.”

The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Kirsanow said, has held extensive hearings in recent years detailing how amnesty would economically impact American workers, especially the black community.

“We had a hearing before the Civil Rights Commission on the effects of illegal immigration on black employment levels, both wage levels and unemployment rates,” Kirsanow said. “What we had were a number of experts from just about every sphere you can think of: business, academia and immigration experts in general. They spanned the ideological spectrum. We had individuals from the far left, individuals in the middle, individuals on the right.

“They disagreed in some respects about certain policy prescriptions but they were unanimous in their conclusion, backed by copious amounts of data,” he recalled, “that illegal immigration had a deleterious effect on the wage and employment levels of black Americans. And it’s not a small effect. It’s a clearly sizable effect.”

Kirsanow and some of his fellow U.S. Commission on Civil Rights members have pushed for members of Congress and key political figures in the national immigration debate like President Barack Obama himself to address these issues, but they have ignored the calls thus far.

“What’s interesting is those who have described themselves as the champions of civil rights are doing enormous damage to the ranks of black Americans by supporting and shepherding through comprehensive immigration reform that does nothing to control the borders, that grants amnesty and is going to create a legal population of individuals who are going to undercut the employment and wage prospects for low income Americans, generally, and specifically black Americans and more specifically black males,” he asserted.

Kirsanow questions who the lawmakers in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the political aisle are really representing, given that they have not substantively discussed the issue in their legislative deliberations. “I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee back in April on immigration reform on the same thing that we’re talking about right now,” he stated. “What was amazing is the number of senators who were either cavalier about it or they gave grudging acknowledgment to the fact that ‘yeah, there’s a possibility that there might be some dislocation to American workers as a result of illegal immigration’ and then just kind of moved on.

“The question I have is: Who do they represent? They are United States Senators. They represent Americans, presumably. Yet, what they’re proposing is they’re going to have a decided negative effect on Americans. What reason? What? Who do they represent? Do they represent illegal immigrants? Or do they represent lawful Americans? And that’s a question that needs to be posed to them.”

Kirsanow was originally one of only three witnesses who were going to be called to testify on the immigration situation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He; GOP establishment figure Doug Holtz-Eakin of American Action Forum (AAF), a group advocating in favor of amnesty; and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were going to be the only ones who testified were it not for public outcry about the rushed process.

Originally, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Senate Democratic Party leadership were not even going to call any hearings. “On a matter this large, it is an insult to the American people that only three people were going to testify regardless of how knowledgeable they may be about the subject matter,” Kirsanow said. “This is such a complex matter that they needed perspectives from so many different places. What we had was a bill that was gigantic. It was almost the size of Obamacare and yet it was released barely 36 hours before our testimony.

“In other words, we were testifying in an information vacuum on a momentous piece of legislation. Only after there was a bit of hue and cry did Senate leadership understand that they needed to open up the testimony to more witnesses.”

Kirsanow and others members of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission have written letters on this matter to President Obama and to Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), among other lawmakers, and they have received no response. Similarly, advocates opposed to amnesty like Leah Durant have written letters to members like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, raising these same concerns–which have gone ignored, as well.

Kirsanow said that while there are likely a number of reasons why members of the Congressional Black Caucus have ignored this real threat to their constituents, he thinks the most prevailing is that President Barack Obama, America’s first black president, is pushing the policy so they have no ability to stand up to him politically.

“I have asked them why they are not standing up for the needs of their constituents,” Kirsanow said. “We’ve sent these letters to Marcia Fudge. We’ve sent them to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Radio silence. Complete radio silence.”

“I wish reporters asked members of the Congressional Black Caucus what the heck they’re thinking,” he said. “They’ve not been challenged on this. One of the dynamics at play is the fact that we have the first black president who is in support of this. If he is in support of it, a lot of black Americans will reasonably presume that he is looking out for their best interests. So, the Congressional Black Caucus can use that as cover.

“If President Obama supports amnesty, and therefore 90 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus’ constituents will believe it’s in their best interests, those members of the Congressional Black Caucus are unlikely to be questioned by their constituents about whether it’s a good idea on that because they will have believed ‘Barack Obama looks out for my interests, it must be a good idea.'”

Kirsanow said the president is not sticking up for the black community and argued it might be because of special interests and potential future voter pools. “You know that old line, when you want to figure out why something is being done, follow the money? Well, in politics, you not only follow the money, but you follow the votes or potential votes,” he explained. “I think what a lot of sides see, both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, is this vast untapped pool of votes that they expect are going to materialize as a result of amnesty.

“Republicans don’t want to be seen as being anti-Hispanic, Democrats see this as a giant new constituency group and, so, what you’ve got I think, and I don’t know if this pertains to President Obama, but you’ve got a political class looking out for their interests. ‘I want more votes,’ as opposed to current interests of their constituents.

“I don’t necessarily want to ascribe that motive to them, but it’s as plausible and probably more rationale than anything else because I can’t figure out why it is representatives of the United States of America are doing something that is harmful to their constituents.”

While Kirsanow argues members of the political class in the black community like members of Congress and leaders of black groups like the NAACP and others do not stick up for their rank and file on this issue, he said he does get the impression many ordinary black citizens are aware of this threat to their economic well-being.

“A lot of folks do,” Kirsanow, who lives in inner-city Cleveland and used to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), said. “I was in Washington, D.C., and I also appear of black radio shows from time to time, and other radio shows, and what you get without question and what you used to get for quite some time was whenever the issue of illegal immigration came up, black callers were outraged because they feel the effects,” he declared.

“They see it with their own eyes. You get calls from people who have been displaced by illegal immigrants, people who can’t find jobs because they can’t compete against low wages offered to illegal immigrants and it’s fairly vigorous.”"

PART 1 | Immigration reform under Reagan: Twenty-seven years ago the United States implemented a plan that offered amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Hear from one of the architects of the bill and key players as they discuss where it went wrong. (The Washington Post)

A Senate panel took up amendments to a comprehensive immigration bill Tuesday and was expected to consider a proposal aimed at tightening the monitoring of foreign students in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings.

The measure, offered by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), would require the Department of Homeland Security to transfer all student visa information to border control agents at ports of entry. Aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing the amendment process, said the proposal was inspired by reports that alleged accomplices of the accused Boston bombers were living in the country on expired student visas.

In opening the committee’s session Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the panel’s chairman, said a key consideration for him in the immigration bill was that “the pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants in the United States “not be a false promise.” He called on senators to reject efforts to set up procedures that he said would be “nothing but obstacles to that goal.”

Before considering Grassley’s amendment, the committee took up changes related to border security. On a voice vote, the panel approved an amendment offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would limit the use of drones along the border with Mexico to three miles of the border in the San Diego and El Centro sectors.

The committee members then rejected 12 to 6 an amendment offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) that would have required the Homeland Security Department to implement a system to verify the entries and exits of visa holders using biometric identifiers such as fingerprints and iris scans. The amendment was aimed at reducing visa overstays, which account for an estimated 40 percent of the illegal immigrant population.

Sessions argued that his provision would force the government to obey a 1996 law that called for implementing such a biometric system. But opponents, including Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the system would be too expensive to establish in the short term. They said the immigration bill includes a provision to strengthen entry and exist verification using “biographic” data such as photographs.

Another Sessions amendment aimed at reducing the influx of legal immigrants under the legislation was defeated on a 17 to 1 vote. The senator from Alabama argued that the arrival of millions of job seekers acts to drive down wages and adversely affects U.S. citizens. Schumer and Graham said illegal immigration depresses wages much more and touted the bill’s provisions favoring “merit-based” legal immigration, which they said would better meet the needs of the economy than the current system based largely on family ties.

Immigration advocates have feared that Republicans would seize on the Boston attacks, allegedly carried out by two men who immigrated as youths with their Chechen parents, to rally opposition to the sweeping bipartisan immigration bill.

Grassley has been a leading critic of the legislation, and he cautioned last month that the Senate should move deliberately in the wake of the marathon bombings to determine potential weaknesses in the immigration system before making changes.

“Given the events of this week, it’s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,” Grassley said at a hearing in April. “How can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil? How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the U.S.? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill before us?”

The Senate Judiciary Committee began the second day of amendments shortly after 10 a.m. Last week, the committee debated 32 proposed changes to the immigration bill related to border security, adopting 21.

Leahy has said he hopes to complete the amendment process by the end of the month, potentially sending the bill to the full Senate in June. House Republican leaders are weighing whether to consider a comprehensive immigration bill or break the bill into pieces, a tactic opposed by Democrats and the White House.

At a fundraiser with Democratic donors in New York on Monday, President Obama said: “I am absolutely confident that if we stay with it, we are going to be able to get immigration reform done this year.”

The Grassley proposal will be considered along with several dozen others related to regulating the number of immigrants who are allowed to enter the United States through legal channels to seek employment, also known as “future flow.”

The proposals are a critical component of the bipartisan legislation, which aims to avoid the problems created in 1986, when Congress approved the last sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

Critics of that plan said lawmakers failed to set in place a program to meet — and adequately regulate — the demand for visas in the workplace, helping lead to a wave of illegal immigrants now estimated at 11 million.

Senate staffers familiar with Grassley’s student visa amendment described it as acceptable to the eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — who developed the legislative framework for the immigration bill. The four members of that group who serve on the Judiciary Committee are expected to support the adoption of the amendment.

The immigration bill includes provisions to add hundreds of thousands of new visas for low-skilled and high-tech workers. Senators on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to either expand or contract the visa levels proposed in the bill.

Any changes that are made by the committee could upset a pair of fragile agreements hashed out by the bipartisan coalition. On the low-skilled side, Senate negotiators worked with the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor union, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to create a new “W” visa program for up to 200,000 temporary workers in jobs such as waiters and janitors.

The program would start in 2015 with 20,000 visas and expand to 75,000 by 2019, after which a new federal bureau would make annual recommendations based on employment data. The number of visas would rise if unemployment is low and contract when it spikes, and the foreign workers would be paid salaries equivalent to American workers.

On the high-tech side, up to 180,000 visas would be available to foreign engineers and computer programmers at U.S. tech companies, which could hire up to 15 percent of their workforces under the so-called H-1B program. If companies exceed that percentage, they would have to pay the additional workers higher salaries, as well as financial penalties to the government.

Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has filed several amendments to increase the number of high-tech visas, but his amendments will not be debated until Thursday, Senate aides said. That will give the bipartisan group that developed the comprehensive bill time to negotiate over which amendments to support and which to oppose, the aides said.

http://news.yahoo.com/boy-scouts-vote-policy-toward-openly-gay-boys-194343272.html,,[],Boy Scouts vote on policy toward openly gay boys,"GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) — In one of their most dramatic choices in a century, local leaders of the Boy Scouts of America voted Thursday on whether to ease a divisive ban and allow openly gay boys to be accepted into the nation's leading youth organization.

Whether yes or no, the result will bitterly disappoint many. The decision expected Thursday evening could trigger defections among those on the losing side.

Casting ballots were about 1,400 voting members of BSA's National Council who were attending their annual meeting at a conference center not far from BSA headquarters in suburban Dallas.

At stake was a proposal drafted by the BSA's governing executive committee that says boys could no longer be excluded from Scouting solely on the basis of sexual orientation. A longstanding ban on gay adult leaders would remain in place.

Whatever the outcome, the vote will not end the wrenching debate over the Scouts' membership policy.

Some conservative churches that sponsor Scout units want to continue excluding gay youths, and in some cases have threatened to leave the BSA if the ban were lifted.

More liberal Scout leaders — while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth — have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. If the full no-gays policy is maintained, some units in liberal areas may consider either leaving the Scouts or openly defying the ban.

However the vote goes, the BSA could take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted, while many major corporate donors are likely to withhold donations if the ban remains.

In January, the BSA executive committee suggested a plan to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. However, the plan won little praise, and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community.

Story continues

Of the more than 200,000 leaders, parents and youth members who responded, 61 percent supported the current policy of excluding gays, while 34 percent opposed it. However, most parents of young Scouts, as while as youth members themselves, opposed the ban.

In the weeks leading up to the vote, and on Wednesday as National Council members arrived in Grapevine, advocacy groups on both sides of the debate organized news conferences, photo opportunities and forums to make their case.

Two conservative groups opposed to any easing of the ban — the Family Research Council and OnMyHonor.net — placed an ad Thursday in the Dallas Morning News warning that lifting the ban on gay youth would trigger lawsuits that could force the BSA to admit gay adults as well as youth. It said lifting the ban on gay boys could drive out as many as 400,000 of the Scouts' youth members.

The BSA's overall ""traditional youth membership"" — Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers — is now about 2.6 million, compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers.

Of the more than 100,000 Scouting units in the U.S., 70 percent are chartered by religious institutions. Those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays, but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban — notably the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced in April that it was satisfied with new proposal, and the National Catholic Committee on Scouting has not opposed it.

However, 50 leaders of other conservative religious groups have issued a statement imploring the National Council to retain the full ban, warning that easing it ""would open the Scouts to a wide range of open sexual expressions.""

The signatories included the leaders of the Assemblies of God, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.

The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists.

Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.

http://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-says-man-same-sex-marriage-may-233235900.html,,[],North Dakota says man in same-sex marriage may wed woman too,"By Eric M. Johnson (Reuters) - A man already married to another man in a state that permits same-sex marriage could wed a woman in North Dakota without breaking state laws, the state's top attorney has found. The finding raises potentially complex issues about Social Security and death benefits, tax exemptions and even possible prosecutions for bigamy or polygamy, said a constitutional law expert. Those issues are likely to arise more often with 16 states plus the District of Columbia now recognizing same-sex marriage while a majority of states still ban it, said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor at DePaul University's College of Law. The issue came up when a man giving only his first name called Burleigh County Recorder Debbie Kroshus in September to ask if he could marry a woman in North Dakota if he were already married to a man in another state, she said. ""I didn't ask where this caller was calling from or where he planned on getting a marriage license,"" Kroshus said in a telephone interview, adding that it was not possible to determine if the man had applied for a marriage license. The man could not get a divorce in North Dakota because of the state ban on same-sex marriage and he said the man he is married to also lives in a state that does not recognize gay marriage, Kroshus said. Kroshus asked the state's attorney from Burleigh County to seek the opinion from the attorney general. North Dakota is among the states that ban same-sex marriage by state law and state constitutional amendment. Since it would not recognize the man's same-sex marriage, he could also marry a woman in North Dakota without breaking state laws, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said in an opinion dated December 12. Stenehjem also found the man would not be committing a crime in North Dakota if he filled out the application as ""single/never married"" and declined to discuss whether he could be prosecuted for bigamy in another state if he later moved to a state that recognized same-sex marriage. Shaman said more and more people will enter into same-sex marriages and move to other states as the recognition of same-sex marriage increases. And same-sex couples, like opposite-sex couples, will part ways. ""I think there are going to be more and more of these questions,"" Shaman said in a telephone interview. The Supreme Court has found that federal law must recognize same-sex marriage in states where it is legal, but the ruling in June that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act stopped short of requiring states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states, Shaman said. ""Although this is pretty extreme in its complexity, situations like these do arise because of the nature of our country,"" Shaman said. ""We are a federation and states have authority to enact laws as they see fit."" Stenehjem referenced a part of the Defense of Marriage Act that says states need not recognize a same-sex marriage formed in another state in finding that a marriage license could be issued even if the same-sex marriage was not dissolved. The state attorney general's opinion came a day before a U.S. federal judge struck down a portion of Utah's bigamy law governing cohabitation as unconstitutional, saying it bars consenting adults from living together and criminalizes their intimate sexual relationships.

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-27/news/chi-supreme-court-gay-marriage-20130327_1_doma-case-gay-marriage-marriage-rights,2013-03-27 00:00:00,[],Supreme Court concludes arguments on marriage law,"The U.S. Supreme Court seemed to be leaning on Wednesday toward striking down a law that denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples in a move that would reflect a shift in Americans' attitudes about gay marriage.

In a second day of oral arguments on same-sex marriage, a majority of the court raised serious concerns with the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, enacted in 1996 under President Bill Clinton.

Arguments over the last two days on the DOMA case and a separate one challenging California's ban on gay marriage marked the high court's first foray into a delicate and divisive political, religious and social issue in the United States as polls indicate growing public support for same-sex marriage.

In theory, the cases have the potential for the court to take a significant step toward endorsing gay marriage as it gains support in some parts of the country. Based on the arguments, however, a partial victory for gay rights activists seems more likely than the sweeping declaration of same-sex marriage rights they had hoped for.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Supreme Court building for a second day, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote, showed a willingness to invalidate DOMA, which denies married same-sex couples access to federal benefits by defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

He warned of a ""real risk"" that the law infringes on the traditional role of the states in defining marriage.

A conservative, Kennedy is viewed as a key vote on this issue in part because he has twice authored decisions in the past that were viewed as favorable to gay rights.

In contrast to the ambivalent approach they displayed on Tuesday in arguments about California's Proposition 8 gay marriage ban, the nine justices seemed willing to address the substantive issue in the DOMA case, while also eyeing procedural questions.

The court is not expected to rule on the two cases until the end of June. If the justices were to strike down DOMA, legally married gay couples would be winners because they would have improved access to federal benefits, such as tax deductions.

Justices gave a strong indication they might resolve the Proposition 8 case on procedural grounds, but even that would be viewed as a win for gay rights activists as same-sex marriages in California would likely resume.

What appears highly unlikely is a sweeping declaration of a right for gay people to marry, a possible option only in the California case.

Overall, a majority of the justices made it clear that, while they might not impede the recent movement among some states toward gay marriage, they were not willing to pave the way either.

Nine states now recognize gay marriage, while 30 states have constitutional amendments banning it and others are in-between.

On several occasions over the two days, the justices' own remarks illustrated how quickly attitudes have changed in favor of gay marriage.

During Tuesday's arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, questioned whether there was sufficient data to show that children are not adversely affected if raised by same-sex couples. Likewise, Justice Samuel Alito noted the concept of gay marriage is ""newer than cellphones and the Internet.""

Offering a liberal perspective, Justice Elena Kagan prompted murmurs of surprise from onlookers on Wednesday when she quoted from a U.S. House of Representatives report written less than two decades ago, at the time DOMA was enacted, that referenced ""moral disapproval"" of gay marriage.

'SKIM MILK MARRIAGE'

As attention turned to DOMA on Wednesday, Kennedy made it clear where he stood, referring to DOMA as ""inconsistent"" because it purports to give authority to the states to define marriage while limiting recognition of those determinations.

His states' rights concerns were echoed by two of the liberal members of the bench, Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all about what the definition of marriage is?"" Sotomayor said.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer also raised concerns about the law.

Ginsburg stressed how important federal recognition is to any person who is legally married.

""It affects every area of life,"" she said.

Comparing marriage status with types of milk, Ginsburg said that a gay marriage endorsed by a state, but not recognized by the federal government, creates two types of marriage, ""full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage.""

If the court rules on the states' rights issue, the justices could strike down the law without deciding the bigger question of whether DOMA violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

On that issue, Kagan spoke of a ""red flag"" that indicates Congress passed DOMA with the intent of targeting a group that is ""not everyone's favorite group in the world.""

Various groups are calling for DOMA to be struck down, such as the Business Coalition for DOMA Repeal, whose members include Marriott International Inc, Aetna Inc, eBay Inc , and Thomson Reuters Corp, the corporate parent of the Reuters news agency."

The Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and a television host on MSNBC, announced that his National Action Network will hold demonstrations and prayer vigils in 100 cities across the country on Saturday. Sharpton, who has been active in supporting Martin’s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, made his announcement on NBC’s “Today” program.

Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted this last Saturday of murder charges in the shooting of Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford. Martin, an African American, was returning home from a convenience store where he had purchased Skittles and a drink.

Zimmerman, who is of Latino heritage, maintained that he had shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager suddenly attacked him.

Local officials accepted the self-defense claim but civil rights leaders did not and weeks of local and national demonstrations followed. A special state prosecutor was eventually appointed and Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder.

In the wake of the verdict, there have been demonstrations by thousands of people across the country. On Sunday, protests crossed geographic and demographic lines, from New York to Los Angeles, from Florida to Wisconsin, drawing anywhere from dozens to hundreds. In Chicago, about 200 people peacefully protested. In San Francisco and Los Angeles, police closed streets. Although the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, police in Los Angeles and New York have reported making arrests.

Much of the battle over the verdict and its meaning has been fought on cable television, which covered the trial in detail. In addition to Sharpton, other prominent leaders, including Benjamin T. Jealous, head of the NAACP, have called for further government action by the Department of Justice. The agency said over the weekend that it was restarting its investigation into the death of Martin to consider possible separate hate crime charges against Zimmerman.

Evidence is being evaluated by the criminal section of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office for the Middle District of Florida, the Justice Department said. A federal inquiry was begun shortly after the shooting but was delayed pending the resolution of the Florida charges.

Atty. Gen. Eric Holder is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the NAACP convention on Tuesday. The prominent civil rights group is meeting in Orlando, near Sanford.

Several prominent congressional representatives have called on the Department of Justice to look at the incident. On Monday, Reps. Charlie Rangel and Jerrold Nadler of New York will be among members of Congress holding a news conference to discuss the case.

Also a possibility is a civil suit against Zimmerman brought by the Martin family. The family’s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said again on Monday that he was considering a suit.

“We’ll be talking about all of that in the days to come,” Crump said on CNN’s New Day. “Right now, they are trying to make sense of this criminal verdict. As Sybrina Fulton said, we have to roll up our sleeves, because even though we’ve come a long way, we’ve got a long way to go to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else’s child, especially after this verdict.”

President Obama and religious and civil rights leaders have urged calm in hopes of ensuring peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, pastors and officials in Sanford planned a prayer service for peace.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-defeats-gop-objection-immigration-bill-162330626.html,,[],Senate defeats GOP objection to immigration bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has voted down a GOP attempt to block immigration legislation offering eventual U.S. citizenship to millions of people.

The 68-30 vote overturned a procedural objection that Republicans tried to bring against the bill.

The vote came as senators worked Wednesday to remove the remaining hurdles ahead of final passage as early as Thursday.

The vote was an indication the legislation commands the backing of well over the 60 senators needed to pass the measure and send it to the House, where an uncertain future awaits.

The White House-backed measure spends tens of billions on border security while establishing a 13-year path to citizenship for 11 million people already here illegally.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

The Senate is poised to push landmark immigration legislation across a few final hurdles ahead of passage as early as Thursday of the bill opening the door to U.S. citizenship for millions.

The legislation cleared an early procedural hurdle this week with room to spare, and more test votes were due Wednesday. The White House-backed bill would pour billions into border security and offer a path to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants now in the United States illegally.

""A permanent, commonsense solution to our dysfunctional system is really in sight,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""It is my hope that our colleagues in the House will follow the Senate's lead and work to pass bipartisan reform and do it now.""

Opponents weren't convinced.

""It continues to promote false promises that the border would be truly secure,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.

Prospects were anything but clear in the GOP-controlled House, where many conservatives oppose citizenship or even legalization for people in this country illegally. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, reiterated Wednesday that he has no plans to hold a vote on the Senate-passed immigration bill.

Story continues

""We are not going to take up the Senate bill,"" the speaker told fellow Republicans in a meeting Wednesday morning, according to Rep. John Fleming, R-La.

The House Judiciary Committee was to vote Wednesday on legislation requiring employers to verify their workers' legal status. It's the third in a series of single-issue immigration bills the committee has voted on as it takes a piecemeal approach to overhauling the nation's immigration system, in contrast with the Senate's comprehensive bill.

In the Senate, after the addition of $38 billion in provisions strengthening border security, doubling the size of the border patrol, and completing hundreds of miles of fencing, the legislation looked likely to command support from around 14 Republicans on final passage. That's more than enough to ensure the 60-vote margin needed for passage, as all 52 Democrats and the two independents who usually vote with them look likely to stick together.

As time drew short to cut any last-minute deals before final action on the bill, there was still some hope of negotiating a few final amendments that could bring even more Republicans on board.

Sen. Rob. Portman, R-Ohio, was pushing an amendment to strengthen an electronic employment verification program made mandatory in the bill. ""I can't vote for (the bill) without it,"" Portman said.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., sought changes to a new agriculture workers program that he said makes it too easy for farm workers to get permanent U.S. residency.

But the measures sought by Portman and Chambliss are being opposed by some immigrant advocacy groups, and some Senate Democrats believe the bill has enough Republican support as is without pursuing more changes."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron,2012-03-20 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],NBC's Curry Attacks Kirk Cameron's Religious Beliefs,"Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech!

Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal: to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.”

In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion.

The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD.

What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”

We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.

This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.

Newsbusters:

Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump] Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.” Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?” Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.”

Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims."

Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) has won a major battle against the politically correct left’s “War on Christmas,” he announced in a press release on Christmas Eve on Tuesday.

Since 1973, U.S. House rules made it an ethics violation for any official congressional communications to contain the phrase “Merry Christmas.” This month, after battling the system for the more than two years since he took office in 2011, Huelskamp was able to get the House to determine it will not consider use of the phrase “Merry Christmas” an ethics violation.

“For decades the PC Police have intimidated Christians throughout America with their attacks on the symbols and language of Christmas,” Huelskamp said in a statement released midday on Christmas Eve. “From nativity scenes to Christmas trees, those opposed to Christmas has sought to eradicate any reason for the season from the public square. And Congress has not been exempted.”

Huelskamp noted the history of the U.S. House’s War on Christmas before detailing how he has won this battle in the war.

“Amazingly since 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives has forbidden the use of ‘Merry Christmas’ and deemed use of such words in any official mailing or e-mail an ethics violation,” Huelskamp said. “Instead, they demanded the use of ‘Happy Holidays.’ This month, the House Franking Commission accepted the position I have fought for since arriving in Congress–ignore the PC Police and let us use ‘Merry Christmas.'”

Huelskamp added that since 2011, he has fought against the politically correct people in the U.S. Congress who implemented and still attempted to enforce this rule. “In 2011 during an interview on Fox News, I stated my refusal to comply with this decades-old policy, which reflects the continual leftist war on Christmas,” Huelskamp said.

I have continued that refusal through today, even as it has cowered many other public officials and private industry alike. The new refusal of the U.S. House to cater to the PC Police moves us one small step away from that carefully crafted secular society devoid of any reference to our religious and cultural heritage. I am glad that finally Members of Congress can express their holiday joy in a manner that they see fit and consistent with our American history–without an ethics threat.

Huelskamp ended his statement with a warm Christmas greeting for his constituents and all Americans: “As I have done for the past two years, I personally wish you and all of America a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”

Merry Christmas, folks.

The Senate seems to be a tad less polarized since the female population rose from 17 to 20 this year. It’s also possible that there’s been more productivity since women got more power. For instance, the Budget Committee has a new chair, Patty Murray of Washington, and it has produced a budget for the first time in four years.

It’s conceivable that the committee was inspired by a rule that would have canceled the senators’ salaries if they didn’t deliver. But I’m hoping for a larger picture.

“Women tend to listen to what everybody’s needs are, rather than just saying: ‘I’m the only bright person in the world and you have to listen to what I say,’ ” suggested Murray in a phone conversation from her home state, where she was inspecting a spectacular bridge collapse. We will all stop here to envision the moment in the State of the Union address when President Obama called for more bridge repair projects and John Boehner failed to applaud.

The Senate passed its budget two months ago, after 50 hours of debate and an all-night series of 70 amendment votes. The next step was to send members to a House-Senate conference committee, but the Republicans held that up, arguing that before the conference committee could work on an agreement, the Senate should decide what the agreement would say."

The website, Change For Trayvon, and committee of the same name, are intended “to give his family a voice in the political process,” according to the group's mission statement.



“Your support will help engage the discussion across the country regarding stand-your-ground laws and the need to revise them so that there is required judicial or prosecutorial review before decisions are made,” the statement continues. “30,000 mothers and fathers lost their children to gun violence. The Change for Trayvon movement will shine the light on stand-your-ground laws across the nation. These laws allow individuals to shoot first and ask questions later.”

The site provides PayPal links for those wishing to make contributions, which ""will be used to educate voters, candidates, and elected officials on the impact these laws have on victims and families,"" according to the site.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin’s family, said the committee was formed in response to a growing number of states that have placed Stand Your Ground laws -- which they believe prevented their son’s killer, George Zimmerman, from being immediately arrested -- on ballots for the upcoming November election.

“The family is saying straightforward that it is not just about Trayvon; all of our children have the possibility of being a Trayvon and having to face this battle against the Stand Your Ground law and the way it’s written,” Crump told The Huffington Post. “They’re saying its too late for them, we can’t do anything about Trayvon. But it’s not too late for others.”

In the wake of Martin’s Feb. 26 killing by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Sanford, Fla., who claims he shot the teen in self-defense, so-called Stand Your Ground laws were scrutinized not only by supporters of Martin’s family, but also by legal experts and advocacy groups who say the laws are written in a way that allows broad interpretation and application and give people wide discretion in the use of deadly force.

Sanford police initially said that it would have been against the law and possibley a violation of Zimmerman’s rights to arrest him. But police arrested Zimmerman more than 40 days after the killing, not long after Florida Gov. Rick Scott assigned a special prosecutor to the case.

Scott also formed the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection to hold town hall meetings, consult with legal experts, and make recommendations for possible changes to the law.

The task force has itself been controversial, with critics assailing it and Gov. Scott for appointing supporters of the law to the board, including two of the law's authors.

The family’s announcement today comes on the eve of a meeting of the 19-member task force on Tuesday in Jacksonville.

“These laws allow people to shoot first and ask questions later,” Tracy Martin, Trayvon’s father, said in a video featured on the Change For Trayvon website.

“Worse, under existing Stand Your Ground laws, decisions on shootings are made even before a judge or prosecutor can review the case,” added Sybina Fulton, Martin’s mother. “Stand Your Ground is a solution in search of a problem, and it’s a terrible solution with tragic result, like the death of our son.”

The Change For Trayvon website also ups the ante in a media battle between the Martin and Zimmerman camps, as both sides work to drum up moral and financial support.

Zimmerman has given exclusive interviews to sympathetic cable news pundits. And his parents, friends and brother have defended him on various television news programs.

Meanwhile, Martin's family has made the rounds on the major morning shows and have done countless primetime interviews.

The fight for support has also been waged on the Internet.

Zimmerman, who remains free on bail pending trial, set up a website early on, which he used to thank supporters and raise funds. That site was later taken down, at which time his defense attorney, Mark O’Mara, launched a new website, gzlegalcase.com, which has been used to publish evidence, court filings and various statements.

Zimmerman’s parents also launched a website in support of their son.

According to the Change For Trayvon website, laws similar to Florida’s Stand Your Ground law exist in 32 states “and have allowed people to escape responsibility.”

In Florida, the bill sailed through the state legislature in 2005 with bipartisan majorities. It was intended to strengthen existing self-defense laws after a series of major hurricanes raised fears of looting. But critics say the law is ambiguously written, which consequently has allowed some misapplication. Recent investigative reports suggest a troubling pattern in the application of the law, which seems to skew along racial lines.

Among the more controversial aspects of the debate are the law's possibly biased application, its widespread support among gun rights advocates like the NRA and conservative groups like ALEC, and a number of recent high-profile shootings, including the Trayvon Martin case, in which people have attempted to invoke the law as a legal defense."

Abortion bill requires abortions only in surgical centers%2C bans abortions after 20 weeks

House clears bill two weeks after Senate failed to meet deadline amid filibuster

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas House has approved new abortion limits in a second special session, less than two weeks after Senate Republicans failed to finish work on the bill amid a filibuster and raucous protests.

A final vote could be held as early as Friday in the Senate, where the measure died as the first special session expired. The House voted mostly along party lines Wednesday on what has become signature GOP legislation.

Lawmakers spent more than 10 hours debating it Tuesday, and Republicans rejected every attempt to amend the bill. Throngs of protesters were missing for Wednesday's mostly procedural vote after days of protests by supporters and opponents.

The bill requires doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, only allow abortions in surgical centers and ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Democrats and women's rights activists have protested the bill for weeks. The measure failed to win enough support during the regular session, then died in the first special session due to a 13-hour filibuster by state Sen. Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat.

Republican leaders, including Gov. Rick Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, are intent on passing it quickly through the Republican-controlled Legislature in a second special session. Democrats can do little but slow the bill down, attract as much attention as possible and lay the groundwork for a federal lawsuit to block it once it becomes law.

Davis' successful filibuster put the Texas bill in the spotlight of the national abortion debate. On Monday night, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee spoke to abortion rights opponents. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced a statewide bus tour Tuesday morning, dubbed Stand With Texas Women.

""It seems like every time women looked up from doing their laundry of helping children with their homework, the Texas Legislature is right there taking aim at them again,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""Over the past few years, more than 50 women's health centers have been shut down.""

Women from both parties who support abortion rights introduced a series of amendments to water down House Bill 2, hanging coat hangers on the front podium to symbolize illegal abortions, which they say will become more common if the law is enacted. Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, called for an exception to the 20-week ban in cases of rape and incest, but Laubenberg rejected the proposal.

An anti-abortion voting record is critical to winning Republican primaries in Texas. Texas Alliance for Life, a Christian group that maintains a scorecard on lawmakers, sent out messages on Twitter opposing each amendment, signaling how lawmakers should vote for a high score.

Supporters of the restrictions insist that they will improve the health care women receive by placing more stringent conditions on abortions. Laubenberg told the House on Tuesday that her bill would ensure that women get high-quality treatment while protecting ""babies"" after 20 weeks of gestation.

""What we're talking about today truly is about the health and safety of a woman who would undergo an abortion, but also, I want to point out, we are talking about an unborn child,"" she said.

Federal courts have ruled that states can regulate abortions but not to the extent to make them impossible to obtain. That hasn't stopped Republican-led legislatures in Texas and several other states from passing laws in recent years that test the legal limits.

Opponents of the Texas restrictions say they would effectively ban abortion in much of the nation's second most-populous state by causing the closure of 37 of its 42 abortion clinics.

Houston Rep. Sarah Davis, the only Republican opposed to the law, warned that the bill as written is unconstitutional and she offered an amendment to make it less stringent.

""I believe the bill as drafted will be a de facto ban on abortion,"" she said. ""No one wants to see abortions, it's a terrible way to end a pregnancy, but it is a constitutionally protected right.""

They also say the Texas restrictions and those passed by other states conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established that a woman has the right to get an abortion until her fetus could viably survive outside of the womb, which is generally at 22 to 24 weeks of the pregnancy.

It's unclear if the Texas restrictions could survive a court challenge. Federal courts have suspended aspects of the bill passed by other states. On Monday, a federal judge blocked enforcement of a Wisconsin abortion law requiring admitting privileges.

The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology oppose the bill, calling it unnecessary.

The Texas Department of Public Safety has more than doubled the number of troopers at the Capitol due to the rallies and marathon hearings, said Sen. Kevin Eltife, a Tyler Republican who oversees the Senate Administration Committee. He declined to reveal the exact number of troopers or how much the boost in security cost.

Lawmakers told the DPS they wanted plenty of troopers on the ground no matter the expense, he added."

Wade Fast Facts,"Norma McCorvey (L) formally known as 'Jane Roe,' as she holds a pro-choice sign with former attorney Gloria Allred (R) in front of the US Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, just before attorneys began arguing the 1973 landmark abortion decision which legalized abortion in the US.

(CNN) —

Here’s a look at the US Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.

Case

1971 - The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.

Decision

January 22, 1973 - The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. The Court held that a woman’s right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy (recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut) protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision gave a woman the right to an abortion during the entirety of the pregnancy and defined different levels of state interest for regulating abortion in the second and third trimesters.

The ruling affected laws in 46 states.

Legal Timeline

1971 - The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.

1971 - The Supreme Court agrees to hear the case filed by Roe against Wade, who was enforcing the Texas abortion law that had been declared unconstitutional in an earlier federal district court case. Wade was ignoring the legal ruling and both sides appealed.

December 13, 1971 - The case is argued before the US Supreme Court.

October 11, 1972 - The case is reargued before the US Supreme Court.

January 22, 1973 - The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution.

June 17, 2003 - McCorvey (Roe) files a motion with the US District Court in Dallas to have the case overturned and asks the court to consider new evidence that abortion hurts women. Included are 1,000 affidavits from women who say they regret their abortions.

September 14, 2004 - A three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans dismisses McCorvey’s motion to have the case overturned, according to the Court’s clerk.

The Players

McCorvey - Texas resident who sought to obtain an abortion. Texas law prohibited abortions except to save the pregnant mother’s life. McCorvey was pregnant when she became the lead plaintiff in the case. She gave up the baby for adoption.

McCorvey has since come forward and changed sides on the abortion debate. In 1997, McCorvey started Roe No More, a pro-life outreach organization that was dissolved in 2008. McCorvey died on February 18, 2017.

Wade - district attorney of Dallas County from 1951 to 1987. McCorvey sued him because he enforced a law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life. He died on March 1, 2001.

Sarah Weddington - Lawyer for McCorvey.

Linda Coffee - Lawyer for McCorvey.

Jay Floyd - Argued the case for Texas the first time.

Arkansas law bans most abortions after 12th week of pregnancy

North Dakota law bans abortions as early as sixth week of pregnancy

Laws challenge 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established right to abortion

Rival legal teams, well-financed and highly motivated, are girding for court battles over the coming months on laws enacted in Arkansas and North Dakota that would impose the nation's toughest bans on abortion.

For all their differences, attorneys for the two states and the abortion-rights supporters opposing them agree on this: The laws represent an unprecedented frontal assault on the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.

The Arkansas law, approved March 6 when legislators overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe, would ban most abortions from the 12th week of pregnancy onward. On March 26, North Dakota went further, with Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple signing a measure that would ban abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can first be detected and before some women even know they're pregnant.

Abortion-rights advocates plan to challenge both measures, contending they are unconstitutional violations of the Roe ruling that legalized abortion until a fetus could viably survive outside the womb. A fetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks.

""I think they're going to be blocked immediately by the courts — they are so far outside the clear bounds of what the Supreme Court has said for 40 years,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The center will be leading the North Dakota legal challenge and working in Arkansas alongside the American Civil Liberties Union's state and national offices. Both Northup and ACLU lawyers say they have ample resources to wage the battles, and they expect victories that would require their attorneys' fees to be paid by two states.

Dalrymple, in signing the ban, acknowledged that its chances of surviving a court challenge were questionable, but said it was worth the eventual price tag — at this point unknown — in order to test the boundaries of Roe.

North Dakota's attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, initially said lawyers from his office would defend any lawsuits but is now considering hiring outside help. His office is working on a cost estimate for the litigation that could be presented to lawmakers soon.

""We're looking at a sufficient amount to adequately defend these enactments,"" Stenehjem said.

A lead sponsor of the Arkansas ban, Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert, said threats of lawsuits ""should not prevent someone from doing what is right.""

He contended that the ban had a chance of reaching the U.S. Supreme Court through the appeals process and suggested that the victory predictions made by abortion-rights lawyers amounted to ""posturing"" aimed at deterring other states from enacting similar bans.

In both Arkansas and North Dakota, the states' lawyers will be getting pro bono assistance from lawyers with Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian legal group.

Mathew Staver, the group's chairman, said supporters of the bans were resolved to fight the legal battles to the end, and issued a caution to the rival side.

""They ought to hold off on their celebrations,"" he said. ""The cases have a long way to go through the court system.""

The North Dakota ban is scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, along with two other measures that have angered abortion-rights backers. One would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, the other would make North Dakota the first state to ban abortions based on genetic defects such as Down syndrome.

The Center for Reproductive Rights is reviewing its options regarding the latter two bills, but definitely plans to challenge the 6-week ban before Aug. 1. Northup said her team is pondering whether to file suit in state court or U.S. district court.

In Arkansas, where the 12-week ban would take effect 90 days after the end of the legislative session, abortion-rights lawyers plan to file their challenge in federal court within the next few weeks.

Bettina Brownstein, who will be representing the ACLU of Arkansas in the case, said the U.S. district court with jurisdiction over Little Rock had issued rulings in past abortion-related cases that gave her confidence of victory this time.

""Eventually it could go to U.S. Supreme Court on appeal, but that would take a while, and they may not want to hear it,"" she said. ""It's a question of how much money the state wants to spend.""

Northup chided officials in both Arkansas and North Dakota for their willingness to spend taxpayers' money on difficult and divisive legal cases.

""It's important that the citizens of those states realize that every dollar spent to defend blatantly unconstitutional laws is taxpayers' dollars wasted,"" she said.

Attorneys' fees for the upcoming cases are impossible to estimate at this stage, but Northup said her organization received $1.3 million in fees from Alaska after that state lost a recent case regarding an abortion-related law.

The last few years have been intensely busy for the Center for Reproductive Rights, the ACLU and other abortion-rights legal groups as Republican-controlled legislatures have enacted scores of laws seeking to restrict access to abortion. At least two dozen such measures are currently the target of lawsuits, said Northup, who vowed that her organization ""will not let unconstitutional laws go on challenged.""

Some of the recent laws place new requirements on abortion clinics, others require abortion providers to perform certain procedures or offer state-mandated counseling before an abortion can take place.

At least 10 states have passed bills banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that stage. One of those laws, in Idaho, was struck down by a U.S. district judge on March 6, while the laws in Georgia and Arizona have been temporarily blocked by judges pending further court proceedings.

Abortion-rights advocates, while eager to defeat the new bans in North Dakota and Arkansas, worry about the impact of the broader surge of restrictions.

""I don't believe these bans are going to take effect, but the danger is that they make the other laws look reasonable,"" said Talcott Camp, deputy director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project. ""The ultimate goal is to take this decision away from a woman and her doctor and give it to the politicians.""

One of the most frequent targets of the anti-abortion laws is the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which — in addition to providing a range of other health services — is the nation's leading provider of abortions.

Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, said she found it frustrating that women ""continue to be a political punching bag."" But she saw an upside to the wave of anti-abortion legislation: more members and more donations for her organization.

""These attacks have served to energize our supporters,"" she said. ""We've gained 2 million members in the past two years.""

There's new energy on the other side as well.

The tough North Dakota laws have been welcomed by the protesters who gather weekly in Fargo outside the state's lone abortion clinic.

Among those on hand for the latest protest at the Red River Women's Clinic was Scott Carew, 50, who had brought two anti-abortion posters nailed to pieces of wood.

""Certainly, we're proud of the governor standing up for life,"" Carew said. ""We're going to keep standing up for life until we can't stand up anymore.""

Lew testified Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee. He spoke amid claims from some corners that missing the Oct. 17 deadline does not necessarily trigger the doomsday scenario of default on the debt.

Lew also did not go so far as to claim payments on the debt would be jeopardized after Oct. 17. However, he said myriad other payments inevitably would be -- which he described as a ""default"" in the general sense.

""Under any scenario, we will be defaulting on obligations,"" Lew said.

Lew, in a written statement, warned that upcoming payments for the following could all be jeopardized before Nov. 1:

Social Security payments

Medicare payments

Veteran benefit payments

Active-duty military salaries

""The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens,"" Lew said.

Lew said missing that deadline would cause financial chaos, hurting the economy and shaking the financial markets to a degree that could cripple the economic recovery. He urged Congress to promptly raise the debt ceiling and pass a spending bill to restore confidence.

The appearance was yet another public restatement of the administration's stance that Congress needs to pass a spending bill and lift the U.S. borrowing cap before President Obama will negotiate over the nation's budget ills.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, though, argued that the nation's overspending needs to be dealt with, and he bristled at Obama's repeated claims that the debt ceiling should be raised to pay for spending Congress racked up. ""It is a problem that all of us ... need to deal with,"" Hatch said.

He also said it is ""disconcerting"" to hear Social Security and other payments could be stopped.

In a glimmer of hope for a possible deal, some Republicans are discussing the possibility of permitting a short-term increase in the debt ceiling to allow for further negotiations. Obama is hosting top House Republicans on Thursday afternoon to discuss the impasse, which so far has resulted in a partial government shutdown.

The next big deadline is Oct. 17, when the Treasury Department says the government will exhaust ways to pay all its bills without an increase in the debt ceiling.

Credit-rating agency Moody's, though, released an analysis on Wednesday that claimed even if the government missed that deadline, a default on the debt would not happen. Moody's argues that the Treasury Department would find a way to pay interest on its debt above all else.

""We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt, even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,"" the analysis said. ""The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury's extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.""

The analysis also noted that the next interest payment -- of $5.9 billion -- is not due until the end of the month.

Still, few would claim that the implications of not raising the debt ceiling are minor. Even if the government can pay interest on the debt, it would be unable to pay myriad other obligations -- officials say the government would have to choose between priorities like Social Security checks and many other functions of the federal government.

The uncertainty could severely damage the economy and shake the financial markets.

Some officials argue, though, that since this is uncharted territory it's ultimately unclear whether the Treasury Department could prioritize payments -- and that a default on debt is a possibility.

""A default would be a financial heart attack,"" Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Thursday.

Lew on Thursday also questioned his ability to prioritize payments.

It's not every day you see an ex-president ask the Supreme Court to strike down a law he signed.

That's what Bill Clinton is doing with the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman -- and which the high court will rule on this year in a landmark moment for the gay marriage movement.

The justices must decide whether the Defense of Marriage Act ""is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional,"" Clinton writes in The Washington Post.

He says, ""As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.""

Clinton says that when he signed the law in 1996, ""it was a very different time."" No state recognized same-sex marriage, but some were considering it -- and congressional opponents proposed ""quite draconian"" responses, the 42nd president writes.

""As a bipartisan group of former senators stated in their March 1 amicus brief to the Supreme Court, many supporters of the bill known as DOMA believed that its passage 'would defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more,'"" Clinton writes.

Now nine states and the District of Columbia sanction gay marriage, but those couples are denied rights available to others, Clinton says. They ""cannot file their taxes jointly, take unpaid leave to care for a sick or injured spouse or receive equal family health and pension benefits as federal civilian employees.""

Clinton says:

""When I signed the bill, I included a statement with the admonition that 'enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.' Reading those words today, I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.""

The Supreme Court decision is likely in late June."

The Des Moines Register

Melissa Nelson was fired in 2010 after working for dentist for 10 years

Court decision that dentist%27s conduct did not constitute sexual harassment drew national attention

No new testimony will be considered when justices reconsider the case

DES MOINES, Iowa -- A woman fired from her job because she was an ""irresistible employee"" has gotten another chance at her sexual discrimination lawsuit after the Iowa Supreme Court this week took the rare step of withdrawing the unanimous opinion it issued in the case in December.

Melissa Nelson had worked for 10 years for Webster County dentist James Knight before she was fired in 2010 because of her looks. Knight eventually told Nelson's husband that ""she's a big threat to our marriage"" and that Knight feared he would attempt an affair if Nelson continued to work for him.

The court ruled that such conduct does not amount to sexual harassment because it was based on specific emotions tied to a specific relationship and not based solely on a person's gender.

The decision drew national attention that included segments on ""Good Morning America"" and the Comedy Central program ""Tosh.0.""

Nelson earlier this year asked the court to reconsider its decision.

On Monday, Chief Justice Mark Cady signed an order resubmitting Nelson's lawsuit for reconsideration by the court. Cady's order says the case will be reopened for discussion by the court; there will be no further oral arguments or additional input from Knight. Nelson's appeal will simply be re-evaluated based on previously submitted evidence and legal briefs.

A new decision could come as early Friday, when justices theoretically are scheduled to wrap up all pending cases submitted during the prior term.

An Iowa Supreme Court spokesman said it's ""rare"" for justices to grant petitions to rehear a case. Five such requests have been granted over the past decade.

Ryan Koopmans, a Des Moines attorney who blogs about legal cases at iowaappeals.com, said justices could have made technical changes to the opinion without granting a formal rehearing.

""In all likelihood, at least one justice has already changed his mind; otherwise there would be no need to rehear the case after six months,"" Koopmans said. ""So I expect that there will be at least one opinion coming out in favor of Melissa Nelson. The question is whether that opinion is the majority or the dissent.""

Neither Nelson nor her attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday.

Randall Wilson, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, called the court's decision to rehear Nelson's case ""an encouraging development"" because ""an issue of this importance probably deserves a second look.""

""On balance, while there's no right to dress the way you want to in the workplace, there is a right to be a woman,"" Wilson said.

Nelson, a former assistant, filed her lawsuit after she was fired based on Knight's stated irresistible attraction to her.

Court papers say it was roughly 18 months before the end of Nelson's employment that Knight began to complain about the distractions caused by Nelson's appearance. According to the previous ruling, ""Dr. Knight acknowledges that he once told Nelson that if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing.""

Documents say Knight's wife discovered in late 2009 that her husband had been exchanging text messages with Nelson (usually about child-related matters) and demanded that the assistant be fired.

Nelson's lawyer had argued on appeal, according to court documents, that ""if Dr. Knight would have been liable to Nelson for sexually harassing her, he should not be able to avoid liability for terminating her out of fear that he was going to harass her.""

The court's December opinion saw a difference between decisions based on personal relationships and one based on gender.

""The civil rights laws seek to insure that employees are treated the same regardless of their sex or other protected status,"" the justices wrote. ""Yet even taking Nelson's view of the facts, Dr. Knight's unfair decision to terminate Nelson (while paying her a rather ungenerous one month's severance) does not jeopardize that goal."""

""The word racist is truly hurtful,"" he told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""It's not who I am. It's not who I ever was. It's just not fair. It's just not right.""

The Washington Post columnist came under fire on Tuesday for writing that ""people with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children."" He insisted that he was expressing the views of some people within the Tea Party and not his own.

""I didn't write one line, I wrote a column,"" Cohen said. ""The column is about Tea Party extremism and I was not expressing my views, I was expressing the views of what I think some people in the Tea Party held.""

And those views are not held by the entire Tea Party. ""I don't think everybody in the Tea Party is like that, because I know there are blacks in the Tea Party,"" he said. ""So they're not all racist, unless I'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there.""

When asked if he believed that people who do “have a gag reflex” at the idea of interracial marriage are in fact racist, he said that he did. “I could have picked a better word, but it didn't ring any bells with anybody, it didn't ring any bells with me,” he continued. “But there is a context to the column. You've got to read the whole column and if you read the whole column you can't honestly think that these are my views or I endorse the views that I articulated in the column.”

Fred Hiatt, editor of the Washington Post editorial page, said Tuesday that he should have edited Cohen's ""conventional"" line to prevent misunderstanding.

Cohen said that no editors objected to the phrasing the first time around. ""Nobody, not a single one of my editors -- and believe me, they're super sensitive to this sort of stuff -- said, 'Wait a minute.' They all knew what I meant because of the context of the column. I was talking about tea party extremism. And it's clear.""

He added, ""Look, maybe the word was inappropriate or maybe I could have used a different word. But you're talking to somebody who has written, I don't know, 100 columns in favor of homosexual rights, many columns in favor of same sex marriage.""

Cohen has been criticized for his comments on race in the past. When asked why he thought it was that he keeps getting caught up in racially charged arguments, he said that it's because people view him as a liberal and find some of his positions unconventional. ""Every once in a while I take an unconventional stance as a liberal -- as someone who has always been called a liberal,"" he said. ""If someone on the right wrote this, no one would care. No one would make a big deal about it but because I veer every once in awhile from orthodoxy, or maybe more than once in awhile, I get plastered this way.""

ORIGINAL STORY: Richard Cohen is back at it again, this time with incendiary comments about interracial marriage and lesbians.

In his November 11 column in the Washington Post entitled ""Christie’s tea-party problem,"" Cohen said that the GOP has had trouble embracing some of the country's cultural shifts. He wrote:

Today’s GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled — about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde. People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.

In fact, according to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, 87 percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage between blacks and whites."

Early voting is underway in Albuquerque for an election Tuesday, which will decide whether to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Although similar bans have been passed by state legislatures, New Mexico’s largest city is believed to be the first municipality in the country to place such an initiative on a ballot.

The “Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance,” which needs a majority to pass, would have statewide impact because the only late-term abortion providers in the largely rural state are in Albuquerque.

Women living out of state also fly to Albuquerque for this type of care, said Micaela Cadena, policy director at Young Women United. The New Mexico-based group is part of the Respect ABQ Women campaign, which is fighting the local measure.

“Albuquerque voters are voting for the whole state of New Mexico and also for the rest of the country,” Cadena said.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe vs. Wade has been interpreted by lower courts as making abortion legal through 24 weeks of pregnancy, but antiabortion activists are pushing to ban the procedure after 20 weeks — a step in chipping away at the 1973 landmark ruling.

Tara and Bud Shaver, who call themselves pro-life missionaries, moved to New Mexico three years ago from Kansas, a center of antiabortion activism, with the intent of mobilizing a campaign to shut down Southwestern Women’s Options — one of a handful of clinics in the country that provide late-term abortions.

There doesn’t seem to be a consensus on when a pregnancy is considered late-term, with definitions ranging from the 20th week of gestation to the 27th.

Tara Shaver said that although terminations after 20 weeks account for about 1.3% of all abortion procedures, banning them would be one step toward outlawing the practice entirely.

In Albuquerque, it’s hard to get away from any mention of the measure.

Campaign ads have taken over radio and television. Commuters drive down boulevards flanked with signs that read “Vote for Late Term Abortion Ban” or “Respect ABQ Women. Vote no Nov. 19.”

On a recent weekday morning at University of New Mexico, Shaver and her contingent of volunteers handed out leaflets to backpack-toting students hurrying to class.

At about the same time a “truth truck” — as the antiabortion group contingent calls it — maneuvered along a road cutting through campus. The truck carried its a billboard-sized picture of what looked to be a dismembered fetus.

“We’re going to show them the truth — what abortion really does,” Shaver said.

The night before, a group of abortion rights advocates gathered downtown. Bineshi Albert and her 17-year-old daughter, Dezbah Evans, munched on pizza before they took to the streets with their best pitch in opposition to the ban.

“As a Native American, I have some experience with the government telling us what to do with our land, our hair, our body, our language, our culture,” Albert said. “I can relate that experience to me as a woman, and I just don’t think the city government should have a say to regulate what happens to my body.”

To get the measure on the ballot, Operation Rescue and other antiabortion groups gathered 27,000 signatures — more than twice the number the city requires. If successful, the ordinance could be implemented days after city officials certify the election.

Councilman Dan Lewis, who describes himself as pro-life, said that if the measure passes and is challenged in court, the city will be obligated to defend it.

Councilwoman Trudy Jones, who has questioned the constitutionality of the measure, said abortion should not be a municipal issue. The special election will cost the city at least $500,000, and legal bills to defend it could triple that amount — a strain for a poor city, she said.

“We could feed a lot of babies for million and a half dollars,” she said.

Opponents of the measure, including state Atty. Gen. Gary King, have said they’re prepared to sue if the measure passes.

Dave Sidhu, a constitutional scholar at the University of New Mexico, pointed to recent court rulings throughout the nation that have struck down similar bans at the state level.

Just the next state over, Arizona officials have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after a 20-week limit on abortions was struck down by a federal court. Eleven other states have also adopted 20-week limits. Several of these bans have been blocked by courts while litigation is pending.

In addition to the advertising blitzes, the fight over the measure is playing out at front doors, in parking lots and on college campuses — anywhere proponents and opponents can make their pitch.

At the university, Shaver approached Rachel and Garrett Wolff and asked whether they had heard about the measure. Rachel Wolff, who is 18 weeks pregnant, said she had.

At first, it appeared Shaver had persuaded both to vote for the measure. But Rachel Wolff’s eyebrows rose when she discovered the initiative does not make exceptions for women who are victims of incest or rape.

The only exception is for women whose lives would be in danger if they were to carry the fetus to term. Wolff found that provision too limited.

Her husband agreed.

“I think they should make concessions for rape, incest and deformities,” he said.

At this point, he said, he’d likely just not vote.

About an hour later, opponents and supporters of the measure rallied outside the university’s bookstore.

Two women from Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, a group based in Riverside, Calif., held a sign that read “Keep this legal” above a picture of what looked like a baby’s severed head.

A few passersby tried not to look. Others shook their heads. Some accepted the leaflets the women handed out.

At the other end of the plaza, other women tried to warn pedestrians about the Riverside protesters, carrying signs that read “Trigger warning: deceptive images ahead.” Other women shouted, “Our bodies, our choice.”

At one point the two groups converged and began a shouting match that had to be broken up by police.

It was time, he told them, for him to speak to the nation about the Trayvon Martin verdict, and he had a pretty good idea what he wanted to say.

For the next 15 minutes, according to a senior aide, Mr. Obama spoke without interruption, laying out his message of why the not-guilty ruling had caused such pain among African-Americans, particularly young black men accustomed to arousing the kind of suspicion that led to the shooting death of Mr. Martin in a gated Florida neighborhood.

On Friday, reading an unusually personal, handwritten statement, Mr. Obama summed up his views with a single line: “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.”

That moment punctuated a turbulent week marked by dozens of phone calls to the White House from black leaders, angry protests that lit up the Internet and streets from Baltimore to Los Angeles, and anguished soul-searching by Mr. Obama. Aides say the president closely monitored the public reaction and talked repeatedly about the case with friends and family."

Senate GOP leader holds up targeting of Tea Party groups by IRS as example

He blames Obama administration for pitting bureaucrats vs. Americans

Remarks made in speech to American Enterprise Institute

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks last year, said Friday that the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.

McConnell, R-Ky., seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House, saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies, the administration, President Obama's congressional allies, left-wing groups and public-employee unions.

""As serious as the IRS scandal is, what we're dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees,"" McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop.""

Speaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.

In the first six months of Obama's second term, the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. No evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and, in another case, reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.

""When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it,"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""

In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather the government's.

""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.

In response to Grassley's criticism, the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.

McConnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections."

Well, hardly. A new book quotes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as saying that America was ready for a president like Barack Obama who is black but ""light-skinned"" and speaks ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" Disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich said in an interview that he was ""blacker than Obama"" -- a comment that Blago later called ""stupid, stupid, stupid."" Here are 10 facts about racism and its close cousin, ethnic intolerance:

1. ""Honky,"" a slur against white people, probably originated in Chicago. Experts trace it to ""bohunk,"" used to describe Bohemians, Hungarians and other Eastern European immigrants. Black workers in Chicago's South Side meatpacking plants are believed to have referred to their white co-workers as ""hunkies,"" which later became ""honkies"" to refer to all whites.

2. A 1906 newspaper article in the Atlanta Constitution described how a white girl suffered a fatal heart attack after dreaming that a ""big negro"" with a knife was trying to kill her. The Constitution seemed to blame the fictional black man, headlining the story: ""Negro, Seen in Dream, Causes Death of Girl."" Such newspaper transgressions are easy to find. In 1921, The New York Times reported that South Africa's black population, which outnumbered whites 5-to-1, was pushing for political power. Some would view that as democracy in action. The Times saw it differently with this headline: ""Negroes a Problem in South Africa.""

3. The Tribune has its own embarrassing archives regarding race. About 40,000 people viewed the body of lynching victim Emmett Till when it was returned from Mississippi to Chicago in 1955, but the Tribune's article suggested that the key civil rights event might be a Marxist hoax. The article's third and fourth paragraphs described communists distributing ""inflammatory literature"" outside the church. The fifth and sixth paragraphs quoted a Mississippi sheriff who questioned whether the body was even Till's and said that ""the whole thing looks like a deal made up by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.""

4. There's nothing like a Disney movie to make some people whistle a happy tune and other people simply scream. The 1946 feature film ""Song of the South"" remains out of circulation because of the perceived offense it would give to African-Americans. The 1933 cartoon short ""Three Little Pigs"" featured the big, bad wolf dressed as a Jewish peddler. After complaints, the cartoon was revised so that the wolf posed as a Fuller Brush salesman. More recently, Arabs objected to a lyric in the 1992 film ""Aladdin."" It originally described Arabia as a place ""where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" That was changed to ""Where it's flat and immense, and the heat is intense / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" A Disney spokesman emphasized that the new lyric meant that Arabian weather patterns, not people, were ""barbaric.""

5. It's now a slur, but it once was the official name of a federal program. ""Operation Wetback"" was conducted in 1954 to drive illegal immigrants from the American Southwest. Federal officials claimed that 1.3 million people were deported or compelled to flee. The offensive name for the operation came from Gen. Joseph ""Jumpin' Joe"" Swing, a former West Point classmate of then-President Dwight Eisenhower who headed the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

6. A few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Life magazine published an article headlined ""How to tell Japs from the Chinese."" The Chinese, who were U.S. allies, found themselves mistaken for Japanese on American streets and treated rudely by angry Americans. Then Life came to the rescue, with annotated photos. The Chinese had ""parchment yellow complexion."" The Japanese had ""earthy yellow complexion."" The Chinese were ""tall and slender."" The Japanese were ""short and squat."" In their facial expressions, the Chinese ""wear the rational calm of tolerant realists,"" while Japanese show the ""humorless intensity of ruthless mystics."" A person from China ""never has rosy cheeks."" A Japanese person has ""sometimes rosy cheeks."" The apparent message: If you feel compelled to angrily confront an Asian stranger, harass the one with the rosy cheeks.

7. Ethnic prejudice can look a lot like racism. In 1855, Chicago's lily-white rulers clashed with new German and Irish immigrants. The battleground: booze. Mayor Levi Boone tried to shut down Irish and German beer halls while leaving open the taverns that served the whiskey preferred by his kind of people. An immigrant mob protested the crackdown, and the Lager Beer Riot ensued, leading to one death and 60 arrests.

8. Two of Chicago's best-known roads -- Sheridan and Roosevelt -- are named after national icons who disparaged American Indians. The phrase ""The only good Indian is a dead Indian"" is often attributed to Gen. Philip Sheridan. He denied saying it, but there's no question he viewed Indians as inferior savages and that he imposed hard-line policies leading to the deaths of many innocent Indians. Future President Theodore Roosevelt addressed the ""only good Indian"" expression in an 1886 speech: ""I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the 10th.""

9. Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and standard-bearer of the ""Back to Africa"" movement, met with the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1920s. Garvey said the two groups' attitudes were ""similar,"" explaining: ""Whilst the Ku Klux Klan desires to make America absolutely a white man's country, the Universal Negro Improvement Association wants to make Africa absolutely a black man's country."" Four decades later, Malcolm X also met with the Klan. According to accounts by Malcolm X and an FBI informant, the black Muslim and the Klan shared their distaste for integration. But unlike Garvey, Malcolm X later expressed regret for consorting with Klansmen."

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, argues that the NSA’s ongoing, daily collection of virtually all Verizon telephone records is unconstitutional and should be stopped.

“This dragnet program is surely one of the largest surveillance efforts ever launched by a democratic government against its own citizens,” Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director, said in a statement. “It is the equivalent of requiring every American to file a daily report with the government of every location they visited, every person they talked to on the phone, the time of each call, and the length of every conversation.”

As a Verizon customer, the ACLU claims that the NSA’s seizure of telephone records “compromises sensitive information about its work” and harms its ability to freely communicate.

The Guardian newspaper last week published an order, marked “Top Secret,” from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that requires Verizon to turn over all “telephony metadata,” or records of each call, over a three-month period. Lawmakers later said the program has been in operation nonstop for seven years under similar court orders.

The White House has come under harsh criticism for the NSA’s deal with Verizon, as well as the so-called PRISM program, which was designed to secretly obtain emails, photos, documents and other online material from foreign nationals. A former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, has claimed responsibility for leaking both programs.

The administration has strongly defended the surveillance systems, saying they are approved by Congress and the courts, and thus within the law.

Obama “believes as commander-in-chief that the oversight structures that are in place to ensure that there is the proper review of the kinds of programs that we have in place, authorized by Congress through the Patriot Act, and FISA do strike that balance,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday.

The good news is that the court affirmed major precedents going back 35 years. It asserted that a more diverse student body — and an admission policy that helps produce one — serves a compelling interest of government by achieving educational and social benefits. Diversity, in turn, helps realize what the court has called “the dream of one nation, indivisible.”

At the same time, the court sent the case at hand — Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin — back for review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld the university’s use of race in its admissions policy. The court did not say that race could not be used to achieve diversity. It did say, however, that the appeals court must closely reconsider the university’s admissions process to determine whether a race-neutral approach could achieve the level of diversity it seeks.

Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, “Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but feeble in fact.” By this, he meant the court must do a better job of determining that the university needs to rely on race in admissions to achieve greater diversity, including why it wants to admit more minorities in the first place.

In its brief, the university explained that it was not able to admit “an adequate representation of minority students to assure educational benefits deriving from diversity” despite many years “of good-faith efforts to achieve racial diversity through facially race-neutral means.” That included, most prominently, the state’s Top Ten Percent program, which uses geography as a proxy for race by assuring every Texas student who graduates in the top tenth of a high school class admission to a state university."

Senate Bill 353, formerly known as the ""Motorcycle Safety Act,"" has a new, not particularly snappy nickname: ""Health and Safety Law Changes."" But, good news for motorcycle enthusiasts: the gutted bill at least keeps the motorcycle-related proposals. The new version of the bill is meant to address North Carolina governor Pat McCrory's promise to veto the anti-Sharia/anti-abortion hybrid bill. Essentially, McCrory said previously that he wants to keep the state's abortion laws the same as they are now. And now, it looks like Republicans may have worked with someone from McCrory's office to come up with something — anything — he'd sign that includes new abortion restricting measures. But it's still not clear whether the governor is cool with even this bill, which removes some key components of its previous iteration. The new version, which has been reported on by the Charlotte News-Observer and the Associated Press, isn't even on the North Carolina General Assembly's site yet. Some outlets have posted a scanned PDF of the changes:

Unlike the state House's anti-Sharia bill, known as the ""Family, Faith, and Freedom Protection Act of 2013,"" the new measure wouldn't require abortion-providing clinics in the state to meet the requirements of ambulatory surgical centers. That requirement, one of the hallmarks of so-called TRAP abortion bills, would effectively prompt the closure of clinics in the state. The bill, however, would allow the state's Department of Health and Human Services to apply those standards to abortion clinics at their discretion, ""while not unduly restricting access."" The new bill also steps back from a requirement that a physician be present for the administration of all drugs involved in a chemical abortion. Instead, a doctor is required to be in the room only for the first pill. But some measures already passed in the House remain. The bill would ban sex-selective abortions, provide a conscience objection for health care professionals and institutions, and prohibit Obamacare healthcare exchanges or taxpayer-funded health insurance plans from covering almost any abortion.

(CNN) —

A federal judge ordered Monday that the New York Police Department’s controversial stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it violates the Constitution in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos.

But city officials bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects, and vowed to appeal the ruling, contending the policy has cut crime.

“You’re not going to see a change in tactics overnight,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Monday, saying it would take time to implement the judge’s changes even if an appellate court doesn’t temporarily halt it.

Asked if he hopes an appeal will delay the order until he leaves office next year, Bloomberg said: “Boy, I hope so, because I wouldn’t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.”

Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, ruling on a class-action lawsuit, wrote that the policy violated plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion.

She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs’$2 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection.

The police department had said that the policy – in which police stop, question and frisk people they considered suspicious – is used to deter crime.

“The city’s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,” Scheindlin wrote. “In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting ‘the right people’ is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the United States Constitution.”

Coupling Monday’s ruling with a similar decision in January, she ordered that the policy be altered so that stops are based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner.

Among her orders:

– She appointed Peter Zimroth, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, to develop and oversee near-term reforms, including changes to the NYPD’s policies and training.

– In a pilot project, NYPD patrol officers in five precincts – one per borough – must wear video cameras. The chosen precincts would be those with the most stops in 2012. “The recordings should … alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the police and the black and Hispanic communities,” and “will be equally helpful to members of NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate behavior,” Scheindlin wrote.

– Other, longer-term reforms would come after community input.

NYPD: Names of innocent to be erased from stop-and-frisk records

The lawsuit, filed in 2008, went to trial for nine weeks this spring. The lead plaintiff in the case was David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice – once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit.

Another plaintiff, Leroy Downs, described to CNN how he, too, was confronted and frisked as he sat on the steps in front of his own home.

“The officers drove past me, went up the street, reversed, came back, jumped out and they approached me,” Downs said, adding that the officers told him, “You look like you (were) smoking weed.”

Downs said he told the officers, “Come on, I’m talking on a cell phone.”

“They cursed at me and said, ‘Get against the fence,’ and started pushing me toward the fence and commenced to searching me,” added Downs. Police found nothing on Downs.

“I’ve been so much of this throughout my life, that’s one of the reasons why I took part in this – I just want it to stop,” Downs said.

David Ourlicht, also among those stopped, reacted to the judge’s ruling with tears and with an assessment: “This is a big thing for New York, but as far as for America as a whole, it shows the polarization of people of color in this country, as how we’re viewed.”

In her ruling, Scheindlin said more than 80% of the stops involved blacks or Hispanics. The NYPD made more than 4.4 million total stops under the policy from 2004 to June 2012.

She wrote that the NYPD carried out more stops where there were more black and Hispanic residents, at a rate disproportionate with crime rates. She also wrote that the department has an unwritten policy of targeting “the right people” for stops – encouraging, in practice, the targeting of young blacks and Hispanics based on their prevalence in local crime complaints.

“No one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life,” she wrote. “Those who are routinely subjected to stops are overwhelmingly people of color, and they are justifiably troubled to be singled out when many of them have done nothing to attract the unwanted attention.”

Officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas

The city will ask the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to block the ruling until an appeal is heard, city attorney Michael Cardozo said Monday.

The ruling hardly impressed Bloomberg and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who called Scheindlin’s finding of racial profiling “disturbing and offensive.”

“We do not engage in racial profiling. It is prohibited by law,” Kelly said. “We train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop, and I can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop.”

The policy “is certainly a tool that every police officer needs throughout America,” Kelly said.

“If you see something suspicious, you pay your police officers to ask a question, stop to inquire. To the extent that this significantly impacts on that, I think you’re going to have a problem, not only here, but across America.”

Bloomberg said the policy was one of a number of programs that helped the city’s murder rate drop – it’s 50% below the rate when he took office nearly 12 years ago, he said.

The mayor said “we want to match the stops to where the reports of crime are.”

“One of the problems we have in our society today is that victims and perpetrators of crime are (disproportionately) young minority men – that’s just a fact,” he said. “If there’s any administration that’s ever worked hard on that, I think it’s ours … we’re trying to do something about it.

“That has nothing to do with, however, where we stop people. We go to where the reports of crime are. Those unfortunately happen to be poor neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods. But that’s not the original objective or the intent or how we get there. We get there when there’s a crime reported, and we will continue to do that.”

The trial, which ended in May, included testimony from men who said police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops.

Closing arguments gave conflicting accounts of stop-and-frisk incidents. While attorneys for the city argued that one man was stopped because he appeared to be smoking marijuana, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was simply talking on a cell phone.

Another man was reportedly stopped because he fit the description of a wanted man in a high-crime area with a recent string of burglaries, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was more than a mile from where the burglaries occurred and that the last burglary in that area occurred more than 25 days earlier.

According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, the Police Department logged its 5 millionth stop-and-frisk under Mayor Michael Bloomberg in March.

Report Outlined Goals for More Power,"Critics, including some congressional leaders, say that the role of N.S.A. surveillance in thwarting terrorist attacks — often cited by the agency to justify expanded powers — has been exaggerated. In response to the controversy about its activities after Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, agency officials claimed that the N.S.A.’s sweeping domestic surveillance programs had helped in 54 “terrorist-related activities.” But under growing scrutiny, congressional staff members and other critics say that the use of such figures by defenders of the agency has drastically overstated the value of the domestic surveillance programs in counterterrorism.

Agency leaders believe that the N.S.A. has never enjoyed such a target-rich environment as it does now because of the global explosion of digital information — and they want to make certain that they can dominate “the Sigint battle space” in the future, the document said. To be “optimally effective,” the paper said, “legal, policy and process authorities must be as adaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit.”

Intent on unlocking the secrets of adversaries, the paper underscores the agency’s long-term goal of being able to collect virtually everything available in the digital world. To achieve that objective, the paper suggests that the N.S.A. plans to gain greater access, in a variety of ways, to the infrastructure of the world’s telecommunications networks.

Reports based on other documents previously leaked by Mr. Snowden showed that the N.S.A. has infiltrated the cable links to Google and Yahoo data centers around the world, leading to protests from company executives and a growing backlash against the N.S.A. in Silicon Valley.

Yet the paper also shows how the agency believes it can influence and shape trends in high-tech industries in other ways to suit its needs. One of the agency’s goals is to “continue to invest in the industrial base and drive the state of the art for high performance computing to maintain pre-eminent cryptanalytic capability for the nation.” The paper added that the N.S.A. must seek to “identify new access, collection and exploitation methods by leveraging global business trends in data and communications services.”

And it wants to find ways to combine all of its technical tools to enhance its surveillance powers. The N.S.A. will seek to integrate its “capabilities to reach previously inaccessible targets in support of exploitation, cyberdefense and cyberoperations,” the paper stated.

The agency also intends to improve its access to encrypted communications used by individuals, businesses and foreign governments, the strategy document said. The N.S.A. has already had some success in defeating encryption, The New York Times has reported, but the document makes it clear that countering “ubiquitous, strong, commercial network encryption” is a top priority. The agency plans to fight back against the rise of encryption through relationships with companies that develop encryption tools and through espionage operations. In other countries, the document said, the N.S.A. must also “counter indigenous cryptographic programs by targeting their industrial bases with all available Sigint and Humint” — human intelligence, meaning spies."

Fine']",The Trifecta of Race in America,"Race and charges of racism continue to dominate the headlines in the U.S., with December turning out to be the ""trifecta"" of race in America. In early December, it was ""Affluenza"" -- not immediately coded for race, but yet a story with race in the background. A Texas judge sentenced a wealthy white teenager who killed four pedestrians when he lost control of his speeding pick-up truck to probation rather than jail. Although the teen confessed to intoxication manslaughter, the judge accepted the defense argument that the he suffered from ""Affluenza,"" a disease caused by having too much money and too little supervision, which led to his reckless behavior and absolved him of responsibility for his actions. The judge's decision outraged many people because it showed blatant preference for the wealthy. But imagine a different scenario -- a wealthy Black teen facing the same charges. Would ""Affluenza"" be the cause, or would the teen now be the victim of Black men's irresponsibility, which, of course, would leave him fully responsible for his actions?

Then came the second big story when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly assured any kids who happened to be watching her commentary about a Slate.com post on the possibility of a ""Black Santa"" that ""Santa just is white."" She also assured viewers that ""Jesus was a white man too."" Her statements set off a firestorm of criticism and satirical replies (John Stewart and SNL for example). The news commentators on the Boston PBS program ""Beat the Press"" wore black Santa pins to show support for non-white Santas. In an interview with Kelly on ""The Kelly file"" on December 13, political commentator and writer Zirlina Maxwell told her that whiteness is ""not the default identity."" Santa is a fantasy; why shouldn't Christian children of any race or ethnicity imagine that fantasy in their own image? Fern Johnson told a reporter for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that Kelly's comments were an example of ""white washing"" images that have no firm racial definition. Kelly at least admitted in a later segment that controversy remains about whether Jesus was white. But Santa? The answer is ""white.""

Then we hit the trifecta when ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch and star Phil Robertson's anti-gay and anti-Black statements were quoted in a GQ Magazine interview. While he defended his anti-gay statements by quoting scripture, his anti-Black comments were more insidious. Claiming he understood Blacks because he and his family were ""white trash,"" Robertson insisted that Blacks were happier before the civil rights era: ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" In a few short sentences, Robertson managed to conflate race and social class and declare that he, a white man, knows how Blacks think and feel.



We don't want to add to the debate over whether any of these individuals or their comments was intentionally racist. The issue is more complex than what sounds like a racist comment. The comments each reflect the kind of racial thinking that shapes our understanding of the world in the U.S. Whether it's the belief that wealth corrupts whites while Blacks are born corrupt, or that Santa, like all iconic figures, is white, or that a white person who has some commonality with African-Americans knows what Blacks think or feel, these beliefs each normalize a vision of the world that is not necessarily shared by people of other races or cultural backgrounds. But as long as those of us who are in the dominant culture believe our thinking is natural and normal, we refuse to question it, even in the face of contrary evidence.

Yes, many commentators ridiculed the decision of the judge in the Affluenza case and Megyn Kelly's insistence that Santa is white and Phil Robertson's belief that Blacks were happier before the era of civil rights. But for all those who spoke up and questioned these beliefs, many still don't understand why they did. And many of those who did speak up might not know why the incidents reveal racial thinking. Often, we know something is wrong, but we don't know exactly why. Racial thinking is powerful precisely because it's normalized. If mainstream media and the shopping malls in American portray Santa as white, well... he must be white. Same for Jesus of Nazareth. We know these things to be true because these images repeat over and over. Santa is white, white people have money and money corrupts them, Blacks were happy before civil rights. In fact, Black people used to like white people -- after all, didn't Mammy love Scarlett in Gone with the Wind?"

Hawkins was forced to relive the nightmare of Gosnell%27s %22House of Horrors.%22

The abortion rights community has opposed legislation to regulate abortion clinics in Pennsylvania.

A Planned Parenthood representative admitted they knew the clinic was unsafe

""If I talk, maybe people will make sure it won't happen again.""

That's what 20-year-old Desiree Hawkins told me last week as she recounted the horror of visiting abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell in December 2009. The jury in Gosnell's trial for the alleged murders of multiple babies and one woman heard closing arguments Monday afternoon, but they won't hear from Hawkins.

Hawkins was forced to relive the nightmare of Gosnell's house of horrors when she was contacted by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent this year. The agent told her that one of the severed feet found in jars at the clinic belonged to her aborted baby. She was set to testify as a rebuttal witness against Gosnell until he chose to not take the stand.

When she was 16, Hawkins sought an abortion at a National Abortion Federation-certified abortion clinic, Hagerstown (Md.) Reproductive Health Services. The clinic told her she was 19 weeks pregnant and referred her to Gosnell. When she recently retrieved her file in anticipation of testifying, she was shocked that her sonogram showed she had in fact been at 21 weeks, which meant she would have been 23 weeks pregnant by the time Gosnell performed the abortion. ""I was so overwhelmed and hurt,"" said Hawkins. ""If I had known I was 23 weeks, I would have (chosen) adoption.""

She also would have avoided the trauma visited upon her by Gosnell. Hawkins described the licensed medical professional as laughing at her during the procedure as she cried and begged him to stop because of the pain. ""Stop being a baby,"" he said.

Hawkins experienced betrayal anew when she read the grand jury report replete with testimony of government officials admitting they ignored repeated complaints about Gosnell because they didn't want to limit access to abortion.

'People die'

Said Hawkins, ""What really got me was when the (health department official) just said, 'People die.' They just decided to look the other way."" She is passionate that ""someone needs to make sure all states' departments of health ... are preventing this from happening.""

Abortion rights advocates have asserted that Gosnell was an ""extreme outlier"" and opposed legislation to increase regulation of Pennsylvania abortion clinics as they have in other states. But how could they possibly know that this is an aberration?

Last week, Ohio officials shut down an abortion clinic after inspectors found that a medical assistant administered narcotics to five patients, that narcotics and powerful sedatives weren't properly accounted for, that pharmacy licenses had expired and that four staff members hadn't been screened for a communicable disease.

This month, a Delaware TV station reported that two Planned Parenthood nurses resigned in protest over conditions at a clinic there. One nurse, Jayne Mitchell-Werbrich, said, ""It was just unsafe. I couldn't tell you how ridiculously unsafe it was.""

Clinic closure drumbeat

Last month, Maryland officials shut down three abortion clinics, two for failings in their equipment and training to deal with life-threatening complications.

Last year, an Associated Press investigation found that Illinois hadn't inspected some abortion clinics for 10 to 15 years. After state health officials reinvigorated their clinic inspections in the wake of Gosnell, inspectors closed two clinics, including one fined for ""failure to perform CPR on a patient who died after a procedure,"" according to AP.

Such problems wouldn't be a shock to Pennsylvania state Rep. Margo Davidson, the only member of the Democratic black caucus to vote for the abortion-regulation bill passed there. She told me, ""We don't know how many (Gosnells) there are. I'm not trying to overturn Roe v. Wade, but if a woman makes this difficult choice, she should at least be afforded the highest level of care."" She said the choice community knew what was going on and did nothing.

Indeed, the grand jury found that the National Abortion Federation inspected Gosnell's clinic, refused to certify him, but didn't tell anyone. Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood representative Dayle Steinberg has admitted that its officials knew the clinic was unsafe after women complained. What did they do? ""We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health.""

Davidson concluded that for the choice community, ""the institution was more important than the individual lives."" Davidson knows firsthand what can happen when people choose to look the other way: Her 22-year-old cousin died after an abortion at Gosnell's clinic.

She is the author of ""Heart of the Cross: A Postcolonial Christology.""

A recent open letter to the Christian evangelical church, signed by a wide array of Asian-American scholars and Christian practitioners, complained of numerous racially offensive incidents in evangelical circles. In yet another sign of callousness, Asian-Americans were initially told, in effect, to “get over it.” Instead, it is U.S. white Christians who must “get over” their whiteness and their failure to see the already changed face of Christian faith.

By 2040 the racial demographics of this country will no longer be predominantly white. If any church group, including U.S. evangelicals, wishes to stay apace with this momentous change, and welcome nonwhite members, its leaders and members must listen to the experiences of these new groups.

White evangelicals must stop clinging to an alibi of color-blindness. Growth within 'their' churches depends on nonwhite members.

Among Asian-Americans, the fastest-growing immigrant group in the U.S., 42 percent self-identify as Christian, 15 to 20 percent as “evangelicals” or “born again.” They attend religious services more often than white evangelical counterparts.

If U.S. evangelical Protestant churches – now 81 percent white, according to 2012 Pew research – hope to become a more diverse representation of all the people of God, they must respond more positively to constructive criticism like that in the recent open letter.

But persistent use of derogatory racial stereotypes by many white evangelical churches continues to surface in a variety of ways, among leaders, at religious events, in church practices and, painfully often, in church curricula.

It is the conceit of religious white racism to presume that one’s evangelicalism transcends racial and cultural identities, making such “worldly” labels no longer important. The letter reminds church leaders that those identities still matter. White evangelical Christians must stop clinging to an alibi of color-blindness and recognize that vibrant growth within “their” churches has much to do with nonwhite members’ views of them.

Obama has brought in a lot of women, including two he appointed to the Supreme Court, but it is more than an “optics” problem, to use the irritating cliché of the moment. Word from the White House is that the president himself is irritated, and demanding answers about the faces his staff is pushing forward. Unfortunately, he has only a bunch of white guys to offer an explanation of why the picture looks like a bunch of white guys.

Right from the start, the president who pledged “Change We Can Believe In” has been so cautious about change that there have been periodic eruptions from women and minorities.

Maybe Obama thinks he’s such a huge change for the nation to digest that everything else must look like the Eisenhower administration, with Michelle obligingly playing Laura Petrie. But it’s Barry tripping over the ottoman.

In more “He’s Like Ike” moments, the president spends his free time golfing with white male junior aides. The mood got sour early in the first term when senior female aides had a dinner to gripe directly to Obama about lack of access and getting elbowed out of big policy debates.

Some women around Obama who say that he never empowers women to take charge of anything are privately gratified at the latest kerfuffle, hoping it will shut down the West Wing man cave. It’s particularly galling because the president won re-election — and a record number of women ascended to Congress — on the strength of high-toned denunciations of the oldfangled Mitt Romney and the Republican kamikaze raid on women.

“We don’t have to order up some binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women” to excel in all fields, the president said on the trail, vowing to unfurl the future for “our daughters.”"

Lawmakers disagree sharply on this front, which could drive debate as they begin formal work on the bill Thursday.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., points out that the proposal says applicants would not qualify for at least 10-13 years -- and would not qualify for another five years after getting a green card, under current law.

Further, Rubio argues that the proposal has ""very specific"" rules governing anyone who could be considered a ""public charge,"" or someone who would live off the government dole.

""If you are a public charge, you don't even qualify for renewal of that temporary status that you're getting,"" Rubio said.

But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., another Republican senator who has emerged as one of the chief critics of the bill, says the law does not properly enforce that provision.

Sessions told Fox News that the so-called ""public charge"" law, as currently written, has been ""totally ignored"" to date. And he argued that many immigrants will be eligible for benefits much sooner than proponents claim -- including the so-called ""dreamers,"" young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. their parents.

Sessions said 2-3 million illegal immigrants who claim that status will be able to have access to federal benefits in five years.

And, he added, eventually ""everyone who entered illegally will be able to accept any benefits this country offers.""

After the 15-year waiting period, the number accessing federal benefits could be an additional 10 or 11 million.

Nevertheless, Rubio insists there will be checks at every stage of the process.

""When you re-apply at the six-year mark, by the way you're not eligible for any public benefits at that point, you have to prove you're not a public charge,"" he said.

A controversial report released earlier this week by the conservative Heritage Foundation estimated that, under the bill, the total cost of legalizing 11 million illegal immigrants could approach $6.3 trillion over the course of their lifetimes. The study factored in taxes those immigrants would pay, but also the services and other benefits that would be spent on them.

It has come under heavy scrutiny from some conservative economists who say it ignored significant factors - like the possibility of some of these illegal immigrants moving up the income ladder after coming out of the shadows, while expanding the economy and boosting federal tax revenue.

Sessions and other critics are unconvinced.

""We respect people who want to come to America. We believe that we should accept immigrants,"" Sessions said. ""But we've got to be realistic about the impact.""

As the debate wages on, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Wednesday offered an amendment to end the dispute -- by proposing to let illegal immigrants stay but deny them from ever receiving any ""means-tested benefits,"" or welfare."

(CNN) —

The number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% in the past two years, according to a Pentagon report released Tuesday.

The Defense Department estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of “unwanted sexual contact,” a huge jump from the 19,300 figure in the 2010 report.

“Sexual assault is a despicable crime and one of the most serious challenges facing this department,” Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters at a briefing on the survey. “It’s a threat to the safety and the welfare of our people and to the health, reputation and trust of this institution.”

The actual number of sexual crimes reported in the fiscal year 2012 was 3,374, a 6% increase over the previous year, the report said. Military officials worry that many victims don’t come forward because they are frightened of retaliation. But the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past.

After officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions

Hagel said victims need to be made confident they can rely on the military’s justice system and that commanders will be held responsible.

On Tuesday, lawmakers reiterated that it’s crucial that service members feel they can come forward when they’ve been violated.

The Defense Department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a special victims unit to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit.

But President Obama stressed that there must be a harder push in the military to reduce sexual assaults involving service members.

“I don’t want just more speeches or awareness programs or training but … if we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff, they are going to be held accountable,” Obama said. “Prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period. It is not acceptable.”

Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, the head of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office for the military, said that while the prevalence rate was “unacceptably high,” the report did indicate one positive trend. The percentage of people who initially filed restricted reports (That remain confidential) but changed to unrestricted had risen.

After sex assault case, Hagel seeks changes to military legal process

“We see that as a sign of victim confidence, willingness to … take their case into the law enforcement realm,” he said.

The Defense Department data from 2010 to 2012 found that the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact increased for active duty women and remained unchanged for active duty men, and men and women in the reserves.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, top Air Force officials faced questions at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about an Air Force officer accused of sexual assault.

Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, served as a branch chief for the service’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. He was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend and had been removed from current duty, an Air Force official said Monday. The official declined to be named because it is an ongoing law enforcement matter.

Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley what qualified Krusinski for the job in the sex assault prevention program.

Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and has spent the last two-and-a-half years working on Air Force staff in policy, Welsh replied.

“He was a force support squadron commander before coming to the Pentagon.” Force support squadron addresses issues such as sexual assault coordination councils in active Air Force units, Welsh said. “He’s been around the business his entire career as a personnel officer.”

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York had strong words.

“If the man in charge for the Air Force in preventing sexual assault is being alleged to have committed a sexual assault this weekend obviously there’s a failing in training and understanding of what sexual assault is and how corrosive and damaging it is to good order and discipline and how it is undermining the credibility of the greatest military force in the world,” she said. “This is not good enough.”

McCaskill pressed Donley and Welsh.

“Did you look at his file for any kind of problems related – I mean, clearly, the accusation is that he was drunk and sexually attacked a complete stranger in a parking lot,” McCaskill said. “It is hard for me to believe that someone would be accused of that behavior by a complete stranger and not have anything in their file that would indicate a problem in that regard.

“Have you looked at his file and determined that his file was absolutely pristine?” the senator asked.

Military rape victims: Stop blaming us

“Senator, I looked at his officer record of performance which is all I could access last night. I talked to his current supervisor,” Welsh said. “I haven’t talked to people who knew him or supervised him in the past. There is no indication in his professional record of performance or his current work place that there’s any type of a problem like this.”

Earlier Tuesday, Welsh said sexual assault response efforts are critically important to the Air Force and the branch “would not quit working this problem.”

In March, members of the military who were sexually assaulted gave dramatic and anguished testimony to congressional lawmakers.

A former Army specialist described being raped in two different instances while she was in the service and how she felt that the military’s chain of command was failing at consistently prosecuting and convicting offenders.

At that hearing, high-ranking members of each branch assured lawmakers that they were working hard to end sexual assault in the armed forces.

Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, an Air Force judge advocate general, told lawmakers that the branch started a program in January that provides airmen who report being victimized with an attorney to represent them.

The attorneys operate independently of the prosecution’s chain of command, he said.

(CNN) —

The extraordinary revelation this week that the Internal Revenue Service targeted tea party groups for more aggressive enforcement highlights exactly why caution is needed in any response to the much-vilified Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC.

It also shows how all Americans, from the most liberal to the most conservative, should closely guard their First Amendment rights, and why giving the government too much power to limit political speech will inevitably result in selective enforcement against unpopular groups.

To the agency’s credit, Lois Lerner, a senior official at the IRS, apologized on Friday for these unconstitutional practices, which are as unseemly as the Bush administration’s targeting of the NAACP and the House of Representatives’ defunding of Planned Parenthood on purely political grounds.

ACLU Michael Macleod-Ball

Gabe Rottman

Lerner said that career IRS staff who were reviewing applicants for tax-exempt status took a harder look at applications with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names. She stressed that the added scrutiny was done as a “shortcut,” not out of “political bias.” But her admission calls into question earlier claims by the agency that IRS scrutiny wasn’t politically motivated, and it comes in the face of repeated complaints by right-wing groups that they have been treated unfairly.

Collins says IRS revelations will fuel distrust in government

Before addressing the obvious constitutional concerns with the selective use of the tax code against political opponents, here’s some background.

Certain public interest groups, like charities and nonprofit athletic organizations, do not have to pay federal income tax on their donations or dues. These tax-exempt groups include 501(c)(4) organizations (named for the relevant section of the code). To qualify, a group must be “operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare.” The definition of “social welfare” is broad, and applies to all points of view. The ACLU’s lobbying arm, for which we work, is a 501(c)(4). So is the National Right to Life Committee.

These social welfare groups are forbidden from engaging in too much partisan political activity. How much is too much, however, is controversial and remains uncertain. An organization that crosses over the fuzzy line will be denied tax-exempt status.

Crucially, 501(c)(4) organizations, in most cases, need not publicly disclose their donors. That policy is driven by the same concerns that prompted the Supreme Court in a civil rights-era case, NAACP v. Alabama, to prohibit that state from forcing the NAACP to out its members as a condition of operating. The court reasoned, rightly, that such disclosure could lead to violence against existing members and would dissuade potential members from joining at all.

Now, during the past couple of elections there has been a surge in applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. Some argue that these new groups are being created specifically to help elect or defeat candidates, which would otherwise prompt full donor disclosure to the Federal Election Commission.

Opponents claim these groups are abusively claiming tax-exempt status to keep their donor lists secret. Some further claim that these groups then allow wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to anonymously funnel large amounts of money into ads supporting or attacking political candidates.

As a consequence, the IRS has been under enormous pressure to speed up and aggressively investigate applications for tax-exempt status – both reasonable demands, if carried out impartially. But much of this outside pressure has come from the left and has been directed at conservative groups, who have an advantage in this “dark” political money.

It sounds as though the events surrounding the IRS announcement can be partly attributed to this growth in applications and the pressure to uncover “sham” 501(c)(4) groups.

Although the IRS claims this was an honest mistake, these revelations are troubling on many levels. For instance, there are several proposals circulating in Washington right now that would make it much easier for the IRS and other regulators to force political groups to disclose their donors. These disclosure requirements would apply even when the group is advocating purely on an issue of public interest, from clean air to abortion, and would apply to groups of all political persuasions and not just to groups supporting or opposing candidates for office.

The ACLU has expressed concern with these disclosure requirements precisely because they open the door to selective enforcement. Such concerns are often dismissed as speculative and overly pessimistic, but the IRS apology shows that concerns over selective enforcement are prescient. Those in power will always be tempted to use political speech restrictions against opposing candidates or causes.

The IRS announcement demonstrates that we should carefully consider any new policy that allows the government to restrict or chill political speech, including broader donor disclosure requirements. Congress and the administration should also act immediately to create ironclad checks on the IRS to prevent this from ever happening again.

It shouldn’t need to be said: Even the tea party deserves First Amendment protection.

http://news.yahoo.com/colo-governor-delays-convicted-killers-execution-211104345.html,,[],Colo. governor delays convicted killer's execution,"DENVER (AP) — Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper indefinitely delayed the execution of convicted killer Nathan Dunlap on Wednesday and said he was unlikely to allow it as long as he is governor.

Hickenlooper stopped short of converting the death sentence to life in prison, as Dunlap's lawyers had requested.

Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said he had doubts about the fairness of Colorado's death penalty system and about the state's ability to get the lethal drugs required for an execution.

Republicans derided his decision as no decision at all, with Attorney General John Suthers saying the reprieve guaranteed ""continued suffering and delayed justice"" for families of Dunlap's victims.

""He took a coward's way out,"" said Melinda Cromar, whose 19-year-old sister Sylvia Crowell was among those killed by Dunlap. ""I am just so angry.""

Dunlap, 38, was convicted and sentenced to die in 1996 for the ambush slayings of Crowell and three others in a Denver-area restaurant. Hickenlooper's action essentially guarantees Dunlap will survive through Jan. 13, 2015, the last day of Hickenlooper's first term. Hickenlooper plans to run for re-election, and the reprieve is sure to be a campaign issue.

Dunlap, whose execution was scheduled for the week of Aug. 18, had requested clemency, which would have removed the possibility of execution and changed his sentence to life without parole.

Dunlap could conceivably be executed one day if a Colorado governor lifts the reprieve.

Hickenlooper's announcement frustrated and angered the current top prosecutor in the district where Dunlap was convicted.

""He could have made a decision I disagreed with. He could have made a decision I agreed with. But to not make a decision is an injustice,"" District Attorney George Brauchler said.

""One person will go to bed with a smile on his face, and that's Nathan Dunlap, and that's due to one person,"" Brauchler said.

Madeline Cohen, one of Dunlap's attorneys, expressed relief.

""I'm very, very glad that the governor has decided not to go forward and has recognized how many problems there are in the system,"" she said.

Story continues

Hickenlooper said he considered the decision carefully.

""We heard a variety of sides and obviously this has weighed heavily on me for well over a year now,"" he said at a news conference.

Dunlap has acknowledged fatally shooting four employees — three of them teenagers — who were cleaning a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant after hours in the Denver suburb of Aurora.

Dunlap, then 19, had recently lost a job there as a cook. On the night of Dec. 14, 1993, he hid in a bathroom until the restaurant closed, then shot and killed Crowell; Ben Grant, 17; Colleen O'Connor, 17; and Margaret Kohlberg, a 50-year-old mother who was on her first day on the job.

Each was shot in the head. A co-worker Bobby Stephens, then 20, was also shot in the head, but he survived and testified against Dunlap.

One victim was down on her knees and begging for her life when Dunlap shot her.

Dunlap lost his last mandatory appeal in February. His lawyers petitioned Hickenlooper for clemency and filed other lawsuits challenging the sentence and execution process.

In his reprieve, Hickenlooper said Colorado's capital punishment system is flawed, citing a study that showed the death penalty was sought and imposed inconsistently across the state.

He also said the state doesn't have the drugs in place to carry out an execution by lethal injection, and that many states and nations are repealing the death penalty.

Hickenlooper's reprieve order mostly referred to Dunlap by his state prison number.

""I don't use his name. I haven't with any of these mass killings because I don't think he needs any more notoriety,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference.

Dunlap's attorneys previously released a video and written statement in which Dunlap apologized.

They also said he had undiagnosed bipolar disorder at the time of the shootings.

""Mr. Dunlap was grateful,"" his attorney Philip Cherner said after Hickenlooper's announcement. ""His expressions of remorse were genuine. He is truly sad for what happened.""

""This is not a day to celebrate,"" Cherner said.

""Mr. Dunlap faces the rest of his life in a cell that's about the size of two king-sized beds, and he gets out for about an hour a day.""

That is the question the court is facing this week in the case of Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.

The court last considered an affirmative action case out of Michigan in 2003, when it upheld the race-conscious admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. In response to that ruling, opponents of affirmative action put on the ballot an amendment to the State Constitution banning any consideration of race or sex in public education. Michigan voters approved the amendment in 2006, and since then black undergraduate enrollment at the University of Michigan is down 33 percent.

Advocates of affirmative action sued the state on grounds that the amendment violates the United States Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. They argued that it impermissibly altered the political process that determines admissions policies in a way that places special burdens on racial minorities.

For instance, an applicant who wants alumni connections to be considered in admissions could ask the admissions committee to adopt that policy, or she could lobby the university administration or its popularly elected governing board. But an applicant who wants the university to consider race as a factor has only one path available: to work to pass a new amendment that repeals the anti-affirmative-action amendment — which a federal appeals court called “a lengthy, expensive and arduous process.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/18/Conservatives-to-Paul-Ryan-Don-t-Commit-Political-Suicide-by-Following-Rubio-on-Immigration,2013-07-18 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Conservatives to Paul Ryan: Don't Follow in Rubio's Footsteps on Immigration,"As the House begins to take up comprehensive immigration reform legislation, Richard Viguerie’s Conservative HQ sent a warning to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI): don’t commit political suicide by becoming the House’s version of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).

“We are still astonished and disappointed in how Florida Senator Marco Rubio squandered his conservative and Tea Party movement base by becoming the face of S. 744 – [the Senate’s bill],” the outlet wrote on Thursday.

Rubio’s support among conservatives and Republicans has plummeted since he championed the Senate’s bill, and he has not mentioned the bill since it passed the Senate more than three weeks ago.

Conservative HQ does not want to see Ryan meet the same fate. The site’s staff members write that “it looks like another promising Republican,” Ryan, “is about to follow Rubio down the plank and over the side into the shark-infested waters of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.” Ryan, they argue, “should be smarter than to get sucked-into supporting anything remotely resembling the corrupt pork and special interest favor bloated Senate bill.”

Ryan recently told the Associated Press that he is keeping in touch with the House’s “Gang of Seven,” a group of bipartisan lawmakers focusing on immigration law. The “Gang” includes Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), who said Ryan is his “guiding light. I know I get him in trouble every time I say it.” Ryan has also clashed with conservative talk radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin about the immigration bill’s impact on working-class Americans.

Senior White House aides reportedly “often mention” Ryan “as crucial to the prospects for legislation this year” and hope that Ryan could “sway recalcitrant House members.” In addition, Ryan is associated with business and Catholic groups who are “backing an overhaul of immigration laws.” The Associated Press states Ryan urged House Republicans in a closed-door meeting last week to seize the moment to pass sweeping immigration reform.

Conservative HQ claims that Ryan has a “penchant for granting the kind of deference to the interests of the establishment Republican Party’s corporate paymasters,” which include the “shills for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the cheap labor opportunists and the inside-the-Beltway party hacks of the ‘buy the Hispanic vote’ wing of the Republican Party.”

According to Conservative HQ, while Tea Partiers and conservatives want to have honest discussions about how to solve the country’s immigration problem but are wary of harmful side effects which could result from the current legislative push:

What they are not prepared to do is dole out millions of dollars in slush funds to radical Hispanic political organizations like La Raza, grant vast new powers to the federal executive branch, insulate it from Congressional direction and oversight, bring millions of new clients for the welfare state from illegal and ineligible for benefits status to legal and eligible for benefits status and grant blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants who are in jail.

The authors urge Ryan to preserve his political capital and reject attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation akin to the Senate bill.

“We welcome Paul Ryan to the debate on how best to apply conservative principles to immigration reform – something that eluded Senator Rubio,” Conservative HQ writes. “However, if Paul Ryan wants to avoid Marco Rubio’s fate he must begin by publicly and forcefully rejecting the corruption, pork and special interest favors of Rubio’s Gang of Eight bill.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/court-hears-doma-arguments-heightened-atmosphere-161014844.html,,[],Court hears DOMA arguments in tense atmosphere,"The Supreme Court spent a second day hearing arguments about another potential ruling on same-sex marriage, as it considers the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Early reports indicate a tense court room and more attention on Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Source: Chris Walton (Flickr).

The DOMA case doesn’t involve a basic question about an equal right to marriage, since the couples who challenged that law are already legally married in their states.

The hearings concluded early Wednesday afternoon. Listen to the official audio from today’s oral arguments here (audio will be available Wednesday afternoon).

Early reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that the court’s conservative justices were critical of the Obama administration’s refusal to defend DOMA in court.

In one exchange, Chief Justice John Roberts said the Obama administration should have the “courage” to defend DOMA, rather than let the Supreme Court decide who has the ability to defend the law.

But Justice Kennedy, a key swing vote on the court, also voiced concerns about the ability of the federal government to define marriages for the states.

SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein said on his Twitter account that he believed after seeing the arguments that there was an 80 percent chance the court would strike down DOMA.

The question at hand is if Congress has the constitutional power to deny married same-sex couples benefits given to opposite-sex couples under about 1,100 federal programs or services.

DOMA was passed by Congress in 1996 after fears that Hawaii’s Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. The federal benefits denied by DOMA to married same-sex couples include the right to file a joint tax return and to obtain a Social Security death benefit.

The case is United States v. Windsor. Edith Windsor is contesting a requirement that she pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes inherited from her late same-sex married partner, which she wouldn’t have been obligated to pay if she were married to a man.

Story continues

On Tuesday, the court heard arguments about Proposition 8, a law in California barring same-sex marriages that was later overturned by two other courts.

Like Proposition 8, the justices were expected to hear arguments in the DOMA case about whether the case had legal standing and could even be considered by the high court.

The Obama administration decided not to defend DOMA in court in 2011, and instead several Republican congressional leaders pursued the defense.

Under the Constitution’s Article III, the court must have before it a live “case or controversy,” with a party on each side with a direct, not a theoretical, interest in the outcome.

In the DOMA case, Republican leaders have challenged the right of the federal government to appeal, and the federal government has challenged the GOP leaders’ right to make a defense of DOMA.

What’s unknown at this point is if the Supreme Court, when it issues rulings in late June, will take any stance on the same-sex marriage issue, aside from agreeing to hear the DOMA and Proposition 8 cases.

Some observers of the Proposition 8 hearings on Tuesday believed the court could say in June that the Prop 8 case didn’t have standing, and it would be invalidated or returned to a lower court.

But others believe the court could have a logic that is shared between the Prop 8 and DOMA cases.

Still others point back to last year’s instant analysis of the Supreme Court’s hearings on the Affordable Care Act. In March 2012, pundits were forecasting the ACA would be struck down by the justices, based on their line of questioning in the hearings. But in June 2012, most of the ACA stood intact after the court’s ruling. Two of the attorneys in court on Wednesday for the DOMA case also argued the ACA case last year: U.S. Solicitor General Don Verrilli Jr. and former Solicitor General Paul Clement.

USATODAY

This was only the latest attack on the news media under Holder's leadership.

His value to President Obama has been his absolute loyalty.

The feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama's sins.

Recently, Attorney General Eric Holder appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the administration's sweeping surveillance of journalists with the Associated Press. In the greatest attack on the free press in decades, the Justice Department seized phone records for reporters and editors in at least three AP offices as well as its office in the House of Representatives. Holder, however, proceeded to claim absolute and blissful ignorance of the investigation, even failing to recall when or how he recused himself.

Yet, this was only the latest attack on the news media under Holder's leadership. Despite his record, he expressed surprise at the hearing that the head of the Republican National Committee had called for his resignation. After all, Holder pointed out, he did nothing. That is, of course, precisely the point. Unlike the head of the RNC, I am neither a Republican nor conservative, and I believe Holder should be fired.

The 'sin eater'

Holder's refusal to accept responsibility for the AP investigation was something of a change for the political insider. His value to President Obama has been his absolute loyalty. Holder is what we call a ""sin eater"" inside the Beltway — high-ranking associates who shield presidents from responsibility for their actions. Richard Nixon had H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Ronald Reagan had Oliver North and Robert ""Bud"" McFarlane. George W. Bush had the ultimate sin eater: Dick Cheney, who seemed to have an insatiable appetite for sins to eat.

This role can be traced to 18th century Europe, when families would use a sin eater to clean the moral record of a dying person by eating bread from the person's chest and drinking ale passed over his body. Back then, the ritual's power was confined to removing minor sins.

For Obama, there has been no better sin eater than Holder. When the president promised CIA employees early in his first term that they would not be investigated for torture, it was the attorney general who shielded officials from prosecution. When the Obama administration decided it would expand secret and warrantless surveillance, it was Holder who justified it. When the president wanted the authority to kill any American he deemed a threat without charge or trial, it was Holder who went public to announce the ""kill list"" policy.

Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that it was Holder who personally approved the equally abusive search of Fox News correspondent James Rosen's e-mail and phone records in another story involving leaked classified information. In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as ""an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the leaking of classified materials. The Justice Department even investigated Rosen's parents' telephone number, and Holder was there to justify every attack on the news media.

Ignoble legacy

Yet, at this month's hearing, the attorney general had had his fill. Accordingly, Holder adopted an embarrassing mantra of ""I have no knowledge"" and ""I had no involvement"" throughout the questioning. When he was not reciting the equivalent to his name, rank and serial number, he was implicating his aide, Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Cole, it appears, is Holder's sin eater. Holder was so busy denying responsibility for today's scandals, he began denying known facts about older scandals, such as the ""Fast and Furious"" gun operation.

In the end, Holder was the best witness against his continuing in office. His insistence that he did nothing was a telling moment. The attorney general has done little in his tenure to protect civil liberties or the free press. Rather, Holder has supervised a comprehensive erosion of privacy rights, press freedom and due process. This ignoble legacy was made possible by Democrats who would look at their shoes whenever the Obama administration was accused of constitutional abuses.

On Thursday, Obama responded to the outcry over the AP and Fox scandals by calling for an investigation by ... you guessed it ... Eric Holder. He ordered Holder to meet with news media representatives to hear their ""concerns"" and report back to him. He sent his old sin eater for a confab with the very targets of the abusive surveillance. Such an inquiry offers no reason to trust its conclusions.

The feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama's sins despite his effort to feign ignorance. It did not matter that Holder is the sin eater who has lost his stomach or that such mortal sins are not so easily digested. Indeed, these sins should be fatal for any attorney general.

Appearing on FoxNews to defend the bill’s security provisions, Rove singled out a Breitbart story which appeared Friday as “simply not true.” Rove’s criticism, however, was factually incorrect.

The article Rove attacked, detailed a new provision in the then-Corker-Hoeven amendment which would allow immigrants on work visas who overstayed their visas to still apply for a green card. In other words, breaking immigration law in the future would not prevent someone from getting on the “path to citizenship.”

Rove claimed the article “turned out simply not to be true. It was very narrow provision that said if you’re from one of nine countries that get what’s called ‘Temporary Protective Status’ because of war or conflict inside your country, and you’ve been employed for ten years, the last ten years, you can, like every other person who’s here in the United States get in line to become a citizen, ultimately at the back of the line, and can’t happen for another ten years and so forth.” (emphasis added)

Rove, like many supporters of the Senate bill, clearly has not read the entire bill or simply misunderstands it. The language discussed in the Breitbart article had nothing to do with the TPS program or refugees from war-torn countries. The amendment allowing visa-overstays applies to the overwhelming majority of future immigrants in this country, what’s called the Merit Track-2 path. The CBO estimates that more than half the current 11 million illegals in this country will take this path to citizenship.

That is not a “very narrow provision.” Rove’s attempt to attack the Breitbart News article was totally inaccurate and wrong."

The Jews have an expression: he who saves a life saves the whole world. I sometimes think that we could use a few more scoundrels. We could use a few more people who are notorious sinners—if, in fact, they would intervene on behalf of human life. I ask you, who is the most righteous? Is it the person who sings the loudest, who prays the longest? Is it the person who has memorized the most Bible verses, but never lifts a finger to intervene on behalf of another human being's life or death? Or is the person who maybe has a lifestyle that is less than desirable, but who, when it really counts, is willing to stand between life and death for other human beings?

Let us pause for this brief reminder of Huckabee's own words:

Okay, then, let's continue:



And now we're called into this incredible holocaust of our own in America. Fifty-five million babies. Fifty-five million babies since 1973 have died in what ought to be the safest place in the world: their mothers' womb. And it's become one of the most dangerous places for a baby to be. For us, this is not about the politics of Democrat and Republican, winning and losing. It's about our capacity to one day stand before a holy god and give an account for whether we stood between life and death for those who had no voice but ours, who had no hands to raise and say ""no"" except ours.

The report, titled ""Deadly Delivery,"" notes that the likelihood of a woman's dying in childbirth in the U.S. is ﬁve times as great as in Greece, four times as great as in Germany and three times as great as in Spain. Every day in the U.S., more than two women die of pregnancy-related causes, with the maternal mortality ratio doubling from 6.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 1987 to 13.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2006.

I want to mention today that the heart of the pro-life movement is not about trying to end abortion as much as it is to try to help people understand that abortion ends when we elevate every human life as a life of value. And the ultimate goal, and the message that we must articulate, is there is no such thing as a life that is expendable, disposable and unworthy of being treated with dignity and respect. Our founders said it eloquently in the Declaration of Independence. ""We hold these things, these truths, to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" It is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.

And our founders recognized this—though they didn't get it all right, they understood that all of us have a sense of equality because our equality comes from the fact that we have our roots and our origins, not merely by human hands, but that our creation is the result of a divine intervention. And they saw it that way. We're all created equal. Endowed by our creator with those unalienable rights. It is not the job of government to give life or to decide who gets to take it. It is the job of government to protect that which God has given us responsibility for, and in the case of an unborn child, it is the life of those most vulnerable that it is our duty to protect and to seek to preserve.

Now, we've spent, for the last 40 years in this country, since Roe v. Wade, we've taught the idea that life can be expendable if the life represents a social disruption or a financial hardship on the biological mother. I mean, that's the basis of abortion on demand. Well, I can't really carry this baby because I'd have to drop out of college. I can't carry the baby because it would cost me a promotion at work. I can't carry the baby because my mother would be furious at me if she finds out I'm pregnant. My father will never understand this. So for the purpose of our social disruptions, or sometimes for financial hardships, I can't afford the baby.

I understand the hardship, but I think we've got to be very careful never to be condemning of that young lady in the most painful and difficult moment of her life. I'm so grateful for what Marla said here today. It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful, and her own story is a powerful one. The story of a frightened young girl having to make a very tough decision, and in her case, making the right one. And we shouldn't be condemning of those who make a different one. We should reach out to them with the same message of grace and redemption, but never waiver from our message that life is precious.

Now think about if we instill, as we have in this culture of ours, the notion that life is disposable if it represents financial hardships or social disruptions. Here's what we've told the generation coming after us, the generation of my children and now my grandchildren. We've told them that if they were expendable at that end of the spectrum of life because they just were going to be too expensive, or because they represented for us having to mess up our calendars, then we have now told them that at the other end of the spectrum of life, when they become our caretakers, we've already now given them permission. In fact, we have given them full rights to end our lives, because I guarantee you, at that end of the spectrum, we will be a financial hardship to them, and we will represent a social disruption when they have to give up their weekends to come check on us in the long-term care center, and when they have to write the check every month for all of that expensive care that we're going to end up costing.

Now, I don't know about you, but I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to make it much tougher for my kids to get rid of me than that. I'm telling you now, I am not going to go easily.

And now for a little fact-checking interruption about why wombs are no safe haven. In 2010, Amnesty International released a report about the ""maternal health crisis"" in America:The report also found that ""one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care,"" and that the majority of those deaths were easily preventable with improved access to affordable health care. Those unborn children, for whom Huckabee claims to be so concerned, are denied basic and necessary care even before they're born. That is what makes wombs so dangerous—and it has nothing to do with abortion.Remember:While Huckabee and his fellow conservatives may claim to believe it is the government's job to protect the unborn, they don't think the government has any business doing a damned thing for the born. That's why conservatives have fought against the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, early childhood education, nutritional assistance programs, child labor laws—basically anything that protects and provides for children—because of empty catch-phrases like ""free market"" and ""self-reliance"" and ""bootstraps.""While Huckabee so easily and dismissively scoffs at the reasons why women might want to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, there's one young woman's name he should learn : Spring Adams, who died at the age of 13, when her father, who had raped and impregnated her, shot and killed her in her sleep after finding out she planned to obtain an abortion.It's almost impressive the way Huckabee first ridicules and condemns the reasons women might choose an abortion, and then, in the very next breath, insists that these women should not be condemned—and then, in the breath after that, continues to condemn them for making what he considers the ""wrong"" choice. This is what passes for his ""message of grace.""It's curious, to say the least, that Huckabee is concerned that his children and grandchildren might prefer to off him rather than write out those expensive checks to the nursing home. But if his concern is genuine—which, you can be sure from his laughter, it isn't—he might want to have a conversation with his own Republican Party. It's his party, after all, that is so eager to cut or eliminate entirely the very programs, like Social Security and Medicare and even Meals on Wheels, that would ease the financial burden of caring for Huckabee in his old age. But conservatives don't believe in preserving that social safety net; after all, the government only has an obligation to protect and provide for you while you're still in the womb. After that, you're on your own.And then the room fills with laughter. Oh, what a wonderful speech. Oh, what a charming man. Oh, what a great voice for a movement that believes it is better to let women die than spend a single government dollar on their health care or the health care of their children once they are born. Toss in some basic shaming of the choices women make, an outrageous comparison to genocide, and voila. There's your ""pro-life"" movement, neatly summed up by one of its most charismatic leaders, because every single life has value, and ""it is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.""

In a speech Tuesday in Phoenix, Obama will call for transitioning the business model of Fannie and Freddie into a system where ""private capital must be wiped out before the government pays on any form of catastrophic guarantee,"" a senior administration official said.

Obama will also renew his calls for sweeping mortgage refinancing legislation when he travels to Phoenix Tuesday. Arizona's desert capital was the epicenter of the housing crisis that began in 2008, but the market there has rebounded strongly, with home prices up and foreclosures down.

The president's visit to Phoenix marks the latest stop on his summertime economic tour aimed at refocusing his agenda on middle class Americans still struggling to fully recover following the recession. The collapse of the housing market in particular had a dramatic impact on people's lives and the economic viability of communities across the country.

""So many Americans across the country view their own economic and financial circumstances through their homes and whether they own a home, whether their home is underwater, whether they feel like they have equity in their homes,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday.

Senior administration officials said Obama would focus in Phoenix on shifting more of the burden for supporting the nation's massive mortgage market to the private sector. A centerpiece of that effort is his support for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The White House has already lauded efforts to achieve that goal spearheaded by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. While Obama will outline his own proposals on Tuesday, his plans are largely in line with the bipartisan Senate overhaul.

Officials said Obama will insist that the government only step in to pay out mortgage guarantees after private capital has been exhausted and that private capital bear the substantial majority of any losses. He will also call for Fannie and Freddie's investment portfolios to be wound down by at least 15 percent per year.

Obama advisers did not outline a specific timeframe for winding down Fannie and Freddie. The Corker-Warner legislation would shutter the operations within five years.

Fannie and Freddie were nationalized during the 2008 financial collapse and bailed out with $187 billion in taxpayer-funded loans. The two enterprises don't directly make loans, but buy mortgages from lenders, package them as bonds, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors.

Fannie and Freddie currently own or guarantee half of all U.S. mortgages and back nearly 90 percent of new ones.

Jared Bernstein, a former member of Obama’s economic team, told The Wall Street Journal the president is putting a marker down ""that says there's a need for a government backstop for the secondary mortgage market, one whose magnitude is still to be determined.""

Against the backdrop of Phoenix's reinvigorated housing market, Obama will also tout refinancing proposals that gained little traction on Capitol Hill when he first unveiled them last year. Among his proposals is a call for expanding refinancing eligibility for homeowners who do not have government-backed mortgages.

The president will also look to link his housing proposals to immigration reform, his top second term legislative priority. Officials said he will argue that legal immigration can stimulate the housing market, noting that immigrants accounted for 40 percent of new homeowners nationwide between 2000 and 2010, according to the Obama administration.

The officials insisted on anonymity in order to preview the president's remarks ahead of his trip.

The nationwide housing recovery has been providing critical support to the economy at a time when manufacturing and business investment have stagnated. Steady job growth and low mortgage rates in the past year have also fueled more home sales. The increased demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed home prices higher. That's encouraged builders to start more homes and create more construction jobs.

The recovery in Phoenix is emblematic of the larger improvements happening in many parts of the country.

Just two years ago, the region was in the throes of the worst housing collapse in the country, with prices down nearly 60 percent from their June 2006 peak and banks foreclosing on 70,000 homeowners a year. While the current median home price remains below peak, the levels have risen 66 percent from September 2011. Buyers are plentiful and homes for sale scarce, leading to bidding wars for resale homes.

Yes, in the land of six-guns, cattle rustling and Enron, handing a sandwich to a homeless person in a city park or serving a bowl of soup in a rented storefront can earn you a $500 fine. Some charitable organizations, financially unable to risk the fines, have relocated outside the city.

Last week, Houston police ticketed a homeless man for trying to feed himself by fishing a donut from a trash bin in a public park.

James Kelly, a nine-year Navy veteran, was issued a citation for violating a peculiar law on the books since 1942, and amended as recently as 2002, that makes it illegal to “remove any contents of any bin, bag or other container that has been placed for collection of garbage, trash or recyclable materials.”

“I know on the face of it, it sounds very cruel,” Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, said, claiming that most police officers would not cite someone for simply taking food from a dumpster.

Yes, Mr. Hunt, it does, and apparently they do; see the copy of the citation above.

Since the news broke of Kelly’s encounter with the law, there has been an outpouring of concern from less heartless Houstonians. Randall Kallinen, a Houston attorney who’s fought against the “anti-feeding” ordinance, has taken the case. Kallinen acknowledges that Kelly got his ticket based on the garbage law not the feeding ordinance, but says the two laws overlap in that both seek to achieve the same goal – to force the homeless out of Houston and into neighboring municipalities.

""The city of Houston has shown, over the many years, a hostile environment toward the homeless,"" said Kallinen, who plans to represent Kelly in court next month."

Singh was pulled over in January for a flat tire, and was harassed by the state's Department of Transportation officers who wrongly assumed that his kirpan, a small spiritual sword that is a religious article for Sikhs, was illegal. They taunted him as a ""terrorist"" and arrested him for refusing to obey ""an officer's lawful command,"" reports the ACLU.

On his March 26th court date, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected him from the courtroom stating that Singh would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed ""that rag"" from his head.

Singh's attorney confirmed that Rimes expelled him due to his turban. However, Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful.

A subsequent Department of Justice investigation prompted the Pike County Board of Supervisors to revise the County's non-discrimination policy to say that religious discrimination includes, ""requiring an individual to remove a head covering or denying that individual access to a County office, building, program or activity because they are wearing a head covering, if that head covering is worn for religious reasons.""

American Sikhs often encounter misunderstandings about their faith, and a Stanford University survey published earlier this month revealed that though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70% of Americans misidentify turban-wearers as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, or members of the Shinto faith. The survey also discovered that nearly half of Americans think that Sikhism is a sect of Islam, and more associate the turban with Osama bin Laden rather than with the Muslim and Sikh alternative.

The letter comes on the heels of yet another incident of Sikh harassment, as Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh was brutally attacked in Harlem on Saturday night, beaten by a hate mob who called him ""terrorist,"" and ""Osama."""

U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, who has invited the clown who wore the mask to perform in Texas, said the request for probes into the incident by the Justice Department and Secret Service are “silly” and should be ignored.

“A rodeo clown is really a nominal thing and it hurt no one,” Stockman told FoxNews.com. “They didn’t speak out when George Bush was being portrayed as a murderer. To become relevant again, they need to become more of an honest broker and not have contrived anger.”

Stockman said the NAACP would better serve its constituents by focusing on ways to decrease unemployment among the black community. He also noted that the national civil rights group was silent after a July incident on a Florida bus where three black teens beat a fellow white student. Though Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told Fox News the attack did not appear to be racially motivated, former Florida Rep. Allen West, who is black, chided Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, noting they condemned Florida's laws in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting yet remained mum on the bus attack.

[pullquote]

“It’s really patently false that they’re angry at this, but not angry at other issues,” Stockman continued. “There has to be some consistency.”

Stockman said he thinks it’s unlikely federal officials will investigate the matter.

“We can’t get the Justice Department to look at Benghazi, so it would be ironic that the Justice Department would investigate a clown,” he said. “They should focus on their member’s needs rather than theatrics.”

Still, the rodeo clown has been widely condemned for his off-color act.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the rodeo clown incident was “not one of the finer moments” for The Show-Me State.

“I haven’t heard about the president’s reaction or if he had one,” Earnest told reporters. “I can tell you as a native Missourian, it was certainly not one of the finer moments for our state and not the way I like to see our state depicted in the news.”

Stockman said widespread reports of Saturday’s bull riding event at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia was an example of what he calls “pop news,” distractions from serious issues facing the country.

The performer, meanwhile, has been permanently banned from future state fair events and subsequent performers must undergo sensitivity training.

Messages seeking comment from Justice Department and NAACP officials were not immediately returned Thursday.

Jehmu Greene, a Fox News contributor and Democratic strategist, said she agreed with Stockman’s take that the call for a federal probe was unwarranted. It’s far from the first time a sitting commander-in-chief has been mocked, she said.

“Absolutely it is misguided,” she said during an appearance on Fox News. “The NAACP has jumped the shark on this one.”"
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-27/news/chi-supreme-court-gay-marriage-20130327_1_doma-case-gay-marriage-marriage-rights,2013-03-27 00:00:00,[],Supreme Court concludes arguments on marriage law,"The U.S. Supreme Court seemed to be leaning on Wednesday toward striking down a law that denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples in a move that would reflect a shift in Americans' attitudes about gay marriage.

In a second day of oral arguments on same-sex marriage, a majority of the court raised serious concerns with the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, enacted in 1996 under President Bill Clinton.

Arguments over the last two days on the DOMA case and a separate one challenging California's ban on gay marriage marked the high court's first foray into a delicate and divisive political, religious and social issue in the United States as polls indicate growing public support for same-sex marriage.

In theory, the cases have the potential for the court to take a significant step toward endorsing gay marriage as it gains support in some parts of the country. Based on the arguments, however, a partial victory for gay rights activists seems more likely than the sweeping declaration of same-sex marriage rights they had hoped for.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Supreme Court building for a second day, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote, showed a willingness to invalidate DOMA, which denies married same-sex couples access to federal benefits by defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

He warned of a ""real risk"" that the law infringes on the traditional role of the states in defining marriage.

A conservative, Kennedy is viewed as a key vote on this issue in part because he has twice authored decisions in the past that were viewed as favorable to gay rights.

In contrast to the ambivalent approach they displayed on Tuesday in arguments about California's Proposition 8 gay marriage ban, the nine justices seemed willing to address the substantive issue in the DOMA case, while also eyeing procedural questions.

The court is not expected to rule on the two cases until the end of June. If the justices were to strike down DOMA, legally married gay couples would be winners because they would have improved access to federal benefits, such as tax deductions.

Justices gave a strong indication they might resolve the Proposition 8 case on procedural grounds, but even that would be viewed as a win for gay rights activists as same-sex marriages in California would likely resume.

What appears highly unlikely is a sweeping declaration of a right for gay people to marry, a possible option only in the California case.

Overall, a majority of the justices made it clear that, while they might not impede the recent movement among some states toward gay marriage, they were not willing to pave the way either.

Nine states now recognize gay marriage, while 30 states have constitutional amendments banning it and others are in-between.

On several occasions over the two days, the justices' own remarks illustrated how quickly attitudes have changed in favor of gay marriage.

During Tuesday's arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, questioned whether there was sufficient data to show that children are not adversely affected if raised by same-sex couples. Likewise, Justice Samuel Alito noted the concept of gay marriage is ""newer than cellphones and the Internet.""

Offering a liberal perspective, Justice Elena Kagan prompted murmurs of surprise from onlookers on Wednesday when she quoted from a U.S. House of Representatives report written less than two decades ago, at the time DOMA was enacted, that referenced ""moral disapproval"" of gay marriage.

'SKIM MILK MARRIAGE'

As attention turned to DOMA on Wednesday, Kennedy made it clear where he stood, referring to DOMA as ""inconsistent"" because it purports to give authority to the states to define marriage while limiting recognition of those determinations.

His states' rights concerns were echoed by two of the liberal members of the bench, Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all about what the definition of marriage is?"" Sotomayor said.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer also raised concerns about the law.

Ginsburg stressed how important federal recognition is to any person who is legally married.

""It affects every area of life,"" she said.

Comparing marriage status with types of milk, Ginsburg said that a gay marriage endorsed by a state, but not recognized by the federal government, creates two types of marriage, ""full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage.""

If the court rules on the states' rights issue, the justices could strike down the law without deciding the bigger question of whether DOMA violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

On that issue, Kagan spoke of a ""red flag"" that indicates Congress passed DOMA with the intent of targeting a group that is ""not everyone's favorite group in the world.""

Various groups are calling for DOMA to be struck down, such as the Business Coalition for DOMA Repeal, whose members include Marriott International Inc, Aetna Inc, eBay Inc , and Thomson Reuters Corp, the corporate parent of the Reuters news agency."

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A pivotal vote Thursday in the Minnesota House positioned that state to become the 12th in the country to allow gay marriages and the first in the Midwest to pass such a law out of its Legislature.

The 75-59 vote was seen as the critical step for the measure, which would allow same-sex weddings beginning Aug. 1. It's a startling shift in the state, where just six months earlier voters surprisingly turned back an effort to ban them in the Minnesota Constitution.

The state Senate is expected to consider the bill Monday, and leaders expect it to pass there. Gov. Mark Dayton has pledged to sign it into law.

Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue rallied Thursday at the Minnesota Capitol, which was under tighter than usual security. Pro-marriage demonstrators filled the hallways outside the House chambers, some dressed in orange T-Shirts and holding signs that read, ""I Support The Freedom to Marry."" Behind them, opponents held up bright pink signs that simply read, ""Vote No.""

Eleven other states allow gay marriages — including Rhode Island and Delaware, which approved laws in the past week. Minnesota would be the first state in the Midwest to pass the measure out of the Legislature.

Iowa allows gay marriages because of a 2009 court ruling. Leaders in Illinois — the only Midwestern state other than Minnesota with a Democratic-led statehouse — say that state is close to having the votes to approve a law too. But most other states surrounding Minnesota have constitutional bans against same-sex weddings, so the change might not spread to the nation's heartland nearly as quickly as it has on the coasts and in New England.

The Minnesota push for gay marriage grew out of last fall's successful campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned it. Minnesota became the first state to turn back such an amendment after more than two dozen states had passed one over more than a decade.

The same election put Democrats in full control of state government for the first time in more than two decades, a perfect scenario for gay marriage supporters to swiftly pursue legalization. They tapped the cross-section of citizens, businesses, churches and others who spoke out against the amendment and staged rallies as part of a lobbying effort to build support.

The bill cleared committees in both chambers in March, and with a succession of national polls showing opposition to gay marriage falling away nationally."

Southern Poverty Law Center tracks militias%2C %22patriot%22 groups

Number rose 7%25 to 1%2C360 last year

Fear of more gun restrictions is behind the increase

Radical anti-government ""patriot"" groups and militias, galvanized against gun control, will continue to grow even as the number of groups operating in the USAreached an all-time high in 2012, a report Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center finds.

The center tracked 1,360 radical militias and anti-government groups in 2012, an eightfold increase over 2008, when it recorded 149 such groups. The explosive growth began four years ago, sparked by the election of President Obama and anger about the poor economy, the center says. That growth is likely to continue as the groups recruit more members with a pro-gun message, the center's senior fellow Mark Potok said.

President Obama's second term and a gun control movement bolstered by the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School is intensifying anti-government rage and will lead to more growth for the groups, Potok said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights advocacy group based in Montgomery, Ala., defines the patriot movement as groups of people who believe the federal government is conspiring to confiscate Americans' guns and curtail liberties to create a socialist government or ""new order."" Most are non-violent citizens groups. Some groups also include militias, which arm themselves and conduct military-style training, the center said.

Conservative critics say the center uses its rhetoric to undermine right-wing and conservative groups.

The Southern Poverty Law Center uses its extremism report as a way to raise funds, says Bill Hahn, a spokesman for the John Birch Society, a conservative, anti-communist group based in Appleton, Wis, that advocates limited government. The group is on the center's list of anti-government groups.

The center ""is very adept at creating the specter that armed groups will overthrow the government or that the continuously dying supremacy movement is lurking behind every rock,"" Hahn said in a written statement. ""The SPLC will continue to utilize fear to fill their bank accounts.""

The John Birch Society opposes violence and urges its members to take action to restore and preserve constitutional freedoms, Hahn said.

Everett Wilkinson, whose Florida-based National Liberty Federation is not listed in the report, says many of the groups simply engage in peaceful rallies and letter-writing campaigns aimed at promoting free markets, fiscal responsibility and limited government.

""The Southern Perversion Law Center is a liberal organization that likes to spread propaganda about right-wing and conservative groups,"" Wilkinson said.

He recently sent an e-mail addressed to ""Patriots"" seeking land ""to hold training sessions for prepping, Constitution classes, militia training, medical, alternative communications, etc."" Wilkinson said some of his members had expressed interest in firearms training.

""We do respect people's right to defend themselves, but we are not a military-type organization or anything like that,"" he said. ""We're a grassroots activist organization focused on legislative issues and changing what's happening in government. We've had thousands of rallies since 2009 and we've yet to have a violent incident.""

The patriot groups' rhetoric and some groups' threats of domestic terrorist plots mirror the mood in the six months before the Oklahoma City bombing, a domestic terror attack in 1995 by anti-government militia sympathizer Timothy McVeigh that killed 168 people, center President J. Richard Cohen said in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The center has called for a task force to assess the groups.

""In the last four years we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of conspiracy-minded, anti-government groups as well as in the number of domestic terrorist plots,"" Cohen wrote. ""We now also are seeing ominous threats from those who believe that the government is poised to take their guns.""

The number of anti-government groups grew 7% from 1,274 in 2011 to 1,360 in 2012. The center gathers its data from the groups' publications, websites, law enforcement, news reports and other sources.

Daryl Johnson, a former domestic terror intelligence analyst at the Department of Homeland Security whose report on the resurgence of the radical right in April 2009 was withdrawn by the department after criticism by conservative groups, said the center's estimate of radical anti-government groups is low and does not account for some of the most radical groups that operate underground.

Some groups stockpile weapons and their ""ability to inflect mass violence is quite high,"" Johnson said.

A January study from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found a dramatic rise since 2007 in the number of attacks and violent plots originating from people and groups identified with the far right of American politics.

The Southern Poverty Law Center's latest count surpasses the record number of groups formed in the 1990s in response to the passage of sweeping gun-control measures in 1993 and a ban on assault weapons in 1994. In 1996, the number of patriot groups peaked at 858, then declined until 2009, the center reports.

Recently, some of the groups have threatened politicians who have proposed gun-control measures, the report says. In one instance, neo-Nazi Craig Cobb posted Rep. Diana DeGette's address and photograph on the racist, anti-Semitic VanguardNews Network forum after the Colorado Democrat proposed a ban on high- capacity magazines, the report says.

The report cites groups that predicted civil war and tyranny after Obama's executive orders on gun control, including Fox News Radio host Todd Starnes, who tweeted, ""Freedom ends. Tyranny begins"" and ConservativeDaily.com's Tony Adkins, who wrote, ""Martial law in the United States now a very real possibility.""

The center quotes the United States Patriots Union, which in a letter to legislators in several states called the federal government ""a tool of International Socialism now, operating under UN Agendas not our American agenda."" The group said states should defend freedom and liberty ""or we are headed to Civil War wherein the people will have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.""

""Their rhetoric is a barometer of the rage that is building in certain quarters,"" Cohen said."

Pollak'],"Holder Faces New Questions About Racial Bias, Credibility After IG Report & Documents Released","Attorney General Eric Holder faces new questions about racial bias at the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as about the veracity of his testimony before Congress, as the result of a new Inspector General report and documents obtained by Judicial Watch.

The Inspector General’s report, covered extensively by former DOJ official J. Christian Adams, reveals that many Civil Rights Division attorneys do not believe that the Voting Rights Act ought to be enforced to protect white victims as well as black victims, and that black employees who were willing to help prosecute black defendants–such as the New Black Panther Party–were subject to alleged threats and intimidation by DOJ officials.

The Judicial Watch documents suggest that political appointees at DOJ were involved in the decision to drop the case against the New Black Panther Party, contrary to Holder’s sworn testimony before Congress, in which he said: “The decisions made in the New Black Panther Party case were made by career attorneys in the department. And beyond that, you know, if we’re going to look at the record, let’s look at it in its totality.”

The documents also contradict the testimony of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez, who claimed that there was no political intervention in the case.

Perez is currently considered the frontrunner to be President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of Labor, despite a controversial history that includes heavy involvement with the pro-amnesty group La Raza as well as the New Black Panther Party case.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, who fought the DOJ in court for access to the documents, called for “an independent investigation into whether Messrs. Holder and Perez committed perjury in testifying under oath about the Black Panther controversy.”"

Probably some of each: brave, because he’s trying to sell himself and fellow Republicans to African Americans, a singularly resistant demographic; and crazy, because he based his pitch on revised history and airbrushed facts — and the Howard kids weren’t fooled.

“No Republican questions or disputes civil rights,” the senator from Kentucky proclaimed. “I’ve never wavered in my support for civil rights or the Civil Rights Act.”

Howzat?

As a candidate in 2010, Paul questioned the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act’s Title II, which prohibits private discrimination. “I don’t want to be associated with those people,” he said when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow asked him about private businesses that refuse to serve black customers, “but I also don’t want to limit their speech in any way in the sense that we tolerate boorish and uncivilized behavior because that’s one of the things freedom requires.”

Asked by the moderator to explain his claim that he never spoke out against the Civil Rights Act, Paul provided the creative rationale that he was talking “about the ramifications of certain portions of the Civil Rights Act beyond race, as are now being applied to smoking, menus, listing calories and things on menus and guns.”

Paul acknowledged that his wooing of African Americans “is an uphill battle,” and his hour with the students confirmed this. Talking about the Republicans’ historical support for civil rights, he said: “I’ll give you one example. The first, one of the African American U.S. senators was a guy named, uh, I’m blanking on his name, from Massachusetts — ”

“Edward Brooke!” several in the audience called out.

“Edwin Brookes,” Paul repeated.

The students broke out in hysterics. The laughter had barely subsided when Paul posed a question. “If I were to have said, ‘Who do you think the founders of the NAACP are?’ . . . would everybody in here know they were all Republicans?”

“Yes,” several could be heard grumbling. “Of course they would,” one woman informed him.

Paul dug himself in deeper. “I don’t know what you know,” he said.

They knew enough to be suspicious of his central argument: that Abraham Lincoln’s Republican Party is the same Republican Party that now dominates the South. This analysis glossed over the civil rights era, when Democrats and Republicans essentially switched sides as southern Dixiecrats left for the GOP.

“Democrats in Louisville were led by Courier-Journal Editor Henry Watterson and were implacably opposed to blacks voting,” Paul argued. Watterson died in 1921. “Meanwhile,” he continued, “Kentucky’s Democrat-controlled legislature voted against the 13th, the 14th and the 15th amendments.” In the 1860s.

A student questioner sought clarification. “Are we discussing the Republican Party of the 19th century?” he asked, to applause. “Or are we discussing the post-1968 Republican Party?”

“The argument I’m trying to make is we haven’t changed,” Paul proposed.

The Howard students weren’t hostile to the senator as much as indifferent. Campus police swarmed outside the hall and erected barricades, although they proved unnecessary. Doors opened an hour early, but seats didn’t fill up until the last minute, and many spent their time texting and fanning themselves in the overheated hall.

Paul elicited a few chuckles when he requested that the school newspaper go with the headline, “A Republican came to Howard, but he came in peace.” But he got only silence when he ad-libbed a joke about how his Civil Rights Act comments in 2010 didn’t “go so well for me.”

“My hope is that you will hear me out,” Paul asked, and all appeared to — except for senior Brian Menifee, who raised a hand-lettered banner announcing that “Howard University Doesn’t Support White Supremacy.” Police threw him out roughly, and other students cheered.

But Paul got no cheers for most of his ideas: criticizing Democrats’ “unlimited federal assistance,” calling private-school choice “the civil rights issue of our day” and saying that “there are Republicans who don’t clamor for war.” He did better with his proposal to repeal mandatory minimum sentences, but he drew boos when he defended voter-ID laws.

“I come to Howard,” Paul said, “to say I want a government that leaves you alone.” He argued that “objective evidence shows that big government is not a friend to African Americans.”

Freshman Keenan Glover disagreed. “I want a government that’s going to help me,” he said. “I want a government that’s going to help me pay for my college education.”

http://news.yahoo.com/youth-activists-detained-while-trying-enter-us-215218834.html,,[],Youth activists detained while trying to enter US,"NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) — U.S. authorities have detained eight activists who asked to be allowed to re-enter the United States from Mexico on humanitarian grounds in a protest against American immigration policies.

Customs and Border Protection officials detained the activists Monday after they filed applications for humanitarian parole at the Nogales border crossing to try to return to the United States.

CBP officials said they could not comment on specific cases but under immigration law all applicants for admission bear the burden of proof to establish they are eligible to enter the country.

Domenic Powell, a spokesman for the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, said the group hadn't been taken to a detention center as of Monday afternoon.

He said the alliance would continue to pressure federal authorities to let the eight activists ""go back home"" to the U.S.

Margo Cowan, a lawyer for the group, says she will file asylum applications on behalf of the activists if they are denied humanitarian parole.

On the U.S. side of the border, about 60 people waiting for the activists chanted in Spanish, ""No papers, no fear.""

Three activists left the U.S. and traveled to Mexico expressly to participate in the protest. The group wants to draw attention to the huge jump in deportations carried out under the Obama administration, and reaffirm their attachment to the country where they were raised.

The first one to be detained was Claudia Amaro Escalera, 37, along with her U.S.-born son Yamil, 13. Amaro Escalera returned to Mexico six years ago after her husband was deported but lived more than 20 years in the U.S. and calls America home.

Cowan said, ""This will be a decision to be taken by the Obama administration, maybe not immediately, but I trust it will be the right decision.""

Humanitarian parole means the activists can be released with the understanding that they are not a menace to society, she explained.

Lizbeth Mateo, Lulu Martinez and Marco Saavedra were the three youths who recently left the U.S. to organize the protest from Mexico with the National Immigrant Youth Alliance. They were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and have no legal status there even though they grew up in America.

""We cannot ask others to do something we ourselves are not willing to do,"" Mateo said before getting to the border.

She added the group hopes the Obama administration will create a process so all those who were deported from the U.S. can return.

""We are giving President Obama a chance to do the right thing. They always say, 'Why don't you come here legally?' Well this is his chance to create the legal process.""

Members of NIYA such as Mateo have participated in other acts of civil disobedience, one of them in 2010 in the offices of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. They have also entered detention centers to publicize cases where prisoners are about to be deported without having a criminal record or a legal recourse.

The activists have said that if they were detained, they would do the same in detention centers in Arizona.

Maria Peniche and Adriana Gil Diaz could have benefited from a deferred action program recently offered by the Obama administration that lets young immigrants live in the U.S. on renewable two-year stays, but they had both returned to Mexico City shortly before the measure was announced.

Peniche, who was raised in Boston, Mass., was hoping to continue her university studies in Mexico, because they were too expensive in the U.S.

""I want to give a face and a voice to those who are undocumented immigrants like myself,"" she said.

Luis Gustavo Leon, 20, said he has been deported from the U.S. four times. He had gone to Mexico two years ago to continue his university studies but did not get used to the lifestyle there. His parents and brothers are all in North Carolina.

""I will keep trying because my family is there, because even though I'm Mexican, my culture is the American culture,"" he said.

He added he was not afraid of being detained.

""As long as there is hope, I will fight,"" Leon said. ""If they tell me I can't do it, then I'll give up temporarily, but not completely. I'll go back to Mexico but later on I'll find a way to return.""

One finding of the report that received little attention, however, was about cultural attitudes toward success. Of the five nationalities polled, Americans were least likely to believe that success in life was determined by forces outside our control.

Just 36 percent of Americans believe in this fatalistic statement, while the vast majority of their compatriots are greater believers in self-determination. Put another way, Americans are (not surprisingly) more likely to believe in the American dream.

Americans with less education are more fatalistic, however. The study found that 22 percent of college graduates believe they have little control over their fate, compared to 41 percent of Americans without a college degree.

Even so, American nongraduates still seem to think they have more control over their destinies than the average German, Frenchman or Spaniard does. Almost three-quarters of Germans, for example, believe that success is determined by factors outside our control.

These findings are particularly interesting when juxtaposed with a separate report from the Pew Economic Mobility project. That report, which examined economic and social mobility in 10 Western countries, found that Americans actually appear to have less control over their success in life than their counterparts do.

In particular, the educational attainment of a person’s parents — a factor usually determined before that person’s birth — seems to matter more for mobility in the United States.

“There is a stronger link between parental education and children’s economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes than in any other country investigated,” the report says.

As Richard Wilkinson suggested in a recent TED Talk, if you want to live the American dream — and have greater control over your own likelihood of success — you should probably move to Denmark, where the poor have a better chance of moving up in the world."

Today, the justices will consider the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denies federal benefits to same-sex married couples. On Tuesday, the issue before them was California’s Proposition 8, the voter-approved initiative that placed a same-sex marriage ban in the state constitution in 2008. A U.S. District Court judge subsequently declared the ban unconstitutional, and in 2012 the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.

During oral arguments, some of the nine justices appeared uncomfortable jumping into the gay marriage debate at all. Much time was spent arguing about whether the petitioners on the pro-Prop. 8 side had legal standing to bring the appeal. Determining that they do not, the court could let the lower court’s ruling stand. They could also simply uphold the 9th Circuit’s decision. Either way, the justices could avoid a broader judgment that homosexuals have a constitutional right to marry in all 50 states.

Also wanting to stop short of that outcome, yet still urging the justices toward a somewhat broader middle ground, Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. offered a position that would open the way to same-sex marriage only in states such as California that already give homosexual couples every legal benefit accorded married persons except the right to marry. Because such states have essentially conceded that there is no societal harm in established domestic partnerships, those states cannot reasonably contend there would be harm in letting same-sex partners marry, Verrilli argued.

The perverse aspect of this position was readily apparent to the justices, however. They noted that following this path would force gay marriage on states that have been generous to same-sex couples while demanding nothing from the most regressive states that grant no legal benefits to homosexual partners.

Even more untenable was the core argument of the attorney for the pro-Prop. 8 petitioners, Charles J. Cooper. He asserted that marriage is primarily an institution that society has established to formalize and manage the production of offspring. Since, by nature, children cannot be conceived by two women or two men, homosexuals cannot carry out that prime purpose of marriage and, therefore, have no equal claim on matrimonial rights, he said.

This led to an amusing exchange between Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan. Kagan said, by Cooper’s reasoning, a 55-year-old couple could be barred from marrying since they could not produce offspring. Laughter erupted from the courtroom audience when Cooper responded by noting the 55-year-old man, at least, would be fertile. Justice Antonin Scalia chimed in with weird comments about the fertility of the very elderly former senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. How that was germane only Scalia knows.

Oddly, no one pointed out that homosexual couples actually are producing children through sperm donors and surrogate mothers. They are also becoming parents via adoption. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy noted that, in California alone, 40,000 children are being raised by homosexual parents. In the modern world, there is more than one path to parenthood.

Seeking more solid ground for their skeptical view of same-sex marriage, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the other court conservatives rallied around the idea that moving too fast on same-sex marriage would be unwise because it is a novel idea that breaks with tradition. Theodore B. Olson, representing the anti-Prop. 8 side, offered the obvious and most pertinent rejoinder: interracial marriage was illegal until the Supreme Court invalidated laws against it in 1967. Such laws enforced a traditional view and were supported by large majorities, not just in the South, but all over the country. Yet the court went against the majority of Americans and against the status quo in that decision.

The principle is exactly the same in the case of Prop. 8 as it was with interracial marriage: a certain class of citizens should not be denied the right to marry simply because they were born different from the majority. It looks doubtful, though, that the current court will be as brave in asserting equal rights as were their counterparts back in ’67."
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-questions-irs-scrutiny-anti-abortion-groups-071630476.html,,[],GOP questions IRS scrutiny of anti-abortion groups,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — When a small anti-abortion group in Iowa sought nonprofit status, the Internal Revenue Service asked its board to promise not to organize protests outside Planned Parenthood and demanded to know how its prayer meetings and protest signs were educational.

Although the Coalition for Life of Iowa's application was ultimately approved in 2009, the tax collection agency's treatment of that and other anti-abortion groups has gotten new attention in the wake of an ongoing scandal over the alleged targeting of conservative groups.

The IRS apologized for singling out tea party groups for scrutiny in 2010 and 2011, but Republicans now are seizing on the coalition's case to question whether the effort may have been broader and started earlier.

Groups with tax-exempt status, known as 501(c)(3) nonprofits, must have educational, religious or charitable purposes and cannot be involved in elections or engage in substantial lobbying activity. But they can conduct educational campaigns about their causes that do not have to be balanced, and their members retain their constitutional rights to assemble and protest.

U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday the IRS was out of bounds in seeking information on the group's prayer activities and a guarantee that it wouldn't protest at Planned Parenthood.

""That's outrageous that that statement would be made by anybody in government, that somehow you've got to compromise your First Amendment rights,"" Grassley said. ""It appears the IRS offered this group a quid pro quo: you can become a charity if you don't protest in front of a Planned Parenthood.""

Outgoing Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller told Grassley he was unaware of the case, but apologized generally for poor service.

The Iowa group isn't the only anti-abortion organization that appears to have been singled out for scrutiny. In 2011, another IRS employee asked Christian Voices for Life of Fort Bend County in Texas whether it provided ""education on both sides of the issues"" in its programs and whether its members try to speak with anyone entering medical clinics, correspondence shows.

Story continues

Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., said last week that the Iowa and Texas groups faced unfair IRS intrusion into their activities because of ""political and religious bias"" that chilled their constitutional rights. He turned over their IRS correspondence to the inspector general for tax administration and demanded an explanation.

Both groups received tax-exempt status after seeking help from the Thomas More Society, a conservative legal group. But counsel Sally Wagenmaker said the cases were troubling because the IRS asked inappropriate questions about their activities even though their applications should've raised no red flags, and they were forced to retain lawyers to win approval.

""Is it something bigger? I can't say. But is it of concern? Absolutely. Now the IRS is getting into content,"" she said. ""The common thread here is scrutiny on a content basis and seeming to really bend over backwards on the conservative side.""

Tax experts said the IRS inquiries appeared to be misguided attempts to ensure that groups were educational in nature and did not interfere with the rights of patients and employees.

""I can see what they are raising, but it seems to be there are very strong First Amendment issues here,"" said Richard Koontz, director of the Iowa Nonprofit Resource Center. ""You don't want to let one nonprofit stop the activities of another. But you certainly want them to be able to criticize from dawn to dusk what another nonprofit is doing.""

The Iowa group considers its mission to educate citizens about ""the sanctity of life"" and it has held forums on issues such as stem-cell research and euthanasia. Members also routinely walk and pray outside Planned Parenthood in Cedar Rapids. Sue Martinek, the group's president, submitted its application for tax-exempt status in October 2008.

An IRS employee identifying herself as ""Ms. Richards"" from the Cincinnati office responded in April 2009 that she needed more information about its events, including all ""advertisements, schedules, syllabuses, handouts, a summary of each person's speech"" and more, records show.

The coalition turned over those records, including Catholic writings opposing embryonic stem cell research and cloning and brochures handed out at events, including one that accused Planned Parenthood of promoting promiscuous behavior. In follow-up calls, ""Ms. Richards"" asked Martinek whether the group protested outside Planned Parenthood, Martinek said.

""Ms. Richards"" informed her that its prayer gatherings there would be permissible — as long as ""what we were doing would not be construed as protesting or picketing"" and didn't involve harassment, according to a June 2009 email that Martinek sent to Wagenmaker. ""Ms. Richards"" said its application would be approved if board members promised in writing that the group would not protest outside Planned Parenthood, Martinek wrote.

Martinek said she and others were ready to sign such a statement, but that one board member saw it as a free speech violation and contacted Thomas More Society to protest.

Martinek sent a letter to IRS saying that members had debated its request not to organize Planned Parenthood protests, but wanted definitions of ""organize, picketing, protesting"" to ensure compliance. Rather than answer those questions, ""Ms. Richards"" responded with a letter seeking an explanation of how ""prayer meetings held outside of Planned Parenthood are considered educational.""

Wagenmaker responded with a letter saying the inquiries were legally improper and calling for the IRS to grant the application promptly. She said the coalition had organized one event to pray the rosary at Planned Parenthood and that members otherwise assembled there peacefully on their own, carrying signs such as ""Women deserve better than abortion"" that do not contain graphic images.

Days later, the IRS sent its approval notification.

""It was a little weird and it seemed like they wanted lots of information, but we wanted our status,"" Martinek said. ""The IRS is so powerful, we were just hesitant to get on their bad list."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/us/pentagon-says-it-is-lifting-ban-on-women-in-combat.html,2013-01-24 00:00:00,"['Elisabeth Bumiller', 'Thom Shanker']",Pentagon Set to Lift Ban on Women in Combat Roles,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is lifting the military’s official ban on women in combat, which will open up hundreds of thousands of additional front-line jobs to them, senior defense officials said Wednesday.

The groundbreaking decision overturns a 1994 Pentagon rule that restricts women from artillery, armor, infantry and other such combat roles, even though in reality women have frequently found themselves in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan; according to the Pentagon, hundreds of thousands of women have deployed in those conflicts. As of last year, more than 800 women had been wounded in the two wars and more than 130 had died.

Defense officials offered few details about Mr. Panetta’s decision but described it as the beginning of a process to allow the branches of the military to put the change into effect. Defense officials said Mr. Panetta had made the decision on the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Women have long chafed under the combat restrictions and have increasingly pressured the Pentagon to catch up with the reality on the battlefield. The move comes as Mr. Panetta is about to step down from his post and would leave him with a major legacy after only 18 months in the job."

I don't think we are. We only sound like it sometimes.

The poll by the conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports finds a larger minority of Americans, 37 percent, think most black Americans are racist compared with the 15 percent of the respondents who think most white Americans are racist and the 18 percent who think that about Hispanic-Americans.

I expected the numbers to fall heavily along racial and partisan lines, and they do. For example, 49 percent of conservatives consider most blacks to be racist compared with21 percent of liberals. Considering how many of today's conservatives tend to hear any racial grievance as ""playing the race card,"" I'm not surprised.

What defies the usual stereotypes is the sizable minority of blacks, 31 percent, who agreed with the 38 percent of whites in the poll who think most blacks are racist. That's higher than the 24 percent of blacks (and 10 percent of whites) who think most whites are racist.

That stereotype-shattering result might suggest that we black folks have some work to do in cleaning up our own prejudices. Understood. But what? The poll offers not a clue.

For starters, it doesn't define ""racist,"" even though there is hardly a more abused, misused and overused word in the English language than the R-word.

Two major misunderstandings make a mess of today's race debates. One, our racial attitudes are based on our personal experiences and all of our experiences are very different. Two, everybody carries different definitions in their heads of what racism is.

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary lists two definitions. One is ""a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race."" The other is simply ""racial prejudice or discrimination.""

But there's at least one other definition, widely believed among black folks, that touched off an uproar after filmmaker Spike Lee expressed it in a July 1991 Playboy magazine interview: ""Black people can't be racist, he said. ""Racism is an institution.""

Although ""black people can be prejudiced,"" Lee allowed, we ""don't have the power"" to enforce the sweeping institutional racism that perpetuates social, economic and political inequality. Maybe not, I say, but we're moving up.

Lee's argument was easier to make before African-Americans gained as much institutional power and influence as some of us are beginning to achieve, all the way up to the White House.

As we aspire to full equality, I believe we need to hold ourselves as accountable as we hold Paula Deen, Don Imus, Michael ""Kramer"" Richards and every other racial gaffe-maker.

But that's not always easy. What we say can be quite culturally different from what other people want to hear.

Remember, for example, the blowback last year after President Barack Obama framed the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in personal terms by saying, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""

""Disgraceful,"" fumed Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich. ""We should all be horrified no matter what the ethnic background."" Of course. Obviously the president didn't mean to say otherwise.

But, when even Obama gets slammed for an innocent tribute after all of his years of diligently playing by the rules of today's racial etiquette, it is no wonder so many people think black folks are racist.

Yet, as the poll results hint, it is no secret that the black community has to contend with its own internal racism too. I recall, for example, how one of my son's black high school classmates responded when I asked whether he detected any racism in today's youths. Yes, he said, ""The blacks girls get mad when they see you dancing with a white girl."" Ah, yes. Race, like sex, is complicated, children.

Considering today's tragic shortage of marriageable black males, I can't help but sympathize with those girls. They didn't create this world. They're probably just imitating us, their elders.

It is not that the Republican Right Wing base is less intelligent. They are willfully ignorant. They are unwilling to accept uncomfortable realities, so they live in a delusional bubble irrespective of consequences.

Ted Cruz was born on foreign soil from an American mother and a foreign father. That is fact. President Obama was born on American soil from an American mother and a foreign father. In effect there was never a real constitutional question regarding President Obama’s eligibility to be president. Irrespective of his parents, he was born on American soil. There is a constitutional question on Cruz’s eligibility based on the definition of ‘natural born citizen’. As such one would expect the Right Wing birthers to go after Ted Cruz.

As long as you have constituents like Walden Republican Christina Katok, Canadians would qualify for the presidency. She says “As far as I am concerned, Canada is not foreign soil. That’s the way I look at it”. Listen to her and others in this short Texas Tribune video snippet.

Aren’t these guys the strict constitutionalists? This behavior is called willful ignorance. Adjust your beliefs to satisfy your desires. What is ironic is had President Obama been born in Kenya, based on Cruz’s circumstance and acceptance by the Right Wing, President Obama would be just as eligible given his American mother to these birthers. The reality is even if both President Obama’s parents were foreign; he constitutionally qualifies for the presidency as he was born on American soil while Cruz was not.

The reason the country is at a standstill is that we have a sect that is obstructing that has no interest in reality based governing. They can do this as long as their willfully ignorant base continues to vote at higher rates than the rest of America in gerrymandered districts. In effect America gets the government it deserves. Those who want good government must vote for good politicians.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/26/texas-lawmaker-filibusters-against-abortion-bill/,2013-06-26 00:00:00,[],Texas abortion bill fails after chaotic stand-off in capital,"Chaos reigned in the final minutes of the Texas Senate late Tuesday night as opponents of a strict abortion bill succeeded in killing the measure, using a sprawling Democrat-led filibuster, egged on by noisy ""unruly mob"" protests, to blunt last-ditch efforts by Republicans to save the legislation.

The drama centered largely around Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who staged an hours-long, old-fashioned filibuster on the Senate floor against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans initially succeeded in cutting her filibuster off, in part by objecting when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace. But protesters picked up where she left off, jeering at lawmakers as they rushed to meet a midnight deadline for the bill.

Republicans initially insisted they made it, but Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst later acknowledged they did not.

Dewhurst denounced the more than 400 protesters who staged what they called ""a people's filibuster"" from 11:45 p.m. to well past midnight. He denied mishandling the debate.

""I didn't lose control (of the chamber). We had an unruly mob,"" Dewhurst said. He then hinted that Gov. Rick Perry may immediately call another special session, adding: ""It's over. It's been fun. But see you soon.""

The chaos capped one of the most unusual stand-offs in any state legislative session this year.

Davis spent most of the day staging her filibuster, attracting wide support, including a mention from President Obama's campaign Twitter account. Her Twitter following went from 1,200 in the morning to more than 20,000 by Tuesday night.

""My back hurts. I don't have a lot of words left,"" Davis said when it was over and she was showered with cheers by activist who stayed at the Capitol to see her. ""It shows the determination and spirit of Texas women.""

Davis' mission, however, was cut short.

Rules stipulated she remain standing, not lean on her desk or take any breaks -- even for meals or to use the bathroom. But she also was required to stay on topic, and Republicans pointed out a mistake and later protested again when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace.

Republican Sen. Donna Campbell called the third point of order because of her remarks about a previous law concerning sonograms. Under the rules, lawmakers can vote to end a filibuster after three sustained points of order.

After much back and forth, the GOP voted to end the filibuster minutes before midnight, sparking the raucous response from protesters in the final 15 minutes before the deadline.

Initially, Republicans insisted they had started voting before the midnight deadline and passed the bill that Democrats spent much of Tuesday filibustering. But after official computer records and printouts of the voting record showed the vote took place on Wednesday, and then were changed to read Tuesday, senators convened for a private meeting.

An hour later, Dewhurst was still insisting the 19-10 vote was in time, but said, ""with all the ruckus and noise going on, I couldn't sign the bill.""

The measures would have closed almost every abortion clinic in Texas, a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people. A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes.

In her opening remarks, Davis said she was ""rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans"" and called Republican efforts to pass the bill a ""raw abuse of power.""

""Partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol but here in Texas right now it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility,"" Davis was quoted as saying by MyFoxAustin.com.

Democrats chose Davis to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School.

In the hallway outside the Senate chamber, hundreds of women stood in line, waiting for people in the gallery to give up their seats. Women's rights supporters wore orange T-shirts to show their support for Davis, and Dewhurst reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could results in 48 hours in jail.

Davis tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large binder on her desk.

MyFoxAustin.com reported that a protester in the Senate gallery, identified as Mike Bradford, was removed by security after causing a disturbance.

He explained his opposition to abortion in an interview with reporters outside the gallery.

""I see all the supporters mostly I see, firstly white women, who are supporting abortion but yet abortions are effecting a certain demographic that's not included in the people supporting it,"" Bradford told the station.

Twice in the first six hours, anti-abortion lawmakers questioned Davis about the bill, presenting their arguments that it would protect women or that abortions were wrong. Davis answered their questions but did not give up control of the floor.

""This is really about women's health,"" said Sen. Bob Deuell, who introduced a requirement that all abortions take place in surgical centers. ""Sometimes bad things can happen.""

Davis questioned then why vasectomies and colonoscopies aren't also required to take place in such clinics. ""Because I've been unable to have a simple question answered to help me understand how this would lead to better care for women, I must question the underlying motive for doing so.""

Davis read testimony from women and doctors who would be impacted by the changes, but who were denied the opportunity to speak in a Republican-controlled committee. During one heart-wrenching story describing a woman's difficult pregnancy, Davis choked up several times and wiped tears.

The bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics that perform the procedure to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers. Also, doctors would be required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles -- a tall order in rural communities.

(Representative Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, for example, delights his constituents with his relish for a presidential impeachment. His animosity runs so deep that he said he “couldn’t stand” to be in the same room with Mr. Obama.)

On most social questions, Mr. Flake is squarely on the right. He opposes abortion rights, and, unlike Arizona’s senior senator, John McCain, he refused to break with orthodoxy and support a mild background check for gun buyers. He is a Mormon — a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah and a former missionary in Africa — and opposes same-sex marriage. But he is not a demagogue; in the House, he voted to repeal the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” restriction and to allow gays to serve in the armed forces."

The jury began its second day of deliberations on Saturday.

Jurors are deliberating whether Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman has claimed he had to shoot Martin in self-defense.

The Washington Times noted the group has tweeted, “New Black Panther Party will not give you specific details on anything other than to say we have rallies and street maneuvers planned.” The group has even tweeted about a planned Sept. 7 rally for Trayvon Martin: “We can’t and WON’T try to control the general dissatisfied population. For sure we are ORGANIZING.”

“If Zimmerman is acquitted there is likely to be unrest all over America. It will be way beyond the capacity of the NBPP,” the group tweeted. “From what we are hearing there is a HIGH chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted on all charges.”

The Times flagged some tweets that showed the group’s disdain for Zimmerman. The NBPP tweeted that Zimmerman was “exposed on closing arguments as a lying, conniving, manipulating scheming underhanded profiling devil” and that the prosecution’s “withering” closing argument “wiped that smile off his [expletive] face.”

On Friday, Malik Shabazz, Chairman of the the New Black Panther Party, appeared on the David Webb Show on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, which Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon guest-hosted. Shabazz claimed the New Black Panthers are in Sanford because President Barack Obama has encouraged more “traditional” civil rights groups and leaders, like Al Sharpton, to not play active roles in organizing protests during the trial. He said groups like the New Black Panthers have had to replace the more “traditional” civil rights groups who he claimed have been “silenced.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/u-judge-orders-landmark-california-cross-taken-down-012849685.html,,[],U.S. judge orders landmark California cross taken down,"By Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A massive cross that serves as part of a war memorial on a San Diego hilltop must be dismantled because it has been found to violate a constitutional ban on government endorsement of religion, a federal judge grudgingly ruled on Thursday. The decision by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns marks the latest development in a long-running legal battle over the 43-foot-tall cross, a local landmark that has stood on top of Mount Soledad since 1954 and is visible for miles. Burns stayed his order to give the Obama administration and the association that erected the cross, which have fought its removal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, a chance to file another appeal. Otherwise, he said, the monument must be taken down within 90 days. ""This is a victory for religious liberty,"" said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program on freedom of religion and belief who argued the matter for the plaintiffs in a hearing before Burns on Thursday. ""We firmly support the government's efforts to honor the service of those who fought and died for this country, but there are many ways to do that without playing favorites with religion,"" Mach said. The case hinged on whether it is legal for a religious symbol to be prominently displayed on public land and whether the cross violated the U.S. Constitution's requirement on separation of church and state. The Mount Soledad cross has been the subject of litigation since 1989, when two veterans sued San Diego to get it off city land. In 2006, Congress intervened in the dispute, resulting in the federal government taking ownership of the property. A group of plaintiffs, including the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, then sued. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals court ruled that the dominance of the cross conveyed a message of government endorsement of religion. The Obama administration and the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, supported by 20 U.S. states and various veterans groups in arguing the cross should be allowed as part of the memorial. In June 2012, the Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting the Ninth Circuit's ruling stand. In ordering that the cross be taken down, Burns said on Thursday he did not agree with the Ninth Circuit's ruling but that his hands were tied. The cross, located between the Pacific Ocean and a major interstate highway, is surrounded by walls displaying granite plaques that commemorate veterans or veterans groups. Easter services were held annually at the cross from 1954 until at least 2000, according to court documents. The Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross in place of another cross that had stood on that spot since 1913, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday's ruling.

USA TODAY

Throngs make their way to the Lincoln Memorial for new March on Washington

Organizers see a key theme as unfinished business on racial equality

Mood is euphoric in contrast to 1963 event%2C when violence was feared

WASHINGTON — Fifty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. offered a transcendent vision of racial harmony for America's future with his ""I Have a Dream"" speech, tens of thousands gathered where he spoke Saturday to hear leaders tell them that while much has been attained, much remains unfinished.

""Dreams are for those who won't accept reality as it is, so they dream of what is not there and make it possible,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton, an event organizer, told the throngs that pulsated with enthusiasm — laughing, cheering, nodding and clapping.

Orators speaking from the steps where King stood outlined what they said were promises yet unfulfilled in preserving voting rights, quelling gun violence, reducing economic disparity and achieving equal protection under the law. Among the thousands were more women, more Hispanics and more people representing sexual diversity — and more tech-savvy — than their predecessors 50 years before.

Many said they felt an inspiring sense of unity while witnessing history. ""It's beautiful around here,"" said 17-year-old Margaret Foster, who attended with her mother, Tamilikia, from Lansing, Mich.

Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only surviving speaker from the original 1963 event, said the most brutal days of the civil rights struggle ""for the most part are gone."" But he said the struggle for a more perfect America goes on.

""We cannot give up. We cannot give out. And we cannot give in,"" Lewis said, urging that crucial elements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court be placed back into law by Congress.

""The vote is precious. It's almost sacred,"" he said.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the first African American to hold that post, laid out a broader mandate for today's activists.

""Our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities. And of countless others across this great country who still yearn for equality,"" Holder said. ""I know that in the 21st century we will see an America that is more perfect and more fair.""

A message of cross-generational common cause extended from 1963 as a recurring theme Saturday.

""Me and my generation cannot now afford to sit back consuming all of our blessings, getting dumb, fat and happy thinking we have achieved our freedoms,"" said Cory Booker, the 44-year-old mayor of Newark, N.J., and Democratic candidate for Senate.

The most raucous crowd response was reserved for Sharpton, especially when he rebuked a young, black, male culture that tends to embrace guns and violence.

""Don't disrespect your women. Make it clear that you know that Rosa Parks wasn't no 'ho,' and (voting rights activist) Fannie Lou Hamer wasn't no b----,"" Sharpton bellowed from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Alternatively, he chastised a society that he said leaves these young men without a moral compass. ""We need to give them dreams again, not to worry about sagging pants, but sagging morality,"" Sharpton said. ""If we told them who they could be and what they could do, they would pull up their pants and get to work.""

Keying on the fabled rhythm of King's ""I have a dream"" refrain, orators reveled in the repeated phrase, punctuating remarks with: ""It's movement time,"" ""Keep dreaming,"" ""Redeem the dream"" and ""We still have work to do.""

Sixteen-year-old Qion Nicholson's only knowledge of the original march was what he learned in school. Arriving by bus from Asbury Park, N.J., he said he now feels part of that history going forward.

""I'm grateful to be living in today's era,"" said Nicholson, of Sayreville. ""The (original) march meant so much for our country.""

Andrea Williams arrived at the event with what she described as a personal history of marching for labor rights. Today as a 34-year-old Army staff sergeant from Queens, N.Y., who has served four combat tours in Iraq, Williams said she felt fulfilled by all that she saw.

The daughter of a union organizer, Williams said she marched with her mother as a child.

""My mother instilled in me a sense of action, not just that you want to do something, but act on it,"" she said, her husband and 4-year-old at her side.

Organizers were planning for nearly 100,000 to attend Saturday. Minutes before key speeches began, buses were backed up still trying to the reach the site. The crowd was expanding east to the base of the Washington Monument. People stood a dozen deep along the length of the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial where, their forebears cooled their feet in the stifling heat and humidity of the original event.

Weather on Saturday was cool and breezy. U.S. Park Police said there were few problems and only about dozen of those attended fell out from problems with the heat.

The many elderly were assisted down grassy slopes by younger marchers to places where tree shade and folding chairs were waiting. Mixing with Martin Luther King T-shirt salesmen were activists working the crowd with literature discussing racial profiling, ""stand-your-ground"" laws and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.

Marchers streamed in shoulder to shoulder, clutching an array of signs promoting the march, jobs, the DREAM Act and protection of voting rights. Many posters bore the face of slain black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Organizers kept iron-fisted limits on dozens of early speakers to two minutes, cutting microphone feeds if someone went too long. People booed when Julian Bond was shut down in midsentence.

Among arrivals watching the event was Lillian Reynolds, a minister and social worker from Mount Vernon, N.Y., who said she was there because of goals still unmet.

Literacy rates remain too low and black unemployment too high, she said, moving through tight security for a place to see her son, gospel hip-hop artist JProphet, perform. ""Trying to get there and not miss it,"" Reynolds said.

Two adult sisters attending Saturday's march echoed the view that racial unity is still a far-off dream in America. Marjorie Francis, 36, of Jackson, N.J., lamented the growth in voter identification laws across the country.

""It's a solution to a problem that didn't exist,"" she said. Said her sister, Maureen Francis, 39, of Monroe N.J., ""you always have to be fighting for freedom.""

Riding the bus from Asbury was William Griffin, 88, who also attended the original march, elbowing his way through the crowd to hear King speak.

""At the time,"" he said, ""you wondered whether it was going to do any good, whether it was going to have any results.""

There is no question that rank-and-file gay couples of all political stripes are sincere in their desire to enjoy the benefits and status that come with marriage. There is no sinister agenda at work in the issue of same-sex marriage among the masses. But the same cannot be said of the organized left who have always intended to use the issue of gay marriage as a vehicle to destroy the Christian Church and marginalize Christians.

Faithfulness to the Bible and the Christian faith will very soon be declared bigotry by the media and a de facto civil rights violation by the State.

What is currently happening to the Boy Scouts of America at the hands of the organized left is nothing more than a trial run for what is surely coming next against the Church. The small ball has already begun: lawsuits, harassment, and media campaigns against those who preach what the Bible says. The Big Leagues, however, don’t launch until the State lights the torchfor the witch hunt, and that has already happened in the state of Washington.

Although America’s most protected right is freedom of religion, that didn’t stop the state attorney general from filing a suit against Baronelle Stutzman, a florist who said it was a “violation of conscience” to service a same-sex wedding.

JD Bristol, attorney for Arlene’s, said his client has many customers and employees who are gay and the claim that she is “discriminating on the basis on sexual orientation is nonsense.”

“This is about gay marriage, it’s not about a person being gay,” Bristol said. “She has a conscientious objection to homosexual marriage, not homosexuality. It violates her conscience.”

According to the florist, in response to standing by her Christian beliefs, she has received hate mail and threats to burn down her business.

This is not an isolated incident, either. Back in February a baker who wouldn’t provide a cake for a lesbian wedding not only faced protesters but is (or was) under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General. Back in 2006, a Catholic adoption service in Boston had to shut down after the government demanded the religious entity service same-sex couples.

For those skeptical of the organized left’s desire to destroy the Church; one question: is it really a leap to believe that the same government currently attempting to force the Church and other religious business-owners to pay for the abortion pill will soon use the same arguments and precedents to force same sex marriage on these institutions?

Shapiro says that TruthRevolt.org is launching by targeting Al Sharpton of MSNBC’s PoliticsNation. Their petition, which will be sent to stockholders and board members of Sharpton’s advertisers, states:

Al Sharpton is one of the greatest race hoaxers and divisive demagogues of the last half-century….Now it’s time to let his advertisers know that we won’t stand for our purchases backing his propaganda. TruthRevolt is leading the fight to inform Sharpton’s financial backers just who Sharpton is – and what the consequences will be for continuing to support his race-baiting.

TruthRevolt.org has launched a Twitter campaign to tweet @RitzCrackers with hashtag #SharptonsCrackers.

The Daily Beast reports:

The first Sharpton sponsor the group is targeting is Ritz Crackers, owned by Chicago-based Mondelez International. Shapiro said Truth Revolt chose Mondelez because it bills itself as a “family-friendly company” and because it was one of the few advertisers to respond to the group’s inquiries about why it supports the Sharpton show.

As part of its response, Mondelez International said in a statement to Truth Revolt: “At Mondelez International we demonstrate our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship by participating in programs that best serve a wide range of local communities and their interests and needs. We extend our responsibility to the sponsorship of tasteful, believable television programming and we avoid sponsorship of programs that would be unacceptable in terms of generally accepted social or community standards.”

Shapiro says, “If anyone believes that Al Sharpton is tasteful and believable, they are delusional. The American people must wake Sharpton’s advertisers to their delusions. This is war – and for the left, the shock troops are those in the media who live off of advertiser and donor dollars. We must not be afraid to go after their funding sources. And we will.”"

Senate approved the measure last month

Amendment would have to be approved by voters

Bill would cover %22historically significant displays%22 that may also have religious significance

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A House committee approved a constitutional amendment Wednesday that would authorize governments and schools to display the Ten Commandments, but an American Civil Liberties Union attorney said the law can't ""trump the Constitution.""

The legislation, sponsored by GOP Sen. Gerald Dial would allow public schools and public bodies to display ""historically significant displays which reflect the foundations of the rule of law in America, notwithstanding that such displays may also have religious significance.""

The Senate approved the measure last month 23-1. The committee approved the amendment on a voice vote; it now goes to the House of Representatives. If approved there, the amendment would go to voters in 2014.

As introduced, the bill explicitly authorized the display of the Ten Commandments. Dial said at a meeting of the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections committee that the language was changed in an attempt to stave off potential lawsuits.

""That would certainly result in us going to court, because of challenges based on religious content,"" he said.

After the meeting, Dial said he hoped the measure would defend local communities that wanted to display the Ten Commandments.

""We changed to historically significant religious documents,"" he said. ""That would include the Ten Commandments, that would include the Pledge of Allegiance, you could even display a coin that said 'In God We Trust' in your building and not worry about being sued by someone.""

Dial argued that the Ten Commandments would be considered a ""historically significant"" document, claiming the Founding Fathers had implemented it in the creation of the U.S. Constitution.

But the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a similar argument made in Stone v. Graham, a 1980 decision that struck down a Kentucky statute requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms.

The Kentucky statute required displays of the Ten Commandments to include language saying the ""secular application"" of the Ten Commandments ""is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States."" The Supreme Court said the Ten Commandments were a ""sacred text,"" and that ""no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.""

""The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,"" the court wrote. ""Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: Worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.""

The historically significant context, Dial said afterward, would not authorize the display of other religious documents, such as the Quran.

Current Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore brought the public display of the Ten Commandments to the forefront during a legal and political fight over him displaying the Commandments on a more than 2-ton granite monument he had placed in the state judicial building.

Moore originally was removed from office almost a decade ago for refusing a federal judge's order to remove the monument, which also depicted other historic documents. Moore ran again last year and reclaimed his seat.

Heather Weaver, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said in an interview Wednesday that ""state law can't trump the First Amendment,"" which provides for separation of church and state.

She warned the state was setting itself up for lawsuits.

""It's a power grab by the state, and it injects the state into these deeply personal religious matters,"" Weaver said. ""Religious liberty for individuals and groups can only be guaranteed when government remains neutral.""

The amendment includes language banning the use of public funds ""in defense of the constitutionality of this amendment.""

Dial argued that the display of the commandments, particularly the Fifth Commandment's prohibition of killing, would be ""worth it"" if sight of the commandment inspired a student to avoid violent acts. That drew skepticism from Democratic Rep. Juandalynn Givan.

""People see these words every day, and I don't think they've stopped anyone yet,"" Givan said after the meeting. ""You have to have the mindset, as well as the heart, not to kill."""

That’s not a phrase that Carol Champommier ever expected to see. She’s a schoolteacher, not an activist; a rule follower, not a renegade.

Advertisement

But Champommier is suing the United States because a federal agent shot her son to death in a parking lot encounter that played out like a scene from an action movie, where two unrelated story lines coalesce in violent tragedy.

Government lawyers contend the shooting three years ago was reasonable — that 18-year-old Zac Champommier tried to run down an officer with his car, creating a “deadly, immediate threat” that justified gunfire.

Carol Champommier blames poor training, reckless conduct and a coverup by officers unwilling to acknowledge they killed a panicky kid, not a criminal.

Zac had driven to the parking lot in Studio City to meet a young man he’d chatted with online. But when Zac arrived, he saw the acquaintance scuffling with what seemed to be a bunch of middle-aged toughs. Apparently, the acquaintance had been looking for Zac, and the men had seen him peering into parked cars and thought he might be a thief.

Advertisement

The men were part of an undercover law enforcement task force: sheriff’s deputies, LAPD officers and DEA agents, in leather jackets and T-shirts. They’d just completed a narcotics raid and were “debriefing” in the public lot, with the drugs and cash they’d confiscated still in their unmarked cars.

It’s too late now to ask what Zac thought as he stepped on the gas of his mother’s Toyota and the car struck a deputy holding a gun. A DEA agent nearby responded by firing off three shots.

Advertisement

Was Zac trying to mow down officers to keep them from arresting his acquaintance? Or was he just trying to maneuver a balky stick shift to flee men dressed like hoodlums and armed with guns?

::

Testimony in Champommier’s lawsuit ended this week in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald. Her friends and neighbors from Porter Ranch showed up. So did Zac’s friends, who were on spring break. Champommier counseled them on her Facebook page: “Attire is business casual, no flip-flops.”

Attorneys will make closing statements later this month. Then the judge — who heard the case without a jury — will determine if the use of deadly force by officers was “objectively reasonable” under the circumstances that night.

Advertisement

It’s a question of both perception and facts, and the trial offered plenty of both.

A customer at the Chipotle restaurant nearby described two men with guns in the parking lot. One “looked like a biker person” in a leather jacket. The other held his weapon “like in the movies, very professionally” before firing “boom, boom, boom” at Zac’s car.

Advertisement

“I thought they were all biker gangs,” the witness testified. He was so unnerved by the violence, he rushed his children into his car and drove off with their seat belts unfastened.

Crash and ballistics experts spent days on the stand parsing details: the trajectory of the bullets, the speed of Zac’s car and how many seconds it takes to unholster a weapon, draw, aim and fire.

Advertisement

Champommier sat in the front row each day, staring at photos of her car with bloodstains and a bullet hole in the driver’s spot, listening to witnesses and lawyers spar over the final moments of her son’s life, watching DEA agent Peter LoPresti demonstrate how he pointed his gun at the car’s driver and fired the fatal shots.

I wondered as I watched LoPresti on the stand, earnest and unemotional, how many times he must have privately replayed that evening in his mind, trying to recall exactly what he felt, thought and did in the moments that changed so many lives.

Advertisement

LoPresti fired, he testified, because Zac’s car rammed the deputy hard enough to thrust the lawman onto its hood. Things happened so fast he didn’t have time to think. “It was simply a reaction” to his perception that officers’ lives were in danger, he said.

We “had to have that threat stopped. That’s why I shot.”

Advertisement

::

It’s not hard to imagine that in the context of that night, the unexpected might have felt like a threat.

Advertisement

That the officers, amped up on adrenaline, might have been primed to respond with firepower to trouble in the parking lot. That the public might have presumed that the dressed-down cops were actually gun-toting criminals.

Reasonableness can be a squishy concept; your view depends on your prism.

Advertisement

The government seems determined to blame Zac for his own demise, questioning, in finger-wagging style, even the young man’s choice to meet up with a stranger he’d connected with online. The judge, to his credit, shut that avenue down.

The issue is not what brought Zac to that parking lot but what circumstances led to the fatal shots.

Advertisement

“These agents and officers have a tough job,” acknowledged Champommier’s lawyer, Cara Eisenberg. But they created an unnecessary danger by debriefing in a crowded public parking lot.

“Our position is that they shouldn’t set up a situation where they can’t take the time to discern the difference between a minor traffic accident ... and a threat of deadly force,” she said. “Nobody hates the cops. We just want them to be as fair as possible, and not do harm to the rest of us.”

Advertisement

It’s not uncommon, DEA agents testified, for undercover officers to assemble in a public spot and leave their cache of seized guns, narcotics and cash unguarded in their unmarked cars.

It’s also courting trouble. Isn’t it reasonable to expect that officers would log that evidence at the station and lock it down before heading off to discuss the case?

Advertisement

The nature of much of law enforcement is making split-second choices in life-or-death situations. That’s why it troubles me that the government seems so cavalier about how that evening turned out.

Maybe those officers need to believe they were not responsible for what happened in that parking lot. It must be tough to contemplate the possibility that a frightened young man who meant no harm was gunned down for no good reason that night.

Listen up!,"x Embedded Content

In the approximately two minutes that Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke on All In with Chris Hayes, she articulated the Democratic message that every Democrat running for office must turn into muscle and reactive memory. Sen. Warren was on the show to talk about her new bill, the Equal Employment for All Act that would prevent employers from discriminating against Americans with poor credit ratings. She successfully made the case that employers checking credit ratings of potential employees disproportionately affect the poor and the middle class. It further damages potential employee credit as they are unemployed for a longer time or may have to settle for low wage jobs. Hayes could not have Sen. Warren on the show without pivoting to her populist propensity. He asked her if there is an Elizabeth Warren wing of the party that she leads. She humbly dismissed the personalization of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. “This isn’t about me,” she said. “This is about the issues about what’s happening to America’s families.” Sen. Warren went on to say that America’s hardworking families have been hammered on for a generation as a the result of supply side economics. She then enumerated the specific issues they are dealing with like declining wages, core expenses, housing, healthcare, daycare, and college, then tying it to how the middle class has coped so far. Everyone in the household has to work. When that is not enough, they get into debt. And for that debt, they are exploited by a predatory credit industry that make huge profits on their backs. She said no longer can a parent tell their kids they will be better off. Hayes detailed a sad truth. The middle class decline occurred under both Democratic and Republican rule. This can be attributed to a Democratic party that for all practical purposes has kept supply side economics in effect. Hayes asked if Democrats had done enough. Sen. Warren demonstrated her political bona fides. She did not address past Democratic middle class failures. Instead, she said Democrats must be forward looking and fight for the middle class.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-embodies-kings-dream-struggle-070620427.html,,[],Obama embodies King's dream and his struggle,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama will lead the civil rights pioneers of today and two of his presidential predecessors Wednesday in a celebrative but solemn commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech of yesteryear, saluting his fight for equal opportunity.

Large crowds thronged to the National Mall and the Lincoln Memorial where King, with a soaring, rhythmic oratory and a steely countenance, pleaded with Americans to come together to stomp out racism and create a land of opportunity for all.

Slate-gray skies and a light drizzle greeted the earliest arrivals for an observance that seemed likely to take on a more formal, serious tone, than a commemorative rally last Saturday. People eager to get a close-up view of Obama and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton clustered at a security checkpoint. And National Guard troops were arrayed along fence lines encircling the Mall from the World War II Memorial to the Lincoln Memorial.

The scheduled appearance later Wednesday of Obama, the first African-American president, was certain to embody the fulfilled dreams of hundreds of thousands who rallied there in 1963. Obama has not often talked publicly about racial issues in the time he has been president. He did, however, talk at some length about the challenges he faced as a young black male as he discussed the case of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen-ager killed in a confrontation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.

When Obama took office in January 2009, he had broken through barriers that many before him could only approach. But his presidency has been marred by racist backlash and his administration has found itself still taking on battles thought won, such as ensuring equal access to the voting booth.

Obama's speech was set to follow an organized ringing of church bells at mid-afternoon, about the same time of day that King, his jaw squared and his turning, delivered his clarion call for equal rights. Obama was being joined at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by Carter and Clinton. Other luminaries include Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, daughter of President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a longtime leader in the civil rights battles.

Story continues

At an interfaith service, the Rev. Bernice King opened the celebration. King said that her father is often remembered as a freedom fighter for equal rights and human rights. But she said he was most importantly a man of faith.

""He was a pastor, he was a prophet, he was a faith leader,"" she said. ""It was that faith and the spirit of God that infused that movement.""

King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, said blacks can rightfully celebrate his father's life and work but much more work lies ahead.

He bemoaned ""staggering unemployment"" among black males age 18 to 30 and said he fears too many blacks still ""are first judged by t heir color and then the content of their character.""

Preceding the speeches was a march featuring a replica of a transit bus that civil rights leader Rosa Parks rode when she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955.

Obama considers the 1963 march a ""seminal event"" and part of his generation's ""formative memory."" A half-century after the march, he said, is a good time to reflect on how far the country has come and how far it still has to go.

In an interview Tuesday on Tom Joyner's radio show, Obama said he imagines that King ""would be amazed in many ways about the progress that we've made."" He listed advances such as equal rights before the law, an accessible judicial system, thousands of African-American elected officials, African-American CEOs and the doors that the civil rights movement opened for Latinos, women and gays.

""I think he would say it was a glorious thing,"" he said.

But Obama noted that King's speech was also about jobs and justice.

""When it comes to the economy, when it comes to inequality, when it comes to wealth, when it comes to the challenges that inner cities experience, he would say that we have not made as much progress as the civil and social progress that we've made, and that it's not enough just to have a black president, it's not enough just to have a black syndicated radio show host,"" the president said.

King's son was interviewed on NBC's ""Today"" show.

Soledad Cross from a Southern California veterans memorial on Thursday was the latest skirmish in the war against religion and faith, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said not even Congress can protect landmark symbols from “angry atheists armed with attorneys.”

“This is just more reason why we need to stand up for our constitution and the religious liberty it protects,” Palin said.

Palin urged her followers on Friday to read a Breitbart News report on the decision, and said that the attacks on veterans’ memorials mean those “who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms can’t even be honored with a symbol embodying one of those freedoms.”

In her blockbuster bestseller Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, Palin has said these attacks are the tip of the spear in a larger fight to fundamentally transform America. Palin noted that in “Good Tidings and Great Joy,” she “mentioned a lawsuit taken against a World War I veterans memorial cross in California’s Mojave Desert”:

In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave Desert– in an isolated area known as Sunrise Rock– to honor our brave soldiers who died in World War I. The modest cross, made out of eight-foot metal pipes painted white, sat on 1.6 acres of desert, 90 percent of which is federal land. Though it was ‘in the middle of nowhere,’ it meant such a great deal to many people. In 1983, when a World War I veteran lay on his deathbed, he asked his best friend, Henry Sandoz, to take care of the cross. And that’s exactly what Henry faithfully did every year after his friend’s death. Henry was in his seventies by the time Frank Buono, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit claiming that this lovingly maintained old cross unconstitutionally promoted the Christian faith. As the case bounced from one court to another, the cross was enclosed with plywood, covered like an adult magazine in the back of a bookstore. Over the course of the court battle, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, it was even stolen. Finally, after eight long years of battling, the cross was able to remain on the land by transferring the property surrounding it to a private citizen.

Though the Mojave Desert cross was saved, the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial cross in San Diego was not, even though in 2004, Congress, as Palin noted, “passed a law protecting its right to exist as a national memorial to the brave men and women in uniform ‘who sacrificed their lives in the defense of the United States.'”

“But apparently even Congress can’t stop angry atheists armed with attorneys. As I’ve said repeatedly in interviews about ‘Good Tidings and Great Joy,’ the so-called ‘war on Christmas’ is just the tip-of-the-spear in the larger efforts to strip God from the public square and banish all expressions of faith from public life,” she wrote.

Palin has consistently stood up against the “PC police.” On Thursday, hours after Palin told Breitbart Sports that she was disappointed that ESPN had rejected a commercial from a Catholic hospital because the station found the words “God” and “Jesus” to be “problematic,” ESPN reversed course and accepted the original ad, which it will air on Saturday.

Palin also posted a statement from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) that said the decision was “deeply flawed” because the “federal court decision declaring the memorial unconstitutional and ordering its removal does not square with the facts” and the “memorial is part of the historic landscape of San Diego and is consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”

The ACLJ has “promised to file an amicus brief in support of an expected appeal to keep the memorial – which includes a commemorative cross – in place.”

“We will continue to aggressively argue in support of this memorial and commemorative cross,” ACLJ President Jay Sekulow said. “We believe the law and precedent are clear: the Supreme Court has concluded in the past that ‘a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It is a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people.'”

Sekulow added that “this memorial should not create a constitutional crisis. It is part of the history and heritage of the San Diego area.”"

Fair Housing Act passed after Martin Luther King%27s assassination

New Jersey case asks what is illegal -- discriminatory intent or impact%3F

But settlement talks could scuttle case before justices rule

WASHINGTON -- Fresh from race-related rulings this summer on voting rights and affirmative action, the Supreme Court now faces another landmark civil rights case that could make it tougher for minorities to prove housing discrimination.

At stake is the Fair Housing Act, a law enacted one week after Martin Luther King's assassination in April 1968 during the race riots that followed. The justices are being asked to weaken the law as interpreted by the Obama administration and lower courts, and civil rights groups weary over this year's battles are gearing up for another.

One potential development could reduce the growing tension between those groups and a court they view as antagonistic: a settlement between the small town of Mount Holly, N.J., and low-income residents of a blighted housing complex that has been targeted for redevelopment for a decade. A similar case in St. Paul, Minn., was settled last year, just two weeks before the Supreme Court was to hear oral arguments.

""We have wanted to settle this case from day one,"" says Olga Pomar of South Jersey Legal Services, which is representing the residents. ""We think that continuing this litigation is not in anyone's interest.""

But as the two sides negotiate, they are plowing ahead with legal briefs and preparing for oral arguments as early as December, less than six months after the justices' landmark decision striking down a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

James Maley, the attorney representing the town, says Mount Holly (pop. 9,536) isn't out to reverse decades of settled housing discrimination law, in much the same way Shelby County, Ala., brought the case that struck down a key section of the Voting Rights Act.

""Discussions will continue right up until there's a decision,"" Maley says of the settlement talks. The town, he says, ""is not focused on making a statement in the world of fair housing.""

WEIGHING INTENT, IMPACT

The town's brief was filed last week, marking the first legal step since the justices agreed in June to hear its appeal of an appellate court ruling. At issue is whether the Fair Housing Act requires blacks and other minorities to prove intentional racial discrimination in sales, rentals, zoning or lending practices, or whether a policy's ""disparate impact"" is enough to make it illegal.

That difference between intent and impact is at the root of many civil rights laws, from education and employment to disability and voting rights. In most cases, showing that minorities are disproportionately affected is enough; that is how lower courts and the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs have enforced the Fair Housing Act.

But opponents -- including developers, bankers, insurers and conservative groups -- have challenged that interpretation, noting that the law does not refer to disparate impact. And the high court's decision to hear the case without a split among federal appeals courts has led civil rights groups to worry that its conservative majority is ready to rule against them.

""It would really cut the legs out of fair housing enforcement,"" says Joseph Rich, director of the fair housing project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Proving intentional racial bias is more difficult, he says, because ""discrimination is pretty subtle these days.""

Andrew Sandler, chairman of BuckleySandler, a law firm representing the financial services industry, says real discrimination still would be punished if the high court did away with disparate impact claims. The problem now, he says, is that bankers don't make loans that could benefit all sorts of borrowers when they risk being accused of favoring whites over minorities.

""Innovation is being stifled because of fear that underwriting criteria based on making it easier to make loans for people could have a disparate impact,"" Sandler says.

A FIGHT NO ONE WANTS?

At the center of the case is a 30-acre neighborhood outside Philadelphia of two-story, attached row houses called The Gardens that is blighted and overrun by crime. In 2000, about 1,600 people lived in the neighborhood, about two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Most household incomes were far below the town's $43,000 median.

Since 2002, Mount Holly officials have sought to demolish the homes and replace them with 520 mostly market-priced apartments and townhomes; 56 would be reserved for Gardens residents.

While about 260 families have moved out, many with relocation assistance from the town, about 70 remain, including about 30 that are parties to the lawsuit. They have charged that any redevelopment of the neighborhood would affect blacks and Hispanics more than whites and is therefore discriminatory.

Not true, the town argues in its recent brief to the court. The Fair Housing Act ""prohibits intentional discrimination alone; it does not require local officials to use race as a criterion in determining how best to allocate limited resources in the context of redeveloping an entire section of a community,"" it says.

But proving intentional discrimination is ""an extremely hard burden for a plaintiff,"" Pomar says."" People don't leave memos that contain obvious smoking guns in this day and age.""

The Obama administration and its civil rights allies aren't eager to fight this battle in a court with a 5-4 conservative majority. The Department of Justice intervened in the last case to get St. Paul officials to drop their appeal and settle with landlords, who had alleged that the city's aggressive enforcement policies reduced the amount of affordable housing for minorities.

Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance, is hopeful this case will end as that one did -- with an out-of-court settlement in which minority residents are compensated. That would be in Mount Holly's interest as well, she says, because litigation ""hurts a community's reputation."""

Follow Him On Twitter At""]",UNC prof ignites 4th Amendment debate after being pulled over by fire truck,"When a North Carolina firefighter switched on the siren atop his Chapel Hill Fire Department truck to get a driver he suspected of being impaired to pull over, he probably didn't expect to ignite a constitutional debate.

But that's exactly what has happened. The woman Fire Lt. Gordon Shatley pulled over on his way back from a call was Dorothy Hoogland Verkerk, a professor at the University of North Carolina and former town council member who is arguing use of the fire truck and siren - which are not authorized for law enforcement actions - gave the color of government to what might otherwise have been a lawful citizen's arrest. And although a lower court upheld Verkerk's arrest, an appellate court remanded the case with instructions to consider whether it was an illegal search and seizure.

The incident occurred in May, 2011, and led to Verkerk's arrest and eventual conviction by an Orange County District Court judge for driving while intoxicated. Verkerk, who teaches art history at UNC-Chapel Hill, claimed in her appeal that Shatley violated her rights under the Fourth Amendment when he used the lights and sirens on the fire truck he was driving to pull her over. When she sped away, he called police who later caught and charged her.

Lower court Judge Elaine Bushfan denied Verkerk's motion claiming that Shatley had conducted a citizen’s arrest, but suspended her sentence and ordered the professor to spend 30 days in jail plus 18 months’ probation, pay a $1,000 fine, and perform 72 hours of community service.

That’s when Verkerk filed with the court of appeals and the three-member panel ordered Bushfan to consider anew the legality of Shatley stopping the driver. In particular, the appellate judges said it must be determined whether or not Shatley acted as a private citizen or as a governmental officer; if Shatley did act as a government officer, whether he followed Fourth Amendment criteria and had reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed; and finally if the stop was unconstitutional, if that tainted evidence and the subsequent police traffic stop.

One member of the appeals panel, Judge Robert Hunter, found that Shatley was indeed a governmental officer at the time he stopped her, but conceded that he lacked police training and the legal authority to make an official traffic stop.

According to court documents, Shatley was on his way to a fire scene the night of May 27, 2011, when he saw Verkerk’s Mercedes stopped in an intersection. He noticed that the headlights were off and that the interior and auxiliary lights were lit and that the driver’s side window was partially opened despite a pouring rain. Shatley continued to his destination where he was no longer needed, and headed back to the firehouse.

On the way back, Shatley claims he pulled up behind Verkerk’s car as she was driving with a hazard light on and was weaving while driving much slower than the speed limit. Shatley told the driver of the firetruck to turn on the lights and siren to prevent other cars from passing.

Verkerk’s car then swerved to the right and hit the curb before coming to a stop, according to the documents.

Shatley hopped out of the fire truck and approached her car to see if she was ok. He did not ask if she was drunk but did urge her to park her car and have someone pick her up, according to documents. She told Shatley that she would, but then drove off. She was picked up by Chapel Hill Police 10 minutes later and charged with driving while impaired and had her license taken away.

In addition to teaching at UNC, Verkerk, who did not return requests for comment, is a former member of the Town Council and is a local environmental activist."

USA TODAY

Obama acknowledges he may not be best person to lead a dialogue on race

President was criticized for remarks in a prior race-related case

Suggests Americans give deeper thought to racial bias

WASHINGTON — When it comes to dealing with the sticky issue of race in America, President Obama has found that leading from behind might not be such a bad idea.

He was pilloried by critics on the right early in his presidency when he said a Cambridge, Mass., police officer ""acted stupidly"" when he arrested the black Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. as he struggled to open the door of his home in a predominantly white neighborhood.

And Obama raised eyebrows, when he remarked after Trayvon Martin's death last year that ""if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""

So, it's no surprise that he took a cautious approach as he weighed in for the first time since a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon.

In a surprise appearance before reporters six days after the verdict, Obama spoke eloquently about Trayvon's family showing grace in the aftermath of the verdict, and he reiterated his understanding of the pain the African-American community feels over the outcome of the trial and the larger problem of racial profiling.

And Obama again connected himself directly to the teenager when he observed that he could have been Trayvon 35 years ago.

But the president, despite the historic nature of his presidency, also made clear that he's not the best person to be leading a difficult conversation about race.

Instead, he argued that the larger discussion of race belongs not with lawmakers in Washington but in living rooms, houses of worship and workplaces.

In such settings, Obama posited, ""There's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?""

The president rightfully noted that as a nation we've made progress in our dialogue on race. But, as he also made clear, we're hardly in a post-racial era.

Obama, who has long contended with a portion of America's views about his ""other-ness,"" seems to have realized that a president – even an African-American one – can sometimes serve the public dialogue on race best by merely participating in the conversation rather than directing it."

The Tennessean

Vote on Amendment 1 is Nov. 4%2C 2014

In 2000%2C the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled women have a fundamental right to abortion in the state

Duggar family%2C of %2219 Kids and Counting%22 fame%2C lend their support to Amendment 1

NASHVILLE -- The next general election may be exactly one year away, but the upcoming battle over the future of abortion in Tennessee is getting started Monday.

Reality television show stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, along with their 19 children and three grandchildren, will visit a Madison, Tenn., church Monday night to encourage an expected audience of 3,000 to vote in favor of Amendment 1 on Nov. 4, 2014. The proposed constitutional amendment would give lawmakers more authority to regulate and restrict abortions.

At a separate event Monday night, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, a Republican from Blountville, will launch the ""Yes on 1"" campaign with a reception and dinner. The campaign has just hired an experienced political fundraiser and a veteran campaign manager and expects to raise more than $250,000 at the kickoff event.

""Now that our time has come, we're not going to take anything for granted,"" said Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, which worked for more than a decade to get the measure on the 2014 ballot. ""We're going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed.""

The preparation over Amendment 1 in Tennessee comes as a recent Texas abortion ruling could lead to a national fight in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. Texas' new law -- which went into effect Friday -- is one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws.

It will be up to Tennessee voters to decide whether the state's constitution will, for the first time, specifically address abortion. The referendum would add this language: ""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.""

The wording could pave the way for lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions that have been previously ruled out of bounds under the constitution's strong privacy protections.

""I think it's going to be a fight, that's for sure,"" said Jeff Teague, the president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee, one of the chief organizers of the yet-to-be-launched campaign against the measure. ""The fact that the other side is already kicking off their effort so early is a (recognition) on their part (that) it's going to be a fight.""

The effort to defeat the measure, however, has not been dormant. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Tennessee and the American Civil Liberties Union have conducted polling and focus groups, secured commitments for donations and begun working with local and national groups to get organized and develop a plan.

The two groups were behind the original lawsuit challenging abortion regulations in Tennessee in the 1990s. At the time, Tennessee had some of the strictest abortion rules in the country. They included a requirement that doctors use materials created by the state to counsel women seeking abortions, a mandatory two-day waiting period after the counseling and a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals rather than outpatient clinics.

In 2000, the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down those regulations and ruled that women have a fundamental right to abortion in Tennessee.

""A woman's right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution,"" the opinion said.

Trenches set up

Proponents view the upcoming year as critical to defending those hard-won abortion rights.

""The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee,"" said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee. ""We're confident when the public understands what this ballot initiative is about, they will vote no. Tennesseans want their privacy and understand that this ballot initiative takes away that privacy.""

Since the state Supreme Court decision, those who oppose abortion have been working to get the proposed amendment before voters. To get a referendum on the state ballot, the groups first had to wait until the Legislature had enough supportive lawmakers in office.Then, according to state rules, the measure had to be approved twice in separate years, which eventually happened in 2009 and 2011.

Jim Bob Duggar and his family — stars of the reality TLC network program 19 Kids and Counting — will perform a concert, sign books and speak about their support of Amendment 1 when they visit Cornerstone Church in Madison. Joining them will be Alveda King, niece of the late Martin Luther King Jr., an outspoken opponent of abortion.

""I really believe a lot of Christians have sat on the sidelines and not gotten involved in politics in the past and not bothered to vote,"" said Duggar, a former Arkansas state representative. ""There is a whole sleeping giant of Christians out there. A lot of people in Tennessee don't realize that because of the Supreme Court decision back in 2000, they wiped out almost every regulation and state law that regulated abortions.""

Tennessee's power debated

That message — that Tennessee lawmakers lack the ability to regulate abortion — is disputed by abortion rights advocates, who point to a series of existing state abortion restrictions.

Among them: Tennessee requires minors to obtain the consent of one parent before having an abortion and requires abortion clinic waiting rooms to post signs ""in 40 pt. Arial font"" informing patients that it is illegal for anyone to coerce a woman into an abortion. Last year, lawmakers passed the ""Life Defense Act of 2012,"" which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital — a law that one Knoxville, Tenn., abortion clinic cited as forcing its closure. In addition, Tennessee halted funding for Planned Parenthood last year, redirecting it to other clinics.

""It's just false to say our legislature cannot pass laws,"" Weinberg said. ""It's misleading and not true. Proponents of the amendment have attempted to hide the true nature of this initiative by couching it in language, saying there are no state laws regulating abortion when the reality is the Tennessee Legislature is able to pass legislation as they have for some years, and right now there are numerous laws on the books regulating abortion in Tennessee.""

An open invitation?

While abortion restrictions do exist, the Tennessee constitution bars other laws that neighboring states have enacted, including waiting periods, bans on later trimester abortions and required ultrasounds.

Those added restrictions have led more women from other states to come to Tennessee to have abortions, a Tennessean special report in May 2012 found. More than 1 in 4 abortions in Tennessee were sought by women from out of state, according to an analysis of abortion data.

Opponents of abortion say that voters don't want Tennessee to be known for its lack of abortion regulations. The Yes on 1 campaign website posts a large illustration of a highway welcome sign with the words ""The Volunteer State welcomes you"" inside the state map. Underneath, it says ""an abortion destination?""

Text of Amendment 1

""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother."""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/martin_luther_king_01.shtml,,[],Martin Luther King's Style of Leadership,"There were many leaders in the civil rights struggle, but Martin Luther King was more than just the most conspicuous -and eloquent - among them. Peter Ling examines King's leadership role during his campaign for peace and justice.

The 'great leader' myth

Thanks to the miracle of television, Martin Luther King Junior is vividly remembered as an inspirational speaker, whose leadership was seemingly rooted in oratory. Speeches such as the 'I Have A Dream' speech at the civil rights march on Washington of August 1963 galvanised people of all races, and created an unprecedented bipartisan coalition for anti-racist legislation.

King undoubtedly spoke to, and for, African Americans, and their mounting challenge to white oppression sprang from hearing his non-violent call to arms. When he died the non-violent movement seemed unable to continue without him, and this deepened the impression that he was its essential leader. His leadership, however, was always being questioned during his lifetime, and this has continued since his death.

Movement activists, particularly militant black separatists, never saw King as their one great leader. When his lieutenants introduced him as a 'Moses' for African Americans, for example, it rankled. Hearing Wyatt Walker, a key aide, introduce King publicly as the people's saviour prompted Bob Moses of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to ask: 'Don't you think we need lots of leaders?'

Privately, King's supporters knew that non-violence was not an outlook everyone shared, and Walker amused King by telling him of how one black Virginian had responded to a white bus driver who wanted him to enter his bus by the back door. A massive figure, the man had picked up the driver with one hand and said bluntly: 'Know two things. I can break your neck, and I ain't one of Martin Luther King's non-violent Negroes.'

'Privately, King's supporters knew that non-violence was not an outlook everyone shared ...'

This recognition that King's non-violent approach was just one tendency within a larger movement - and that he was created by the movement, rather than being the creator of it - has become a staple of recent scholarship. It was not King but other local figures, for instance, who planned the famous Montgomery bus boycott of 1955.

The first student protesters of the 1960s sit-ins similarly denied that they were following King's orders, and it was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), rather than King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), that launched the freedom rides of 1961 - and SNCC volunteers who ensured their success. Furthermore, when members of the SNCC asked King to join them on the ride into Mississippi, he pompously declined, saying: 'I think I should choose the time and place of my Golgotha'. Thereafter, they referred to him sarcastically as 'De Lawd' - and mistrusted a leader who preferred to cheer from the sidelines.

Imagine standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, looking out toward the Washington Monument. A huge crowd has gathered — more than 200,000 people — from all across the nation. They fan out around the Reflecting Pool, to the base of the monument and beyond.

It’s August 1963, and people have come to Washington to demand change. In some parts of the country, black people are not treated the same as white people. The marchers want that to end. They want fair and equal treatment for everyone, no matter the color of their skin. They are part of a growing force called the civil rights movement.

By bus, train and plane, they have come to Washington. Some arrive by car, and one even roller-skates into town. Now they are all on the Mall. For more than five hours they have been marching, singing, praying and listening to speeches.

You are the last speaker on this tiring but exciting day. How will you stir the crowd? As recently as last night, you told a friend you still didn’t know exactly what you would say. But now, here you are. Everyone’s eyes are on you. If you are nervous — who wouldn’t be? — you don’t show it.

You are the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and you are about to give one of the most famous speeches in American history. It will be known as the “I Have a Dream” speech. [See Page 3.]

For many, it will be the high point of the entire civil rights movement.

A nation still divided

The year 1963 marked the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, in which President Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the South were freed. But in some ways, life in the 20th century wasn’t much better for black people (then often called “Negroes” or “colored people”).

“White Only” signs hung over drinking fountains and doorways in several states. Many hotels would not rent rooms to black people. The best jobs went to whites. In some places, black people were not allowed to vote.

Keeping the races separated is called segregation. Schools, churches, buses and trains, movie theaters and even professional sports teams all were segregated at some point in U.S. history.

The 1950s and ’60s featured a big push for equality. King, the son of a Baptist minister and a minister himself, was a leader in this fight for civil rights. He preached the power of love over hate. He urged people to challenge unfair laws and actions, but to do so peacefully. King said black people should work with white people to gain equality.

Not everyone agreed with King, but there was no doubt that his was a powerful voice.

Steps toward equality

Several civil rights milestones happened in the decade before the 1963 rally in Washington. Among them:

The U.S. Supreme Court said “separate but equal” schools for white and black children were illegal. Then Rosa Parks, who was black, refused to give up her bus seat to a white rider in Montgomery, Alabama. Her case and others led to a court ruling that segregation on buses was illegal.

Across the South, rallies were held to protest other forms of segregation, including keeping black people from voting. There were “sit-in” protests at segregated lunch counters, libraries, parks and other public places. In Birmingham, Alabama, police dogs and water cannons were turned on protesters; more than 1,000 people, including King, were arrested.

The nation was moving slowly — but not always willingly — toward treating the races equally, a process called integration. In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to pass a major civil rights bill giving all Americans access to public places and protecting the right to vote.

‘Freedom now’

Civil rights leaders and others got busy planning a big rally. They called it the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. When the big day, August 28, arrived, thousands of marchers headed for the Mall. Many carried signs: “We Demand Equal Rights Now!” . . . “With Liberty and Justice for All!” . . . “Freedom Now.”

It was the largest civil rights march in history. Millions watched on television.

Several people spoke before King. Some were civil rights leaders; others were leaders of religious groups or groups of workers. Rosa Parks was introduced. Singers Marian Anderson, Mahalia Jackson and Bob Dylan performed.

The youngest speaker was 23-year-old John Lewis, who led a student activist group. Lewis, now a congressman from Georgia, was angry about the slow pace of change in the country, and he wrote a speech that said so. That upset some people, so Lewis agreed to delete the harsh wording. That, in turn, upset other people. Because of this dispute, Lewis’s speech is the only one besides King’s that is still talked about.

Right after the march, King and others met with President Kennedy at the White House. The following July, they returned to watch the new president, Lyndon Johnson, sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And in August 1965, two years after they marched on Washington, the group came back. This time they stood under the Capitol dome as the president signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, calling it “a triumph for freedom.”

The March on Washington had indeed changed history.

Appearing in a Monday interview on Al Jazeera America’s Talk to Al Jazeera with David Shuster, West said 2.5 million new prisoners have been incarcerated while Obama has been in office mostly “because of soft drugs” and the disparity in “crack cocaine versus regular cocaine” users. West referred to this phenomenon as the “new Jim Crow” because he said minority communities and the poor are disproportionately impacted.

West blasted the level of corruption on Wall Street that has seen few people to go jail and said there has been a “two-tiered” system of justice under Obama.

West said that disparity applied to Obama’s economy as well, as corporations have made record profits while there has been “massive unemployment” and “increasing wealth inequality.” He said struggling Americans are “giving up work” or “working part time” in Obama’s economy and those numbers are not reflected in the official unemployment numbers.

Shuster, conversely, gushed over Obama’s accomplishments, saying Obama’s presidency should be considered a success if his presidency was judged by “morality” because Obama prevented a depression, passed Obamacare, ended the Iraq War, ended “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and appointed the first Latina Supreme Court justice. He continued to defend Obama, saying Obama saved the economy and the unemployment rate would have been worse without Obama.

But West disagreed, saying Martin Luther King Jr. would not approve of the “vanilla suburbs” at home that symbolize the income inequality that he said has gotten worse since King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” 50 year ago. West acknowledged that Appalachia also had problems with income and crime inequality."

“My family’s story not just about them – it’s about us,” he said. “It’s the story of millions of people before them and since who achieved here in this land what would have been impossible almost anywhere else. That is still who we are. Today there are millions of people among us, trying to do what my parents did for us and what your parents did for you.""

He did not directly address immigration reform, an issue that has frayed his relationship with many in the tea party movement.

“I’d like to see Marco Rubio, just so I can tell him what I think of his positions: He’s on the wrong track of being a conservative,” Rick Barr, a 60-year-old activist from Indianapolis, said before his speech.

Some said Rubio needed to address the topic head-on to win over skeptics.

“We’re all a little irritated with Marco,” said Judy Peterson, a retired special education teacher from Treasure Island, Fla. “Now, that doesn’t mean we’ve thrown him under the bus. But we would like him to, just come on. He hasn’t explained it very well.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/march-focus-continued-fight-civil-rights-074203940.html,,[],March to focus on continued fight for civil rights,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Alice Long planned months ago to use vacation time to travel from Huntsville, Ala., to the 50th anniversary events for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Long, a NASA administrative assistant, brought along her grandchildren to give them a close-up view of African-American and civil rights history that she said isn't being taught in schools.

""I'm here supporting this march because there are so many injustices in this country,"" Long, 59, said on the eve of Saturday's march from the Lincoln Memorial to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. ""I'm very concerned about it because I have a 5-year-old grandson and a 13-year-old granddaughter.""

Marchers began arriving early Saturday to gather on the National Mall, many staking out their spots as the sun rose in a clear sky over the Capitol. By midday, tens of thousands had gathered on the National Mall.

Eric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, thanked those who marched a half century earlier. He said he would not be in office, nor would Barack Obama be president, without them.

""They marched in spite of animosity, oppression and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept,"" Holder said.

Holder said the spirit of the 1963 march now demands equality for gays, Latinos, women, the disabled and others. Keeping with that theme, those in attendance represented a grab-bag of causes advocating gay rights, organized labor, voting rights and access to local post offices.

Organizers have planned for about 100,000 people to participate in the event, which is the precursor to the actual anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, march. It will be led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and King's son Martin Luther King III. After several speeches, participants will walk the half-mile from the Lincoln Memorial to the 2-year-old memorial.

Those in attendance arrived in a very different, post-9/11 Washington.

Story continues

In 1963, people crowded the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and could get close to King to hear his speech. On Saturday, metal barriers kept people away from the reflecting pool.

Only a small group of attendees was allowed near the memorial. Everyone else has been pushed back and was watching and listening to the speeches on big-screen televisions. Police were stationed atop the Lincoln Memorial. There was a media area and VIP seating.

On the day of the anniversary, President Barack Obama will speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the same place King stood when he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Obama will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 3 p.m. Wednesday, marking the exact time King spoke.

On Friday, a coalition of black leaders issued what they said is the 21st century agenda for the nation as it marks the watershed civil rights event that helped bring about the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The 1963 march drew some 250,000 to the National Mall and ushered in the idea of massive, nonviolent demonstrations.

The leaders named economic parity, equity in education, voting rights, health care access and criminal justice reform as national policy priorities.

National Urban League President Marc Morial said the agenda was ""by no means a complete agenda"" but one that can strengthen the unity among the coalition's members and a way to go forward in a new civil rights movement.

Throughout the buildup to the anniversary march, leaders have been acknowledging and honoring civil rights progress spurred by the 1963 march. But they also have bemoaned what they see as an attack on that progress since King delivered his stirring speech.

They cite the Supreme Court ruling that effectively erased a key anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act; persistent unemployment among African-Americans, which is about double that of white Americans; and the shooting death of unarmed black teenage Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of George Zimmerman.

Organizers of Saturday's march hoped this year's event would serve to inspire people again to educate themselves about issues they see as making up the modern civil rights struggle.

""It's very difficult to stomach the fact that Trayvon wasn't committing any crime. He was on his way home from the store,"" Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, said Friday as she prepared to participate in the march. ""Don't wait until it's at your front door. Don't wait until something happens to your child. ... This is the time to act now. This is the time to get involved.""

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama has weighed in. The pro football commissioner, has too. And now, a Native American tribe hopes recent attention to controversy surrounding the name of Washington’s National Football League team will provide the momentum needed to get it changed.

As NFL executives arrived in the nation’s capital for their annual fall meeting on Monday, the Oneida Indian Nation held a symposium in town to discuss their campaign to find a new name for the Washington Redskins after 80 years.

“We are asking the NFL to stop using a racial slur as the name of Washington’s football team,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter.

The “Change the Mascot” campaign launched last month with a string of radio ads airing in Washington and cities where the Redskins play this season.

The NFL executives were invited to the symposium, but Halbritter said none attended.

In an interview with the Associated Press last week, Obama said if he were the owner of the Redskins and he knew the name was “offending a sizable group of people,” then he would “think about changing it.”

Halbritter began his remarks by thanking the president for weighing in.

“As the first sitting president to speak out against the Washington team name, President Obama’s comments over the weekend were nothing less than historic,” Halbritter said. “Isn’t that the real issue? No matter what the history of something is, if it’s offending people, then it’s time to change it. And this is a great time to do it.”

Obama on the Redskins

A Washington Post poll from June indicated that two-thirds of people who live in the D.C. metropolitan area didn’t want the Redskins to change their name, but more than eight in 10 said it wouldn’t make much of a difference to them if the name were changed.

Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who had previously expressed support for the team mascot, changed his tone on the “The LaVar Arrington Show with Chad Dukes” on 106.7 The Fan in Washington.

“I want all of us to go out and make sure we’re listening to our fans, listening to people of a different view, and making sure that we continue to do what’s right to make sure that team represents the strong tradition and history that it has for so many years,” Goodell said.

The NFL confirmed on Monday that it would meet with Oneida leaders.

But Redskins owner Dan Snyder has steadfastly refused to consider it, telling USA Today last spring that he will “NEVER” change his team’s name, even if they lose an ongoing federal trademark lawsuit that would stop the NFL team from exclusively profiting from the Redskins name.

In addition to the federal trademark lawsuit, a group of U.S. lawmakers drafted a bill last spring to cancel trademark registrations that use the name “Redskins.” Two of them, Democrats Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, and Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota attended Monday’s forum to voice their support.

D.C. council member pushes name change for Washington Redskins

McCollum, who is co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus, said the use of the Redskins name is “exploitation perpetrated for profit by the NFL and Dan Snyder’s football business.”

“Mr. Snyder, change the mascot. End this ugly history and tradition of your team’s racial slur. Pick a new mascot. Pick one that offends no one, hurts no one, dehumanizes no one. It is time to put dignity and respect for native American people ahead of your profits,” McCollum said.

Snyder did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.

But Redskins attorney Lanny Davis said Halbritter is being “selective in his outrage,” citing other teams named after Native Americans who are not targeted in the “Change the Mascot” campaign.

“Why is he not protesting the Atlanta Braves Tomahawk Chop, or President Obama’s hometown Chicago Blackhawks?” Davis said.

While Halbritter said that there are certain Native American names that “can be unifying and respectful,” he maintains that the Redskins name is “a dictionary defined racial epithet,” that shouldn’t be used to “sell a national sports team to America or to the rest of the world.”

Washington Redskins’ owner: ‘We will never change the name of the team’

“Washington’s continued use of the current team name is not just a slur against one group of people, it has demonstrable and serious public policy cultural educational, public health ramifications for our entire country,” Halbritter said.

Critics argue that the Redskins’ name is based on a historically offensive slur and presents negative identity issues for Native Americans, a community already distressed by a slew of public health and social crises including high rates of poverty, diabetes, and suicide.

Dr. Michael Friedman, a clinical psychologist who attended the forum, called Snyder’s refusal to consider calls for a name change “textbook bullying.”

“Experimental study after experimental study shows that if you bring a Native American person into an experimental situation and you show them an image of a Native American mascot, their self-esteem goes down, their faith in their community goes down, their feeling that they can achieve goes down,” Friedman said.

But Davis said Friedman is ignoring other data that shows Native Americans are not insulted by the name.

“I ask him, since there’s no intent to disparage or disrespect - and I certainly respect those, and am sorry for those, who are offended - why is he selecting the Washington Redskins? Does he see the Tomahawk Chop of the Atlanta Braves fans? They’re doing that not out of disrespect. They love the Atlanta Braves.”

Other at the forum, like Norton, said the intent behind keeping the name doesn’t matter.

“I want to say this to Redskins fans. No one blames you for having used a name that was always used as this team. They will only blame you if you continue to use it and if you use it will impunity,” she said.

The NFL Redskins were in Boston before the Washington franchise was born in 1933.

Two conservative students asked me questions -- good, tough questions (and indeed the kind I like getting at these sorts of events) -- and my answers, and our interactions proved grist for the right-wing ""undercover video"" mill, despite how incredibly mild and obviously true my remarks were, to which they took such offense.

One of these was a young woman of color who wanted to know -- given my ""dislike for conservatives and Republicans"" -- what I would say to people of color who were also conservative, such as herself. I explained that I wouldn't say anything different to her than any other conservative. Rather, I asked her, as I would anyone on the right, how she would explain the persistent racial disparities between whites and people of color, if she rejects (as the right does, and as she admitted she did), the notion that racism and discrimination, either past, present, or a combination of the two, were largely to blame.

At no point did she even try and answer my question, because like most conservatives, she cannot; at least not without sounding incredibly racist in the process. Because the only possible answer, if one rejects the discrimination thesis as an explanation for ongoing and glaring disparities in income, wealth, education, and elsewhere between whites and black folks, is inherently racist: namely, that those persons of color must in some way be inferior, either biologically or culturally, relative to whites. I waited with baited breath for her -- a woman of color -- to actually admit that was what she thought. But instead of grappling with the question honestly, she said nothing, beyond her amazing admission that she refuses to accept the simple statement that people of color had ever been disadvantaged in the U.S., or that whites had ever been advantaged, due to racism. In other words, it wasn't just that she insisted America was an equal opportunity society now (say, because of the civil rights revolution), which is at least an understandable and honorable argument, however wrongheaded I might view it to be. Rather, she refused to so much as acknowledge that the history of racism and white supremacy had ever mattered at all. She was the moral equivalent of a Holocaust denier, so fundamentally irrational and uninformed about basic social reality as to call into question how and why a school as good as Providence would have admitted her as a member of its student body. And to think that she was chagrined by affirmative action ostensibly lowering the academic standards of the school on behalf of the other black kids there? Ah, methinks the lady doth protest too much.

But her friend and conservative colleague's question -- actually it was a statement -- was even more interesting. She claimed that I was ""anthropologically reductionist"" (one of those word casseroles that we learn in college and that some sadly deploy just to show how smart they are), for even noticing something like race. She, on the other hand, in the throes of a deeper (and Scriptural) enlightenment merely saw ""people"" when she looked around, not colors, and especially ""people made in the image of God."" Cue the harps and Vienna Boy's Choir.

In response, I told her first that such a sentiment was lovely, but, I thought naive. Mostly because even if we accept the notion that we are all merely individuals made in the image of God, the fact is, our identities as whites or people or color, men or women, straight folks or LGBT, have mattered, and have resulted in advantages for some and disadvantages for others. In other words, we can't treat people as abstractions, removed from their social context and consider that justice. If racism has had consequences -- which of course her black friend refused to admit, so no doubt one can understand her confusion -- then one must deal with that, and attempt to rectify the injustices that have brought us to this point, not merely gloss over them in the name of some colorblind ecumenism, thereby leaving in place all the unearned advantages obtained by some and unearned disadvantages visited upon the rest. She was, in short, guilty of viewing individuals using a dictionary definition of the term, when what we actually experience in this world in the lives we lead, is an encyclopedic version of ourselves, far more complex than either the dictionary, or certainly the Bible might lead us to believe.

But what I also said -- and which apparently created such a firestorm -- was the part where I noted that however nice it was to prattle on about people being made in the image of God, that even there, we have a problem in this culture, given how we have created the image of that God to match whiteness. In other words, we have made God white, and Jesus white, as could be seen on any number of crucifixes (or is it crucifi?) around this Catholic campus, including one that was hanging right behind my head while I spoke: a lily-white, Europeanized savior, devoid of any relationship to what first century Jews would have looked like. Until my questioner was prepared to deal with that, and why we had done that, and what it meant, she really was in no position to lecture me about my anthropological reductionism or anything else.

One would think that any reasonably educated person would realize that the whitening of Jesus was an act of white supremacy, undertaken down through many centuries for the purpose of inculcating western and European domination. Constantine, after all, said that the cross was the sign under which he would conquer, not liberate, the world. My comments are not remotely contestable by rational people. But in the eyes of Providence College conservatives, they were heresy of the highest order.

And so today I discovered that someone in the crowd apparently provided a video of my talk to well-known white nationalist (as in, openly so), and Providence resident, Tim Dionisopoulos, and that he had written about it and uploaded it to the web. Therein, Dionisopoulos took special umbrage at my discussion of the white Jesus issue, as if my comments were the height of craziness. And he made special note of the part where I joked that the school should make Jesus black for a year, just to show that his color ""really doesn't matter"" (which is what white Christians always tell me when I bring up his whitening, as if to suggest I shouldn't make a big deal of it). Apparently, some folks think I was being serious and that my comment (obviously intended to lampoon their own unblinking devotion to his pasty whiteness on their campus crosses) suggested some kind of anti-Catholic bias.

The videographers also found it shocking, just shocking that I would suggest the Catholic Church (and really, Christendom more broadly), had been deeply implicated in the genocidal mistreatment of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas. This revelation comes as no surprise to anyone who has studied the history of native peoples, or the church for that matter; indeed, even the Church no longer denies it, though they rarely deal honestly with its implications. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for instance, has itself noted the history, however bloodlessly as such:

Catholicism's spread to Native people across the United States resembles in many ways the settling of the country itself. From the earliest days French and Spanish missionaries who came to this world newly discovered by Europeans came as extensions of the colonizing powers. The approach was, in many cases, to force the Natives to accept the faith as part of the process of servitude…

The history of the Alta California missions are instructive here. These were settlements established by Spanish colonizers so as to rapidly assimilate native peoples there into both European culture and Catholicism, under the belief of the Church that it had a moral right to evangelize and that the Spanish crown had a legal right to land. The missions operated by forcibly resettling indigenous persons around the mission itself so as ""convert them"" not only from so-called heathens into Catholics, but from savages to civilized peoples, in European terms. Once Indians were Baptized they were disallowed the right to move about the country; rather, they were forced to work at the missions, under the rigid control of the Friars. Indian women, in particular, were housed in such unsanitary conditions at the missions that diseases spread rapidly, resulting in the deaths of thousands. Contemporaries writing at the time noted without compunction that the labor conditions at the missions resembled slavery, and since the native peoples were unpaid for their work -- work that ultimately enriched the Catholic Church and the colonial powers with which the Church was entwined -- such an analogy is obviously warranted.

Elsewhere the Church contributed directly to the cultural and even physical evisceration of indigenous Americans, in ways that any truly educated person in this country would know, were our schools dedicated to the teaching of anything remotely comporting with truth. For a comprehensive accounting of the evil done in the name of God to indigenous peoples, one need only read George Tinker's Missionary Conquest: The Gospel and Native American Cultural Genocide, or David Stannard's meticulously documented, American Holocaust, to see that my comments at Providence, far from indicating a bias against Catholicism, fully dovetail with historical fact, however inconvenient those facts may be for a school that has chosen ""Friars"" as its sports mascot.

That today's campus conservatives think challenging the phony whiteness of Jesus, or noting the history of the church's role in racism makes one a radical is instructive. It speaks to what an utterly sheltered, provincial and fundamentally ignorant world view these persons have been given heretofore, by their parents, high schools, priests and preachers, and by a larger society that has no room for any understanding of America and Christianity that isn't laudatory. Their inability to hear of evil, let alone address it, is rendered all the less likely by such a sheltering, and their ability to engage in even the simplest rational dialogue with others, or even with history, is made almost impossible.

The good news is, the school is pushing forward with its diversity initiative, and nearly everyone in attendance at the talk cringed and groaned openly at the foolishness of their classmates, there on display. So one can only hope that even at a school like Providence, this too shall pass."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – A bitterly divided Supreme Court drove a stake through the heart of the landmark Voting Rights Act Tuesday, striking down a coverage formula that Congress has used to monitor states with a history of discrimination.

Declaring that ""our country has changed in the past 50 years,"" Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's four other conservatives said the 1965 law cannot be enforced unless Congress updates it to account for a half-century of civil rights advances.

The court's 5-4 ruling in the case from Alabama frees states and municipalities with a history of racial discrimination from having to clear changes in voting procedures with the federal government. That restriction has applied to nine states and parts of six others, mostly in the South.

""Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices,"" Roberts said. ""Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,"" he wrote.

The decision came in the second of two major cases involving race to come before the high court this term. In the other, decided Monday, the court reaffirmed that affirmative action is constitutional but instructed lower-court judges to look far more critically at whether universities can prove their use of racial preferences is the only way to achieve a diverse student body.

Tuesday's opinion did not invalidate the Voting Rights Act's ""preclearance"" requirement outright. Instead, Roberts said Congress failed to account for broad changes in the nation's civil rights landscape since it first laid out its method for determining which states and counties would be covered. That failure, Roberts wrote, left the court ""with no choice"" but to invalidate Section 4 of the law, which spells out which states face that additional scrutiny.

President Obama swiftly condemned the decision and called on Congress to work around it.

""For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act – enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress – has helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans,"" Obama said. ""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.""

Attorney General Eric Holder said the decision is ""a serious setback for voting rights."" Other parts of the voting law ""cannot totally fill the void left by today's Supreme Court ruling,"" he said.

The decision leaves Congress an opening to reinstate federal oversight: Lawmakers are free to come up with a new formula ""based on current conditions"" to salvage the federal oversight requirement, Roberts wrote.

But on Capitol Hill, even Democrats who support the Voting Rights Act said passing new legislation was a very long shot at best. Lawmakers are divided and frequently stalemated over issues ranging from taxes to immigration to a routine farm bill.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a back door way to gut the Voting Rights Act,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""As long as Republicans have a majority in the House and Democrats don't have 60 votes in the Senate, there will be no preclearance.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a lengthy dissent tracing the history of recent voting discrimination, said Congress already had more than enough justification for singling out some states and not others.

""Recognizing that large progress has been made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous record, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­pated,"" she wrote. ""In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress' decision.""

The decision met with swift condemnation from civil rights advocates, who accused the court's conservatives of destroying a law that has been responsible for helping to stamp out discrimination at the ballot box.

""The Supreme Court has effectively gutted one of the nation's most important and effective civil rights laws,"" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""Minority voters in places with a record of discrimination are now at greater risk of being disenfranchised than they have been in decades.""

Roberts, joined by justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, said federal election oversight is a deep and unusual intrusion into states' normal ability to manage their own affairs, justified only by pervasive voting discrimination when the law was enacted. He said that Congress had not adequately justified singling out the same states for extra scrutiny.

State officials through the Deep South hailed the decision.

""The Supreme Court today rightly recognized that Alabama and other covered jurisdictions could not be treated unequally based on things that happened decades ago,"" said Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange.

""This is a victory for all voters, as all states can now act equally, without some having to ask for permission or being required to jump through the extraordinary hoops demanded by federal bureaucracy,"" South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's lone African American, wrote in a separate opinion that he was willing to go farther and completely invalidate the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, known as Section 5. The court's narrower decision, he said, ""needlessly prolongs the demise of that provision.""

The Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon Johnson -- with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. standing near -- in the wake of the violence and bloodshed that marked the 1950s and 1960s throughout the South.

It outlawed the types of voting practices that were common in many states, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and set up legal and regulatory processes to overturn them.

The steel spine of the law was Section 5, which required certain states and municipalities to get federal permission before making changes in voting practices. Before it was invalidated on Tuesday, Section 4 of the law laid out which parts of the country would be subject to that requirement.

Under a formula devised to capture those states, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, along with Arizona and Alaska, emerged with what they now consider a scarlet letter. The law was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 with only minor changes.

But the Supreme Court's majority finally lost patience with lawmakers who had refused to update the list of states and municipalities deemed discriminatory, despite wholesale gains in the South by blacks and other minority voters and elected officials.

The ruling tosses the ball back to Congress, which could try to update a coverage formula based on 1972 data. Few observers, however, expect lawmakers to pick and choose among states and municipalities, even if they could overcome political inertia.

The court's conservatives, led by Roberts, had signaled their intentions during oral arguments in February. They expressed disdain for a geographic formula last updated in 1972 that forces most of the Deep South -- but also certain municipalities from Florida to Alaska -- to check even the relocation of polling places with the Department of Justice.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote, likened the states' plight to being ""under the trusteeship of the United States government."" Justice Antonin Scalia drew gasps inside the courtroom when he referred disdainfully to ""racial entitlements.""

And Roberts had long ago signaled his impatience with laws that give minorities a leg up on whites. In a 2007 decision on public school integration, he famously declared: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""

Roberts and the court had punted on the issue four years ago, ruling that a Texas water district — and any municipality, for that matter — could get out from under Section 5 by demonstrating 10 years of good behavior. More than 200 municipalities have done so since the law's inception.

Even then, however, Roberts had warned that ""things have changed in the South"" and the pre-clearance requirements and coverage formula ""raise serious constitutional questions.""

The new case came to the court with two lower court strikes against Shelby County's challenge. In the most recent decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled last year that the coverage formula ""is not perfect, but the fit was hardly perfect in 1965.""

The Obama administration warned the court not to mess with Congress' legislative authority. ""Invidious racial discrimination is the most pernicious form of governmental discrimination prohibited by the Constitution,"" the government's brief said. That puts Congress ""at the zenith of its constitutional authority.""

Civil rights advocates and the court's left-leaning justices noted that the provision was used as recently as last year to beat back photo ID laws, redistricting plans and restrictions on early voting. Without it, they said, states could resume discriminatory practices.

But opponents of the law argued that the types of state and local election laws that continue to draw fire today ""exist to a greater degree outside those covered jurisdictions than they do inside the jurisdictions,"" said Edward Blum, director of the Project on Fair Representation, who helped initiate Shelby County's lawsuit.

Both sides agree that progress has been made: Black voter turnout topped white turnout in last year's presidential election and was strongest in some of the Southern states subjected to the strictest oversight under the Voting Rights Act.

Minorities also have been elected to local offices in record numbers, thanks to the creation of so-called ""majority-minority"" districts. In 1965, the 11 states of the Old Confederacy, stretching from Virginia to Texas, had a total of three black state legislators. By 2009, the number had grown to 321, or 18% of the total, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But over the same period, Southern legislatures that were overwhelmingly Democratic in 1965 have turned Republican. Today, the GOP controls both houses of the legislatures in all 11 states.

In recent years, the number of objections by the Justice Department to states' voting changes has declined dramatically. In 1976, there were 64 objections, including 30 in Texas alone. In recent years, the number dropped to five or less. While there were 10 objections last year, this year has produced only one.

Meanwhile, the number of municipalities that have ""bailed out"" of Section 5 by maintaining a clean record on voting rights for 10 years has risen. From 1998 to 2008, only Virginia municipalities were excused from federal oversight. In the last three years, they were joined by several in California, Texas, Alabama, and the entire state of New Hampshire.

The law's defenders say Section 5 prevented Texas, Florida and South Carolina from enacting new voting restrictions in 2012. This year, they say, it stands as a bulwark against similar discrimination. In Beaumont, Texas, a school board election was canceled to prevent white candidates from running unopposed in three majority-black districts. In North Carolina, lawmakers have proposed new restrictions on voter identification, registration and early voting.

The remainder of the Voting Rights Act wasn't challenged in the case. The law still will provide for legal challenges to voting changes deemed discriminatory in any state. But those after-the-fact challenges can be costly and time-consuming.

http://news.yahoo.com/air-force-calls-number-sex-assaults-appalling-150039203--politics.html,,[],Air Force calls number of sex assaults 'appalling',"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force recorded an ""appalling"" number of reports of sexual assault last year even as it worked to curb misconduct in the wake of a sex scandal at its training headquarters in Texas, the service's top officer told lawmakers on Wednesday.

Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said there were 796 reports of cases ranging from inappropriate touching to rape. The 2012 figure is a nearly 30 percent increase from 2011 when 614 cases were reported. The number could be much greater, Welsh said, because many cases are never reported at all.

""Calling these numbers unacceptable does not do the victims justice,"" Welsh said. ""The truth is, these numbers are appalling!""

Welsh's testimony before the House Armed Services Committee underscores the challenges it and the other military branches face in stopping sexual assault within the ranks. Even more disturbing than the number of reports of sexual assault is the fact that most of these crimes are committed by fellow airmen, Welsh said.

The scandal at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio continues to unfold nearly two years after the first victim came forward. All U.S. airmen report to Lackland for basic training. The base has about 500 military training instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. While one in five recruits are women, most instructors are men.

The preliminary results of Air Force investigation released in November described abuses of power by bad instructors who took advantage of a weak oversight system to prey on young recruits.

The investigation, which is ongoing, has found so far that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. Six instructors have been convicted in court martials on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Another nine instructors are awaiting courts martial. Two more received non-judicial punishments. There are 15 instructors still under investigation.

Story continues

The Air Force has changed the way it selects officers and instructors who train new recruits and created a special unit of lawyers and investigators to assist victims of sexual assault.

Welsh said he has stressed to the Air Force's officer corps and senior enlisted ranks the importance of eliminating sexual misconduct from the ranks. As part of that effort, Welsh issued a ""Letter to Airmen"" earlier this month that said images, songs and stories that are obscene or vulgar are not part of the Air Force heritage.

An Air Force veteran who pressed Congress to hold hearings on the misconduct at Lackland said there is a sexual assault epidemic in the military. Jennifer Norris said she medically retired in 2010 and was sexually assaulted while serving in the Air Force but not at Lackland. She told the committee she frequently has seen well-intentioned reforms fall short.

Fundamental reforms are needed ""to change a military culture and fix the broken military justice system,"" said Norris, who serves as an advocacy board member of the group Protect Our Defenders."

http://news.yahoo.com/sweeping-anti-abortion-bill-goes-kansas-gov-055505494.html,,[],Sweeping anti-abortion bill goes to Kansas gov.,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas legislators gave final passage to a sweeping anti-abortion measure Friday night, sending Gov. Sam Brownback a bill that declares life begins ""at fertilization"" while blocking tax breaks for abortion providers and banning abortions performed solely because of the baby's sex.

The House voted 90-30 for a compromise version of the bill reconciling differences between the two chambers, only hours after the Senate approved it, 28-10. The Republican governor is a strong abortion opponent, and supporters of the measure expect him to sign it into law so that the new restrictions take effect July 1.

In addition to the bans on tax breaks and sex-selection abortions, the bill prohibits abortion providers from being involved in public school sex education classes and spells out in more detail what information doctors must provide to patients seeking abortions.

The measure's language that life begins ""at fertilization"" had some abortion-rights supporters worrying that it could be used to legally harass providers. Abortion opponents call it a statement of principle and not an outright ban on terminating pregnancies.

""The human is a magnificent piece of work at all stages of development, wondrous in every regard, from the microscopic until full development,"" said Sen. Steve Fitzgerald, a Leavenworth Republican who supported the bill.

Abortion opponents argue the full measure lessens the state's entanglement with terminating pregnancies, but abortion-rights advocates say it threatens access to abortion services.

The declaration that life begins at fertilization is embodied in ""personhood"" measures in other states. Such measures are aimed at revising their constitutions to ban all abortions, and none have been enacted, though North Dakota voters will have one on the ballot in 2014.

But Kansas lawmakers aren't trying to change the state constitution, and the measure notes that any rights suggested by the language are limited by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. It declared in its historic Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that women have a right to obtain abortions in some circumstances, and has upheld that decision while allowing increasing restrictions by states.

Story continues

Thirteen states, including Missouri, have such language in their laws, according to the National Right to Life Committee.

Sen. David Haley, a Kansas Democrat who opposed the bill, zeroed in on the statement, saying that supporters of the bill were pursuing a ""Taliban-esque"" course of letting religious views dictate policy limiting women's ability to make decisions about health care and whether they'll have children.

And in the House, Rep. John Wilson, a Lawrence Democrat, complained that the bill was ""about politics, not medicine.""

""It's the very definition of government intrusion in a woman's personal medical decisions,"" he said.

Brownback has signed multiple anti-abortion measures into law, and the number of pregnancies terminated in the state has declined 11 percent since he took office in January 2011.

The governor said he still has to review this year's bill thoroughly but added, ""I am pro-life.""

This year's legislation is less restrictive than a new North Dakota law that bans abortions as early as the sixth week of pregnancy and a new Arkansas law prohibiting most abortions after the 12th week. But many abortion opponents still see it as a significant step.

""There is a clear statement from Kansas with respect to the judgment on the inherent value of human life,"" said Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee Chairwoman Mary Pilcher-Cook, a Shawnee Republican and leading advocate for the measure.

The bill passed despite any solid data on how many sex-selection abortions are performed in Kansas. A 2008 study by two Columbia University economists suggested the practice of aborting female fetuses — widespread in some nations where parents traditionally prefer sons — is done in the U.S. on a limited basis.

But legislators on both sides of the issue said the practice should be banned, however frequent it is.

The bill also would require physicians to give women information that addresses breast cancer as a potential risk of abortion. Advocates on both sides acknowledge there's medical evidence that carrying a fetus to term can lower a woman's risk for breast cancer, but doctors convened by the National Cancer Institute a decade ago concluded that abortion does not raise the risk for developing the disease.

The provisions dealing with tax breaks are designed to prevent the state from subsidizing abortions, even indirectly. For example, health care providers don't have the pay the state sales tax on items they purchase, but the bill would deny that break to abortion providers. Also, a woman could not include abortion costs if she deducts medical expenses on her income taxes.

""Every taxpayer will be able to know with certainty that their money is not being used for abortion,"" Pilcher-Cook said.

But Jordan Goldberg, state advocacy counsel for the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights, called the tax provisions ""appalling and discriminatory.""

""It's probably, if not definitely unconstitutional, and it's incredibly mean-spirited,"" she said.

See the note at the bottom for details.

A gay teacher at a Catholic high school in Glendora was fired after he married his partner and photos of the wedding were published in a local newspaper last month.

Ken Bencomo, 45, of Rancho Cucamonga was fired from his teaching position at St. Lucy’s Priory High School days after he married his partner of 10 years.

He and his partner, Christopher Persky, 32, were among the first couples married at the San Bernardino County Assessor-Recorder’s Office following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed gay couples to marry in California.

Photos of the ceremony were published in the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.

School officials had been aware of his sexual orientation for about 10 of the 17 years Bencomo has been employed by the high school, said Patrick McGarrigle, Bencomo’s attorney.

School officials specifically mentioned the wedding and the publicity it received during a meeting at which Bencomo was informed that he had been fired, McGarrigle said.

Bencomo, through his attorney, declined to comment.

“Ken was one of the school’s star educators and the decision to terminate him because he lawfully married a man is just heartbreaking to him –- it’s crushing,” McGarrigle said. “It shows a terrible error of judgment and complete disregard of Ken and what he has brought to the school.”

On multiple occasions over the years, McGarrigle said, Bencomo has introduced Persky as his partner to administrators at school events.

In a statement released through an attorney, the school said it is “a community of faith for those who wish to express, practice and adhere to values in education based on the Roman Catholic tradition.”

“While the school does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values,” the statement reads. “These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees.”

Bencomo hopes to resolve the situation without legal action, but has not ruled out filing a lawsuit, McGarrigle said.

“The school went to the Draconian measure of firing him without warning and without legal reason,” he said. “The haven’t expressed any interest in finding a way for Ken to return.”

An online petition to reinstate Bencomo’s position at the school garnered nearly 10,000 signatures by Thursday afternoon.

Brittany Littleton, a 2008 graduate of the school who created the petition, said that she was appalled to learn that Bencomo had been fired for something that was common knowledge through her entire time at the school.

“He never made it part of the discussion and he never pushed his personal life on us,” she said. “But we knew, the school knew, teachers knew -– it was never a problem.”

For the record, 9:58 a.m., August 2: A previous version of this post said incorrectly that Bencomo was informed during a meeting with school officials that his contract would not be renewed for the upcoming school year. His contract for the next school year had actually already been approved and he was informed that he had been fired.

Fair Housing Act passed after Martin Luther King%27s assassination

New Jersey case asks what is illegal -- discriminatory intent or impact%3F

But settlement talks could scuttle case before justices rule

WASHINGTON -- Fresh from race-related rulings this summer on voting rights and affirmative action, the Supreme Court now faces another landmark civil rights case that could make it tougher for minorities to prove housing discrimination.

At stake is the Fair Housing Act, a law enacted one week after Martin Luther King's assassination in April 1968 during the race riots that followed. The justices are being asked to weaken the law as interpreted by the Obama administration and lower courts, and civil rights groups weary over this year's battles are gearing up for another.

One potential development could reduce the growing tension between those groups and a court they view as antagonistic: a settlement between the small town of Mount Holly, N.J., and low-income residents of a blighted housing complex that has been targeted for redevelopment for a decade. A similar case in St. Paul, Minn., was settled last year, just two weeks before the Supreme Court was to hear oral arguments.

""We have wanted to settle this case from day one,"" says Olga Pomar of South Jersey Legal Services, which is representing the residents. ""We think that continuing this litigation is not in anyone's interest.""

But as the two sides negotiate, they are plowing ahead with legal briefs and preparing for oral arguments as early as December, less than six months after the justices' landmark decision striking down a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

James Maley, the attorney representing the town, says Mount Holly (pop. 9,536) isn't out to reverse decades of settled housing discrimination law, in much the same way Shelby County, Ala., brought the case that struck down a key section of the Voting Rights Act.

""Discussions will continue right up until there's a decision,"" Maley says of the settlement talks. The town, he says, ""is not focused on making a statement in the world of fair housing.""

WEIGHING INTENT, IMPACT

The town's brief was filed last week, marking the first legal step since the justices agreed in June to hear its appeal of an appellate court ruling. At issue is whether the Fair Housing Act requires blacks and other minorities to prove intentional racial discrimination in sales, rentals, zoning or lending practices, or whether a policy's ""disparate impact"" is enough to make it illegal.

That difference between intent and impact is at the root of many civil rights laws, from education and employment to disability and voting rights. In most cases, showing that minorities are disproportionately affected is enough; that is how lower courts and the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs have enforced the Fair Housing Act.

But opponents -- including developers, bankers, insurers and conservative groups -- have challenged that interpretation, noting that the law does not refer to disparate impact. And the high court's decision to hear the case without a split among federal appeals courts has led civil rights groups to worry that its conservative majority is ready to rule against them.

""It would really cut the legs out of fair housing enforcement,"" says Joseph Rich, director of the fair housing project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Proving intentional racial bias is more difficult, he says, because ""discrimination is pretty subtle these days.""

Andrew Sandler, chairman of BuckleySandler, a law firm representing the financial services industry, says real discrimination still would be punished if the high court did away with disparate impact claims. The problem now, he says, is that bankers don't make loans that could benefit all sorts of borrowers when they risk being accused of favoring whites over minorities.

""Innovation is being stifled because of fear that underwriting criteria based on making it easier to make loans for people could have a disparate impact,"" Sandler says.

A FIGHT NO ONE WANTS?

At the center of the case is a 30-acre neighborhood outside Philadelphia of two-story, attached row houses called The Gardens that is blighted and overrun by crime. In 2000, about 1,600 people lived in the neighborhood, about two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Most household incomes were far below the town's $43,000 median.

Since 2002, Mount Holly officials have sought to demolish the homes and replace them with 520 mostly market-priced apartments and townhomes; 56 would be reserved for Gardens residents.

While about 260 families have moved out, many with relocation assistance from the town, about 70 remain, including about 30 that are parties to the lawsuit. They have charged that any redevelopment of the neighborhood would affect blacks and Hispanics more than whites and is therefore discriminatory.

Not true, the town argues in its recent brief to the court. The Fair Housing Act ""prohibits intentional discrimination alone; it does not require local officials to use race as a criterion in determining how best to allocate limited resources in the context of redeveloping an entire section of a community,"" it says.

But proving intentional discrimination is ""an extremely hard burden for a plaintiff,"" Pomar says."" People don't leave memos that contain obvious smoking guns in this day and age.""

The Obama administration and its civil rights allies aren't eager to fight this battle in a court with a 5-4 conservative majority. The Department of Justice intervened in the last case to get St. Paul officials to drop their appeal and settle with landlords, who had alleged that the city's aggressive enforcement policies reduced the amount of affordable housing for minorities.

Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance, is hopeful this case will end as that one did -- with an out-of-court settlement in which minority residents are compensated. That would be in Mount Holly's interest as well, she says, because litigation ""hurts a community's reputation."""

He Left The Newspaper In']",Federal judge backs same-sex marriages in Utah; state to appeal,"A federal judge on Friday struck down Utah’s same-sex marriage ban, making the state where the powerful Mormon Church has fought gay marriage the latest front in the legal battle over marriage rights.

In a 53-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby held that Utah’s law passed by voters in 2004 violates the federal right of gay and lesbian couples to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

“The state’s current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,” Shelby wrote. “Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional.”

Utah will appeal the ruling to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Ryan Bruckman, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office, said in a telephone call to the Los Angeles Times. He said the state will also seek an emergency stay to prevent any gay marriages from taking place.

Advertisement

Even as he spoke, at least one county clerk in Salt Lake County has begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The state’s attorney general’s office did not have an immediate comment on whether it will seek an appeal in the case.

The Utah ruling comes a day after New Mexico’s Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, by ruling that it is unconstitutional to deny a marriage license to gay and lesbian couples. New Mexico became the 17th state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow same-sex marriages.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, in effect, recognizing same-sex marriages for the purpose of receiving federal benefits. The legislation has led to a flurry of lawsuits to force states to legalize same-sex marriages. Other states, including Hawaii and Illinois, recently legalized gay marriages through legislative action.

In September 2013, a New Jersey judge cited the DOMA ruling in a state case, holding that the state constitution requires the recognition of same-sex marriages.

That ruling effectively brought same-sex marriage to New Jersey after Gov. Chris Christie decided not to appeal. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, challenges in many other states are still pending.

But Utah, the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, holds a special place because of the state’s history opposing gay marriage and the Mormon Church’s strong opposition.

Clifford Rosky, chairman of the board of the advocacy group Equality Utah, and a professor of law at the University of Utah, praised the decision, which he called careful and well-reasoned. “This is one of the decisions that recognizes that every individual has the right to marry the person he or she loves.”

Rosky also said he expects the state to appeal the decision to the 10th Circuit, but given the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, that could cause a problem for the appeals court.

Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) has won a major battle against the politically correct left’s “War on Christmas,” he announced in a press release on Christmas Eve on Tuesday.

Since 1973, U.S. House rules made it an ethics violation for any official congressional communications to contain the phrase “Merry Christmas.” This month, after battling the system for the more than two years since he took office in 2011, Huelskamp was able to get the House to determine it will not consider use of the phrase “Merry Christmas” an ethics violation.

“For decades the PC Police have intimidated Christians throughout America with their attacks on the symbols and language of Christmas,” Huelskamp said in a statement released midday on Christmas Eve. “From nativity scenes to Christmas trees, those opposed to Christmas has sought to eradicate any reason for the season from the public square. And Congress has not been exempted.”

Huelskamp noted the history of the U.S. House’s War on Christmas before detailing how he has won this battle in the war.

“Amazingly since 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives has forbidden the use of ‘Merry Christmas’ and deemed use of such words in any official mailing or e-mail an ethics violation,” Huelskamp said. “Instead, they demanded the use of ‘Happy Holidays.’ This month, the House Franking Commission accepted the position I have fought for since arriving in Congress–ignore the PC Police and let us use ‘Merry Christmas.'”

Huelskamp added that since 2011, he has fought against the politically correct people in the U.S. Congress who implemented and still attempted to enforce this rule. “In 2011 during an interview on Fox News, I stated my refusal to comply with this decades-old policy, which reflects the continual leftist war on Christmas,” Huelskamp said.

I have continued that refusal through today, even as it has cowered many other public officials and private industry alike. The new refusal of the U.S. House to cater to the PC Police moves us one small step away from that carefully crafted secular society devoid of any reference to our religious and cultural heritage. I am glad that finally Members of Congress can express their holiday joy in a manner that they see fit and consistent with our American history–without an ethics threat.

Huelskamp ended his statement with a warm Christmas greeting for his constituents and all Americans: “As I have done for the past two years, I personally wish you and all of America a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”

Merry Christmas, folks.

There was a time when the NAACP was at the forefront of black empowerment.

For far too long the NAACP has failed to advance anyone.

It%27s time for black Americans to reject the NAACP%27s message of entitlement and victimhood.

CORRECTION:A previous version of this column misstated the timing of the decision to hold the 2013 NAACP convention in Orlando. The decision was made in July 2011, not after Trayvon Martin's death in 2012.

After a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, the NAACP pledged that it ""will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed."" The reaction is characteristic of today's NAACP, a group that deals more in political demagoguery than in advancing the causes relevant to African Americans. The group is a shadow of what it once was.

There was a time when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was at the forefront of the fight for equal rights and black empowerment. As a two-term president of the NAACP branch in Garland, Texas, in the 1980s, I led our efforts to help the black community rise.

We believed that every child deserved a quality education that allowed him or her to become a leader in the community. We fought for the society that espoused the same values championed by Martin Luther King Jr., where our children would be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.

Then I watched as progressives staged a coup to take over the Garland NAACP chapter and many others, including the national organization. Their agenda is angry, calling for every black man, woman, and child to be dependent on the government from cradle to grave – wards of the state, addicted to government handouts, living with a perpetual victim complex.

For far too long the NAACP has failed to advance anyone. Too many black youths are functionally illiterate. About 40 percent of blacks don't graduate from high school. Black unemployment is almost as high as it was during the Great Depression. While the NAACP continues to champion the rhetoric of race baiters, it has nothing to show for the donations taken from those struggling to make ends meet in the black community.

The end of my lifetime membership of the NAACP began the minute I dared to speak out. I was ostracized and punished for declaring that my rights come from God, not the government and that I believed the NAACP stood for the ""advancement of colored people,"" not the ""advancement of colored progressives.""

Progressives in the NAACP called me a ""bad soldier"" for the organization. I refuse to fight for agendas that hold my community down in poverty. Black Americans are only 13.5 percent of the total population, but we represent 34 percent of all welfare recipients. The culture of dependency has our abolitionist forefathers rolling in their graves.

The organization's attempted manipulation of Martin's tragic death for its own gain is just the latest example of a once-great organization gone completely off the rails. The case had nothing to do with ""racial profiling,"" but the cynics at the NAACP saw an opportunity to score political points on a buzzword issue and relentlessly pounced.

It's time for black Americans to reject the NAACP's message of entitlement and victimhood. It's time for members of the black community to educate themselves on the values they won't hear from the NAACP pulpit.

I left the NAACP to travel the country preaching the message of freedom and self-empowerment. In the DNA of every true American is a thirst for liberty. Black people can be free. We just have to leave the government plantation.

After all, 73% of Americans still identify as Christian, according to a 2012 Pew Forum Study. So the fact that many churchgoers have changed their views about gay civil rights in recent years is one of the major under-reported reasons why same-sex marriage is now legal in nine states. It is also one of the reasons that the constitutional challenge to Proposition 8, which took away gay Californians’ right to marry, may get a hearing in the Supreme Court this term (an announcement is expected on Monday).

According to the Pew Forum, a majority of mainline Protestants and Roman Catholics now favor legalizing same-sex marriage. So when our more conservative Christian kin claim that gay marriage is against God and against the Bible, we beg to differ. And since Christians are a “people of the Word,” we look to the Bible to justify our thinking. That’s essential to Christianity, although all too often we get it wrong, at least at first.

In various eras, those who claimed to follow Christ used specific Bible passages to argue that the Inquisition was God’s will, the Crusades were a good idea, slavery was legitimate, women should not be allowed to own property or have the right to vote, disabled people must have sinned to deserve their disabilities and God hated Jews.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

Although each of these beliefs was based on the literal words of a particular Bible passage, all of them were in opposition to the message and life of Jesus and the prophets. So when Christians eventually rejected these positions, they returned to the Scriptures, in their original form, to reconsider the text.

This time around, it’s the same process. Most New Testament Greek scholars now point out that there are only three passages that deal with homosexuality in the New Testament — Romans 1:23-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10 — and those passages don’t deal with homosexuality as we define it today but rather with temple prostitution and other abuses. Because of dated (and often loved) translations, many versions of the Bible imply otherwise.

As for the Old Testament, some Christians cite Leviticus 20:13, which commands death for men who lie with men. But most of us acknowledge that if we took all of the Old Testament’s orders literally, at least half of us wouldn’t make it to age 40, because of commands to kill those who commit adultery (Leviticus 20:10), kill rebellious sons who disobey their parents (Deuteronomy 21:18-21), kill anyone who works on the Sabbath (Exodus 31:15) and the like.

Jesus never addressed the subject of homosexuality, other than what can be inferred from his example of loving and accepting everyone, especially the oppressed and those whom the religious establishment considered unclean.

Some Christians will disagree, pointing out that Jesus said marriage was between a man and a woman. What they are referring to is Mark 10:2-12, where Jesus protested the practice of men getting rid of inconvenient wives by simply handing them a certificate of divorce.

In this passage Jesus is objecting to a system that excessively penalized women, often causing financial devastation, loss of children and other unjust consequences. He was not saying anything about same-sex marriage, which didn’t exist at the time.

Jesus never spoke against homosexuality, but he did speak very clearly against divorce. Yet the majority of churches today — including those who view same-sex marriage as a sin — not only accept divorced members but also allow them to be church leaders. Why? Because marriage and divorce were different institutions in the time of Christ, and there are valid reasons for contemporary cultures to allow divorce in certain cases.

If you surmise that in 30 AD two men or two women marrying would have been anathema had it even been under consideration, you’re probably right. But why not make the same cultural allowances for gay couples 2,000 years later that Christian churches have long made for the divorced (as well as women, the disabled, and others who faced discrimination back then)?

Literalism, says LGBT activist and Episcopal priest Susan Russell, leads to using Bible passages as weapons. “Instead of taking the Bible literally,” she says, “we should take it seriously, with deep faithfulness to the Old and New Testaments’ core values of compassion, justice and peace.”

An ever-growing number of Christian clergy and lay people now believe that rejecting gay civil rights because of a literal adherence to certain verses directly contradicts these themes. They point out how these views are hurting all of the church, especially its most vulnerable members: young gay people who are convinced that their very essence is sinful. Furthermore, they can no longer support unjust laws that penalize committed same-sex couples and their families.

As more and more church members thoughtfully and prayerfully confront the evidence, it will only be a matter of time before the majority of Christians of all stripes become allies rather than antagonists for justice and equal rights for gay people. Then we will come out on the right side of history once again.

The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”

Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.

Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.

This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations.

While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse."

http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-ok-nypd-watchdog-overriding-vetoes-062859148.html,,[],"Lawmakers OK NYPD watchdog, overriding vetoes","NEW YORK (AP) — Levele Pointer has gone to rallies and City Hall to push for changes to police stop and frisks, but he readily explains that the stops he's experienced personally didn't always make him angry.

Sometimes, the 46-year-old felt police accosted him just because of where he was or how he looked, he says. But other times, police explained their reasoning in a way that made sense, even if he had done nothing wrong. And he hopes new laws enacted Thursday will foster more understanding like that between officers and citizens.

""Now we have some legislation in place that will allow us to do the things we need to do so we can have community policing,"" said Pointer, who watched as the City Council overrode mayoral vetoes to create a new watchdog for the New York Police Department and make it easier for people to file profiling lawsuits against it.

The measures mark the most aggressive legislative effort in years to put new checks on the New York Police Department, and the vote came less than two weeks after a federal judge imposed new oversight of her own.

""Today marks a monumental civil rights victory for New Yorkers,"" Councilmen Jumaane Williams and Brad Lander, the legislation's sponsors, said in a statement.

The legislation drew national attention from civil rights groups and a vehement response from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who slapped it down earlier this summer. He said Thursday it will make it ""harder for our police officers to protect New Yorkers and continue to drive down crime.""

The measures were propelled by concern about the NYPD's use of the stop and frisk tactic and its extensive surveillance of Muslims, which was revealed in stories by The Associated Press.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin appointed an outside monitor to reform stop and frisk, a practice she said the police department had used in a way that violated the rights of hundreds of thousands of black and Hispanic men. The city is appealing.

Story continues

Supporters say the new laws, coupled with the judge's ruling, will end practices they see as unfair, will mold a more trusted, effective police force and can change how other departments use the policy.

""What happens in New York city has consequences for the nation,"" National Association for the Advancement of Colored People head Benjamin Jealous said at a City Hall rally before the vote.

Opponents said the measures would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.

""These bills are downright dangerous,"" Councilman Eric Ulrich said.

Bloomberg and police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the police force has driven crime down to record lows without racially profiling. They say that between the council measures and the court ruling, police will be tangled up in second-guessing and lawsuits.

""It will have an adverse impact not only on our police officers but more importantly on the people and the neighborhoods they serve, particularly in minority communities,"" Kelly said in a statement.

The inspector general will have subpoena power to examine the NYPD's operations and policies. The other measure gives people more latitude to sue if they feel police targeted them because of their race, sexual orientation or certain other factors. The lawsuits could seek policy changes but not money.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-abortion-roevwade,0,4040194.story",,[],Background on Roe v. Wade,"For more than two decades, the ruling in the Roe vs. Wade case, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, has been a rallying point for millions. Opponents and supporters continue to fight for their cause.



The opinion has turned political novices into activists and has been a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees and political appointees. It has been a cornerstone of campaigns at every level nationwide. It also has led some to commit deadly violence.



Defining moment in history



""Roe vs. Wade was a defining moment in our history. It has touched all of our lives in one way or another,"" said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""It has fundamentally altered the legal, medical and political landscape of this country.""



Today, the ruling remains legally complicated, emotionally explosive and politically divisive. The controversy shows no signs of abating as new issues have surfaced, including proposed bans on late-term abortions and a push for new laws to protect the rights of fetuses.



Even Jane Roe, the Texas woman who sued for a woman's right to have an abortion, has remained in the fray. The woman, Norma McCorvey, is now in her 50s, a grandmother and vehemently anti-abortion -- to the consternation and skepticism of pro-choice organizations. She said she became a Christian in 1995 and regrets her role in the case.



""I signed an affidavit that brought the holocaust of abortion onto this nation,"" said McCorvey, who has written a book about her life and conversion. ""I'm just really grateful I'm in the kingdom of God now, and all is forgiven.""



A deeply divided public



Public opinion on abortion, however, has not changed dramatically during the last 33 years. Since the first polls were done in the wake of the 1973 ruling, Americans have held deeply contradictory views on the issue: Most think abortion should be legal, but most also believe it is murder.



""The public is at once pro-choice and pro-life,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studied polls on the issue. ""Americans want to keep abortion legal and at the same time support restrictions on its use.""



New strategy by protestors



What has changed is the nature of the conflict. Since the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe in 1992, opponents have all but conceded defeat at directly attacking it. As a result, they are seeking to chip away, fighting for bans on late-term abortions, pushing for greater state regulation of abortions and encouraging malpractice lawsuits against abortion providers.



Foes also point to new developments in the law that give fetuses greater protection. In some states, a woman can be prosecuted for harming her fetus by drinking or taking drugs. That same woman, however, could have chosen to abort her fetus legally.



""You cannot have abortion on demand as a fundamental right and at the same time start criminalizing fetal damage caused by drug use or alcohol use,"" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice.



Complicating matters are advances in medical technology, which mean doctors can operate on fetuses in the womb and deliver them earlier.



Blackmun's choice



Justice Harry Blackmun could not have possibly foreseen these issues when he crafted the majority opinion in Roe vs. Wade, which ruled a Texas statute unconstitutional because it prohibited abortion.



Blackmun spent the rest of his tenure on the court defending Roe and a woman's right to an abortion, but his majority decision has been harshly criticized by legal analysts and people on both sides of the abortion issue.



It is thought of by many as a poorly reasoned exercise in judicial overreaching that usurps the legislative branches of government.



""It's an outrageous constitutional ruling,"" constitutional scholar Bruce Fein said. ""The court is supposed to be interpreting the Constitution, not writing a treatise on the evolution of abortion.""



There were two dissents to Roe, each of which foreshadowed the criticism to come. Justice Byron White wrote that the court had no grounds for making such a decision, calling it an ""exercise of raw judicial power."" Justice William Rehnquist, who later became chief justice of the United States, also dissented and would vote to overrule the decision.



Indeed, the Rehnquist Supreme Court, while refusing to overrule Roe, seemed to want to distance itself from the decision. The ruling's reasoning was never mentioned in other opinions, and it never was extended to other areas such as physician-assisted suicide. Even abortion-related opinions, such as one written by Rehnquist in 1989, don't mention the constitutional right that was the basis for Roe.



Roe vs. Wade challenged



The biggest threat to Roe came in 1992 when the court decided Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, a case challenging Pennsylvania restrictions on abortion. Abortion supporters feared the court would use the case to overrule Roe, but the court, in a 5-4 decision, reaffirmed it.



Even so, the court upheld several restrictions, including a 24-hour waiting period. It also adopted a new standard for determining when laws restricting abortion violate the Constitution. The court now asks whether a law would impose an ""undue burden"" on a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus is viable.



Most states have adopted some restrictions on abortion. Thirty-nine states have passed laws that require minors to get the consent of a parent or judge before getting an abortion but the law is not being inforced in at least nine states."

Judge rules that key parts of Utah%27s polygamy laws are unconstitutional

Utah%27s bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states

The Kody Brown and his 4 wives star in the TV reality show %22Sister Wives%22

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A federal judge ruled Friday that key parts of Utah's polygamy laws are unconstitutional, handing a legal victory to a polygamist family that stars in the TV reality show ""Sister Wives.""

U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups said in the ruling that the phrase in Utah law that forbids cohabitation with another person was a violation of the First Amendment.

Washington D.C.-based attorney Jonathan Turley has said that Kody Brown and his four wives drew the attention of Utah authorities because of their TLC hit series. The Brown family filed their lawsuit in July 2011, and fled Utah for Las Vegas last year under the threat of prosecution.

Turley argued the case before Waddoups in January.

Utah's bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states — most of the other states prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. Utah makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together.

The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1kHUIRd ) reports Waddoups took a narrow interpretation of the words ""marry"" and ""purports to marry"" in his ruling. That means that bigamy remains illegal in Utah only in the literal sense, such as when someone fraudulently acquires more than one marriage license.

""The decision affects a far greater range of such relationships than the form of polygamy practiced by the Browns,"" Turley said in a statement Friday. ""It is a victory not for polygamy but privacy in America.""

Utah officials had sought to have the suit thrown out. They first argued that the Browns couldn't challenge the bigamy law because they hadn't been charged. State attorneys later argued for dismissal because a prosecutor had pledged not to prosecute them for bigamy.

But Waddoups wrote in a 2012 ruling that the promise from the Utah County Attorney's Office appeared to be a ploy to avoid the suit.

Kody Brown said in a statement Friday that the family was ""humbled and grateful"" for the ruling.

""While we know that many people do not approve of plural families, it is our family and based on our beliefs,"" he said. ""Just as we respect the personal and religious choices of other families, we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices."""

Pat Quinn.

The 65-46 vote came after a lengthy debate in which backers and foes laid out their cases.

Rep. Dennis Reboletti, R-Elmhurst, cited numerous concerns about public safety. Opponents questioned why fingerprinting isn't part of the legislation. Republican Rep. Randy Ramey of DuPage County said too many issues are left unanswered.

“There are going to be far too many people who will get these cards,” Ramey said. “There’ll be fraud, abuse.”

House Republican leader Tom Cross, however, supported the measure saying Illinois should be a place welcoming to immigrants ""who want to work, who want to be part of our communities. We should work with them, not fight with them.""

The bill, backed by Quinn, who said he would sign it, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, would let an estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants get three-year renewable licenses.

To become eligible for a license, a person would have to live in Illinois for at least a year, a provision that would require applicants to provide a copy of a lease, utility bills and the like. Under current law, people without a Social Security number or proper documentation to be in the country cannot get a driver's license and often have trouble getting car insurance.

The licenses could not be used for other identification purposes, such as for boarding a plane, buying a gun or voting.

Supporters said they expected the vote to be close in the House, where a committee advanced the bill Monday. The Senate already had approved the measure.

During Monday's hearing, opponents questioned why there was no fingerprinting involved with the temporary licenses to ensure that those who apply are not lying about their identity.

""Without these basic public safety and Illinois security safeguards, this bill's unsafe,"" Hanover Park police Chief David Webb said.

""This is a two-prong issue: It's not only about highway safety, but it's also homeland security issues.""

Acevedo said fingerprinting would add ""phenomenal"" cost to the program.

Fred Tsao, policy director with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said fingerprinting might scare off eligible applicants.

The House transportation panel sent the proposal to the full House on a 6-3 vote. That led supporters to chant, ""Si se puede,"" which roughly translates to ""Yes, we can."""

Pat McCrory said it effectively halted capital punishment in the state Democrats say four condemned convicts had their sentences reduced to life under the law

(CNN) —

North Carolina’s governor says he agreed to repeal a law that allowed inmates to challenge their death sentences on racial grounds because it effectively banned capital punishment in the state.

North Carolina legislators barred death sentences “sought or obtained on the basis of race” in 2009, when both houses of the state General Assembly were under Democratic control.

The, legislation, known as the Racial Justice Act, allowed condemned convicts to use statistical analysis to argue that race played a role in their sentencing.

Republicans who took control of the Legislature in 2010 weakened the law last year, overriding a veto by then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat.

Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican elected in 2012, followed legislative action and signed its complete repeal Wednesday.

“Nearly every person on death row, regardless of race, has appealed their death sentence under the Racial Justice Act,” McCrory said in a statement Wednesday. “The state’s district attorneys are nearly unanimous in their bipartisan conclusion that the Racial Justice Act created a judicial loophole to avoid the death penalty and not a path to justice.”

The state still allowed capital punishment even while the Racial Justice Act was on the books. But state Democrats said the law resulted in at least four convicts being taken off death row after judges ruled that their sentences resulted from racial bias, with their sentences commuted to life in prison instead.

About 53% of the 153 convicts awaiting execution in North Carolina are black, according to the state Department of Public Safety, while about 40% are white. African-Americans make up about 22% of the state’s population, according to Census figures.

In a 25-34 vote, the House rejected the domestic partnership legislation, the first time Wyoming lawmakers formally voted on legislation related to marriage equality. The legislation's defeat comes after the House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee passed the domestic partnership bill on Monday, while defeating a measure that would have allowed gay marriage.

""Just a sad day for the Equality State,"" state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer (R-Cheyenne) told The Huffington Post. Zwonitzer has been a leading supporter of gay rights in the legislature, including several efforts to kill gay marriage bans since his election in 2004.

The debate that predeeded Wednesday night's debate was tamer then Monday's committee hearing, where opponents of the gay marriage bill had contended that gay marriage harms moral and public health. State Rep. Mark Baker (R-Rock Springs) again raised the public health argument in the debate on the House floor, claiming that ""only 1 percent of homosexuals die of old age"" and that domestic partnership would cause higher health care costs for the state, according to a tweet by Trevor Brown, the state government reporter for the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.

Brown also tweeted that Baker had said that domestic partnerships were not ""rooted"" in the Wyoming constitution or in the state's tradition.

Supporters of the legislation focused on civil rights and equality issues raised by state Rep. Cathy Connolly (D-Laramie), the bill's sponsor, in Monday's committee meeting. Connolly, the state's only openly gay elected official, could not immediately be reached for comment. Baker tweeted that Connolly was ""stoic"" during the vote.

The domestic partnership measure had been viewed by supporters as having a better chance of passing than the gay marriage bill, but several legislators may have changed their minds at the last minute. Gov. Matt Mead (R) had indicated that he would sign a domestic partnership bill.

The domestic partnership bill had included the ability for heterosexual couples and platonic couples to enter into partnerships. State Sen. Bruce Burns (R-Sheridan), a co-sponsor, told the Corporations Committee on Monday that his aunt has shared a house with another woman for over three decades in a ""platonic relationship"" and the bill would allow them to have domestic partner benefits. He also said it would allow siblings who live together to become domestic partners.

State Rep. Lynn Hutchings (R-Cheyenne), an African American, told the committee that gay marriage was not comparable to the civil rights movement because she said people choose to be gay. She told committee members that her ex-fiance had been gay before dating her. Hutchings also said she opposed the bill due to AIDS."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/supreme-court-holds-big-four-cases-final-frantic-170036331.html,,[],"Supreme Court holds big four cases for final, frantic week of term","To the dismay of court watchers everywhere, the Supreme Court did not hand down decisions in the four biggest pending cases on Thursday, leaving their simultaneous release for the final, frantic week of the court's term.

Opinions that could drastically expand the rights of gays and lesbians in society, sharply curtail the use of race in college admissions and strike down civil rights legislation protecting minorities at the ballot box could all be released at the same time on Monday, unless the court adds more decision days to its schedule for later that week.

Though undoubtedly every case the nine justices decide has important effects on the legal system, each term a handful of controversial cases particularly captures the public's attention. This year, the court decided to wade into the gay marriage debate for the first time in its history, and it also took up two landmark cases involving race. One of the cases, a challenge to the University of Texas' affirmative-action program, was argued in front of the court all the way back in October, and many legal experts are stumped as to why the justices have taken such an unusually long time to release an opinion.

It's common for the court to delay releasing its biggest decisions until the very last day. Last year, the court did just that, releasing its bombshell decision upholding the health care law on June 28. This is often because the controversial cases are the most difficult and require more back-and-forth between the justices' dissents and the main opinion and concurrences.

Two highly anticipated gay marriage cases—Perry v. Hollingsworth and Windsor v. United States—are sure to have attracted just this sort of judicial shuffling.

In the Perry case, the court is expected decide whether California voters discriminated against gay people when they voted ""yes"" to Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, in 2008. In Windsor, the court is weighing whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act—which limits all federal marriage benefits to opposite sex couples—violates the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.

Story continues

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative-leaning swing vote on the court with a history of backing gay rights, is expected to decide the fate of both cases.

But it's possible that the justices could dodge the legal heart of those two cases—whether gays and lesbians have a fundamental right to marriage—and instead rule narrowly on procedural or standing grounds.

David Boies, an attorney representing same-sex couples in California in the Perry case, has said he believes the justices will rule that the proponents of Proposition 8 do not have the legal standing to challenge the lower court's ruling striking down the ban. (In the Proposition 8 case, California's elected officials opted not to appeal the lower court's ruling, and it's unclear if an unelected coalition of Proposition 8 supporters have the legal right to appeal on behalf of California voters.) If the court rules on these narrow grounds, it would make same-sex marriage legal again in California without having any implications for the dozens of states that currently ban same-sex marriage. This would punt the fundamental gay marriage question down the road for the court to decide later.

In the DOMA case, the justices may decide to strike it down based on the federalist argument that states should be allowed to define marriage for themselves. It's also possible that the justices will decide that Congress doesn't have the standing to defend the law, after the Obama administration's Justice Department declined to defend it in court. Either possibility would result in a narrow decision without much legal implications for the gay rights movement's larger argument that same-sex couples should be allowed to wed.

The two cases involving race, Shelby County v. Holder and Fisher v. University of Texas, will also most likely be released on Monday or another decision day next week.

In Shelby, the justices could significantly scale back the federal government's right to supervise states with a history of voting discrimination against minorities. If the justices decide to strike down this key part of the Voting Rights Act—a cornerstone of the civil rights movement that helped dismantle decades of discriminatory voting restrictions—states would have more leeway to pass laws the Obama administration considers to be discriminatory. These include laws that tighten identification requirements and limit early voting hours at the ballot box, which have passed in dozens of states in the past few years.

In Fisher, the court will decide whether universities can use race as a factor in undergraduate admissions. The Supreme Court established in 2003 in Grutter v. Bollinger that universities could use race as a factor in admissions as long as they did not use quotas (for example, that 10 percent of the class must be black). The justices said affirmative action was still necessary to counteract the effects of institutionalized racism that had prevented minorities from attending college in the past. The majority wrote that they believed that in 25 years, affirmative action would no longer be necessary and should be stopped.

It's possible that the justices will use Abigail Fisher's complaint that she was rejected from UT because she is white to step up the timeline set out in the 2003 decision, and reject the college's use of affirmative action as unconstitutional. The college argues that Fisher's grade point average and standardized test scores made her inadmissible regardless of her race, and that using race as one factor in admission helps it maintain a diverse student body.

The justices also have the option of not deciding some of the cases at all, which would mean they would have to be reargued in October. But that's rare. A hectic Monday full of four legal landscape-changing decisions is much more likely."

(CNN) —

In the aftermath of a failed relationship, jilted lovers have been known to lash out by posting sexually explicit photos or videos of their exes online.

Called “revenge porn,” or the less-salacious “cyber revenge,” the trend has been around for years, spawning entire websites that profit off these images. But now, state laws could make this illegal.

Opinion: ‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime

This week, the California Legislature is debating a new bill that would make it a misdemeanor for people to distribute sexually explicit photos or videos they’d shot in order to cause others humiliation or distress. It has already passed the state Senate.

A similar bill was under consideration in Florida this year that would have made the act a felony, but it failed to muster the votes to become law. New Jersey is the only state that already has such a law on the books.

Advocate Holly Jacobs, a graduate student in Florida, began pushing for stronger laws after naked photos and videos of her were posted online that she had shared with an ex-boyfriend while they were together. The images went viral and were re-posted on hundreds of websites, along with identifying details such as her name, e-mail address and employer.

Jacobs suspects her ex was responsible, although she told CNN that he has denied any involvement. She spent years fighting to get the images removed from various websites.

A gray area

The reason it was so difficult is that these acts of vengeance frequently fall into a gray legal area.

In California, very few variations of revenge are already covered under state law. If a subject is under 18, such an act is covered by child pornography laws. It’s already illegal to shoot a video or photograph secretly of someone without permission anywhere there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy – in a bedroom or a store dressing room, for example, but not in a public park or on the street.

However, these laws don’t apply in most “revenge porn” situations, where the injured party gave permission to be photographed or videotaped during happier times.

There are cyberstalking statutes, but they require a pattern of behavior (multiple offenses) and implied threats that make the victim fear for his or her safety. Uploading a single nude photo to embarrass an ex wouldn’t apply.

As a final recourse, the man or woman shown in an explicit video could pursue a civil case against their ex or the sites hosting the images, but those cases can be costly and difficult to win.

The California bill, Senate Bill 255, targets anyone who photographs or records a sexual image with consent and then “subsequently distributes the image taken, with the intent to cause serious emotional distress, and the other person suffers serious emotional distress.”

Under the new law, distributing these types of videos and photos would become a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail or a $1,000 fine for first violation. A second offense could result in a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. The perpetrator would not become a registered sex offender.

“This is a very precisely drafted and narrowly drafted bill,” said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh.

Legal pitfalls

The California bill is so narrow, in fact, that it doesn’t cover one of the more common revenge-porn situations: images originally shared through sexting. The law only applies when someone is the both the person who shoots the original image and the one who distributes it. If someone takes a photo of himself or herself, texts it to a girlfriend or boyfriend, and then the recipient later posts it, that act wouldn’t be considered a crime under this legislation.

Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have also expressed concerns about the bill, arguing such a law could have a negative impact on free speech.

“It’s possible in extremely unusual situations that this kind of speech might have serious value – you can imagine a political context or a video that reveals something criminal,” Volokh said.

There are other potential holes, such as when images are distributed for bragging rights or money instead of revenge.

“It does require intent to cause serious emotional distress,” Volokh said of the bill. “In certain situations, the reason people distribute this material is for money.”

Once an image is online it can spread quickly. The bitter ex could be charged with a crime, but getting websites to take down the image would still be a separate battle. The hope is that making distributing the images a crime will deter people from pursuing this type of revenge in the first place."
http://news.yahoo.com/5-secrets-march-washington-061706458.html,,[],5 Secrets of the March on Washington,"The March on Washington, which took place 50 years ago this month, is bathed in a warm glow for good reason. But the story of that day, beyond Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, is surprising, funny, poignant.

Here are a few secrets—or little-remarked-upon aspects—of the day worth keeping in mind as the 50th-anniversary commemorations approach.

King's Speech Was Improvised—and Edgy.

All schoolkids are taught the ""content of their character"" part of King's address. After the march, when John F. Kennedy welcomed King and other civil-rights leaders to the White House, he said to the reverend: ""I have a dream."" ""That was like Kennedy saying 'You nailed it,'"" says Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer prize-winning King biographer.

King knew he had hit his mark, Branch told National Journal Daily. But while the ""dream"" section of the speech is best-remembered, the first part of King's speech had been an angry lament about the condition of blacks in America, which he likened to a check returned for insufficient funds.

The ""dream"" portion of the speech was semi-improvised. King had used the dream idea before, in speeches earlier in 1963, including one to black insurance agents. King owes a debt to the Bible's Book of Isaiah, from which he borrowed. But much of the speech that day was original. King also left out some of the angrier and clunkier lines from his prepared speech. For example: ""And so today, let us go back to our communities as members of the international association for the advancement of creative dissatisfaction.""

For what it's worth, The New York Times gave King top billing the next day. The Washington Post devoted its front page to other leaders of the march.

D.C. Was Ready for Riots.

The prospect of all of those protesters coming to Washington scared the crap out of the District of Columbia. As Branch has noted, there were not only 4,000 federal troops poised in D.C. and 15,000 paratroopers on standby, but the city's liquor stores were closed for the first time since Prohibition.

Story continues

Most D.C. businesses shut down for the day. Of course, the day turned out to be incredibly peaceful. Newspapers favored the word ""orderly."" And it was, which helped give the civil-rights movement even more moral force. The organizers of the march even offered to help clean up afterwards, but the National Park Service, which controls the monument, turned them down.

A Gay Man Led the Way.

The organizing genius behind the March on Washington was civil-rights veteran Bayard Rustin. What is less-known now, or then, is that he was gay. That might have not been known at all had Rustin not been arrested on what were then called morals charges (he was arrested in 1953 along with two other men in a parked car in Pasadena, Calif.)

King had kept Rustin at a distance under pressure from other black leaders. The late Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of Harlem had forced Rustin off of the board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Roy Wilkins, head of the NAACP, didn't want Rustin running the 1963 march.

But Rustin's mentor, A. Philip Randolph, head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, insisted. It was Randolph's idea to have a March on Washington in 1941 to protest segregation—and it was called off only when President Roosevelt desegregated the defense industry. So when the idea surfaced of a March on Washington in 1963, to demand justice on the 100th anniversary of the end of slavery, Randolph's word counted above all others. And it was Rustin who did much of the speaking that August day.

Sen. Strom Thurmond denounced Rustin as a communist and homosexual in a floor statement, but the press didn't pick it up. Rustin died in 1987 and President Obama will present him, posthumously, with the Medal of Freedom.

Automation and Labor Were a Factor.

It's often forgotten that the March on Washington was a march for freedom and jobs. The unemployment rate that August was 5.4 percent, low by today's standards but higher than it had been earlier in the '60s; then, as now, black unemployment remained much higher than the national index.

Many of the speakers at the March on Washington inveighed against ""automation"" displacing workers—a harbinger of today's outsourcing. But despite the jobs focus, organized labor was divided. Walter Reuther, the head of the United Auto Workers, was one of the official leaders of the march, and he led his own rally in Michigan earlier that summer.

But despite UAW enthusiasm—and Randolph was, of course, also a union leader—the AFL-CIO was AWOL. George Meany, the head of the AFL-CIO, didn't support the march, and the AFL-CIO's offices were shuttered that day. The marchers called for nondiscrimination not only in public facilities like restaurants but also in unions, and many of those represented by the AFL-CIO, especially the building trades, shut out blacks.

Women Had a Separate March.

There was just one official woman speaker at the March on Washington. There were women singers, including Marian Anderson, who had been famously blocked from speaking before the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939 and was invited to speak at the Lincoln Memorial by Eleanor Roosevelt.

But only one woman was invited to speak at the march, and that was Medgar Evers' widow, Myrlie. She wasn't able to come, so another movement organizer,Daisy Lee Bates, spoke 142 words.

There was a separate march on Independence Avenue for women in the movement that included Dorothy Height, the late leader of the Council of Negro Women.

John Lewis Rewrote His Speech.

Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil-rights veteran, will be everywhere during the anniversary, an elder statesman of the movement.

In August 1963, Lewis was head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and one of the leaders of the march scheduled to speak that day. But the night before the rally, other leaders caught a glimpse of his remarks. The first version of his speech incensed many of the other leaders of the march, including UAW's Reuther, who thought it would backfire on the movement by alienating allies and giving enemies a lot to work with.

Lewis, in his original text, said that President Kennedy's civil-rights plan was ""too little, too late"" and it called for the civil- rights workers to march through Dixie ""like Sherman."" Would Lewis's unspoken words have changed the day? Would King's?

We'll never know."

The personal responsibility finger-wagging, delivered most recently Sunday at Morehouse College’s commencement, is getting old.

During the speech, Obama admonished black men to take care of their families and their communities and told the graduates that despite the lingering legacies of slavery and discrimination, “we’ve got no time for excuses.” Obama also used the occasion to talk about his own life, touching on the fact that he was raised by a single mother and that growing up he sometimes blamed some of his bad choices on “the world trying to keep a black man down.”

The half-hour speech in Atlanta drew a rousing response from those who had sat in pouring rain waiting for the president to speak.

Coleman, a former speechwriter for former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, said that although parts of the talk were strong and lofty, including passages honoring Morehouse graduate Martin Luther King Jr., he was disappointed that Obama almost always defaults to the clean-up-your-act message when talking to predominantly black audiences. First lady Michelle Obama issued a similar tongue-lashing last week at Bowie State University’s commencement ceremony. She told graduates at the historically black Maryland school that too many young people are “fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper.”

“The first couple of times, it was okay, but I and a lot of other people are beginning to grow weary of it,” said Coleman, adding that the message was particularly galling at Sunday’s event at the historically black Georgia school. “What made it so gratuitous was this was Morehouse College! In the African American community, the very definition of a Morehouse man is someone who is a leader, who is taught to go out and make a difference in his community.” (The White House declined comment.)

Obama has been making this point — and stirring controversy — since he was a candidate in 2008. Jesse Jackson Sr. was incensed by what he saw as Obama’s “talking down to black people,” yet it was Jackson who was criticized. Many in the black community believed that Obama’s chastisements were necessary to make himself politically palatable to white voters.

The president’s most recent such remarks — there were only a few Sunday, but they were widely reported — triggered a debate on blogs and social media that, in part, asked why Obama continued his lecturing.

Leola Johnson, an associate professor and chair of the Media and Cultural Studies Department at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., said the Obamas’ speeches “are actually not aimed at black people.”

“They’re actually for white people, liberals especially,” she said. Liberal bloggers were brimming with praise for Obama after the Morehouse speech. “It’s the legacy of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and that whole group of white liberals who want to say it’s not just about structural problems that black people aren’t doing well, it’s about their own values.”

Kevin Powell, an activist based in New York who travels the country encouraging black men to take responsibility for their lives, said he has no problem with Obama challenging the black community, but . . .

“You also have to challenge the system, just as you challenge the people. It’s not an either/or,” said Powell, president and founder of BK Nation, an organization focused on education and civic engagement.

The Morehouse speech offered an instance of Obama discussing race, a topic he has been criticized for avoiding given his unique vantage point as the country’s first African American president. Some African Americans have been disappointed at Obama’s frequent refrain that he is president of all Americans when asked why he hasn’t specifically addressed problems that afflict many black communities, including chronic unemployment and failing schools.

On this front, A. Scott Bolden, a Washington lawyer and Morehouse graduate, and Coleman, the former speechwriter and Detroit-based writer, offered finger-wagging lectures of their own.

“It’s interesting that President Obama is always asking black people to take responsibility for themselves,” Bolden said. “It would be really nice if he’d take responsibility for black people in his second term.”

Coleman says he’ll find the president’s next commencement speech, scheduled for Friday at the U.S. Naval Academy, particularly instructive. “That will be interesting given the reports of sex harassment in the military,” Coleman said. “Is he going to chide those cadets about addressing the social pathologies in that population?”"

They apparently felt that her phone call to her mother was taking too long.

“[Police officer Ricky Grissom ] said, ‘I’ve been waiting here all this time when I could have been out patrolling, waiting on you. This is stupid,’” Diggles recalled. “He just went to cussing. And then I was like, ‘Well, you don’t have to yell at me.’”

Grissom then pushed Ms. Diggles into a wall, before the other officer, Ryan Cunningham, arrived on the scene. He grabbed her hair, at which point she had her head slammed into a counter top at the police station. Next, the two officers violently took her to the floor where she was handcuffed. They then tore off her shoes and dragged her by her feet and ankles to a nearby holding cell. Their actions resulted in a broken tooth and other injuries. Naturally she was charged with resisting arrest. Here's the police station's surveillance video recording of the incident (no audio available):

At least these two lawless ""law enforcement officers"" (and I use that term loosely) were fired for their physically abusive actions and the charges of resisting arrest against Ms. Diggles were dropped. Jasper, Texas, by the way, is the same community where James Byrd was infamously murdered by several white men in a most gruesome manner: he was tied to the back of their pick-up truck and dragged down local streets until he died from his injuries. Jasper certainly sounds like a terrible place to live if you are not white:

Jasper's interim city manager confirmed the terminations [of the two white officers], but referred questions about the Diggles case to the interim police chief, who was unreachable Monday afternoon. “The more things change, the more they remain the same,” Jasper City Council Member Alton Scott said of the city's racial troubles. Scott obtained the video in the Diggles’ incident and turned it over to a local TV station after he heard that her written complaint against the officers was apparently being ignored. “There’s nothing she said that could have justified what they did,” Scott said. “They are supposed to be trained professionals. They are supposed to be above that. It was inexcusable.” After terminating the officers on Monday [June 3rd], the council requested that the pair be investigated for possible criminal charges. Bernsen said he hopes that probe is done by the FBI or state police.

My guess is that nothing more will come of this other than a civil settlement between the town and Ms. Diggles, and that these now former police officers will find employment in the law enforcement field elsewhere, but I could be wrong. Maybe they actually will be prosecuted and convicted of criminal assault and/or a hate crime. However I won't hold my breath awaiting that outcome."

(AP) — Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson isn't backing down from comments he made comparing Florida's struggle with the Trayvon Martin case to the civil rights clashes with police during the 1960s in Selma, Ala.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday demanded that Jackson apologize for his comments calling the state the ""Selma of our time."" He also said Florida has been an ""apartheid"" state.

But Jackson, in an interview with The Associated Press, defended his remarks. He cited the state's voter laws and incarceration rates of blacks versus the general population as examples of ""apartheid like conditions.""

Jackson made his original remarks while taking part in a protest at the Florida Capitol. He joined a group upset that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of Martin.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday demanded an apology from longtime civil rights activist Jesse Jackson for comparing the state's struggle with the Trayvon Martin case to the civil rights clashes with police during the 1960s in Selma, Ala.

Jackson spent the night with protesters upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin. They've refused to leave the Capitol until Scott calls a special session to have legislators overhaul the state's self-defense laws.

Jackson called Florida the ""Selma of our time"" and even compared Scott to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace. While he was governor, Wallace famously stood in the door at the University of Alabama to try to block the entry of two black students.

Scott so far has refused the request and the protest has dragged on for more than two weeks. The protesters have gotten national media attention and won support from celebrities such as entertainer Harry Belafonte and others who have urged people to boycott Florida.

Scott in a release blasted Jackson's comments as ""reckless"" and ""divisive"" and said that he should apologize to residents.

Story continues

""It is unfortunate that he would come to Florida to insult Floridians and divide our state at a time when we are striving for unity and healing,"" Scott said.

But Bishop Tavis Grant, national field director for the Rainbow PUSH coalition started by Jackson, said there was no need for an apology.

""The governor has a deafening ear to the cries of those asking him to take a moral stand, not a political stand,"" Grant said.

Jackson left Tallahassee earlier Wednesday and wasn't immediately made available to comment.

Grant, though, said Jackson made his comments not only in response to the Zimmerman verdict but because of the case of Marissa Alexander.

Alexander, who is from Jacksonville, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a bullet at a wall to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. A judge refused to let her use a ""stand your ground"" defense.

Grant said that thousands of Floridians support Jackson and agree that the state's ""stand your ground"" law is egregious.

But that view isn't shared by Scott or other Republican leaders in the Florida Legislature. Senate President Don Gaetz earlier this week that while he understands that some people are ""frustrated"" with the verdict that doesn't mean the law should be changed.

""In our system, a verdict is not then referred to a referendum of the people who are interested in the issue or who are passionate about the issue,"" Gaetz said. ""A verdict is a verdict.""

The protesters, many of whom belong to a group called the Dream Defenders, want the special session to consider changing state laws to repeal Florida's ""stand your ground"" law and to end racial profiling and zero-tolerance policies in public schools.

Protesters this week started their own mock session in the Old Capitol. They also are trying to urge 32 legislators to ask for a special session. Under Florida law, if 32 legislators make that demand, then the Department of State must poll the Legislature. If three-fifths of lawmakers agree, then a special session must be called.

http://news.yahoo.com/australian-pm-apologizes-forced-adoptions-005244507.html,,[],Australian PM apologizes for forced adoptions,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a historic national apology in Parliament to the thousands of unwed mothers who were forced by government policies to give up their babies for adoption over several decades.

More than 800 people affected by the policy cried and cheered as they listened to the apology in the Great Hall of Parliament House and responded with a standing ovation when it was finished.

A national apology was recommended a year ago by a Senate committee that investigated the impacts of the now-discredited policies. Unwed mothers were pressured, deceived and threatened into giving up their babies from World War II until the early 1970s so they could be adopted by married couples, which was perceived to be in the children's best interests, the committee report found.

""Today this Parliament on behalf of the Australian people takes responsibility and apologizes for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering,"" Gillard told the audience Thursday.

""We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers and we recognize the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members,"" she said.

""We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children,"" she added.

Gillard committed 5 million Australian dollars ($5 million) to support services for affected families and to help biological families reunite.

The seven-member Senate committee began investigating the federal government's role in forced adoption in 2010 after the Western Australian state parliament apologized to mothers and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s until the 1980s.

Western Australia was the first of five state and territory governments to apologize for forced adoption. Australia has eight such governments.

Story continues

Roman Catholic hospitals in Australia apologized in 2011 for forcing unmarried mothers to give up babies for adoption and urged state governments to accept financial responsibility.

Catholic Health Australia, the largest nongovernment hospital operator in Australia and which provides 10 percent of the nation's hospital beds, said the practice of adopting out such children to married couples was ""regrettably common"" from the 1950s to the 1970s.

Adoption in Australia is mostly controlled by state laws, but the report found that the federal government had contributed to forced adoption by failing to provide unwed mothers with full welfare benefits to which a widow or deserted wife would have been entitled until 1973.

Australian adoptions peaked at almost 10,000 a year in 1972, before rapidly declining. The report found that decline could reflect the availability of welfare, the use of oral contraceptives and the legalization of abortion.

Among unwed mothers, adoption rates were as high as 60 percent in the late 1960s, the report said.

The committee could not estimate how many adoptions were forced but said they numbered in the thousands.

After Gillard spoke, opposition leader Tony Abbot also spoke in a gesture of bipartisan support for the apology.

He was heckled by some who saw his choice of words as insensitive.

Angela Barra, 45, who was adopted as a newborn said her biological mother Pamela O'Brien had been upset by Abbott's use of the term ""birth mother"" instead of plain ""mother."" She also said he shouldn't have mentioned adoptive parents to such an audience or speak of people's right to put their children up for adoption.

""A lot of upset mothers in there lost their children because of demand for babies,"" Barra said outside the hall.

""People were forced to give their babies up; they were drugged, they were shackled to their beds ... they didn't relinquish their babies; their babies were taken,"" she added.

Christine Harms, who gave birth at age 15 to a disabled son who died 13 years later in state care, said criticisms of Abbott had been too harsh.

""I think some of the people are a bit hard on that poor man,"" the 60-year-old said. ""We can't all say the right, exact words."""

Ted Cruz (R-TX) for his all-night non-filibuster, and how he read from Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and seemed to miss the entire point of the story.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in an effort to speak for 26 million Texans, and for 300 million Americans. ... And as Americans, we value liberty and opportunity above all else. ... What the American people are interested in is what we've always been interested in.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... what we've always been interested in. Which is freedom.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You go to the 1940s. Nazi Germany.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, accept the Nazis. Yes, they'll dominate the continent of Europe. But that's not our problem. Let's appease them. ... And in America, there were voices that listened to that. I suspect those same pundits who say it can't be done, if it had been in the 1940s, we would've been listening to them.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in opposition...

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... in opposition to Obamacare.

OK, OK, possibly a very troubled bureaucratic system. Can we focus on the Nazi zombies for a second?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.

So you'd be unable to stand. ""Until the Nazis steal my knees.""

Yes, that's Ted Cruz, the Senator who, starting yesterday at 2:41 Eastern Wasting Time, took to the Senate floor for 21 hours, not to filibuster, not to delay, but to cast himself as Churchill to Obama's Chamberlain in the great fight against... Hitler's... health care exchanges. I lost the thread of the metaphor. But my point is this.

(audience laughter)

Yeah, it takes a while to sink in. It takes a while to sink in.

Senator Cruz clearly believes our very freedom is at stake here. And Senator Cruz — as a brilliant Harvard educated lawyer and Princeton debate champion — I imagine that he is prepared to make a stunning and sophisticated argument as to why Obamacare places this very nation in such peril.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Some time ago, I tweeted a speech that Ashton Kutcher gave. That's a terrific speech.

You're fucking with us, right?

""I tweeted a speech by Ashton Kutcher. It was so good, I only needed 140 characters of it.""

Wow, how would something like that look in the Senator's original analogy?

Ted Cruz, Senator! You are one of the great minds of our times — says you — who says we are facing one of the great perils of our age. And yet you've outsourced your argument and wisdom to a dude who cannot find his car? Perhaps there was even more eloquent and soaring speech-making to come.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I want to point out just a few words of wisdom from Duck Dynasty. ... There was a movie, Jason vs. Freddy, I forget, they fought each other, I forget what even happened in that movie. ... Eight White Castle restaurants a year, I like their little burgers. ... It's a little bit like the World Wrestling Federation. ... In my mind, I heard the music from The Shining, er, not The Shining, from Psycho. ... Just like in Star Wars movies ... (in bad Darth Vader voice) Mike Lee, I am your father.

(whispers to Cruz) You're losing them.

Come on, Senator Cruz, this isn't even a filibuster! You had 20 hours to make your case. You're double Ivy League! Surely you can do better, maybe cite a study or a book.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" ... ""I do not like them, Sam I am, I do not like green eggs and ham"".

So to express your opposition to Obamacare, you go with a book about a stubborn jerk who decides he hates something before he's tried it. (wild audience cheering and applause) And when he finally does get a taste, he has to admit after tasting it, ""This is pretty fucking good"".

Senator Cruz, you're trying to save America! Get to the dire foundational issue at hand.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You like your doctor? Do you want to keep seeing your doctor? Well, I'll tell ya, Americans all over this country are losing their health care because of Obamacare. They're losing their ability to see their doctors. That's what happens if the Senate doesn't act to defund Obamacare.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): One half of small businesses say that they will either cut hours to reduce full-time employees, or full-time employees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. ... Obamacare is estimated to have increased individual health insurance premiums by anywhere from 64% to 146%.

(audience laughter)

Take that down, that's really disturbing. (picture of Cruz reappears) Not much better.

Do you have a more foundational critique?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country. ... Small businesses have been hammered under Obamacare unlike ever before. ... It's shattering the economy, all across the country in all 50 states.

But... I can think of another thing that came out of Washington recently that is hurting economic growth right now. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the spending cuts from the sequester are costing the country three-quarters of a million jobs this year alone. How did you feel about those cuts?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (3/16/2013): We stood our ground and finally got at least the first small step — and I underscore it is a small step — to reigning in our uncontrollable spending and debt.

So your problem with the sequester is that it didn't cost us enough jobs. For all its flaws, Obamacare appears to at least be attempting to fix some fundamental holes in our health care system, like insurance companies being able to deny based on pre-existing conditions. So if you're going to repeal it, you'd better have some idea of your own on how to do that. Pre-existing conditions, how would you do that?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): My view on pre-existing conditions is we ought to reform the market to deal with that problem.

So you got nothing. You know what, Ted Cruz? The level of threat you say we face from Obamacare isn't met by the quality of solutions and the rhetoric that you offer.

You know, reminds me of a character I once read about, by I believe one of your favorite authors, Dr. Seuss and his beloved children's book, ""The Bore-ax"". (audience laughter)

Join me now as I read one of my favorite sections. (wild audience cheering as Jon takes out the book)



In the land of D.C., in the Senate of Snooze,

Lived the showboatiest Blab whose name was Ted Cruz. Ted talked about health care, compared it to Nazis.

As comparisons so, he was off by a lotsy. Health care, he said, would end this great nation.

A point made after hours of mouth masturbation. Repeal it, defund it, erase it, deny it,

Murder it, skullfuck it, bread and deep fry it!

Cruz claimed freedom and liberty, but it was all a big show.

Because he could have spent all that time making sure the law didn't blow."

Davis gained nationwide notoriety after she filibustered for 12 hours in an attempt to block the passage of an omnibus anti-abortion bill known as SB5, which was eventually signed into law by Governor Rick Perry on July 18.

Her celebratory profile in Vogue has real significance. Not because the writer reveals that Davis’ filibustering outfit consisted of pink Mizuno running shoes and a sky-blue Escada day coat. Not because the caption for the article’s featured picture reads Wendy Davis in a Carolina Herrera dress and Reed Krakoff pumps. Not because the opening paragraph of the piece references the Super Bowl, HBO’s Girls, and 7 for All Mankind jeans as elements of her life.

Actually, these mentions are precisely why the profile is significant. Each one a different brush stroke creating a portrait of the left’s latest heroine fighting for all women in the face of a fabricated war, in which the villains are simply those who simply do not support federally subsidized contraception or unrestricted abortion on demand. And what better venue in which to view the portrait than the iconic pop culture platform that is Vogue.

The left understand and embraces a very simple concept: culture is upstream from politics. It is a message delivery system that reaches millions and millions of registered voters and those who soon will be. The message can be overtly ideological but what’s often more effective is the celebration of an ideology through other means…simply by presenting the owner of that ideology in a way that is accessible:

A crowd of thousands has assembled for the Fourth of July parade in Arlington. Davis waves to them from the back of a teal-blue vintage Thunderbird draped with bunting. She’s comfortable in the high-80s heat (she goes running in it most mornings), wearing an American-flag scarf from Urban Outfitters, a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts, and red Toms slip-ons. “Thank you!” can be heard. Also: “Our state loves you!” Occasionally a hiss or a boo filters in, but mostly there are cries of “We love you, Wendy” and “Wendy for governor!”

So as the millions of Vogue readers (87% of which are female) turn its pages in search of unattainable freakish beauty, they will be treated to a profile of Wendy Davis and whether they know it or not, the notion of a war on them is reinforced. And what’s more, the villain becomes clear simply because the hero has been hoisted…in a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts and red Toms slip-ons.

[twitter-follow screen_name='JRavitzCNN']

(CNN) - Of course Tevi Troy has heard the hubbub.

He knows full well that his onetime boss, former President George W. Bush, plans to speak Thursday at a Dallas fundraiser for the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute – a group dedicated to converting Jews to Christianity.



“I have yet to meet a Jewish person who hasn’t heard about this,” says Troy, who served as a Bush administration liaison to the Jewish community and was a former deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The topic of conversion can prompt a visceral reaction for Jews whose darker times have been marred by persecution, expulsion and forced conversions. Millions have died for and because of their faith.

“There’s good historical reason for the Jewish discomfort,” Troy says.

But before Troy, an Orthodox Jew, will tread into this controversy, he wants to discuss the Jewish value of hakarat hatov, or “recognizing the good.”

He says people should remember and appreciate that Bush was “a very good president to the Jewish people.”

He was a friend to Israel during the Second Intifada, Troy says. He was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism. And in the wake of the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2002, when Jews felt like targets, Troy says Bush took on terrorism.

That said, when it comes to Bush’s decision to speak at the annual banquet for this messianic group, one that believes Jews like this former aide need to be saved, Troy admits, “I would be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed.”

CNN tried to speak with five other former Bush administration liaisons to the Jewish community, but only two of those responded. Both suggested Troy could speak for them, too.

His words, though, are tempered. Others, such as Rabbi David Wolpe, who was dubbed America’s most influential rabbi by Newsweek in 2012, called Bush’s decision “infuriating.”

The Messianic Jewish Bible Institute is representative of a longstanding effort to convert Jews, one that dates back to Paul in the New Testament who said, in Romans 1:16, that the Gospel should be taken “to the Jew first.”

The institute's website features a menorah in its logo. Its chairman is listed as Rabbi Jonathan Bernis, a man who heads up another organization called Jewish Voice Ministries International, where an “Ask the Rabbi” feature includes an image of him wearing a yarmulke and Jewish prayer shawl.

CNN reached out to Bernis at Jewish Voice Ministries but was told by a spokeswoman that he was not allowed to comment on the upcoming fundraiser.

Then CNN asked where he had been ordained as a rabbi, and the spokeswoman hung up the phone.

We also called the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, which pulled down from its website any references to Bush’s upcoming appearance soon after Mother Jones broke the story. An institute spokeswoman said there would be no comment.

A source close to Bush, who didn't want to be named, confirmed to CNN on Wednesday afternoon that the former president still plans to speak at Thursday’s banquet, where tickets reportedly range in price from $100 to $100,000.

The source also said that Bush addresses all sorts of groups, secular and religious of varying stripes. Bush tells stories from the White House and speaks about his love for America, which includes a commitment to religious freedom and tolerance, according to the source.

Had Bush’s onetime liaison to the Jewish community still been working with the former president or been asked, Troy said he certainly would have advised against such an appearance.

Troy says the problem is most people don’t understand why talk of converting Jews stirs up such strong feelings in the Jewish community.

“It dates back to a time when forced conversion was a serious issue, when the church was imbued with the power of state,” he says.

Troy points to the Spanish Inquisition as an example, explaining how under duress and torture, Jews had to convert to Christianity or face expulsion from Spain in 1492. Those who stayed and exhibited any shred of Jewish observance were persecuted.

The Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, founded in the mid-1990s, includes in its mission the goal to ""educate Christians in their role to provoke the Jewish people to jealousy and thus save some of them.""

The institute's statement of faith also says that those who are born Jewish and ""place their faith in Messiah Yeshua,"" Jesus, ""have not disowned or separated themselves from their race and Judaic heritage, but remain sons and daughters of Israel.""

Missionary outreach to Jews in America isn't new. It dates back to the 19th century. A Hungarian man who called himself a ""rabbi"" established a ministry in 1894 to target Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, offering them assistance, education and New Testaments translated into Yiddish.

On the opposite coast in San Francisco in 1973, a Baptist minister - who was born Jewish - founded a proselytizing organization called Jews for Jesus. His small army has been knocking on doors and pounding the pavement ever since.

A less aggressive approach, preferred by others who might call themselves Messianic Jews or Hebrew Christians, has been the establishment of Messianic “synagogues” and organizations. They’re sponsored by Christians, and they incorporate Jewish symbols and modified Jewish rituals. They’re often led by leaders who call themselves rabbis, use Hebrew phrases and wear traditional Jewish accessories.

Critics cry false advertising, subterfuge and bemoan how such outfits, including the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, which built its base in the former Soviet Union, often target Jews who don’t know better – what Rob Eshman of the Jewish Journal in Los Angeles called, “the low-hanging fruit of Jewish identity.”

While Messianic Jews believe it’s possible to be Jewish while believing Jesus is the Messiah, others say this makes as much sense as a vegetarian who believes in scarfing down steak.

The historical concern may have been rooted in forced conversions, but Troy knows that's not an issue today.

In fact, the group Bush will address - and others like it - don’t really worry him. He’s more concerned about a recent Pew study that showed how a growing number of American Jews don’t identify with any faith, let alone their own.

About a third of American Jews born after 2000 answered “none” when asked about their religious affiliation, the survey showed. Of everyone surveyed who was raised Jewish, according to the researchers, 6% now describe themselves as Christian - mostly as Catholics, Protestants or ""just Christian.""

Messianic Jews, Pew said, constitute a very small group. Meantime, though, the Pew survey also showed that 34% of those asked believe a person can be Jewish and believe Jesus was the messiah.

But the fundraiser in Dallas, even if it features the likes of a former U.S. president, isn’t what’s hurting American Jews, Troy says.

""Judaism,"" he says, ""has other and bigger problems."""

Carter']","NSA chief addresses report agency taps into Google, Yahoo data links","Story highlights Gen. Keith Alexander says the NSA doesn't break into Google, Yahoo databases But The Washington Post reports that the NSA accesses data as it moves between centers Alexander didn't appear to address that specific claim The NSA later denies using the technique to ""collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data""

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency doesn’t have access to servers run by Internet giants Google and Yahoo, its chief said in a pushback to a Washington Post report that the U.S. spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text, video and audio records every day.

But Gen. Keith Alexander’s comments at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday don’t appear to address the substance of the newspaper’s allegations – that the NSA has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by U.S. law and court oversight.

Asked about the report by a Bloomberg Television reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference, Alexander denied breaking into servers or databases run by Internet companies.

“Not to my knowledge,” he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases.

“It would be illegal for us to do that. So, I don’t know what the report is,” Alexander said. “But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.”

However, the allegations published by The Post – based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden – aren’t that the NSA has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies.

Instead, the newspaper – citing the Snowden documents and unnamed “knowledgeable officials” – reported that the NSA gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world.

According to The Post, the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters found a way to exploit a weakness in Internet architecture to copy data as it moves from the public Internet into data centers maintained by the companies.

The agency then uses custom-built software to decode the companies’ internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect, the newspaper reported.

The material collected under the program – code-named MUSCULAR – includes e-mail addressing information, as well as “content such as text, audio and video,” according to The Post.

The agency’s Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top-secret January 9, 2013, accounting on which The Post’s report is based, according to the newspaper.

In a statement, the NSA said “the assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons’ data from this type of collection is also not true.”

“NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons,” the agency said.

It’s unclear how much of the material collected involves what the NSA calls “U.S. persons,” a category that includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the United States.

But unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court, surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards, The Post reported.

The report raised concerns from Google and Yahoo, with the Internet behemoths saying they never gave the NSA permission to access communication links to their servers.

“We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency,” said Yahoo spokeswoman Sarah Meron.

Google has “long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links,” said David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer.

“We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.”

The newspaper report emerged a day after Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, testified before a House committee reviewing the agency’s surveillance activities.

The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, came after a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

Obama has brought in a lot of women, including two he appointed to the Supreme Court, but it is more than an “optics” problem, to use the irritating cliché of the moment. Word from the White House is that the president himself is irritated, and demanding answers about the faces his staff is pushing forward. Unfortunately, he has only a bunch of white guys to offer an explanation of why the picture looks like a bunch of white guys.

Right from the start, the president who pledged “Change We Can Believe In” has been so cautious about change that there have been periodic eruptions from women and minorities.

Maybe Obama thinks he’s such a huge change for the nation to digest that everything else must look like the Eisenhower administration, with Michelle obligingly playing Laura Petrie. But it’s Barry tripping over the ottoman.

In more “He’s Like Ike” moments, the president spends his free time golfing with white male junior aides. The mood got sour early in the first term when senior female aides had a dinner to gripe directly to Obama about lack of access and getting elbowed out of big policy debates.

Some women around Obama who say that he never empowers women to take charge of anything are privately gratified at the latest kerfuffle, hoping it will shut down the West Wing man cave. It’s particularly galling because the president won re-election — and a record number of women ascended to Congress — on the strength of high-toned denunciations of the oldfangled Mitt Romney and the Republican kamikaze raid on women.

“We don’t have to order up some binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women” to excel in all fields, the president said on the trail, vowing to unfurl the future for “our daughters.”"

In September, the Fair Share Housing Center, an advocacy group, sued the state, alleging that it was withholding public information that would show whether low-income and minority citizens were being discriminated against.

The center now says it has evidence showing that black and Hispanic citizens who seek assistance are being turned away in disproportionate numbers. Its data show that 38.1 percent of African-Americans and 20.4 percent of Hispanics who applied for resettlement grants were rejected, against only 14.5 percent of whites. The group says that it found a similar outcome among people who applied for reconstruction or rehabilitation grants: 35.1 percent of African-Americans and 18.1 percent of Latinos were rejected, compared with 13.6 percent of whites.

The center says that its data show low application rates by minority citizens, which might suggest problems with either the state’s outreach efforts or with the application process itself. Gov. Chris Christie has dismissed the center as a “hack group” that deserves no response. His Department of Community Affairs, which oversees the housing recovery effort, says the charge of discrimination is “outrageously false.”

The numbers by themselves do not prove discrimination. But the Christie administration has a poor record when it comes to supporting housing for the poor. Mr. Christie has tried to undermine the state’s affordable housing laws since he took office and would have dismantled the independent agency that promotes affordable housing had the New Jersey Supreme Court not barred him from doing so earlier this year."

Police officers guard the entrance to Franklin street during an active crime scene search for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, Friday, April 19, 2013, in Watertown, Mass. (AP)

A former U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor says the federal government made a mistake in not immediately reading captured Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev his Miranda rights and instead invoking a public safety exception.

Justice Department officials confirmed to multiple news outlets Friday night that Tsarnaev did not receive a Miranda warning and instead will be questioned by a special interrogation team in the hope that he could give up more information, such as whether he and his brother acted alone or if they received training or direction from anyone abroad.

But Aitan Goelman, who served as a Justice Department attorney for nine years and prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombing case, said Saturday that he thinks the government is taking a risk in invoking the exception that says police do not need to give Tsarnaev the well-known warning and can still introduce any statements he makes in court -- because it might not hold up.

""The government is taking a chance in interviewing the suspect without reading his Miranda rights,"" Goelman said on Fox News.

The public safety exception originated in a 1980 New York case where a police officer was arresting an individual matching a suspect description from a woman who said she had just been raped. When the officer frisked the man, he found he was wearing an empty shoulder holster, and after handcuffing him, asked where the gun was. The man gestured and said, ""The gun is over there,"" at which point the officer discovered a loaded handgun. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the immediate need to protect the police or public from danger permitted the officer to question the man right away -- and made his pre-Mirandized statements admissible in court.

""In that case the danger to the public was immediate,"" Goelman said on Fox News. ""Here I think we're talking about potentially interviewing this guy when he wakes up in a hospital after the police have been satisfied that the immediate danger is gone. I think it's a risk...there is a chance that any statement he makes after giving an un-Mirandized statement might be suppressed [in court].""

Story continues

Goelman noted that suppressing any statements from Tsarnaev -- who became a naturalized U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012 -- might not be completely detrimental to the case because the government appears to have a lot of other evidence against him already.

The public safety exception is not permanent, and is meant to run out once the questions are no longer about stopping an immediate danger to the public. Additionally, it's still unclear when Tsarnaev will be questioned -- he is said to be hospitalized in serious condition following injuries sustained in a shootout with police Thursday night, and possibly during his capture on Friday.

""There is a public safety exception in cases of national security and potential charges involving acts of terrorism, and so the government has that opportunity. Right now, though, I believe that the suspect has been taken to a hospital,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters Friday night.

In the hours after Tsarnaev's capture, Glenn Beck on his Twitter account said he should absolutely be given a Miranda warning.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had said the government should hold Tsarnaev as an ""enemy combatant"" and not read him his Miranda rights, released a joint statement late Friday with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reiterating that point.

""Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes. We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives. The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now,"" Graham and McCain said. ""Under the Law of War we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel. Our goal at this critical juncture should be to gather intelligence and protect our nation from further attacks.""

Civil rights organizations filed a complaint against 5th Circuit Judge Edith Jones this week for remarks they say she made at a February speech to the Federalist Society at the University of Pennsylvania Law School about racial bias in death row sentencing.

The groups say the comments are prejudiced and call into question Jones' ability to be an impartial and fair judge.

Jones' law office in Houston said the judge declines to comment on the case.

According to several people present who signed affidavits for the complaint, Jones said:

“[S]adly some groups seem to commit more heinous crimes than others.” When asked to explain her remarks, she stated that there was “no arguing” that “Blacks and Hispanics” outnumber “Anglos” on death row and “sadly” it was a “statistical fact” that people “from these racial groups get involved in more violent crime.” By way of example, she asserted as a “fact” that “a lot of Hispanic people [are] involved in drug trafficking,” which itself “involved a lot of violent crime.”

The judge said ""certain racial groups"" are ""prone"" to violence, according to the complaint. Jones, a Reagan appointee, also defended the use of the death penalty because “a killer is only likely to make peace with God and the victim’s family in that moment when the killer faces imminent execution, recognizing that he or she is about to face God’s judgment,” according to the complaint.

No transcript or recording exists of the speech, according to the Federalist Society.

The 5th Circuit's chief judge, Carl E. Stewart, will decide whether to dismiss or pursue the complaint, according to The New York Times.

The law school's Federalist Society says Jones' remarks are being misconstrued. ""Rest assured the Federalist Society does not host or harbor racist speakers,"" Penn's Federalist Society posted in a brief statement on its Facebook page. ""We're disappointed that constructive dialogue about federal habeas relief is being misrepresented like this."" (Federal habeas relief refers to the appeals process for prisoners.) The group did not return a request for further comment.

Story continues

The issue of racial bias in sentencing made headlines in Texas in 2000 when Texas' then-Attorney General John Cornyn identified five cases in which he thought the race of a defendant was used improperly in testimony. Jones joined her colleagues on the 5th Circuit in rejecting the stay execution request of one of these prisoners, Duane Buck, in 2011. Buck argued that his sentence should be thrown out since an expert witness psychologist, Walter Quijano, suggested during his trail that Buck's race could make him more likely to commit another crime in the future.

Jones, who was believed to be on President George H.W. Bush's short list for the Supreme Court, has been an outspoken critic of the Supreme Court and judges who do not adhere to a constructionist view of the law.

In 2001, she told University of Texas law students that people who suspect they are fired because of racial bias or their gender should ""take a better second job instead of bringing suit"" because they were almost always wrong about the cause of their firing.

Jones also criticized the Supreme Court for allowing pornography and for decriminalizing the use of profanity in public places in a 2005 interview with The American Enterprise."

Inmates in two-thirds of the state’s 33 prisons, and at all four out-of-state private prisons, refused both breakfast and lunch on Monday, said corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton. In addition, 2,300 prisoners failed to go to work or attend their prison classes, either refusing or in some cases saying they were sick.

The corrections department will not acknowledge a hunger strike until inmates have missed nine consecutive meals. Even so, Thornton said, Monday’s numbers are far larger than those California saw two years earlier during a series of hunger strikes that drew international attention.

Despite the widespread work stoppages and meal refusals, Thornton said state prisons operated as usual through the day. “Everything has been running smoothly,” she said. “It was normal. There were no incidents.”

The protest, announced for months, is organized by a small group of inmates held in segregation at Pelican Bay State Prison near the Oregon border. Their list of demands, reiterated Monday, center on state policies that allow inmates to be held in isolation indefinitely, in some cases for decades, for ties to prison gangs.

Though prison officials contend those gang ties are validated, the state last year began releasing inmates from segregation who had no evidence of gang-related behavior. Nearly half of those reviewed have been returned to the general population.

The protest involves the same issues and many of the same inmates who led a series of protests in California prisons two years ago. At the height of those 2011 hunger strikes, more than 11,600 inmates at one point refused meals. The correction department’s official tally, which counts only those inmates on any given day who have skipped nine consecutive meals, never rose above 6,600.

The 5-4 decision is likely to make the taking of DNA samples as common as taking fingerprints or a photograph when people are arrested.

More than half of the states now require a DNA mouth swab when persons are charged with a serious crime, and many of the others were awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the practice.

The FBI’s national database has more than 11 million DNA samples on file, and that number is likely to grow sharply in the years ahead.

The high court said DNA has an “unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty,” and that taking a mouth swab from an arrestee was not an “unreasonable search.”

“When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee’s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,” said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito were included in the majority.

The decision in the case of Maryland vs. King upheld the rape conviction of Alonzo King. When he was arrested for an alleged assault, his DNA sample identified him as the perpetrator of an unsolved rape.

Justice Antonin Scalia spoke for the dissenters, saying the 4th Amendment did not permit searching persons for other crimes they may have committed. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan agreed with him.

As part of a general revision of old codes, the City Council changed a law that required some English on storefront signs because of fears that the language in the measure was unconstitutional. A proposed amendment, to be considered this week, requires the use of “modern Latin” letters on storefront signs.

It’s actually a looser requirement than the old law, which called for English words, not just letters. But that was lost in translation. After unanimously giving first approval to the ordinance last week, city leaders in the majority-Asian community say they’ve been inundated with negative media coverage and calls from upset residents.

“It has kind of spiraled,” Mayor Teresa Real Sebastian said.

Now some city leaders are beating a hasty retreat. One council member wants to avoid regulating language on signs altogether, and another said he would make a motion to delay action on the ordinance when it goes up for the second reading Wednesday.

The sudden furor and quick backtrack suggest a sea change in city politics from the racially charged 1980s, when Chinese immigrants rapidly transformed Monterey Park.

At the time, English-language requirements for commercial signs were hallmarks of a larger racial conflict. Three council members tried to get English declared the official language of the city and sponsored ordinances that would require all signs to use only English. Community groups launched recall efforts.

A wave of demographic change washed away much of the strife. Since 1980, census records show, the Asian population of Monterey Park has nearly doubled, nearing 67% in 2010. Four of five council members in office have Chinese last names.

Drive down Valley Boulevard or Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park and you’ll find mostly Chinese signs with a few begrudging, somewhat cryptic, letters in English. One northern Chinese restaurant whose Mandarin name evokes beauty and equality is known simply as “H&H.;” Others use such easily remembered acronyms as “ABC,” or they forgo English altogether.

This latest attempt to regulate signs, city leaders say, isn’t about race. Across the San Gabriel Valley, cities such as Rosemead, Temple City, San Marino and San Gabriel all have some requirements for English or English lettering on commercial signs.

Advertisement

English requirements for signs are about public safety, city leaders say. Police and firefighters who can’t read the languages of the ethnic communities they work in need some way of identifying businesses during emergencies.

Police Chief Jim Smith said no public safety incident prompted the code change. He supported it, he said, because it would help police officers do their jobs. Fire Chief Jim Birrell also supported the change in a letter to the City Council.

Advertisement

An informal “windshield” survey indicated that just one business would be affected by the change, according to City Atty. Mark Hensley, and he says the new language actually brings more business owners into compliance.

But for many residents, sign language is still “a sensitive, emotional issue,” Councilman Hans Liang said.

Advertisement

He initially voted for the change because he thought it would help firefighters and police officers do their jobs. Now he wants to delay action because, he says, it is a solution in search of a problem.

“There needs to be a better way of addressing this rather than making an ordinance,” Liang said.

Advertisement

John Man, president of the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce, said he wants city officials to proceed more carefully. Many business owners didn’t know the city had laws on the use of English on signs, Man said.

“The business owners need to hear the reason for the change first,” Man said.

Advertisement

Former state Assemblyman Mike Eng, who served on Monterey Park’s council beginning in 2003, recalls when the issue splintered the city into ethnic coalitions. But he says the city has moved on.

“It’s something that used to divide us,” Eng said. “But that political battle that has run its course.”

If signed by the governor, it would be the most restrictive abortion law in the nation.

The vote comes about one week after Arkansas legislators overrode a governor’s veto to become the first state to ban abortions involving fetuses 12 weeks or older.

The North Dakota legislation is among a string of antiabortion bills that the state’s lawmakers have been considering this session. A bill that bans abortions because of genetic defects or for gender selection also passed the Senate on Friday.

“We all know the significance of a heartbeat. It is the universally accepted biological proof of life,” said Sen. Spencer Berry, a sponsor of the bill, in a brief discussion before the vote. No one spoke in opposition and it passed 26 to 17.

The law is certain to face legal challenges. Earlier this month a federal judge struck down a 2011 Idaho law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, saying the law violates U.S. Supreme Court decisions which prohibit unduly impeding abortions before a fetus is able to live outside the womb.

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research institute that advocates for reproductive rights, said some states are in a “race to the bottom” to ban abortion as early as possible.

“These bills ban abortion at a very early point in pregnancy, a point at which many women may not realize they are pregnant.”

The bill provides an exception to protect the life of the mother. Doctors who perform abortions if a heartbeat has been detected could face prison time and a fine. Women who undergo abortions will not be punished.

The Red River Women’s clinic in Fargo is the only abortion clinic in North Dakota. The offices were closed Friday afternoon but a message in bold red letters on its website read: “Abortion is STILL legal in the state of North Dakota -- despite legislators’ attempts to restrict access to abortion. Red River Women’s clinic is OPEN, available for appointments and LEGALLY performing abortions in the state of North Dakota.”

Last-ditch attempt to halt licenses is turned down

Decision came just as gay pride parade got underway

Same-sex marriage opponents had asked Supreme Court to intervene

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on Sunday denied a last-ditch request from the sponsors of California's now-overturned gay marriage ban to halt the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the nation's most populous state.

Kennedy turned away the appeal with no additional comment just as San Francisco's gay pride parade was getting underway in San Francisco, where dozens of couples have gotten married since Friday and where the clerk's office was expected to issue more licenses on Sunday.

PRIDE ON PARADE:Court wins boost San Francisco celebration

Same-sex marriage opponents asked Kennedy to step in on Saturday, a day after the federal appeals court in San Francisco allowed same-sex marriages to go forward.

The opponents said the appeals court had acted about three weeks too soon when it cleared the way Friday for same-sex marriages to be legal in California for the first time in 4 ½ years by lifting a hold it had imposed on such unions while a lawsuit challenging Proposition 8 made its way to and through the high court.

Under Supreme Court rules, the losing side in a legal dispute has 25 days to request a rehearing. While such requests are almost never granted, the high court said that it wouldn't finalize its judgment in the case at least until after that waiting period elapsed.

Proposition 8 supporters could continue their efforts to halt gay marriage by filing their request with another Supreme Court justice. They also have another 21 days to seek a rehearing before the high court.

The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that Proposition 8's backers lacked standing to defend the 2008 law because California's governor and attorney general have declined to defend the ban.

Then on Friday, the 9th Circuit appeared to have removed the last obstacle to making same sex matrimony legal again in California when it removed its hold on a lower court's 2010 order directing state officials to stop enforcing the ban.

Within hours, same sex couples were seeking marriage licenses. The two couples who sued to overturn Proposition 8 were wed in San Francisco and Los Angeles Friday.

Organizers of the gay pride parade have invited newly married couples to a VIP reception at San Francisco City Hall on Sunday afternoon."

The interview will air in two parts on ""Starting Point"" on Monday, Jan 21st and Tuesday, Jan 22nd at 7aET only on CNN.

By ""Starting Point"" host Soledad O'Brien

Before my interview with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, she ushered me into her expansive office. It's upstairs from the rest of the justices. You wouldn't know it, but Justice Sotomayor can be loud. She likes to party, she likes noise, laughter and music. The offices downstairs…they tend to be quieter.

As I walk in, I notice a plaque on her front door and take a picture of it. “Well-behaved women rarely make history,” it says. I ask her if I could tweet the photo. She obliges, saying it's a sign that really embodies her and that most reporters miss it.

When we sit down for the interview, the first thing we talk about is Sunday's swearing in of Vice President Biden for his second term. I asked her what she thinks of that historic opportunity, since she would be the first Hispanic judge to administer the oath. I also wondered if she felt added pressure, especially after Chief Justice John Roberts famously fumbled President Barack Obama's oath in 2009.

“When you read my book you know that I practice everything I do over and over again,"" Justice Sotomayor says. ""So I have been saying the oath out loud for a couple of weeks now a couple of times a day but I won’t be relying on my memory either. I’ll have a card with me.”

What's clear is that Justice Sotomayor has a natural ease, which comes across in person and in her new memoir, ""My Beloved World."" The book recounts her life in the Bronx and her rise through her career, but it ends when she is nominated to her first judgeship on New York's Federal court and doesn't include much about her Supreme Court seat.

Her book also focuses a lot on her roots, her tight-knit Puerto Rican family and growing up in poverty in a public housing project in the Bronx, NY. She went on to college at Princeton and Yale, then worked as a lawyer until she was appointed to her first judgeship in 1991. Despite her rise, she never forgets where she came from.

An important theme she makes in the book is that she doesn't try to glamorize her great successes. Sotomayor makes a point of explaining the lessons she's learned through the challenges she's faced along the way. She recounts what it was like to attend Princeton in 1972, the 3rd year of classes for women at the school. At the time, there were virtually no Latinos at the school but she was still able to observe the plusses, challenges and ultimately the lessons learned from what was at times an isolating experience.

In her first year on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor says she was terrified. She points to her colleagues around her as the ones she relied on for mentoring. Though in reading her memoir and talking with her, it's clear that her drive to 'make it' is evident throughout her life. Even though she says she feels unprepared and not ready for her various experiences, she always manages to take a lay of the land and not only succeed but also outcompete everyone else.

She didn't shy away from talking openly about her diabetes and the importance of staying fit for her health. She felt she had an opportunity in the book to be an example for others.

Justice Sotomayor may be a new kind of Supreme Court Justice, one who knows her power as a role model and as someone who people can relate to. When talking with her in the interview, it's clear her friendliness and warmth makes it's easy to forget she holds a seat on the highest court in the country.

At the end of the interview, I introduced Justice Sotomayor to Erica Ramos, a recent college graduate from the Bronx. Sotomayor embraced Erica, who was trembling from joy, and autographed a book for her.

Sotomayor offered her some advice: You have so many great opportunities. Take them."

Mo Brooks has introduced legislation that would fire any federal employee who refuses to answer questions or gives false testimony at a congressional hearing.

The legislation was introduced in response to Lois Lerner, the IRS employee who revealed the agency's practice of targeting of tea party groups and subsequently declined to answer questions at congressional hearing on the issue, The Hill reported.

The proposed bill would require the termination of ""any federal employee who refuses to answer questions in a congressional hearing after being granted immunity,"" according to the report.

If three-fourths of the congressional body to whom the testimony was given finds that a federal worker ""willfully or knowingly gave false testimony"" during a hearing, then that employee would be fired under the legislation.

Lerner cited her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination in refusing to testify at a congressional hearing in May. The move angered many who say she should have been forced to answer why the tax agency targeted conservative groups applying for tax exempt status.

""This is a statement which should not be made by federally appointed officials before a congressional hearing if they are faithfully carrying out the duties of their office,"" Brooks told The Hill of Lerner's decision to refuse to testify.

Brooks added that the proposed bill is ""constitutional and necessary to enable Congress to provide proper oversight for the American people.""

A yearlong audit by the agency's inspector general found that IRS agents had improperly targeted conservative political groups for additional and sometimes onerous scrutiny when those groups applied for tax-exempt status.

The audit found no evidence that Washington officials ordered or authorized the targeting. But the IRS watchdog blamed ineffective management by senior IRS officials for allowing it to continue for nearly two years during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Since the revelations became public last month, much of the agency's leadership has been replaced and the Justice Department has started a criminal investigation. Both Lerner and Holly Paz, who until recently was a top deputy in the division that handles applications for tax-exempt status, have been replaced.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/immigration-reform-and-workers-rights.html,2013-02-21 00:00:00,[],Immigration Reform and Workers’ Rights - The New York Times,"Members of Congress and President Obama have been working in earnest to deliver on their promise to overhaul immigration this year. Mr. Obama would clearly prefer a bipartisan bill, and last week the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on possible changes in immigration law. News reports last weekend suggested that the White House would fashion its own bill should negotiations between Republican and Democratic supporters of reform collapse.

Yet, in all the talk of providing a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers while tightening border security, one important issue has, so far, received only passing mention: stronger protections for immigrant workers against exploitation and abuse. Such protections, essential to any reform plan, would help rid the system of bottom-feeding employers who hire and underpay and otherwise exploit cheap immigrant labor, dragging down wages and workplace standards for everyone.

Such abuses are easily visited on immigrant workers by unscrupulous employers who use the threat of deportation to force their victims into silence. This imbalance of power harms workers who toil in the shadows. But the system that recruits legal temporary workers is also a mess. In the event that an immigration overhaul greatly expands the number of guest workers — even hard-line Republicans have been talking about adding temporary visas in agriculture and in high-tech industries — it is crucial to avoid making the mess even bigger.

A new report by a coalition of labor, immigrant and human-rights groups has identified and examined “disturbingly common patterns” of abuse in America’s guest-worker programs. They are an alphabet-soup of visas with names like H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, J-1 and A-3, all having their own rules and little in common except, the report said, workers who are frequently victimized by “fraud, discrimination, severe economic coercion, retaliation, blacklisting and, in some cases, forced labor, indentured servitude, debt bondage and human trafficking.”"

Well, hardly. A new book quotes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as saying that America was ready for a president like Barack Obama who is black but ""light-skinned"" and speaks ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" Disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich said in an interview that he was ""blacker than Obama"" -- a comment that Blago later called ""stupid, stupid, stupid."" Here are 10 facts about racism and its close cousin, ethnic intolerance:

1. ""Honky,"" a slur against white people, probably originated in Chicago. Experts trace it to ""bohunk,"" used to describe Bohemians, Hungarians and other Eastern European immigrants. Black workers in Chicago's South Side meatpacking plants are believed to have referred to their white co-workers as ""hunkies,"" which later became ""honkies"" to refer to all whites.

2. A 1906 newspaper article in the Atlanta Constitution described how a white girl suffered a fatal heart attack after dreaming that a ""big negro"" with a knife was trying to kill her. The Constitution seemed to blame the fictional black man, headlining the story: ""Negro, Seen in Dream, Causes Death of Girl."" Such newspaper transgressions are easy to find. In 1921, The New York Times reported that South Africa's black population, which outnumbered whites 5-to-1, was pushing for political power. Some would view that as democracy in action. The Times saw it differently with this headline: ""Negroes a Problem in South Africa.""

3. The Tribune has its own embarrassing archives regarding race. About 40,000 people viewed the body of lynching victim Emmett Till when it was returned from Mississippi to Chicago in 1955, but the Tribune's article suggested that the key civil rights event might be a Marxist hoax. The article's third and fourth paragraphs described communists distributing ""inflammatory literature"" outside the church. The fifth and sixth paragraphs quoted a Mississippi sheriff who questioned whether the body was even Till's and said that ""the whole thing looks like a deal made up by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.""

4. There's nothing like a Disney movie to make some people whistle a happy tune and other people simply scream. The 1946 feature film ""Song of the South"" remains out of circulation because of the perceived offense it would give to African-Americans. The 1933 cartoon short ""Three Little Pigs"" featured the big, bad wolf dressed as a Jewish peddler. After complaints, the cartoon was revised so that the wolf posed as a Fuller Brush salesman. More recently, Arabs objected to a lyric in the 1992 film ""Aladdin."" It originally described Arabia as a place ""where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" That was changed to ""Where it's flat and immense, and the heat is intense / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" A Disney spokesman emphasized that the new lyric meant that Arabian weather patterns, not people, were ""barbaric.""

5. It's now a slur, but it once was the official name of a federal program. ""Operation Wetback"" was conducted in 1954 to drive illegal immigrants from the American Southwest. Federal officials claimed that 1.3 million people were deported or compelled to flee. The offensive name for the operation came from Gen. Joseph ""Jumpin' Joe"" Swing, a former West Point classmate of then-President Dwight Eisenhower who headed the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

6. A few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Life magazine published an article headlined ""How to tell Japs from the Chinese."" The Chinese, who were U.S. allies, found themselves mistaken for Japanese on American streets and treated rudely by angry Americans. Then Life came to the rescue, with annotated photos. The Chinese had ""parchment yellow complexion."" The Japanese had ""earthy yellow complexion."" The Chinese were ""tall and slender."" The Japanese were ""short and squat."" In their facial expressions, the Chinese ""wear the rational calm of tolerant realists,"" while Japanese show the ""humorless intensity of ruthless mystics."" A person from China ""never has rosy cheeks."" A Japanese person has ""sometimes rosy cheeks."" The apparent message: If you feel compelled to angrily confront an Asian stranger, harass the one with the rosy cheeks.

7. Ethnic prejudice can look a lot like racism. In 1855, Chicago's lily-white rulers clashed with new German and Irish immigrants. The battleground: booze. Mayor Levi Boone tried to shut down Irish and German beer halls while leaving open the taverns that served the whiskey preferred by his kind of people. An immigrant mob protested the crackdown, and the Lager Beer Riot ensued, leading to one death and 60 arrests.

8. Two of Chicago's best-known roads -- Sheridan and Roosevelt -- are named after national icons who disparaged American Indians. The phrase ""The only good Indian is a dead Indian"" is often attributed to Gen. Philip Sheridan. He denied saying it, but there's no question he viewed Indians as inferior savages and that he imposed hard-line policies leading to the deaths of many innocent Indians. Future President Theodore Roosevelt addressed the ""only good Indian"" expression in an 1886 speech: ""I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the 10th.""

9. Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and standard-bearer of the ""Back to Africa"" movement, met with the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1920s. Garvey said the two groups' attitudes were ""similar,"" explaining: ""Whilst the Ku Klux Klan desires to make America absolutely a white man's country, the Universal Negro Improvement Association wants to make Africa absolutely a black man's country."" Four decades later, Malcolm X also met with the Klan. According to accounts by Malcolm X and an FBI informant, the black Muslim and the Klan shared their distaste for integration. But unlike Garvey, Malcolm X later expressed regret for consorting with Klansmen."

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: Take cameras out of court,"As a courtroom junkie since my early reporting days, it is at great personal sacrifice that I suggest the following: It may be time to get television cameras out of the courtroom.

Or at least, judges might be encouraged to exclude electronic media from high-profile trials.

The excessive coverage and commentary we’ve watched in recent years may be good theater but bad for justice. Most recently, we’ve been witness to the carnival trial of George Zimmerman, charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. We’ve seen the families; we’ve met neighbors and friends; and we’ve heard the screaming on the recorded 911 call.

I have written about all of the above, true. But here’s the difference. If I were sitting in the courtroom with pad and pen, no one would notice or care. The pen may be mightier than the sword — and a picture may be worth a thousand words — but video cameras alter reality. Their very presence changes the people and events they seek to capture. And, just to keep those cliches rolling, although seeing is believing, what we project for others to see is influenced — and reality is altered — by the fact that a camera is recording that projection.

We’ve always known this on some abstract level, but our curiosity — and, ostensibly, our mighty respect for the public’s right to know — has clouded our judgment. There may be no way to quantitatively prove that cameras influence courtroom behavior and, possibly, a trial’s outcome. But anyone who has ever sat in front of a camera knows that it is so.

Meanwhile, the notion of the public’s right to know every detail of what is essentially a show trial suffers a paucity of veracity. If our concern were truly to better understand the machinations of the judicial system, as some have argued, we would record and broadcast all trial proceedings rather than only the ones that involve key elements of modern tabloid storytelling, namely sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll — and race.

The Zimmerman trial is riveting not because two men got in a scuffle and one of them died or because one was a teenager and the other an armed adult. It is that one was black, the supposed victim of a profiling vigilante, and the other white.

Voilà: We have a potboiler.

Imagine if Martin had been white under the same circumstances. Some might argue that Zimmerman would not have found Martin suspicious had he been white, but we can’t know this. We can debate the point until we’re all blue, but meanwhile, we can be fairly certain that the trial would not have attracted a single camera if not for the race element.

The point: Media are only interested in stories involving tension, whatever its underpinnings. And, inarguably, the media are providing what people, too, most care about. One Google trends chart “of interest over time” shows that people are more focused on the Zimmerman trial than they are on Egypt or the fate of Mohamed Morsi.

It is pointless to blame the media for essentially doing their job — providing information the public wants. Our attention, thus, would be more appropriately aimed at our own prurience and, given the human appetite for same, the court’s responsibility in protecting the defendant’s right to as fair a trial as possible.

This means ensuring a “neutral and detached environment,” as Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki put it in his ruling to ban media coverage of O.J. Simpson’s civil trial. The presence of electronic media in the criminal trial — very little of which I missed, I should say — “significantly diverted and distracted the participants,” Fujisaki wrote, adding that “the conduct of witnesses and counsel were unduly influenced by the presence of the electronic media.”

Fujisaki also was concerned that the jury, which was not sequestered, would be influenced by outside commentary. Although Zimmerman’s jury is sequestered, the judicial environment is hardly neutral or detached. One way or another, the media’s incessant dissection of every little shred of evidence or testimony leaks into the courtroom and contaminates the atmosphere. When lawyers and witnesses hear their own performances critiqued — and evidence is evaluated by one of the legions of former prosecutors-turned-experts — suddenly the audience is directing the play.

Put another way: If it were your neck on the line, you’d probably rather the media were in Cairo.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","In new term, Supreme Court may steer to right on key social issues","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court term that opens Monday gives the court’s conservative bloc a clear opportunity to shift the law to the right on touchstone social issues such as abortion, contraception and religion, as well as the political controversy over campaign funding.

If the justices on the right agree among themselves, they could free wealthy donors to give far more to candidates and parties and clear the way for exclusively Christian prayers at local government events.

In other cases due to be heard this fall, the justices are likely to uphold state bans on college affirmative action and block most housing bias claims that allege an unfair impact on blacks and Latinos.

They may also give states more authority to restrict and regulate abortion.

The justices are being asked to hear cases from Oklahoma in which they could uphold limits on the use of the abortion pill and require pregnant women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasound tests to see the fetus. And last month, Arizona’s attorneys asked the court to uphold the state’s ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a measure that was blocked on the basis of Roe vs. Wade.

By next spring, the justices are likely to revisit part of President Obama’s healthcare law to decide a religious-rights challenge to the requirement that large private employers provide their workers with coverage for contraceptives. Dozens of employers who run for-profit companies have sued, contending that providing health insurance that includes a full range of contraceptives violates their religious beliefs.

The upcoming term “is actually deeper in important cases than either of the last two terms,” said Irving Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at the Georgetown University’s law school.

The last term ended in June on a winning note for liberals, when the court handed down two victories for gay marriage. They included a 5-4 opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy giving legally married same-sex couples an equal right to federal benefits.

In recent years, gay rights advocates have pushed cases toward the high court, confident that Kennedy and the four justices on his left would rule in their favor. Last week, Ted Olson and David Boies, the attorneys who led the challenge to California’s Proposition 8, filed suit in Virginia, hoping to force an eventual ruling on whether gay marriage is a constitutional right.

Advocates on the right are using the same strategy.

They have been pushing cases toward the court confident that Kennedy will join the four conservatives to rule in their favor on religion, affirmative action, campaign finance and abortion. In their legal briefs, they argue for broad rulings and a significant shift in the law. Because they believe Kennedy is on their side, they “think they have the wind at their back,” said Pamela Harris, a Georgetown professor and former Justice Department lawyer.

So far, the only abortion-related case on the court’s docket tests a Massachusetts law that sets a 35-foot buffer zone around the entrances to abortion clinics. It is being challenged as a free-speech violation by Eleanor McCullen, a 74-year-old grandmother who seeks to talk to women before they enter a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston.

In 2000, over vehement dissents from Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the court upheld an 8-foot buffer zone in Colorado. The new case, McCullen vs. Coakley, to be heard in January, gives the court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. a chance to restrict buffer zones to 8 feet or, as the advocates propose, reject them entirely.

Kennedy signaled the potential for a major shift on abortion regulation six years ago. He spoke for a 5-4 majority to uphold the federal ban on “partial-birth abortions” and declared the “government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.”

Antiabortion lawmakers read this as an invitation to enact new restrictions. “Justice Kennedy’s opinion was a foundation changer,” said John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who appealed the decision striking down Arizona’s 20-week limit on abortions. “We’re optimistic this will force the court to confront the issue of fetal pain.”

Since 2010, Arizona and 12 states have adopted bans on abortion after 20 weeks, citing “scientific evidence of fetal pain.” Some of these states have adopted laws mandating ultrasound tests for patients seeking abortions and requiring costly changes in clinic facilities.

Although some measures have been blocked by federal judges, the goal was to get the issue to the Supreme Court.

It will be many months before the court decides whether it will take up an abortion regulation, but leaders of the antiabortion movement are hopeful. The Arizona appeal “may well be the case that leads the Supreme Court to examine and acknowledge the risk of abortion to women,” said Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life.

First up this fall are campaign funding and prayers at town council meetings.

On Tuesday, the court will hear an appeal brought by the Republican National Committee and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that challenges the $123,000 total limit on how much donors may give to congressional candidates and political parties. They want the court to say contributions, like political spending, are fully protected as free speech.

The lead plaintiff is Shaun McCutcheon, a 46-year-old electrical engineer from Birmingham, Ala. If he wins, it will help those in the political fundraising business because they could solicit millions of dollars from wealthy donors.

On Nov. 6, the court will consider whether town leaders can invite a Christian minister to open their meetings with a prayer to Jesus Christ. The case is Town of Greece (N.Y.) vs. Galloway.

Two race-related cases will also be heard. The justices will be asked to uphold Michigan’s voter initiative forbidding “preferential” admissions based on race. The case, Schuette vs. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, is set for Oct. 15. And the court could limit housing bias claims in a case from Mount Holly, N.J., due to be heard Dec. 4.

The investigation appears to center around Midlothian Sgt. Steven Zamiar, a 13-year veteran who helped oversee the suburb's force as deputy chief until a recent political shake-up. It remains unclear exactly what about Zamiar — or the small department — has drawn the attention of federal investigators.

Zamiar, 46, won't say. The suburb's recently appointed police chief, Harold Kaufman, would say only that ""numerous"" people from the department have been questioned in the inquiry.

The village has received two federal grand jury subpoenas this year. The first sought Zamiar's personnel file, specifically requesting records related to allegations of misconduct by the officer, among other documents.

The second subpoena arrived in late June seeking police logs and call records tied to three days in 2011, along with the department's policy manuals regarding ""use of force by police officers.""

On one of those days, Zamiar filed an incident report saying he used a baton to subdue a suspect after an early morning chase outside a bar — at a time department records show he was not clocked in. Charges against the suspect for assault and resisting an officer were later dropped, according to court records.

Zamiar confirmed the federal investigation but declined further comment.

""I don't really have anything to say about it,"" Zamiar said. ""It's an investigation, that's all I know.""

Zamiar remains on duty with the department. The village told the Tribune there was no record of any internal investigations of Zamiar in the last three years.

The suburb's former police chief, David Burke, told the Tribune he thought the investigation centered on a burglary of Zamiar's car in front of his Midlothian home.

Police records show that in 2010 Zamiar chased suspects from his house and called police. Police records show the two 19-year-old suspects were caught and charged with felony burglary. Court records show both pleaded guilty and received probation.

As for the 2011 case, it was early on Thanksgiving when Zamiar reported that he saw a crowd being pushed out of a local bar by security.

Zamiar's time sheets for that day don't show him clocked in, but Zamiar wrote in his incident report that he was working in the area and approached the scene at the bar.

After learning there was a fight, Zamiar said a witness pointed out the suspect. Then after a brief chase, Zamiar said the suspect ""turned toward me in an aggressive manner.""

""At this time I utilized my ASP Baton and the subject was taken into custody without further resistance,"" Zamiar wrote.

Zamiar said the suspect later complained of pain but signed a refusal for medical treatment.

The suspect's attorney declined to comment.

Zamiar has faced past allegations of abuse. He was accused in 2007 of giving a suspect a concussion while trying to arrest him. That case was settled.

Early in his career, Zamiar faced three other lawsuits alleging excessive force, all within his first year on the beat. The village denied the allegations in all cases and court records appear to show one was settled, while the other two were dropped.

Records related to the suits were received by the grand jury in response to the first subpoena.

A look at Zamiar's work history in the village also shows a number of recognitions. Among several citations for achievement are commendations for drug busts as well as his work when a knife-wielding assailant went on a rampage at a shopping center, leaving a 1-year-old dead.

Zamiar also has a record of attending numerous courses in recent years, including special training in the proper use of force. Records show he completed three such courses the same year that he said he used his baton in the 2011 incident.

Burke, who appointed Zamiar deputy chief in 2011, said Zamiar is a good cop.

""(Zamiar) doesn't know what's going on. They won't tell him either,"" Burke said. ""He's losing sleep, and he's quite upset about it. He's never done anything wrong.""

Williams Joined The Network As A Contributor In']",Meet the new face of immigration reform,"Adriana Garcia, 21, is about to become a very unusual poster girl for immigration reform.

Beginning this week Ms. Garcia and the American flag appear in an on-line advertisement for immigration reform called “The Pledge.”

Garcia is one of more than a dozen undocumented young people appearing in the advertisement and holding up their hands as they say the pledge of allegiance to the U.S. flag.

Since she left Mexico and arrived in Arizona at age 10 Ms. Garcia has put her hand over heart every day in school and pledged allegiance “to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”

Garcia is not a U.S. citizen. The only reason she can show her face without fear of trouble is because President Obama ordered federal immigration authorities not to deport “Dreamers,” high school and college students who lack legal immigration status.

More On This...

She calls the U.S. her country and she calls the American flag her flag.

But her American identity has no legal standing. Her parents, who have been in Arizona since the early 1990s, don’t have any legal status at all.

None of the other young people in the on-line advertisements are American citizens. But all of them grew up in the U.S. happily pledging their oath to the red, white and blue flag of a country they call home.

But they have been ignored failed to move immigration reform under President Bush, a Republican, and President Obama, a Democrat.

Garcia, a junior marketing major at Grand Canyon State University who worked as a congressional intern this year, agreed to appear in the advertisement to reach out to American citizens and ask them to insist Congress take immediate action on reforming the immigration broken immigration system.

The symbol in the ad is an open hand of the kind lift to their hearts when they recite the pledge of allegiance.

“The immigration rights movement doesn’t have a symbol,” said Jose Antonio Vargas, another undocumented immigrant who has been saying the pledge of allegiance since he was 12. Now 32 he has written for several American newspapers, won a Pulitzer Prize, and founded the pro-immigration reform group ‘Define American.’ His feature length documentary on his life as a child without citizenship papers will debut on television next year.

But he still lacks citizenship.

“We want the symbol of the pledge hand to unify U.S. citizens and undocumented people in the fight for immigration reform,” said Vargas. “Looking at American history we know that in the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, and the gay rights movement it was crucial to attract allies from all parts of American life. Those movements took off when everyone got involved.”

Garcia, a Girl Scout, has two sisters, 13 and 9, who are citizens because they were born in the U.S.

“I hope people who don’t feel involved with immigration reform take a look at the video and see themselves in a group of all-around American young people who say the pledge but don’t have citizenship,” said Garcia. “If they get involved it will strengthen the movement.”

The only hope remaining for the immigration reform movement is that the House of Representatives will take up the issue in early 2014 before mid-term elections. The Senate passed an immigration bill last summer but the House has taken no action.

Once 2014 primary campaigns begin in Republican congressional districts it will be difficult, if not impossible, for Republican Congressmen to support any reforms without fear of being attacked by GOP primary opponents as soft on criminals.

But this Christmas the happy, welcome symbol of an open hand -- ready to pledge allegiance with other Americans – is Ms. Garcia’s gift to efforts to bring all Americans together and get the House to finally to take action on immigration reform."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/14/naacp-asking-obama-administration-to-pursue-zimmerman-civil-case/,2013-07-14 00:00:00,[],Justice Department weighing civil rights case after Zimmerman cleared of all charges,"The Justice Department said Sunday that it will review the George Zimmerman case for possible civil rights violations, after a jury acquitted the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.

As Zimmerman's attorney cautioned that his client's safety is at risk, the Justice Department responded to appeals from NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous and several lawmakers to keep investigating the defendant.

The department may find itself in a vulnerable spot. Last week, a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the ""pressure campaign"" against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year. Judicial Watch claimed documents and public accounts showed ""extraordinary intervention"" by the department in the campaign that eventually led to Zimmerman's prosecution.

The department, however, claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community – not to take sides.

President Obama himself caused a stir last year by remarking in the days after the shooting that if he had a son, he would “look like Trayvon.” On Sunday, however, Obama urged calm and declared, “the jury has spoken.”

The Justice Department, in announcing it would examine possible civil rights violations, said it has already been reviewing the handling of the criminal case in which Zimmerman, a Hispanic, fatally shot Martin, a black teen, in February 2012, raising concerns about such issues as racial profiling.

""The Department of Justice's Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,"" the Justice Department said in a statement Sunday. ""Experienced federal prosecutors will [now] determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.""

Jealous started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org that was addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder.

""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" Jealous wrote in the petition.

An all-female six-member jury announced late Saturday that it found Zimmerman ‘not guilty’ of all counts against him, which included charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Jealous told CNN’s “State of the Union on Sunday morning, “There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why (Zimmerman) targeted young Trayvon.”

He also said he has not spoken directly with Holder but has spoken to his senior people.

“We are glad that what they began months back continues, which is a serious reviewing of everything that came out in this case, everything that was known before this case,” Jealous said.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urged the Justice Department to review federal charges against Zimmerman.

“I think the Justice Department is going to take a look at this,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This isn’t over with and I think that’s good.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton on the same show condemned the “stand your ground” law under which Zimmerman won acquittal, adding of his plans, ""I will convene an emergency call with preachers tonight to discuss next steps and I intend to head to Florida in the next few days.""

Meanwhile, Mark O'Mara, who defended Zimmerman at trial, suggested his client’s safety was at risk. ""There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,"" O'Mara said. ""They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.""

In August 2012, O'Mara said Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living like hermits and weren't working because they feared for their safety.

After Saturday's verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence.

Demonstrators across America rallied against Zimmerman on Sunday. Most of the protests were peaceful, but in cities like Oakland, Calif., there were reports of vandalism.

""I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,"" Obama said in a statement Sunday.

(CNN) —

Friday, President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room and gave the American people his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case.

His comments were striking in their honesty and in their personal nature.

He didn’t lecture. He wasn’t angry. He was reflective. He spoke about his personal experiences, and the shared experiences of so many others. He called for respect for the process and the verdict, but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry.

He said that 35 ago, “Trayvon Martin could have been me.”

He started a national conversation.

And – in the most predictable and disappointing fashion – he became a lightning rod for criticism from his political opponents. Within moments of his speech, cable news and Twitter was full of comments from the right questioning the president’s motives and words.

He was called divisive. He was accused of fanning the flames of discontent. Some said that by raising this issue, he was not being a president for everyone, just for African-Americans.

Those criticisms could not be more sad. Nor could they be more off base. Because while Obama’s comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation, to me his remarks were about so much more.

They were about all of the divisions we face.

There are far too many stereotypes and bigotries that divide us on a daily basis. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others.

Obama’s comments don’t just speak to the young black man who worries he’s being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. He spoke to the young Sikh-American man who is called a “terrorist” on the street or stared at with fear for wearing a turban publicly.

He spoke to the young Indian-American man, born and raised in this country, who is mocked and called a racial slur and told “welcome to America” by a U.S. senator because his skin color is a little darker.

He spoke to the servicewoman who wears our nation’s uniform but finds that the greatest threat might come from male colleagues.

He spoke to the young woman who walks down the street and feels the need to cover up because of all the eyes “checking out” her body.

He spoke to the young Hispanic-American who is assumed to be an illegal immigrant just because of his or her last name.

And yes, he spoke to the white Americans who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man.

The fact is we do still have divisions in this country based on racism. And sexism. And ageism. And more “isms” than any of us care to admit. So when the president says “Trayvon Martin could have been me,” of course that’s somewhat about race.

But not entirely.

Those misconceptions about him and the fear Martin felt that night are all too familiar to way too many Americans. Trayvon Martin could have been any of us.

Obama has been the recipient of more than his fair share of attacks. But Friday’s were – for me – some of the most disappointing I’ve witnessed since he took office.

Not everything needs to be a fight. We ought to be able to have nonpoliticized conversations about issues that are this important. Sometimes, rather than throw a punch, it might be more productive to just join the conversation.

Friday was one of those days.

And unless we have more conversations like the one the president advocates – and until we realize it’s a conversation that we all are a part of – we’ll won’t every fully get to a place where we are finally judged purely on “the content of our character.”

Many feminists have differing opinions on the much-talked about first lady and her role.

Many feminists have differing opinions on the much-talked about first lady and her role.

In the opening moments of her second turn at history, as Michelle Obama waves at celebrants along Pennsylvania Avenue, Americans will clamor to see the first lady, who remains one of the most popular public figures in the country. In the most recent poll, fully 73 percent said they approve of the way she is handling her job.

But a significant group of Americans — feminist Americans — have been vocally disappointed with her choices and feel let down by her example.

In 2008, when Obama announced her intention to be “mom-in-chief,” many feminists decried her decision to give up her career and said she had been victimized by her husband’s choices. She was regarded as one of the women feminist Linda Hirshman described as “letting down the team.”

But most black feminists and writers had a different view. Let the sister get settled, they said. Give her a minute to do a head count. And if she wanted to focus on motherhood, for black women that was more than fine. It was arguably revolutionary, because black women were long denied the right — or lacked the means — to simply care for their own.

As she begins another four years in the White House, the nation’s feminists are divided about the “work” Obama has done, and the work they’d like to see her do.

Lincoln was one of the original first ladies to be heavily criticized for her spending habits and opulent taste. Oggiano-Frederick Wait 1 second to continue.

This split has bitter historic roots. It surfaced during the suffrage movement, when white women suggested their votes could counter those of “the darker races,” and again in the 1970s, when black feminists broke away over the white middle-class focus of “women’s lib.”

Now, with an African American woman in the White House, these differences have rushed back to the fore.

Last year, after Obama and Ann Romney submitted recipes for a cookie contest, Hirshman told The Washington Post that Obama’s “first mom, gardener thing” is “silly.” Now, Hirshman says, “I’ve kind of lost interest in Michelle Obama. She was trapped by assumptions about race and had limited room to maneuver. Whether that was a welcome choice or she had no choice, I will never know. It’s very difficult to envision her as running for senator from the state of Illinois as you did with Hillary Clinton running for senator from the state of New York.”

“Are fashion and body-toning tips all we can expect from one of the most highly educated First Ladies in history?” asked author Leslie Morgan Steiner in an online column last January. She said she’d “read enough bland dogma on home-grown vegetables and aerobic exercise to last me several lifetimes.”

Steiner contended Obama probably had little leeway. “I’m sure there is immense pressure — from political advisors, the black community, her husband, the watching world — to play her role as First Black Lady on the safe side.”

Feminist discontent with the first lady spiked again last summer at the Democratic National Convention, after she called her daughters “the heart of my heart and the center of my world.” She then repeated her feminist crazy-maker: “You see, at the end of the day, my most important title is still ‘mom-in-chief.’ ”

“Why does mom-in-chief have to be the most important thing this strong, vibrant woman tells us about herself as she flexes the strange but considerable power of the office of first lady?” Emily Bazelon asked on Slate.com.

“Judging by Michelle Obama’s speech, feminism is dead to the Democratic party, ” Lilith Dornhuber wrote on a feminist Web site’s community forum.

Author Katie Roiphe, who says she has had her own battles with fellow white feminists, calls these complaints misplaced. “I think there’s a certain unconstructive scrutiny going on in this certain population of white feminists on the blogosphere,” Roiphe says. “It’s such a naive definition of power to say that the first lady is not a working woman.”

This take — that Obama doesn’t exercise agency in her choices, that her anti-obesity, healthy-eating issues lack gravity, or that she’s not working — is one that many minority feminists and writers of color find ahistorical. They join the Michelle conversation from a different center and land on wildly different points.

By necessity and by choice, a majority of black women have been working outside the home at least since the census began keeping track of their labor in 1972. There has never been a national effort to keep black women at home, caring sweetly for their children. They have always worked, and their work has never been a separate thing from their mothering.

“Feminists who wish that Obama would strike a blow for feminism and against stereotyped roles of women, too easily forget that all women are not burdened by the same stereotypes,” wrote Tami Winfrey Harris in a September article, “A Black Mom-in-Chief is Revolutionary: What White Feminists Get Wrong about Michelle Obama,” for the online magazine Clutch.

“There’s no denying that the emphasis as ‘mom-in-chief’ can be read as conservative,” says Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University who specializes in African American literature and feminist criticism. But black traditional families are rarely pictured in the mainstream, Mitchell says. And, “let’s be real about how much assumptions about black families being pathological really dictate public policy.”

“I just have a problem with the idea that Michelle Obama doesn’t work,” says author Joan Morgan, a visiting scholar at Stanford University. “It’s a basic anti-feminist argument to say the work she does in making sure her family is okay — that the girls are healthy and not caught up in the craziness of celebrity and acting out — is not valuable work.”

Morgan contends that some white feminists are unable to see beyond their own narrative. “Michelle is deeply personal to black women,” Morgan says, and if white feminists “took a modicum of interest in what black women’s lives were like, and took some time to learn about them, then we wouldn’t always end up in this place where there’s an issue or person that seems so polarizing, and we wouldn’t be standing on opposite sides of the chasm.”

Author Rebecca Walker, who writes about culture, identity and motherhood, is the daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker. She says her mother told her of white female writers: “We read them, but really, they do not read us.”

That feminist notion of being on the same team is often absent when it comes to issues affecting women of color and their communities, says Walker, who is biracial and who says she finds the intense questioning of the first lady’s choices “tedious.”

Do we really think “that she would have more power as a hospital administrator than she would as first lady?” she asks.

Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez, an associate professor at the University of Texas who blogs for Ms. Magazine, has closely followed the anti-obesity work the first lady has done with American Indian, Latino and African American children — “with American children more broadly, but with a focus on minority children.”

Obama “refocuses the conversation around black womanhood and black motherhood away from the welfare queen and into the middle class,” Guidotti-Hernandez says. “It’s a different version of race and motherhood that as a nation, and for me as a Latina, is really important.”

In the second term, Guidotti-Hernandez says, she’d love to see the first lady take on women’s pay equity.

Roiphe would like to see her use her position to champion gun control.

Morgan says she’s “content with where Michelle is and what she does.”

Walker wants to see her “stay happy.”

As for a lot of other feminists, they’ve already cut their losses with Obama and are looking past her. All the way to 2016.

The rodeo clown who ignited a firestorm of controversy after donning a mask of President Barack Obama has spoken out for the first time, insisting that he was only making a joke with no underlying message.



""I didn't do this to do any hating on anyone. I did this to be funny. I did it to be a joke,"" Tuffy Gessling told KCTV about the Aug. 10 performance.

Gessling’s appearance drew waves of criticism when it was first reported that in addition to wearing the Obama mask, he made controversial comments such as, “We’re gonna stomp Obama.”

Some observers said the act went too far, bringing up questions of whether the performance had racial undertones. However, Gessling said it was only the latest iteration in a long tradition of mocking U.S. presidents.

""I didn't think anything more of it than what we've done 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, when we've done it with Bush, Clinton and Ronald Reagan,"" Gessling said.

However, after the story went viral, the Missouri State Fair said it had banned the rodeo clown from performing at its event in the future. However, fair officials declined to release his name, saying they wanted to protect his anonymity over safety concerns.

And just when the story seemed to be fading out of the news cycle, Gessling was thrust back into the spotlight when Yahoo News reported that Texas Rep. Steve Stockman had invited Gessling to perform in his state.

Gessling said he is apolitical and was simply doing his job. But he said that job has come to a standstill since the story broke. Instead, he has faced five death threats and a number of personally painful interactions with individuals upset with him.

""I've had one lady spit in my face — called me a dirty name, spit in my face and walked off,"" Gessling told KCTV. ""I've had somebody threaten to run me over. One of them wanted to burn the house down.”

Interestingly, Gessling said he wouldn’t rule out wearing the Obama mask again. But at the same time, he said it would be an “honor” to meet the president in person.

""If President Obama turns out, I would be honored to shake his hand,"" Gessling said.

""I actually think that a lot of people have lost their ability to laugh,"" he added. ""Look at the country as a whole, there is a lot more to be mad at than a rodeo clown at a rodeo trying to make somebody laugh."""

(CNN) —

I’m a big fan of Michelle Obama’s, but if she’s going to be hitting the circuit to raise money for Democrats, she has to be prepared for heckling. Especially heckling from gay rights activists like the one who interrupted her speech Tuesday night.

“Lesbian looking for federal equality before I die.” That’s how Ellen Sturtz, the woman identified as the heckler, identified herself.

Apparently the first lady’s husband said something about signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

ESPN LZ Granderson

Sturtz had the nerve to ask the president to keep his word.

And it’s not like signing an order will rock Washington’s world – as The Washington Post pointed out, of the “employees of federal contractors that are in the Fortune 1000, 92% are already protected by a company-wide sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy, and 58% are already protected by a gender identity nondiscrimination policy.”

Still President Barack Obama made a promise: It’s not unreasonable to expect him to keep it.

Especially when one out of every 16 of his “bundlers” – those who organize super fund-raisers – during the 2012 election was openly gay. The Washington Post says of his top 2012 bundlers, one in six was gay. And that more than 75% of voters who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voted for him. And yet the changes Obama has wrought since he was first elected often feel as if they’re being handed out like doggie treats, and not championed with the same urgency that Democrats showed on the campaign trail.

Heckling the first lady wasn’t fair because she isn’t responsible for policy. But the incident sent a message to those who are responsible: We are people, not pawns.

But this is what happens when a bloc of voters – be it the LGBT community, Latinos, women – surrenders its voting power to a political party as opposed to a principle. Not all Republicans are anti-gay, not all Democrats are pro, and it’s the rare politician who will do something “bold” that isn’t politically expedient.

In Illinois, the House of Representatives, controlled 71-47 by Democrats, chose not to vote on same-sex marriage legislation, with some members saying they needed to talk it over with their constituents. A rationale that doesn’t hold much water because the Senate passed the bill 34-21 in February. State Sen. Jason Barickman, a Republican, voted in support of same-sex marriage after adding a religious liberty amendment to the bill.

Many activists are pointing fingers at the Illinois House Legislative Black Caucus for not playing ball. This seems ironic, considering the first item under the subject line “What Are They Fighting for?” is civil equality.

State Rep. Ken Dunkin, chairman of the Black Caucus, did not return my calls. But he did tell the Windy City Times that it was unfair to pin the bill’s failure on the caucus, adding, “This is not the Black Caucus’ burden.”

Because lord knows black folks have nothing to do with gay folks, right Ken?

Gregory Angelo, the Log Cabin Republicans’ national executive director, told me that “if there’s any lesson to learn from this is that Democrats can’t pass marriage equality on their own. They need Republican support.”

And the LGBT community would be wise to remember that. The Republican Party may house the most vocal, and sometimes offensive, opponents – but that doesn’t mean that all Democrats are proponents or courageous enough to fight. The Senate Republicans in Rhode Island became the first legislative caucus in the country, of either party, to vote unanimously for same-sex marriage.

The truth is the Illinois Democrats promised to bring the bill to a vote and they didn’t. It’s likely they are stalling to see what the U.S. Supreme Court decides in the two same-sex marriage cases it heard this spring. Decisions are expected later this month. The Illinois House has until August 31 to vote.

This is a little political cover that may be smart but flies in the face of the party’s national platform: “We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples.”

But Democrats have trampled on that promise before, and fairly recently.

In 2009, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said he supported marriage for same-sex couples. But he recently opposed an amendment to the immigration reform bill that would have included same-sex couples because he thought it would make Republicans kill the bill. The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t even want to vote on it. Basically Schumer wants same-sex couples to get married in his home state – but if you’re binational, he’ll let the government deport your spouse.

So the LGBT community gets tossed under the bus – again – as if our families are not worth voting for. As if we don’t deserve a public record of which Democrat is for us and which is against us.

Heckling Mrs. Obama wasn’t fair to her.

But taking the LGBT community for granted isn’t fair to us either.

Cpl. Nathan Kemnitz, who was gravely wounded in 2004 from a roadside bomb in Iraq, has limited use of his right arm and is incapable of lifting it above his head, according to the website.

During a recent trip to the state capitol building in Sacramento, Calif. -- where Kemnitz was being honored as his legislative district’s veteran of the year -- the retired Marine was reportedly asked to remove his dress shirt.

He was also asked by TSA workers at Sacramento International Airport to lift his arms above his head during a full-body scan. Kemnitz could not comply with either request, telling Military Times, ""My right arm doesn’t work. It’s a lot of hassle for me to do that.""

Kemnitz's travel partner, Patricia Martin, was outraged following the incidents and wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to express her anger.

“What does a uniform and heroism represent if our own citizens — in this case employees of the TSA and security personnel — have no regard for them?” Martin reportedly wrote.

""I feel so strongly that you need to know just how shamefully even a Purple Heart recipient/disabled veteran can be treated by some TSA and security employees,"" she said, according to the website.

TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein said in a statement Monday that ""Our intent is to treat all injured service members and veterans with the dignity they deserve. As always, all passengers with disabilities and medical conditions are eligible for screening procedures sensitive to their particular disability, medical condition or other unique medical circumstance.

“Transportation Security Officers have to resolve any anomaly detected at the checkpoint,"" Feinstein said. ""As is standard procedure for all passengers, if travelers alarm when passing through a metal detector or an advanced imaging technology (AIT) unit, additional screening is required in order to resolve that anomaly.""

""Wounded Warriors, members of the military and veterans are all required to place their carry-on items on the conveyor belt and in bins prior to passing through either a metal detector or AIT unit,” he said.

The modified pat-down of Kemnitz at the airport lasted about six minutes. At no time did he complain or express any annoyance about the inspection, according to the TSA.

The 5-4 decision is likely to make the taking of DNA samples as common as taking fingerprints or a photograph when people are arrested.

More than half of the states now require a DNA mouth swab when persons are charged with a serious crime, and many of the others were awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the practice.

The FBI’s national database has more than 11 million DNA samples on file, and that number is likely to grow sharply in the years ahead.

The high court said DNA has an “unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty,” and that taking a mouth swab from an arrestee was not an “unreasonable search.”

“When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee’s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,” said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito were included in the majority.

The decision in the case of Maryland vs. King upheld the rape conviction of Alonzo King. When he was arrested for an alleged assault, his DNA sample identified him as the perpetrator of an unsolved rape.

Justice Antonin Scalia spoke for the dissenters, saying the 4th Amendment did not permit searching persons for other crimes they may have committed. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan agreed with him.

Scott Walker signed a law on Friday banning doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice.

Story highlights Law says doctors can't perform abortions without admitting privileges in nearby hospitals Planned Parenthood files suit The judge sides with the group The restraining order will stay in place until another hearing next week

(CNN) —

A Wisconsin federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law.

The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker on Friday, bans doctors from performing abortions if they don’t have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice.

U.S. District Judge William Conley granted the hold Monday after the Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit.

The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures.

Conley agreed.

“There is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement,” he wrote in his 19-page ruling.

He added that the U.S. Supreme Court precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are “reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health.”

To that end, “the record to date strongly supports a finding that no medical purpose is served by this requirement,” he said.

The restraining order will stay in place pending a fuller hearing on July 17.

The law, which took effect Monday, also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion, but that portion of the law was not challenged in the Planned Parenthood suit.

Opponents of the Wisconsin legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics, and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult.

Supporters insist that it would guarantee a safer environment for a woman suffering from abortion-related complications.

Judge Conley questioned that contention, saying, “The current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications.”

CNN reached out to Walker’s office for response and is awaiting a response.

Two states allow commercial production%2C distribution and possession of pot for nonmedical purposes.

Where will legal pot be grown -- outdoors on commercial farms%2C inside in confined growing spaces%3F

Will states try to limit or counter ads in the communities and stores that sell marijuana%3F

Believe me, I've heard all the pot jokes, and some of them are true. Public support for legalizing marijuana use is at an all-time high. Some state-level marijuana laws are going up in smoke. And yes, Washington and Colorado are embarking on a historic joint venture.

Puns aside, discussions about marijuana legalization are getting serious. In November, voters in Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented decision to allow commercial production, distribution and possession of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. Not even the Netherlands goes that far.

Policymakers in both states are confronting some new and tricky issues that have never been addressed. For them, and for anyone else thinking about changing their pot laws, here are seven key decision areas that will shape the costs and benefits of marijuana legalization:

1. Production. Where will legal pot be grown -- outdoors on commercial farms, inside in confined growing spaces, or somewhere in between? RAND research has found that legalizing marijuana could make it dramatically cheaper to produce -- first because producers will no longer have to operate covertly, and second because suppliers won't need to be compensated for running the risks of getting arrested or assaulted. After lawmakers decide how it will be grown, production costs will be shaped by the number of producers and other regulations such as product testing.

2. Profit motive. If there is a commercial pot industry, businesses will have strong incentives to create and maintain the heavy users who use most of the pot. To get a sense of what this could look like, look no further than the alcohol and tobacco industries, which have found ingenious ways to hook and reel in heavy users. So will private companies be allowed to enter the pot market, or will states limit it to home producers, non-profit groups or cooperatives? If a state insisted on having a monopoly on pot production, it could rake in a decent amount revenue -- but for now, that possibility seems far off in the United States since marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

3. Promotion. Will states try to limit or counter advertisements in the communities and stores that sell marijuana? U.S. jurisprudence against curtailing what's known as ""commercial free speech"" could make it tough to regulate the promotion of pot. While a state monopoly system could help control promotion, those advertisements you see for state lotteries should give you pause.

4. Prevention. If pot is legal for adults, how will school and community prevention programs adapt their messages to prevent kids from using? While some proposals to legalize marijuana would divert tax revenues to prevention efforts, the messaging and strategy should probably be in place before legal marijuana ever hits the streets.

5. Potency. Marijuana potency is usually measured by its tetrahydrocannabinol content, or THC -- the chemical compound largely responsible for creating the ""high"" from pot, as well as increasing the risk of panic attacks. Much of the marijuana coming into the U.S. from Mexico is about 6% THC, while the marijuana sold in medical dispensaries in California ranges from 10%-25% THC. Meanwhile, the Dutch are now considering limiting the pot sold at their famed coffee shops to no more than 15% THC.

While THC receives the most of the attention, don't forget other compounds like cannabidiol, or CBD -- which is believed to counter some of the effects of THC.

6. Price. With marijuana, like any other commodity, price will influence consumption and revenues. A growing body of research suggests that when marijuana prices go down, the probability that someone might use marijuana goes up. So retail prices will largely be a function of consumer demand, production costs and tax rates. If taxes are set too high, pot will become expensive enough to create an incentive for an illicit market -- exactly what legalization is trying to avoid. The way taxes are set will also have an effect on what's purchased and consumed -- that is, whether pot is taxed by value, total weight, THC content, or other chemical properties.

7. Permanency. The first jurisdictions to legalize pot will probably suffer growing pains and want to make changes later on. They would do well to build some flexibility into their taxation and regulatory regime. For example, while it may make sense to tax marijuana as a function of its THC to CBD ratio, 10 years from now we may have research suggesting a better way to tax. Just in case they change their minds, some pioneering jurisdictions may want to include a sunset provision that would give them an escape clause, a chance -- by simply sitting still -- to overcome the lobbying muscle of the newly legal industry that will no doubt fight hard to stay in business. As the sunset date approaches, legislators or voters could choose either to keep their legalization regime or to try something different.

Of course, these aren't the only decisions facing those who are thinking about legalizing marijuana. But if we want to move away from the puns and abstract discussions to serious policy debates, these ""Seven Ps"" are a fine place to start.

USA TODAY

President Obama on Friday made his most extensive comments on race since entering the White House, and they are generating extensive commentary.

Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who lost the 2008 presidential race to Obama, called the president's remarks ""very impressive,"" and said they should help all Americans think about how to improve race relations in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death.

""I think we continue to make progress,"" McCain told CNN's State of the Union, but recent events show ""we still have a long way to go.""

McCain also said he wouldn't ""second guess"" the Florida jury's decision this month to acquit George Zimmerman for the death of the 17-year-old Trayvon.

During a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Friday, Obama said all Americans should respect the Zimmerman verdict. Speaking personally and emotionally, the president also said white Americans should understand the pain that African Americans feel over Trayvon's death, and the deep suspicions they harbor about the American justice system.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" said the nation's first African-American president, adding that ""it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.""

Obama's remarks dominated discussions on Sunday news shows, winning many compliments, but also some criticism.

Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., also on CNN, said he appreciates how Obama reflected the frustrations of black men who are regarded with suspicion simply walking down the street.

""That's me on a daily basis ... especially when I'm home in New Orleans and I'm dressed down,"" Richmond said, adding that only African-American males ""can really sense the anger and frustration when it happens, especially when you're doing what you should be doing.""

Journalist Tavis Smiley told NBC's Meet the Press that Obama -- who has often avoided public discussions of race during his presidency -- had to be ""pushed to that podium"" after nearly a week of protests over the Zimmerman verdict. Smiley and others said Obama needs to address the economic challenges of African-American communities, as well as problems in the justice system.

""On this issue, you cannot lead from behind,"" said Smiley, an African American.

Charles Ogletree, a law professor of Obama's at Harvard, defended his former student's efforts on race. He told NBC that Obama should not be seen as ""the black president,"" but the leader of the nation as a whole.

""He's the president who happens to be black,"" Ogletree said.

During his White House remarks, Obama called for new and better law enforcement training to help defuse tensions with minorities, and he criticized racial profiling and Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. (On CNN, McCain said he hopes his state of Arizona will review its own ""stand your ground"" law.)

The president called on Americans to do ""soul searching"" in the wake of the Zimmerman case.

""We have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues,"" Obama said. ""And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature, as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions."""
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/24/army-dont-say-christmas/,2013-12-24 00:00:00,['Todd Starnes'],Army: Don’t say Christmas,"Don’t say Christmas.

That’s the message that was conveyed to a group of soldiers at Camp Shelby by an equal opportunity officer from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, according to a soldier who attended a recent briefing.

“It’s unbelievable that the Army would ban ‘Christmas’ like it’s a bad word,” said Michael Berry, an attorney with the Liberty Institute, a legal firm representing the unidentified soldier.

Two weeks ago, a routine meeting was held at the Mississippi base with various leaders of the 158th Infantry Brigade. During the meeting, they discussed an upcoming Christmas football tournament. The equal opportunity officer immediately objected to the usage of the word “Christmas.”

“Our equal opportunity representative stopped the briefing and told us that we can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me. “Almost the entire room blew up. Everybody was frustrated. The equal opportunity rep told our commander that not everyone celebrates Christmas and we couldn’t say Christmas celebration. It had to be holiday celebration.”

The soldier said there was a brief, but heated discussion about political correctness. At one point, the equal opportunity representative tried to deflect the criticism by pointing out it was the Army’s rules – not hers.

“She said an individual can say Christmas, but as an organization in the Army you can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me.

So what does the Army have to say about the DEOMI officer’s edict?

“There is no policy at the 158th Infantry Brigade, First Army Division East or First Army that forbids using the word ‘Christmas’,” Public Affairs Chief Amanda Glenn told me.

She confirmed that there was a discussion in the meeting about the football tournament. She said it was meant to be a team building event and it had no tie to a specific religious event or holiday celebration.

“The Equal Opportunity advisor simply stated that it would be more appropriate to call it a holiday football event,” she said.

But Attorney Berry tells me that it was made very clear to the soldiers in the room that the name change was not merely a suggestion.

“She stated that the word Christmas had to be replaced with the word holiday,” Berry said.

The soldier who contacted me said it was just another instance of the military trying to curtail public expressions of the Christian faith.

“Between the Air Force and the Army – it’s like they don’t like Christian values, they don’t like the word Christ or Christmas,” the soldier said. “They don’t like you talking about it.”

Berry said it’s a shame that the Army has implemented word police.

“Are they going to have the ‘Merry Christmas’ police going around issuing citations to an soldier who slips and says the word?” he wondered. “They’re treating Christmas like it’s pornography. As a matter of fact, the Army actually treats pornography better than it does Christmas.”

It’s not the first time Equal Opportunity officers have caused trouble at Camp Shelby. Earlier this year, I reported exclusively about a briefing at Camp Shelby that labeled the American Family Association as a domestic hate group.

After my story was published, the Secretary of the Army ordered military leaders to halt all briefings on extremist organizations that labeled Evangelical Christian ministries as domestic hate groups."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet on Friday with members of a privacy oversight watchdog board to try to reassure Americans rattled by revelations of the U.S. government's vast monitoring of phone and Internet data.

Obama is scrambling to show he has credibility on the issue after coming under fire for the scope of surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency, which was revealed in a series of disclosures by former government contractor Edward Snowden.

The president will hold talks with members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a five-person independent agency that has been largely dormant since 2008 and held its first full-fledged meeting on Wednesday after the Senate confirmed David Medine as its chairman last month.

The board's purpose is to review actions the government takes to protect national security, while balancing those steps with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties.

Obama, in an interview with PBS anchor Charlie Rose broadcast on Monday, strongly defended the surveillance program as necessary to protect against the possibility of attacks, but said he wanted to ensure Americans' retained their right to privacy.

His approval rating has dropped in some opinion polls, with the fallout over the surveillance program cited as a reason.

Privacy advocates have argued the surveillance activities infringe on Americans' civil liberties, and say the oversight is insufficient.

The Obama administration and high-profile lawmakers have defended the program as vital national security tools that are vigorously overseen by the administration, Congress and a special court.

'FURTHER QUESTIONS WARRANTED'

Medine told Reuters on Wednesday the board was aiming to hold a public event around July 9 to get legal insight from experts, academics and advocates.

""Based on what we've learned so far, the board believes further questions are warranted,"" said Medine, who previously was a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and served as an associate director at the Federal Trade Commission.

The White House announced steps to try to reveal more information about steps taken by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secretive court that oversees requests for surveillance warrants against suspected foreign threats inside the United States.

At Obama's direction, his homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, asked the director of national intelligence on Thursday to review FISA court opinions and filings relevant to the NSA programs and determine what additional information the government could reveal about them.

The effort ""builds on the administration's ongoing effort to declassify a significant amount of information regarding these programs,"" said a White House statement.

""The president's direction is that as much information as possible be made public while being mindful of the need to protect sources and methods and national security,"" the White House said.

Jerry Brown to immediately begin freeing state inmates and waived state laws to allow early releases, threatening the governor with contempt if he does not comply.

Citing California’s “defiance,” “intransigence” and “deliberate failure” to provide inmates with adequate care in its overcrowded lockups, the judges on Thursday said Brown must shed 9,600 inmates —about 8% of the prison population — by the end of the year.

Unless he finds another way to ease crowding, the governor must expand the credits that inmates can earn for good behavior or participation in rehabilitation programs, the judges said.

“We are willing to defer to their choice for how to comply with our order, not whether to comply with it,” the judges wrote. “Defendants have consistently sought to frustrate every attempt by this court to achieve a resolution to the overcrowding problem.”

If Sacramento does not meet the inmate cap on time, the judges said, it will have to release prisoners from a list of “low risk” offenders the court has told the administration to prepare.

Brown had already taken steps to appeal the court-imposed cap to the U.S. Supreme Court, and he vowed to fight the latest ruling as well.

“The state will seek an immediate stay of this unprecedented order to release almost 10,000 inmates by the end of this year,” he said in a statement.

He had immediate backing from the California Police Chiefs Assn. The court order shows “a complete disregard for the safety of communities across California,” said the group’s president, Covina Police Chief Kim Raney.

“Pressing for 9,000 more inmates on the streets,” Raney said, shows “an activist court more concerned with prisoners than the safety of the communities.”

But a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it did not expect to have to contend with a flood of ex-convicts to watch over.

“It is never a positive step when prisoners have to be released,” said spokesman Steve Whitmore, “but the Sheriff’s Department is prepared for this eventuality.”

Brown has until July 13 to file his full appeal with the high court, the same body that two years ago upheld findings that California prison conditions violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

Lawyers for inmates, meanwhile, said Brown has few options but to let some prisoners go.

“At this point, the governor is an inch away from contempt,” said Don Specter, lead attorney for the Prison Law Office, which in 2001 filed one of two lawsuits on which the judges based their order. “He must make every effort to comply immediately.”

In May, Brown told the court under protest that he could further trim the prison population by continuing to use firefighting camps and privately owned facilities to house state inmates, and by leasing space in Los Angeles and Alameda county jails. In that plan, increasing the time off that inmates may earn for good behavior would have had little impact.

Thursday’s order requires, absent other solutions, that the state give minimum-custody inmates two days off for every one served without trouble and to apply those credits retroactively. Such a step could spur the release of as many as 5,385 prisoners by the end of December.

A separate lawsuit, dating to 1990, alleges unconstitutionally cruel treatment of mentally ill inmates. That the courts are still trying, after two decades, to fix prison conditions was not lost on the three-judge panel that oversees prison crowding, U.S. District Judges Lawrence Karlton and Thelton Henderson and U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt.

Their order accuses the state of “a series of contumacious actions” and challenges Brown’s sincerity about obeying their orders. They noted that the governor lifted an emergency proclamation that allowed inmates to be transferred to prisons in other states, for example.

Requests from prison lawyers that the administration be held in contempt “have considerable merit,” the judges wrote.

The governor’s reluctance to set prisoners free early has the backing of legislative leaders, including Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). He joked openly on Wednesday about intending to kill any population-reduction plans the courts might order the governor to submit to the Legislature.

Republicans in the Legislature have pushed a plan to resume prison expansion in California.

In April, they urged Brown to restore borrowing authority that would have allowed 13,000 beds to be added. They also asked that he continue to pay to house some prisoners in private facilities in the interim. Brown did not include such provisions in the budget that is now on his desk.

Advertisement

The judges said there could be no delays in compliance with their order for appeals or for amendments to the plan Brown submitted in May.

They rejected state officials’ assertion that “with more time, they could resolve the problem.”

California voters may be more willing than Brown to release inmates to reduce crowding. In a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, they were wary of sacrificing public safety, but at the same time supported steps to reduce crowding.

Sixty-three percent said they favored releasing low-level, nonviolent offenders from prison early.

Editor’s Note: Amanda Reiman is the California policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance and a lecturer in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley.



(CNN) —

Today, April 20, is “420: International Marijuana Day.” Festivals and marches are planned around the world. The number 420 reflects the date, but it also represents the term’s clandestine origin in the 1970s, brought about by laws that still plague cannabis consumers today.

In 1971, a group of high school friends, the “Waldos,” invented 420 as a code word for smoking pot. Referring to 4:20 p.m. after school, the friends from San Rafael, California, would meet to smoke marijuana in their secret spot next to a wall – the origin of their nickname. In the 40 years since, 420 has spread to become an international symbol for using marijuana, and it’s a part of the cannabis consumer’s vocabulary.

Threatened with jail and unemployment, people who use marijuana in most states must hide their activities. In 2011, more than 750,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales in the United States. In 2010, 86% of those charged for possession in New York City were black or Latino. That, even though these groups represent about half the city’s population and use marijuana less than whites.

But, slowly, support for cannabis regulation is growing.

A recent Pew research poll found that 52% of Americans support taxing and regulating marijuana, a historic high. It isn’t that more people are using marijuana – those rates have remained stable – it’s that more people feel they can come out of the closet about their support for marijuana policy reform.

Websites like the Marijuana Majority feature statements from celebrities and politicians in favor of marijuana policy reform, across the political spectrum, from Bill Maher to Pat Robertson. No longer a part of a fringe, those who see a better way to regulate marijuana are casting aside the secret codes and openly declaring support.

The marijuana flag was waving proudly on Election Day, when Colorado and Washington became the first states where voters approved taxing and regulating marijuana for adult use. Two recently introduced pieces of federal legislation would protect medical marijuana states from federal interference and end federal marijuana prohibition.

As can be imagined, the April 20 celebrations across Colorado and Washington, as well as other “marijuana friendly” states like California and Oregon, will be joyful, well attended and burgeoning with cannabis products. It might even feel as if marijuana is already legal – but it isn’t, and, in some states, the need for secret codes is still very much alive.

In Oklahoma, manufacturing hash carries a mandatory two-year prison term but can also mean life in prison. Under Louisiana law, a second pot possession conviction is classified as a felony offense, punishable by up to five years in prison. Three-time offenders face up to 20 years in prison. And in Florida, possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, as well as the cultivation of even a single plant, is a felony offense and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

What this means, despite Colorado and Washington, is that April 20 brings a chance to stop and reflect on the draconian marijuana laws still threatening so many Americans.

In addition to the lives harmed by arrests and incarceration, the economic costs of prohibition are enormous. The war on drugs has cost at least $1 trillion since it was announced in 1971 by President Nixon.

The term 420 began as a secret code. But 40 years later, in some states the need for a code has given way to “cannabis pride” and open celebration. In other places, people will smoke or otherwise consume pot in private parties. And for those in prison and jails and for their loved ones, it will be just another sad day.

Make this April 20, as the numbers of pro-legalization supporters swell, the day to join the Drug Policy Alliance in promoting the legalization of marijuana for all adults and an end to the war on drugs.

In late 2011, they modified the Capitol Access Policy from a two page reservation form to a 25-page document that requires users to agree to all sorts of speech-chilling conditions. When singers ignored their demand to apply for a permit and sign the agreement, the Walker administration ordered its Capitol Police officers to issue hundreds of citations alleging violations of obscure sections of the Wisconsin administrative code. I received 4 of the citations last fall, including one for walking in a circle which they deemed to be disorderly conduct, and another for holding a cloth banner which they claimed was a hazardous material. Nearly all of those citations have been dismissed, and many more will be soon.

When that didn’t work, the Walker Administration declared an emergency, allowing them to temporarily modify the state administrative code and give themselves power to declare the Sing Along an “unlawful assembly.” When the singers continued to gather each day anyway, Walker ordered his palace guard to arrest singers, with handcuffs and everything, and issue them more citations. In the past few weeks they have arrested nearly 200 people, including working journalists covering the story, members of Veterans for Peace, numerous Raging Grannies wearing big hats and colorful aprons, at least two minors, school board members, firefighters, and other peaceful singers.

When news of the arrests spread, it attracted more citizens, swelling the ranks of the singers from a couple dozen to hundreds over the last couple weeks.

Finally, on Monday of this week, Walker’s stressed-out palace guards lost their composure and attacked two young African-American men in the rotunda, one who peacefully sat down when he was told he was being arrested, and that man’s brother, who was observing and taking photographs nearby. The photographer has languished in jail for three days while the Capitol Police have tried to get their paperwork together. I guess it’s tough to fabricate a plausible charge of battery to a police officer when multiple videos show that the defendant did nothing but try to walk away while waving his hands to indicate he was not a participant of the Sing Along:

.

Mr. Terrell is finally scheduled for his arraignment this afternoon.

According to one local source who prefers to go unnamed, the beleaguered Capitol Police chief recently contacted the Dane County Sheriff for advice on what to do. The Sheriff, who trains his staff in non-confrontational community policing techniques and has been moderately critical of the Walker administration, is said to have advised the chief to prepare for multiple federal lawsuits for violating people’s civil rights.

Obviously, nothing is working for the Walker administration in their attempts to kill off the peaceful and legal dissent, so now we see their latest brilliant scheme. They know the singers politely move outside when another event has been scheduled inside the building, so they have convinced their nutty allies to take out permits, denying the space to the Sing Along (and to any other group that might want to use the space.) In an attempt to “trap” the singers for public relations purposes, they don’t announce the event on their website until the day before, or sometimes not at all, hoping to cause confusion and a confrontation when people arrive for the Sing Along. Nice, huh?

Today, the Republican Women of Jefferson County will allegedly play music inside from noon to one. On Labor Day, the “Liberty Singers” are scheduled to perform from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Wow, that's a long time. I guess they'll be doing all their hits.

No problem. We singers will sing outside and have a grand time. If we can do it January in Wisconsin (which we have many times), August and September will be a piece of cake. Isn’t this just pathetic, though? I mean really.

UPDATE: Hey, they actually showed up. (Sometimes these ghost permit-holders don't appear.) Judge for yourself the quality of their singing, but don't be too harsh. Considering the propaganda they've been fed about the Solidarity Sing Along, they were probably nervous that they'd be entering a lion's den. It takes some guts to raise your voice in the people's house, no matter your message. They were pretty stiff, but they had one or two quality voices. My advice? Relax. It takes a few hundred rehearsals in the rotunda to adjust to the acoustics.



UPDATE 2: Mr. Terrell is now out of jail on a signature bond, but apparently has not yet been charged with a crime. The Dane County District Attorney, who has been very skeptical lately about arrests made by the Capitol Police, said he did not have enough time to review the paperwork submitted by Capitol Police. Mr. Terrell will have to appear in court again on September 12th, presumably to find out what it is he's being accused of. It's quite possible the D.A. will just drop the whole thing before then."

Steve King missed the message from party leaders about how supporting an immigration overhaul could help boost the GOP’s standing among Latino voters.

He just isn’t buying it.

“I’m incredulous with the conclusion they drew when the sun came up on the morning of Nov. 7,” the firebrand Iowa congressman said the other day, standing outside the Capitol. “They just said that Mitt Romney would be president-elect on that morning if he just hadn’t said two words: self-deport.”

It was a sparsely attended news conference: Just a handful of hard-line House Republicans protesting the immigration bill a Senate committee was poised to approve.

So it goes these days with the opposition to revamping the immigration system, a movement that has been more muted than six years ago when a similar effort successfully turned back a reform bill.

The opponents this time include a sizable coalition of tea party and conservative leaders, including many local-level talk radio hosts.

NumbersUSA, a group that has long fought to limit immigration, has run radio and television ads in more than a dozen states, seeking to pressure senators to vote against the bill. The organization’s president, Roy Beck, brushes off the idea that opposition has waned, noting that polls suggest Americans have mixed feelings about granting citizenship to immigrants. “It seems lonely — just us and the American people,” he said.

But the opponents face a much different landscape than six years ago. Not only are key Republicans not overtly attacking the proposal, but support appears much more solid among Democrats, who had also played a role in dashing earlier efforts.

Advertisement

The growing influence of the Latino electorate, which spurned Romney to help reelect President Obama, and the defeat of much of Arizona’s strict anti-immigration law in the Supreme Court, “created a lot of running room for Republicans to come to the table,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a center-left think tank in Washington.

Republicans as well as Democrats have become more comfortable with offering legal status to an estimated 11 million people who have entered the U.S. illegally or stayed beyond their visas.

The lawmakers are being nudged along, in part, by the stories being told by young people brought to the United States as children who have become adults without legal status. These young adults, who call themselves “Dreamers,” after the Dream Act, a failed legislative effort that would have offered them a route to citizenship, have given a compelling voice to a once largely unheard immigrant population.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, recalls that a “sort of death march” took hold of the 2007 legislative effort as both sides found reasons to back away.

Advertisement

“I don’t think there are as many shaking Democrats today as there were in 2007,” said Angela Kelley, vice president of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

One other element has weighed heavily on both parties: the White House.

Advertisement

Obama used executive authority last summer to defer deportations of Dreamers who came forward and registered. It was, for many lawmakers, a turning point.

Democrats saw the move as a political win that helped give Obama a 44-percentage-point lead among Latinos over Romney in the election.

Advertisement

Republican leaders have since sought to persuade reluctant colleagues that the time has come for Congress to fix the immigration system, lest Obama take further action on his own — and Democrats seize a permanent advantage among the growing Latino electorate.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has privately pushed a bipartisan group of lawmakers to complete their work on the House’s proposed immigration overhaul. “We’re not going to be stampeded by the White House or stampeded by the president,” he said last week.

Advertisement

King says that there are more Republican lawmakers on his side than the few who stood beside him on that sunny spring day and that he believes more will join to defeat the bill as voters learn about it.

In the NumbersUSA spots, a man’s voice argues that an overhaul will allow too many legal immigrants into the U.S. who would then compete with out-of-work Americans for jobs.

Advertisement

The group has enlisted its 2 million members to corner lawmakers at home. “We’re hoping to shame the senators: ‘You’ve got these long lines of unemployed Americans, and you’re going to pass this sort of bill?’” Beck said.

Like-minded Republican opponents also exist in the Senate, and so far not one beyond the four who helped draft the bill has fully endorsed the overhaul.

Advertisement

King predicted that over time, Republican leaders would join him.

“If they’re not on our side,” he said, “I’d suggest that they are convertibles.”

President Obama hasn’t begun to fix the big problem of Washington dysfunction, but he moved Wednesday to respond to public anger and reposition his sinking administration. He fired the acting IRS commissioner, released a blizzard of e-mails on Benghazi and backed a shield law to protect journalists. It was fancy footwork in public-relations terms but not a reaction to what’s really ailing the federal government.

The crippling problem in Washington these days isn’t any organized conspiracy against conservatives, journalists or anyone else. Rather, it’s a federal establishment that’s increasingly paralyzed because of poor management and political second-guessing.

What should frighten the public is not the federal government’s monstrous power but its impotence.

Firing officials has its place in bringing accountability. What’s really needed, as these latest episodes show, is adult supervision of the bureaucracy. This requires senior officials who are properly sensitive to political issues. But such officials have become so afraid of seeming to meddle that mistakes happen.

Where was the senior manager who should have stopped IRS employees from writing outrageous questionnaires and search queries targeting “Patriots” and “We the People”? Perhaps that person was wading through congressional messages urging IRS investigations of tax-exempt political groups.

The attorney general recused himself because of fear of a perceived conflict of interest. Perhaps lower-level officials were chilled by congressional demands for leak investigations — and insinuations the administration was itself the guilty party.

The principal activity of the federal government these days is investigating itself. No panel is bipartisan and independent enough to escape the charge that it is covering something up. This accusation has been leveled against the review panel on Benghazi headed by Tom Pickering, former undersecretary of state, and Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Good grief, if these two are part of a conspiracy, I’m moving to Moscow.

If you unpack the various scandals swirling around Washington this week, you find a common theme of bad decisions by government officials, compounded by finger-pointing and second-guessing from Congress. Here are some moments in this chain of error.

● The IRS investigations of tea party-related conservative groups that began in March 2010 came a couple of months after the Supreme Court in Citizens United opened the way for corporate contributions to political causes. Garance Franke-Ruta, in her blog for the Atlantic, has identified congressional pressure on the IRS to investigate conservative tax-exempt groups. The unit that was supposed to make such determinations (located in Cincinnati in part to keep it away from political pressure) made an intolerable mistake in searching for right-wing groups using political terms.

But the dragnet was hardly a secret: News reports appeared in 2012 about tea party complaints of harassment, at a time when some congressional Democrats were demanding that the IRS crack down harder. A grand jury can help unravel whether the IRS’s outrageous decisions amounted to criminal behavior.

● The Justice Department launched two special investigations of leaks in June after intense Republican criticism of intelligence disclosures. The probes focused on the sources for stories discussing the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran and a spy inside al-Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate.

Even a journalist can understand why officials get upset when such secrets are blown. But the GOP’s larger motivation was its suspicion (apparently wrong) that senior Obama administration officials had organized the leaks. The administration’s own leak obsession (fueled by fears of congressional criticism) led Justice Department officials to subpoena two months of records for more than 20 phones at the AP.

Why did Justice approve such a broad seizure when its own guidelines urge narrow use of reporters’ records? Perhaps it was an especially egregious leak, jeopardizing a British agent in place and infuriating the United States’ closest ally. We don’t know, because the administration has never properly explained its campaign against leaks — fearing political backlash.

● Finally, Benghazi, the scandal that keeps on giving: This one began in the fog of war, so it’s best to be cautious about assigning responsibility. But the administration did try from the beginning to spin the story to preserve its campaign theme that Obama had won the war on terror, and the GOP has been spinning it ever since, to the point that the blame game is beginning to chill operations in North Africa.

Another generation would have said: Let’s get on with it. We say, let’s have another investigation.

Davis gained nationwide notoriety after she filibustered for 12 hours in an attempt to block the passage of an omnibus anti-abortion bill known as SB5, which was eventually signed into law by Governor Rick Perry on July 18.

Her celebratory profile in Vogue has real significance. Not because the writer reveals that Davis’ filibustering outfit consisted of pink Mizuno running shoes and a sky-blue Escada day coat. Not because the caption for the article’s featured picture reads Wendy Davis in a Carolina Herrera dress and Reed Krakoff pumps. Not because the opening paragraph of the piece references the Super Bowl, HBO’s Girls, and 7 for All Mankind jeans as elements of her life.

Actually, these mentions are precisely why the profile is significant. Each one a different brush stroke creating a portrait of the left’s latest heroine fighting for all women in the face of a fabricated war, in which the villains are simply those who simply do not support federally subsidized contraception or unrestricted abortion on demand. And what better venue in which to view the portrait than the iconic pop culture platform that is Vogue.

The left understand and embraces a very simple concept: culture is upstream from politics. It is a message delivery system that reaches millions and millions of registered voters and those who soon will be. The message can be overtly ideological but what’s often more effective is the celebration of an ideology through other means…simply by presenting the owner of that ideology in a way that is accessible:

A crowd of thousands has assembled for the Fourth of July parade in Arlington. Davis waves to them from the back of a teal-blue vintage Thunderbird draped with bunting. She’s comfortable in the high-80s heat (she goes running in it most mornings), wearing an American-flag scarf from Urban Outfitters, a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts, and red Toms slip-ons. “Thank you!” can be heard. Also: “Our state loves you!” Occasionally a hiss or a boo filters in, but mostly there are cries of “We love you, Wendy” and “Wendy for governor!”

So as the millions of Vogue readers (87% of which are female) turn its pages in search of unattainable freakish beauty, they will be treated to a profile of Wendy Davis and whether they know it or not, the notion of a war on them is reinforced. And what’s more, the villain becomes clear simply because the hero has been hoisted…in a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts and red Toms slip-ons.

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) offered to the immigration bill. It would require border security before America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants are granted amnesty.

Reid filed a motion to “table” the amendment, a move that he used to quickly push for an up-or-down vote. A vote in favor of tabling the amendment would kill it. A vote against tabling the amendment would allow it to move through for debate. Essentially, a vote for Reid’s motion is a vote against securing the border before amnesty. Likewise, a vote against Reid’s motion is a vote for securing the border before granting amnesty.

The Senate Reference guide describes a motion to table as: “The motion is used to dispose quickly of questions the Senate does not wish to consider further.”

Reid’s motion to table the amendment passed 57-43, with Gang of Eight Republican Sens. John McCain (R-AZ). Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) voting with Reid. Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor voted against Reid in favor of border security before amnesty, as did Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH). Ayotte had previously indicated support for the Gang of Eight bill.

Reid’s decision to derail an open process on the immigration bill comes during the first week of debate on what will likely drag on until close to the Fourth of July recess. Losing Grassley’s support up front on process is dangerous for Reid, too, as Grassley is a key Republican leader on issues that involve immigration.

On the floor on Thursday, Grassley argued that the “so-called open and fair process” the Democrats and the “Gang of Eight” Republicans have promised “is a farce.”

“This is not the right way to start off on a very important bill,” Grassley said."

Read Part 2 here.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is one of the reddest and most culturally conservative states in America. The statehouse would seem to be about as fertile ground for reining in the drug war and curbing police abuse as the briny marshes and salt flats just outside the capital. But if anyone can bring Utah's conservatives on board with police reform, it's probably Connor Boyack, a clean-cut Mormon with a Republican background who is also pushing the state to nullify the Affordable Care Act.

Boyack, 31, is the founder and president of the Libertas Institute, a state think tank with a libertarian bent. ""Utah politics is basically a debate between conservatives and libertarian-minded conservatives,"" he says. ""We help conservatives hone their free-market ideas, but we also want to persuade them to be more deferential to civil liberties. That I think is our niche.""

Boyack wrote about public policy for several years on his personal blog, built up a readership, and in August 2010 was hired to lead the Utah chapter of the Tenth Amendment Center, an advocacy group that pushes returning federal power to the states. The boyish-looking student of political philosophy also worked on the 2010 campaign of Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. His credentials on the right are sound.

But he felt that more could be done on the state level, and in December 2011, he founded Libertas.

""One thing I noticed at the Tenth Amendment Center is that while liberty-minded Utah legislators could join arms to push back the federal government, they weren't nearly as skeptical of the government here in Utah,"" Boyack says. ""But if the government violates your rights, you haven't been any less violated if it came from state or local government instead of the federal government. The thing we try to stress at Libertas is consistency.""

He ran the organization part-time for about a year, but by January he had attracted enough funding that he was able to commit to it fully.

""What makes Connor unique -- and most effective -- is that he's willing to take on issues that the mainstream political right is generally afraid to touch,"" says Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center. ""They might even agree with him on the issues, but don't want to upset the status quo, so they do and say nothing. Connor, on the other hand, recognizes that it takes risk to get things done. And he certainly takes risks.""

Boyack gradually became interested in police reform as he was exposed to police abuse stories on social media. ""You can't really be active on Twitter or Facebook without seeing these stories, really on a daily basis,"" he says. ""And it isn't just the misconduct, it's that bad police officers are so rarely held accountable.""

After law enforcement officials raided the Ogden, Utah, home of Matthew David Stewart in response to a tip that he was growing marijuana plants in his basement, leading to a gun battle that left one officer dead and five others wounded, Boyack watched closely to see whether that type of scenario would play out.

""That case really catalyzed my focus. I watched at first from the sidelines -- followed the story closely. I'm not an activist or a protester. I tend to come at things from an education or legislative angle,"" he says.

""As it unfolded the way that it did, I was really disappointed. Once again, the police weren't being held accountable. The media narrative was that Matthew was this evil cop-killer. My concern was with the underlying policy, from a legislative standpoint. The police should not have come in to Stewart's house the way they did, all over a few plants. The law just shouldn't allow that to happen.""

As Stewart's supporters -- led by members of his family, as well as progressive activist Jesse Fruhwirth -- protested at Ogden city council meetings, Boyack took a broader view.

""I think what the protesters were doing was important,"" he says. ""But my thinking was that this wasn't just happening in Ogden. Police militarization is happening everywhere. So we were more interested in looking at the state as a whole.""

Boyack began reaching out to legislators, police organizations and activists to craft a bill that would restrict the use of SWAT teams to emergency scenarios, ones in which lives are at risk.

The policy he's pushing is relatively straightforward. Currently, police in Utah may forcibly enter any home, at any time, so long as they've obtained a search warrant. Under Boyack's proposal, officers would be permitted to break into a home only when there is an imminent threat of a violent crime.

The police would no longer be permitted to use battering rams or ""dynamic entry"" -- the term used to describe forcible entry, the use of flash grenades, and other paramilitary tactics -- to serve drug warrants. In Utah and across the country, drug investigations comprise the overwhelming majority of instances in which such tactics are used.

Last August, the Standard-Examiner ran an editorial in support of Boyack's cause. ""Certainly, the use of a battering rams to combat minor offenses is something that should not occur,"" the paper wrote. ""These raids, as conducted now, are too dangerous.""

""We're interested in saving lives,"" Boyack says. ""And we're as interested in saving the lives behind the gun as those in front of it.""

Boyack uses that line often. It hints at the realpolitik that may help explain why his message is finding a receptive audience. A cop died during the Stewart raid, and several more nearly joined him. Particularly in conservative Utah, saving the lives of police officers is a more effective sales pitch than saving the lives of suspected drug offenders.

""I don't think there's any question about it. If this law had been in place in 2011, both Officer [Jared] Francom and Matthew Stewart would still be alive,"" Boyack says. Stewart committed suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial.

Boyack says many of the lawmakers he's talked to about his bill have been supportive. Indeed, several told The Huffington Post that they see the need for police reform, though they would not say so for attribution.

""The response has been surprisingly favorable,"" Boyack says. ""I think most lawmakers want to wait to see the final language, though. The bill should be collaborative, rather than combative. Few legislators will support a bill that's seen as anti-cop, but they're generally supportive of the higher idea.""

Ideally, Boyack would like to get a conservative lawmaker who otherwise supports the drug war to sponsor the bill.

""I think drugs should be decriminalized, but this bill isn't about legalization,"" he says. ""We can still keep drugs illegal, but enforce those laws in a way that doesn't put lives at risk. So I think it would be helpful to get a sponsor for the bill who has drug war bona fides, but understands that sending police officers to break into homes in the middle of the night creates unnecessary danger.""

But he worries that many politicians may be reluctant to publicly embrace the bill, even if they think it's the right thing to do, because they fear retribution.

""A few years ago, we tried to outlaw DUI checkpoints, which I think are a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and really are more about issuing citations and raising revenue for police departments than keeping the roads safe,"" he says. ""Law enforcement groups came out aggressively against the bill. But they also went after the bill's sponsor, [state Rep.] David Butterfield, when he ran for reelection.""

That bill passed the Utah House, but died in the Senate in February 2012. State police groups organized to support Butterfield's primary opponent in the 2012 election, and Butterfield lost.

""They got their scalp,"" Boyack says. ""I understand the concern about micromanaging police departments. I do. But everything police officers do is under authority given them by the legislature, through the people. It's the legislature's job to set the terms under which the laws will be enforced, and its the legislature's job to make sure our rights are protected, not just our safety.""

Boyack is the bridge-builder in Utah's burgeoning police reform movement. His task is to forge ties between the state's legislators and other policymakers, and activists and the families of those killed by police.

""By sticking his neck out and taking on a golden calf, he's able to bridge the divide with traditional political opponents,"" says The Tenth Amendment Center's Boldin.

He's also the pragmatist. For the moment, the bill he and his organization have proposed addresses only forced-entry police raids. It would have had no effect on the police shootings, beatings, and other allegations of misconduct around Utah that weren't the result of drug raids.

Some activists want to go further. They would like to see police get more training in interacting with the mentally ill, and they have called for the creation of civilian review boards with the teeth to issue subpoenas and force the termination of bad cops. Some, including Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, think police need more instruction in conflict resolution, and that training and agency policy put too little emphasis on de-escalation, and too much on how and when to use force.

But Boyack says that for now, focusing on forced-entry is a more realistic goal.

""Our main goal here is to enact substantive reform. We don't just want a token bill that does more in name than in substance,"" Boyack says. ""But we also need a bill that will pass, and that will be reasonable. So for now, I think it makes sense to focus on the one area that will do the most good, and that in my opinion will save the most lives.""

Bill provision that would require firms to post jobs for Americans is targeted

Technology firms have spent millions on lobbying on immigration

Judiciary Committee set to start working on bill

WASHINGTON – Technology firms, exercising new political clout on Capitol Hill, are lobbying against a measure in the leading Senate immigration bill that would make it harder for them to recruit workers from abroad without first taking steps to hire Americans for highly skilled jobs in programming, engineering and other fields.

The measure, part of a sweeping compromise bill drafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators, would require job openings to be posted on a new government website for 30 days and order companies to first extend job offers to ""equally or better qualified"" U.S. workers. It would give the U.S. Labor Department the power to review and challenge those hiring decisions.

Proponents say the measures are needed to curb abuses by companies who they say use the visa program to hire cheaper labor. Technology companies say the proposed rules would cripple their ability to hire the best employees from a global workforce and represent inappropriate government intrusion in internal hiring decisions.

The fight over hiring practices is part of the massive lobbying campaign underway on the immigration measure and will offer a fresh test of the technology industry's growing influence in Washington. The companies involved in the computer and Internet sectors spent nearly $140 million in lobbying last year -- more than twice the $69 million the industry poured into influencing Washington a decade earlier, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political spending.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin work on the bill Thursday.

The hiring battle centers on the program that grants H-1B visas, which go mostly to college-educated foreigners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Technology companies say they face a chronic shortage of qualified workers in these fields. The United States sets an annual limit of 85,000 visas for these companies, and the competition for them is intense: This year, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services opened up the application process April 1, and the cap was reached within a week.

Industry groups have made big gains in the Senate's immigration proposal. The bill, for instance, Would increase the H-1B cap to 205,000 annually. However, tech officials warn the new recruiting requirements could drive companies to move their skilled jobs overseas, rather than comply. A commonly cited example: Microsoft's decision to open a software center in Vancouver, British Columbia, after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation in 2007 that would have significantly increased the number of H-1B visas.

Under the bill, ""employers are going to have an arbitrary government standard imposed on every hiring decision,"" said Robert Hoffman, the top lobbyist for the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group. The proposed rule, he said, ignores subjective factors that influence hiring. ""A perfect example: How does one define whether or not someone has the personality to fit into a corporate culture?"" he said.

""We are not trying to change any of the fundamental policy goals that they are trying to achieve"" in the Senate, Hoffman said. ""We are just trying to tweak it, so that these goals and other goals, like retaining the best and brightest and growing in the United States, so that those types of goals are advanced as well.""

Ron Hira, an associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has criticized the visa program, saying it allows firms to hire ""cheap indentured labor.""

""The technology industry is asking the government to come in and intervene in the normal functioning of the U.S. labor market, specifically on their behalf,"" Hira said.

Bruce Morrison, a former Connecticut congressman who lobbies on behalf of a group that represents American engineers, said the organization will object to any effort to ""dilute worker protections"" as the measure moves through the Senate. ""The arguments from the companies is that there aren't any Americans to take these jobs,"" he said, ""so there shouldn't be any problem.""

The biggest users of H-1B visas are not brand-name companies, but little-known staffing companies that provide foreign workers on a temporary basis to U.S. companies — including banks, health insurance companies and big retailers. Cognizant, a New Jersey-based company that employs 27,000 people in the USA, is the top user of the temporary visas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records show. Most of its workers come from India.

In addition, three India-based outsourcing companies rank among the top five recipients of H-1Bs, according to the federal data.

Americans would ""be shocked to know that most of the H-1B visas … are going to outsourcing companies,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., one of eight senators who drafted the immigration bill, said during a recent hearing. ""They're going to these firms, largely in India, who are finding workers, engineers, who will work at low wages in the U.S.""

Durbin is a driving force behind the hiring requirements in the Senate proposal.

The measure would make business harder for staffing companies dependent on foreign workers. It would impose higher fees on firms that rely on overseas employees for more than 30% of their workforce. Starting in 2016, the bill would bar granting any new temporary visas for foreign workers at companies with more than half their workers on the visas. Both measures apply to companies that employ more than 50 people.

Cognizant spokesman John Procter said he did not have a breakdown on the percentage of the company's workers in the USA on H-1B visas. He said the bill imposes an ""arbitrary, detrimental restriction on the number of skilled immigrants.""

""It would really change the way America does business,"" he said. ""The company is very focused on educating legislators and making sure this language doesn't make its way into any final outcome.""

Cognizant hired its first federal lobbyist in 2010 andby last year, it had spent nearly $1 million on federal lobbying, congressional records show. Its team includes Democratic power broker Heather Podesta, who did not return a telephone call. Other companies also have stepped up their political activity.

Last month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix's Reed Hastings, Google's Eric Schmidt and other technology executives teamed up to underwrite an advocacy group to promote their views on immigration. Two of its subsidiaries began a seven-figure advertising campaign to shore up voter support for key senators in the immigration debate.

The tech industry ""has clearly come of age,"" said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation. ""In the last decade, we've seen this tremendous recognition from Silicon Valley of the need to play in the power circles — to both protect their bottom line and to alter the political scene to their advantage."""

The school%27s president said state officials visited his campus to see whether enough %27dark ones%27 were enrolled

Several Democrats found the comment offensive

Arnn said the college will accept students without regard to race

The president of Michigan's Hillsdale College took heat from several lawmakers during a hearing today in which he said state officials visited his campus to determine whether enough ""dark ones"" were enrolled.

Larry Arnn, the president of the private college, made the comments during a subcommittee hearing on Michigan's adoption of the Common Core State Standards. Arnn, who spoke in opposition of the standards, prefaced his comments by describing an experience when he began as president in the early 2000s in which state officials criticized his college for, as he said, not having enough ""dark"" students.

When it was time for lawmakers on the committee to question Arnn, several Democrats on the committee said they found his comments offensive.

""You're the president of a college. I would expect better out of you,"" said Rep. David Knezek, D-Dearborn Heights.

Arnn tried to explain that his school's charter says the college will accept students without regard to race. But he was cut off.

Later, subcommittee chair Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township, asked Arnn whether he wanted to clarify the comments.

He said the state of Michigan - several weeks before he became president in 2000 - sent a group of people to his campus with clipboards to ""look at the colors of peope's faces and write down what they saw.""

Arnn said his college doesn't keep those kinds of records.

""What were they looking for besides dark ones?"" Arnn said.

The conservative Hillsdale College, founded in 1844, is famous for rejecting all federal and state funding to help guarantee its independence. A 2012 Detroit Free Press story said it was the first U.S. college to prohibit in its charter discrimination by race, religion or gender.

Arnn, the 12th president of the college, began his tenure there in 2000. One of his previous jobs was as president of the Claremont Institute in California. While there, he was the founding chairman of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which pushed for the prohibition of racial preferences in state hiring, contracting and admissions.

Arnn is a 1974 graduate of Arkansas State University, where he received a bachelor's degree. He received a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Claremont Graduate School.

Michigan is one of 45 states that have adopted the common core standards, which for the first time provide common expectations of what students should learn from one state to the next in math and English arts. But state lawmakers have barred the Michigan Department of Education from spending state money on the implementation of the standards — and a test that will be given based on the standards — until the subcommittee can hold hearings on whether the state should move forward with the standards."

President Obama delivered the commencement address at the Atlanta school

Obama called on graduates of the historically black college to be role models

Says African Americans must have empathy for other minority groups%27 struggles

President Obama on Sunday told the graduating class at Morehouse College, the country's pre-eminent historically black college, there is ""no time for excuses"" for this generation of African-American men and that it was time for their generation to step up professionally and in their personal lives.





Obama, the country's first African-American president, chose a particularly poignant moment to deliver the commencement address at the Atlanta college that boasts civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., filmmaker Spike Lee and Atlanta's first African-American mayor, Maynard Jackson, among its alumni.

Obama's visit comes nearly 50 years after King led the March on Washington, and 150 years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

The president connected his own path to the White House to the work of King and other African-American leaders of that generation. But Obama also conceded that at times as a young man he wrongly blamed his own failings ""as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down.""

""We've got no time for excuses — not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they haven't,"" Obama told the graduating class and their families who sat through intermittent rain and thunder. ""It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with a billion young people from China and India and Brazil entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything you haven't earned.""

Obama spoke in very personal terms to the 500 young men as he urged them to not only become leaders in their community, but also good fathers and good husbands. Obama, who was raised by a single mother and grandparents, lamented the absence of his father in his life and urged the graduates to make family their top priority.

Obama told the Morehouse men they are also obliged to set an example for other black men.

""Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man,"" Obama said. ""Be the best husband to your wife, or boyfriend to your partner, or father to your children that you can be. Because nothing is more important.""

In the weeks ahead of the commencement, a spat between the college administration and alumni over the role a Philadelphia pastor would play during graduation weekend threatened to cast a shadow on the president's historic visit.

Morehouse President John Silvanus Wilson and a group of alumni sparred after Wilson invited alumnus Kevin Johnson to deliver the baccalaureate sermon only to later to diminish his role.

Wilson, a former adviser in the Obama administration, told Johnson he was changing the ceremony to a multispeaker format after Johnson wrote an op-ed in a Philadelphia newspaper criticizing the president for appointing too few African Americans to senior Cabinet positions.

A dozen prominent alumni spoke out against the decision, and Johnson initially refused to take part in the baccalaureate under a multispeaker format.

But last week, Wilson and Johnson came to a resolution and Johnson delivered the baccalaureate sermon, while two recent alumni were given lesser speaking roles.

The college was also shaken by news earlier this month that four Morehouse students were charged with sexual assault in which two women from nearby Spelman College were the alleged victims.

In his speech, Obama also connected the discrimination that African Americans have faced with some of the struggles of minority groups — including gays and lesbians fighting for the right to marriage, Hispanic Americans battling anti-immigrant bias and Muslims who face suspicion because of their faith.

Having a personal understanding of discrimination, Obama said, this generation of African Americans is uniquely equipped to be leaders for the country and world on these issues.

""If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy — the understanding of what it's like to walk in somebody else's shoes,"" Obama said. ""It should give you an ability to connect. It should give you a sense of what it means to overcome barriers."""

Washington (CNN) – Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, has been a member of Congress for almost two decades.

Yet when he is walking down the street in Washington, D.C., at night and white women walk toward him, he says ""I cross the street"" to avoid making them uncomfortable.



Cummings says he rarely speaks about race or what life is like as a black man, but says President Barack Obama's heartfelt remarks Friday afternoon made him more comfortable to do so.

""I think it's important that he speak out and he brings a very unique perspective, because is the president and he has been extremely fortunate compared to most African-Americans, and yet still he can speak to the prejudices that most of us still face,"" Cummings told CNN in a telephone interview.

Cummings lives in what calls the ""inner city"" of Baltimore, Maryland.

For emphasis, he says ""when I say inner, I mean inner.""

The 10 term congressman says he loves to go shopping with his wife, because he likes to watch her try on dresses. But he won't do it outside his district where people know him because ""I don't like the idea of people following me around.”

""People usually have the security guard following me, or questions with the overabundant, 'can I help you?' They think you're going to do something wrong. We've seen it over and over again since childhood,"" said Cummings.

He joked that it's a bit better recently since, as the ranking member of the GOP-led House Oversight Committee, which is investigating IRS misconduct, Benghazi and more, he is on T.V. often and is recognized outside his district.

Still, he too talked about ""feeling the tension"" when he is in the elevator with a white woman.

""The tension... it’s hard to describe,"" he said.

Some African-American leaders and activists have expressed frustration with Obama for not using his position to stir a national discussion about race. Cummings was not one of those people.

""It's not that simple. People go crazy,"" said Cummings.

""I see the way this country reacts to the littlest thing he says about race,"" he said.

Plus, Cummings believes that before Obama was elected to his second and final term, it would have been ""counterproductive to talk about these things because everything was in the prism of politics.""

""Now that he has the freedom to not worry about re-election, I think he has a better opportunity,"" said Cummings.

A day earlier, Cummings' race played out in an awkward moment during a tension-filled IRS hearing.

When admonishing Cummings, Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican Oversight Committee chairman, referred to Cummings as ""a little boy whose hand’s caught in the cookie jar.""

Later, Issa apologized to his African-American colleague for using the term “boy.”

""That is something I grew up with, it is intended to be about a small child, and in no way the use of boy or little boy to be anything else,"" Issa said.

Cummings thanked Issa, saying he appreciated his words."

Perhaps you missed it when they haunted every move of Martin Luther King because he too wanted to live in a world at peace, and even worse, a world where people had civil rights.



Possibly you overlooked the government's harassment of the Quakers and sundry other peace groups. Could be you weren't paying attention when our government, in a nationally coordinated crackdown, brutally attacked and violently crushed the Occupy movement.







That our government thinks of OWS as terrorists tells us an awful lot about our government. Nothing too flattering either. And no, it's nothing new, which does not even begin to excuse it. If anything, it is all the more reason to be alarmed. Do not fall victim to the Stockholm Syndrome. Our government is, and has long been, hell on the good guys.



I shake my head in wonder at all those compliant souls who nod their heads in approval as the middle class is killed off to suit the mad desires of the 1% and our last remaining liberties, such as they are, are sacrificed to our unreasoning fear of the boogeymen of our own creation.



The Irrationality of Giving Up This Much Liberty to Fight Terror



Of course we should dedicate significant resources and effort to stopping terrorism.

But consider some hard facts. In 2001, the year when America suffered an unprecedented terrorist attack -- by far the biggest in its history -- roughly 3,000 people died from terrorism in the U.S. Let's put that in context. That same year in the United States:

71,372 died of diabetes

29,573 were killed by guns

13,290 were killed in drunk driving accidents That's what things looked like at the all time peak for deaths by terrorism. Now let's take a longer view. We'll choose an interval that still includes the biggest terrorist attack in American history: 1999 to 2010. Again, terrorists killed roughly 3,000 people in the United States. And in that interval,

Roughly 360,000 were killed by guns (Actually, the figure the CDC gives is 364,483 -- in other words, by rounding, I just elided more gun deaths than there were total terrorism deaths). Roughly 150,000 were killed in drunk driving accidents. The Atlantic

Nothing could be more dangerous to democracy or what we used to call freedom than a massive program of domestic spying. Those who yawn do so either out of unreasonable fear, ignorance of the history of fascistic and repressive regimes or a general lack of awareness...to put it kindly. They may need to read (or re-read) 1984, A Brave New World and the US Constitution.

I'm not saying that government is inherently bad and we don't need one. I'm no libertarian. I'm saying our particular government, dominated and owned as it is by the 1%, is bad to the bone, lies through its teeth and supports all the wrong people doing all the wrong things - and that we desperately need a new one. We need a government that does the right things for the American people, the earth and all the other people of the world. We need a government that respects our rights and our privacy. We need to live in a country where dissent is possible and the government doesn't inspire the rest of the world to want to kill us – which is the only thing that will ever keep us safe from terrorism (though, as pointed out above, statistically not that much of a problem). Manufacturing terrorists all over the world by taking anything we want by force and ruthlessly fucking over anybody who gets in our way hasn't worked out so well. Blaming the Security State on those who object is a pretty slick and cynical trick though.

Dissent, which has been called the highest form of patriotism, may well be on its last legs in this country. It is now impossible to organize any kind of opposition, no matter how innocent or righteous, without government spooks breathing down your neck. Surveillance quashes dissent...all dissent. Just remember who the government thinks is a threat: peace activists, dissidents, kids who dare object to the raw deal being crammed down their throats

A lot of people want desperately to believe that our government is a bunch of really good guys simply doing their best to keep us safe from the terrorists. It's understandable that people want to believe that but pretty fucking outrageous that anyone actually does.

Here are a few clues:

Gulf of Tonkin

Watergate

‎Iran-Contra

Iraq

Gitmo

Abu Ghraib

SCOTUS 2000

George W. Bush

Total Information Awareness

The USA Patriot Act



""People willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both."" arguably attributable to Ben Franklin, but a fine and pertinent quotation regardless of origin

Why does this loathsome crazy bullshit keep happening? Because almost nothing has really changed in this country since Vietnam. People have been lulled into a deep sleep by the most sophisticated and nefarious propaganda program to ever exist on the face of the earth, all so the fat cats can gorge at the expense of everybody else. Many of us simply refuse to wake up and smell the neo-fascism.

With respect to Snowden, and all the idiots screaming, ""he broke the law, he broke the law,"" let me remind you of all the high-ranking members of our fucked up society who broke many more and much more serious laws who have not paid a dime for their crimes. You can see their shining faces on the national TV. Breaking the law is only wrong in this country if you are one of the little people, and it's especially wrong if you are trying to expose the grievous wrongs committed by our government. We'd all be wise to remember that the only person in prison for the official US policy of torturing helpless prisoners to death is the guy who blew the whistle on it.

I support anyone who exposes gross misconduct or wrong doing on the part of our government or military, and consider such people to be genuine patriots and heroes. That means Ellsberg, Manning, Assange and Snowden. I am grateful to them all.

Referring to Assange, Daniel Ellsberg recently said this: “I’ve waited forty years for a release of documents on this scale.”

Those brave enough to dissent, object and resist the madness that dominates our society deserve the full support of anyone who still believes in liberty, truth or justice.

You either support the right to expose wrongdoing, or you support the wrongdoing.

The bone-headed bullshit and obsequious acquiescence of the law 'n order crowd never ceases to amaze me. Line up for showers you dumbasses.

One of the first promises he made as the newly elected president was that he was “not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws.” This was even reiterated formally in the so-called Ogden memo of 2009, in which the Department of Justice instructed U.S. attorneys that federal enforcement should apply only to medical marijuana operations that were not in clear compliance with state law.

Obama has since “clarified” those promises, but it still makes no sense that Matthew R. Davies, a business school graduate who set out in 2009 to create a medical marijuana dispensary that would be in full compliance with California law, is facing up to 15 years in prison — with a mandatory five-year sentence.

Advertisement

This is just one more puzzling incident in the history of a president who not only made these promises but has also admitted to heavy recreational use of marijuana himself in his youth. As a second-term president, with little to lose, why is he continuing his odd campaign on a state-approved industry that employs people, pays taxes and distributes a safe and clinically useful product?

SERIES: Behind the marijuana industry

Lost in this fray is the fact that marijuana is medicine. My son is autistic and has an autoimmune gastrointestinal problem for which, at my suggestion, his doctor prescribed him Marinol (a synthetic THC drug). When that proved ineffective, the doctor agreed to prescribe medical cannabis, which is legal in Rhode Island where we were living and, unlike in some states, such as California, is approved for pediatric use. At the time, our son was eating his clothes. Whether as an autistic behavior or because of gastric pain, we weren’t sure; but every day, unless we had him shirtless, he would consume the entire front of his cotton shirt, and sometimes his jacket, on the bus to and from school.

Medical marijuana cured him. But it wasn’t as easy as running out and buying him a joint. When we first considered cannabis, my husband and I made a decision not to procure it illegally. That was complicated because although medical marijuana was legal in Rhode Island at the time, dispensaries were not, and we needed information about what kind of marijuana might help our son.

Advertisement

There are hundreds of strains of cannabis, with varying clinical properties — anxiety relief, sleep promotion, analgesia, anti-nausea — and the ways they are processed also affect the way they work. I realize that some people use dispensaries to purchase cannabis for recreational use, but I can attest that the cannabis experts at the out-of-state dispensaries we consulted were focused on the medical properties of the marijuana they sold. They shared their considerable knowledge to help us find the particular strain that cured our son’s pica (the medical name for eating nonfood items). I keep a corduroy jacket with a half-nibbled sleeve as a reminder of that day.

Our doctor, who started out as a healthy skeptic, was so impressed and moved by our son’s experience that he asked if I’d speak with another parent in a similar situation. This woman was desperate for help. Her son was even more destructive and aggressive than ours, and she had several children (we have one) and just didn’t have the time and energy for the kind of trial-and-error experimentation we had done. If she’d had access to a good dispensary, things could have been different for her.

Without access, a medical marijuana license is a piece of paper. Even with the attentive grower we found in Rhode Island, we ran into problems, including a pest infestation and a robbery. Then came an even more devastating obstacle: After a year or so, he informed us he was giving up growing because he needed to find work. If there had been a dispensary in Rhode Island, he could have sold his excess there. But because he wanted to follow the law — which meant patients could only pay his actual costs — he was in an economic bind.

For a medical marijuana patient, a well-run, reliable dispensary like Matthew Davies’ should be a basic patient right. There is scientific consensus that cannabis has useful clinical benefits, and unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, it has almost no toxicity.

Advertisement

An article in the Atlantic estimates that prosecuting Davies’ dispensary is going to run more than a million dollars, not to mention putting a man with two small children and no criminal record in prison for five to 15 years. The federal government has charged Davies with cultivating marijuana. It contends he “sought to make large profits,” which, if true, might have put him out of compliance with California law. He has insisted he violated no state laws. Putting that issue aside, it is clear that he was operating transparently and attempting to stay within the law. Is he really the biggest threat federal law enforcers can find to prosecute?

When large banks illegally game the system and ruin people’s lives with subprime mortgages, instead of prosecution, our government bails them out and allows the CEOs huge bonuses. And yet a person who creates a business that provides safe, reliable medicine that patients rely on may have his life upended for following state law. According to press accounts, Davies’ business is transparent, efficient and provides professional service — all things worthy of praise. It has the additional social benefits of both employing people and helping law enforcement by keeping illicit marijuana off the streets. If a well-run, meticulously inventoried, state-law-compliant place is a target for federal action, no dispensary is safe.

According to Marijuana Policy Project estimates, there are more than 1 million medical marijuana patients in the U.S. An attack on state-approved dispensaries is an attack on patients. We would consider it inhumane to take away anti-nausea or pain medicine from a cancer patient. But when the administration raids dispensaries and destroys plants, that is exactly what it ias doing.

So what is the lesson here? Smoke marijuana illegally, and you can become president. Try to provide a safe, consistent product that keeps the trade out of domestic and foreign drug cartels and brings in tax revenue, and face 15 years jail time.

The question in the case, Bowman v. Monsanto Company, No. 11-796, was whether patent rights to seeds and other things that can replicate themselves extend beyond the first generation. The justices appeared alert to the consequences of their eventual ruling not only for Monsanto’s very lucrative soybean patents but also for modern agriculture generally and for areas as varied as vaccines, cell lines and software.

A lawyer for Monsanto, Seth P. Waxman, a former United States solicitor general, was allowed to talk uninterrupted for long stretches, which is usually a sign of impending victory.

Stephen Newman, R-Lynchburg, is at right. Virginia's Senate passed legislation Tuesday that requires women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasound exams. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)

Despite the public lashing Virginia GOP lawmakers took in 2012 over their support for an infamous mandatory ultrasound bill, some of them are kicking off the 2013 legislative session with a slew of new controversial bills that restrict women's access to abortion and birth control.

State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett (R-Lynchburg) has introduced a bill that would prevent Medicaid from subsidizing abortion services for low-income women in cases ""in which a physician certifies ... that the fetus would be born with a gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency."" Women who currently receive Medicaid in Virginia have abortion coverage in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities, or when the life of the mother is in danger.

Four other abortion- and contraception-related bills have been introduced by Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), the author of the fetal personhood bill that state GOP leadership rejected in November. Three of Marshall's bills would allow insurance providers the option to deny women contraception coverage, and a fourth would impose a criminal ban on doctors who knowingly perform sex-selective abortions.

Marshall's abortion ban, reproductive rights advocates argue, will intimidate doctors and violate doctor-patient confidentiality without solving the problem of gender-related abortions. It could also encourage physicians to racially profile women who are seeking abortions, since the practice of sex-selective abortions is most common in South Asian countries that have a cultural preference for boys.

""This is a sexist and racist bill,"" said Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a conference call with reporters. ""The true purpose under the guise of the concern for gender discrimination is to continue to strip away access to safe legal abortion services.""

It will already likely be harder for Virginia women to access abortions in 2013 than in previous years. Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) quietly approved a controversial set of abortion clinic regulations last week that could shut down many of the clinics in the state. The regulations impose strict building standards that were intended for new hospitals, such as specific hallway widths and hands-free sinks, on first-trimester abortion clinics.

Republican leaders in Virginia have indicated that they will take a softer stance on abortion in 2013, and Marshall told The Huffington Post in November that his GOP colleagues pressure him ""seven days a week, 52 weeks a year"" to drop his anti-abortion legislative efforts. But those efforts are lost on a principled social conservative, he said.

""You're talking about human beings being killed,"" he said. ""What higher considerations do I put out there?"""

Labor unions and agricultural industry leaders had been stuck for three weeks on how to legally bring foreign labor into the United States to pick crops and tend livestock at competitive wages. The issue, which is important to California and other farming states, became a major stumbling block in bipartisan efforts to craft a comprehensive immigration bill.

The most two contentious issues were solved, according to officials familiar with the closed-door talks, although they did not release details.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

“We have a wage and cap agreement,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told reporters.

Feinstein is not among the eight senators drafting the overall bill, but she has worked to help design a program to provide legal status to the estimated 500,000 foreign farmworkers in the country.

The eight senators overseeing the bill met Wednesday night and signed off on the outline, leaving staffers to work out final details. Senators were optimistic Thursday that a deal was close.

“All that’s left is the drafting,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

If passed, the historic bill would expand legal immigration, ramp up border security, tighten sanctions against employers who hire people in the U.S. unlawfully, and open a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants who either entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas.

Border security has been key to the negotiations, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that stopping 90% of those trying to sneak across the border, as the draft bill requires, wouldn’t be difficult to achieve. He said six of the nine sectors on the Arizona border with Mexico already had 90% effective control.

“With technology, it should not be that hard” to seal the rest, McCain said.

Reform efforts got a boost from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is influential with Republican lawmakers. The chamber urged Congress to “take advantage of the unprecedented momentum” and pass an immigration bill this year.

Remember reading that England had arrested a guy for anti-Muslim Twitter postings in the aftermath of the Woolrich slaughter? And remember thinking, “Well, this is America, that can’t happen here”?

Oh yes it can. Obama’s Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee wants you to know that if you say something untoward about Muslims, the Federal government may imprison you.

Killian and Moore will provide input on how civil rights can be violated by those who post inflammatory documents targeted at Muslims on social media….Killian said Internet postings that violate civil rights are subject to federal jurisdiction.

The posting he offers as a “for instance” is an egregious one. And yet this country has long protected, absolutely, egregious speech, such as hardcore pornography, for a simple reason: Either you are at liberty to say what you will or you are not. If you are constantly double-thinking every word you might say, for fear of being prosecuted, you are self-censoring, in anticipation of a possible prosecution by the government.

Rather than having a system in which people were constantly worried about imprisonment for speech, our country has evolved a simple bright-line code: Speech of all kinds, with a few exceptions that can be counted on three fingers, is absolutely protected.

Remember, the importance of this bright-line, no-exceptions rule of free speech was preached to us, even when some of us might not have liked it so much, as when hardcore pornography was afforded absolute protection under the First Amendment. In the case of hardcore pornography, it was argued — successfully — that having each artist weigh the possibility of an obscenity prosecution was too much of a burden on his free speech rights, and would have, unavoidably, a chilling effect on speech.

That was the rule then, and that was the rationale.

But now comes the Obama Administration to tell you that Yes, you just might be imprisoned for something you say online, so you’d better Watch What You Say.

Remember when Ari Fleischer said that, without suggesting any kind of legal penalties? Remember how the media freaked out?

But now comes the US Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee explicitly telling you that you may be imprisoned if a political appointee decides your political speech has crossed a line.

Somehow, I don’t think Tim Robbins will be portentously howling us that a “chill wind” is blowing across our rights of free expression this week."

The 68-30 vote overturned a procedural objection that Republicans tried to bring against the bill.

The vote came as senators worked Wednesday to remove the remaining hurdles ahead of final passage as early as Thursday.

The vote was an indication the legislation commands the backing of well over the 60 senators needed to pass the measure and send it to the House, where an uncertain future awaits.

The White House-backed measure spends tens of billions on border security while establishing a 13-year path to citizenship for 11 million people already here illegally.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

The Senate is poised to push landmark immigration legislation across a few final hurdles ahead of passage as early as Thursday of the bill opening the door to U.S. citizenship for millions.

The legislation cleared an early procedural hurdle this week with room to spare, and more test votes were due Wednesday. The White House-backed bill would pour billions into border security and offer a path to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants now in the United States illegally.

""A permanent, commonsense solution to our dysfunctional system is really in sight,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""It is my hope that our colleagues in the House will follow the Senate's lead and work to pass bipartisan reform and do it now.""

Opponents weren't convinced.

""It continues to promote false promises that the border would be truly secure,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.

Prospects were anything but clear in the GOP-controlled House, where many conservatives oppose citizenship or even legalization for people in this country illegally. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, reiterated Wednesday that he has no plans to hold a vote on the Senate-passed immigration bill.

Story continues

""We are not going to take up the Senate bill,"" the speaker told fellow Republicans in a meeting Wednesday morning, according to Rep. John Fleming, R-La.

The House Judiciary Committee was to vote Wednesday on legislation requiring employers to verify their workers' legal status. It's the third in a series of single-issue immigration bills the committee has voted on as it takes a piecemeal approach to overhauling the nation's immigration system, in contrast with the Senate's comprehensive bill.

In the Senate, after the addition of $38 billion in provisions strengthening border security, doubling the size of the border patrol, and completing hundreds of miles of fencing, the legislation looked likely to command support from around 14 Republicans on final passage. That's more than enough to ensure the 60-vote margin needed for passage, as all 52 Democrats and the two independents who usually vote with them look likely to stick together.

As time drew short to cut any last-minute deals before final action on the bill, there was still some hope of negotiating a few final amendments that could bring even more Republicans on board.

Sen. Rob. Portman, R-Ohio, was pushing an amendment to strengthen an electronic employment verification program made mandatory in the bill. ""I can't vote for (the bill) without it,"" Portman said.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., sought changes to a new agriculture workers program that he said makes it too easy for farm workers to get permanent U.S. residency.

But the measures sought by Portman and Chambliss are being opposed by some immigrant advocacy groups, and some Senate Democrats believe the bill has enough Republican support as is without pursuing more changes."

On Tuesday, using his own life as an example of the American Dream, Schwarzenegger argued for immigration reform during a panel discussion at his USC institute.

Also Tuesday, Shriver announced she would return to NBC as a “special anchor” focusing on women’s issues.

Which raises the question: Whose reinvention is working out better?

Since leaving office in 2011 and being forced to admit he had fathered a child with his family’s longtime housekeeper, Schwarzenegger, 65, has tried to recreate himself as the cartoonish movie action hero that brought him worldwide fame.

It’s been a bumpy ride.

He’s had occasional movie cameos and a big belly flop in 2012’s “The Last Stand.” Plans for a Stan Lee collaboration on a Saturday-morning cartoon-style character called “The Governator” fell through after revelations about his domestic treachery. And despite a truly extraordinary life, his memoir, which was billed as a “tell-all,” was panned by The Times as “almost completely devoid of self-examination.”

Maybe he’ll have better luck with a sequel to “Conan the Barbarian,” scheduled for release next year.

Producer Frederik Malmberg put Schwarzenegger in perspective in comments to Deadline Hollywood last year, apparently referring to the movie: “It’s that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king, warrior, soldier and mercenary, and who has bedded more women than anyone, nearing the last cycle of his life.”

Schwarzenegger has also struggled to stay relevant on the political stage. He bought himself the shiny new Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy at USC, which has a very nice website and seems devoted to holding conferences and panel discussions that will keep his name in the news. Prof. Schwarzenegger — don’t laugh, he holds an academic appointment now — is good for the school’s fundraising, USC President C.L. Max Nikias told The Times last year.

Shriver, 57, whose work as the state’s first lady revolved around various women’s causes and family issues, such as Alzheimer’s research and the Special Olympics, has taken on the persona of struggling midlife everywoman.

It’s not entirely apt, given her status as a member of one of America’s royal families, her fame and her wealth.

But that lousy husband of hers has given her a new kind of cred. She knows from broken families and broken hearts. And despite the whiff of elitism that attaches itself to any Kennedy, she has been publicly trying to figure out this unexpected new chapter of her life in veiled but honest ways.

Her website is devoted to issues women care about, and her blog is relentlessly upbeat, even as she drops hints of her pain. One poignant photo shows a silver necklace with a ripped heart, its jagged edges stitched together with blood-red cord.

I tried in vain to find the word “Schwarzenegger” anywhere on her website. When she writes about her experience as California’s first lady, it’s as if she was elected to the job without having been required to be married to the man who was, in fact, the governor.

I don’t blame her for erasing him wherever possible. Was there a woman whose heart didn’t break for Shriver and her four children when The Times reported that their marriage had collapsed after Shriver discovered what her husband had done, in their own home?

Advertisement

What I do blame her for, though, is vouching for her husband on the eve of the 2003 election after six women told The Times he’d sexually groped them.

Many believe her assuring words swayed the race in his favor: “I’ve known this man for 26 years,” Shriver said. “I’ve been married to him for 17. He’s an extraordinary father, a remarkable husband, a terrific human being. He has the character to be governor, the temperament to be governor and he is a leader for all of you.”

Well, what would you expect a loyal wife to do? That, for sure.

But when it all came crashing down, she should have taken some responsibility as the enabler who foisted him off on the public as a man of character. She owed California an apology.

Advertisement

Still, when all is said and done, I’m on Team Maria. I wish her luck in her new job. I hope she finds some good stories to tell.

As for Schwarzenegger, meh.

When he was governor, I used to see him riding his bicycle at the Santa Monica beach. Surprised and delighted passersby would yell greetings.

The last time I saw him, a few months after the scandal, a group of middle-aged women out for their morning power walk noticed him whizzing by on his bike, security at his side.

“That’s Arnold,” one said. “Ugh.”

USA TODAY

Cruz%2C born in Calgary to an American mother%2C said he will renounce Canadian citizenship

Dallas newspaper had reported Texas senator had dual citizenship

Cruz released birth certificate amid speculation he could run for president in 2016

WASHINGTON -- The questions about Sen. Ted Cruz's citizenship may just be beginning.

Political analysts said Tuesday that Cruz may think he's tamping down a controversy by renouncing his previously unknown Canadian citizenship, but the situation may prove to be nettlesome — just like questions about President Obama's citizenship.

Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, calls it the ""nuisance factor.""

""If we learned anything from the allegations surrounding President Obama's citizenship, it's this: Facts may be stubborn things, but people's beliefs can be a lot more stubborn than the facts,"" Scala said. ""Many people believe what they want to believe, regardless of the facts, especially when it's about a public figure they do not like in the first place.""

Cruz, a Tea Party favorite still in his first year in the Senate, said Monday night he will renounce his Canadian citizenship, following a Dallas Morning News report that the Texas senator holds dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship.

Cruz has been making speeches to the GOP faithful in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, appearances that have helped land him on early lists of potential 2016 presidential candidates. Cruz released his birth certificate to the Dallas newspaper amid concerns about his eligibility to be president.

The document showed Cruz was born in 1970 in Calgary, Canada. His mother, Eleanor, was born in Delaware and was a U.S. citizen and his father, Rafael, was born in Cuba. Cruz had said in interviews prior to his Senate election that he is a U.S. citizen because his mother was born in the USA.

""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said in a statement released Monday.

""Now The Dallas Morning News says that I may technically have dual citizenship,"" Cruz continued. ""Assuming that is true, then sure, I will renounce any Canadian citizenship. Nothing against Canada, but I'm an American by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American.""

Cruz will have to explain in writing why he doesn't want to be Canadian, fill out a four-page form and get clearance from Canada's spy agency, according to Reuters. The process could take up to eight months.

The U.S. Constitution says only a ""natural born"" citizen can be president. It has been the general rule that anyone born overseas to an American parent is eligible for the White House. Arizona Sen. John McCain, born in the Panama Canal Zone, had legal experts research his eligibility for president because questions came up.

Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, predicts the citizenship issue will linger for Cruz.

""I am certain that the issue of dual citizenship, which was never an issue with Obama, will percolate through the GOP herd of potential presidential contenders because politics is hardball at best and a contact sport at worst,"" Schmidt said. ""Any controversy such as birth and citizenship will be material for other Republicans aspiring to the White House to make hay with.""

Obama had insisted throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he was born in Hawaii, but doubts about his citizenship and eligibility to be president bounced around on the Internet fueled by critics known as ""birthers."" Donald Trump persisted about Obama's birth certificate in the last presidential campaign.

Bowing to what he called ""silliness"" and distractions from ""sideshows and carnival barkers,"" Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011 that showed — as he had said all along — that he was born in Hawaii in 1961. That hasn't stopped some critics. Last year, for example, Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio had volunteer investigators looking into the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate.

James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said the stories about Cruz's dual citizenship could be perceived as the first big bump in the road for the new senator, who has been hailed by some conservatives for his willingness to challenge his own Republican Party.

The fact that Cruz said he would renounce his Canadian citizenship on the same day as the story first broke is right out of the ""Campaigns 101"" book, Henson said.

""Like a lot of things like this, they have a longer half life in part because of social media and the Internet. Things never quite go away,"" Henson said. ""I fully expected he would renounce his Canadian citizenship. They (Cruz and his team) did it very quickly in the same news cycle so as not to step on his message they want in Texas about repealing Obamacare.""

Cruz has not said whether he's interested in a White House bid, but that hasn't stopped the speculation. In a Granite State Poll released earlier this month, Cruz was in the single digits and finished well behind New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in a survey of likely New Hampshire GOP voters about the Republican presidential nomination. Cruz won a straw poll last month conducted at the Western Conservative Summit, sponsored by Colorado Christian University.

Blacks seem to have crossed that line.”

Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to express that view during the argument in February in the voting rights case, Shelby County v. Holder, No. 12-96. “Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements,” he said, “it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.”

Gay men and lesbians have yet to achieve formal legal equality. They are not protected against job discrimination in much of the nation, may not marry their same-sex partners in most of it and do not have their marriages recognized by the federal government in any of it. The fact that they are asking for equal treatment may help their cause in the cases challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which for purposes of federal benefits defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and Proposition 8, the California voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage there.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested in March that ordinary politics would sort things out. “As far as I can tell,” he told a lawyer challenging the federal marriage law in United States v. Windsor, No. 12-307, “political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case.”

In the three months since that argument, three more states have adopted same-sex marriage, raising the total to 12, along with the District of Columbia.

Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University, said the two different conceptions of equal protection are animated by different concerns. One is skeptical of government classifications based on race and similar characteristics, whatever their goals. The other tries to make sure that historically disfavored groups are not subordinated."

Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying ""homicidal maniacs"" will skirt the system no matter what.

NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement, but not new laws, is the answer to gun violence.

He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for ""universal"" background checks, particularly at gun shows.

""When it comes to background checks, let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,"" LaPierre said.

But Giffords' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law ""make a mockery"" of the system -- echoing Obama's recent proposal, he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.

LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject ""law-abiding people"" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after ""bad guys.""

""Mr. LaPierre that's the point,"" Durbin said. ""The criminals won't get to purchase the guns because there'll be a background check. We'll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it's basic.""

Raising his voice, LaPierre said: ""Senator, I think you missed the point!"" Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then banged the gavel and called for order.

The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.

LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. ""Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works,"" LaPierre testified. ""Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years.""

He continued: ""Proposing more gun control laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it's not a serious solution for reducing crime.""

The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords, who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011, made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.

""We must do something,"" Giffords said, speaking slowly but clearly. ""It will be hard, but the time is now. ... You must act.""

Giffords urged lawmakers to ""be bold, be courageous."" She later met with President Obama at the White House.

""Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying,"" the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed, and 12 were wounded, in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.

Kelly, speaking after his wife, called for a ""careful and civil conversation"" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns, but are ""anti-gun violence.""

He said a ""matrix"" of failures contributes to the country's gun violence problem, including mental illness and poverty, but also gun laws. He said the complexity is ""not an excuse for inaction."" Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America ""into places of carnage and gross human loss.""

Kelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family, leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.

LaPierre, though, argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent, compared to previous administrations, which he says means violent felons, gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.

""That is completely and totally unacceptable,"" said LaPierre, who suggested fixing the country's ""broken"" mental-health system become part of the solution to gun violence -- including making patient records part of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

The hearing, titled ""What Should America Do about Gun Violence,"" takes place roughly seven weeks after a lone gunman with psychological problems used an assault weapon to kill 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school, prompting renewed calls for more gun control.

The NRA, with 4.5 million active members, remains the most powerful gun-rights advocacy group in the country.

Obama is calling for a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, along with more extensive background checks.

LaPierre said the group is willing to work with Congress and the president in curbing gun violence, but ""law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families.""

Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said Wednesday that the current background check system has already stopped nearly 2 million ""prohibited purchases"" between 1994 and 2009.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has already introduced legislation taking similar steps to Obama's proposals.

The California Democrat on Tuesday said she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are ""skewed against us."" Feinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee.

Despite the momentum gun control advocates have gained since the massacre in Newtown, Conn, it will be difficult for them to prevail in Congress this year because of the popularity of guns in many states -- including several represented by Democratic senators -- and the formidable muscle of the NRA on Capitol Hill, lawmakers and others say.

Among other obstacles, the Republican-run House has shown little immediate interest in making dramatic changes in the laws.

At the Senate hearing, Leahy, D-Vt., said lawmakers were not trying to take away Americans' guns.

""They're not at risk. ... what is at risk are lives,"" he said.

The committee's top Republican, Sen. Charles Grassley, said he welcomed the ""renewed discussion"" on gun violence.

But he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns,"" Grassley said.

Breitbart News has debunked that cinematic meme, but Reagan’s commitment to racial equality began long before he even considered a life in politics.

John D. Morris, Director of Development at Eureka College’s Ronald W. Reagan Society, suspects those who malign Reagan today are fearful of his legacy and impact on the next generation of conservatives. And the facts simply don’t bear out their version of reality.

Morris describes a yearbook displayed on Eureka’s campus featuring a photograph of “Dutch” along with classmate Willie Sue Smith, a black woman Reagan would consider a dear friend.

“I have spoken with both of her children who said that Ronald Reagan and their mother corresponded for years. She had passed notes in class between Dutch and his girlfriend, Mugs Cleaver,” Morris says. “Reagan saw Willie Sue as a classmate and friend and, more than anything, another child of God.”

Another college pal, football standout William Franklin Burghardt, became one of Reagan’s lifelong chums.

Morris says one Reagan anecdote illustrates where the actor turned politician learned the value of equality. Jack Reagan, the future president’s father, one day witnessed a store clerk rudely deny a black man’s son from using the bathroom.

“The attendant next turned to Jack Reagan to ask for help. ‘Your services are no longer required by us,’ Jack replied. Taking his children outside, he told Moon and Dutch that no human beings should ever receive such treatment,” Morris says, adding the president would often share that meaningful moment with others.

Morris says it’s a shame the film industry is reluctant to tell the true nature of Reagan the man.

“Hollywood will someday see the virtues of making films based on the inspiring stories of the most consequential member of its own talent pool in history,” he says."

By Joan Biskupic

WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - When the U.S. Supreme Court talks about religion, all hell breaks loose.

A dispute over an upstate New York town's prayer before council meetings produced an unusually testy oral-argument session on Wednesday that recalled the decades of difficulty Supreme Court justices have had drawing the line between church and state.

Court decisions involving freedom of religion tend to be closely decided with many separate opinions rather than clear-cut majority statements. The case of Town of Greece v. Galloway appears to be headed that way.

In the case brought by two Greece residents who objected to the overwhelmingly Christian prayers at meetings, the justices appeared likely to allow legislative prayer to continue but not ready to offer new guidance for when government might have gone too far in favoring, for example, Christianity over other faiths. The more liberal of the nine justices appeared sympathetic to the challenge while the conservatives who control the court's majority seemed ready to back the town - but not with a single obvious rationale.

At one point during the hourlong session, Justice Stephen Breyer referred to the challenge of setting constitutional rules so people of different religions live ""harmoniously together."" Not soon after, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that, ""Every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better.""

Overall, the justices' remarks were more pessimistic than positive regarding a possible consensus. They voiced frustration with the lawyers who appeared before them and with each other as well.

When Breyer asked the town's lawyer if officials could take more steps to invite non-Christians and even people who are not religious to offer the equivalent of a prayer, Justice Antonin Scalia mockingly asked what sort of invocation ""somebody who is not religious"" could offer. As lawyer Thomas Hungar, representing the town of Greece, began to suggest a chant ""of guidance and wisdom,"" Breyer interjected with some annoyance toward Scalia, ""Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later.""

ENDURING DILEMMAS

Such have been the tensions over one of America's most enduring dilemmas. The U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion while requiring the separation of church and state. Neither dictate is absolute and the court has struggled with religious protections, often leaving lower courts with confusing standards, particularly on the mandate at issue on Wednesday - that government ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""

Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a deciding vote on religion during her 1981-2006 tenure, attended the session in the ornate courtroom. She sat, expressionless, in a front-row spectator seat.

The religious makeup of the bench has changed since O'Connor's time. The court has historically been dominated by Protestants but it is now has six Catholic and three Jewish justices. The religious character of the justices, however, is unlikely to control their views. Among the Catholics, for example, are Scalia, a conservative who has voted repeatedly for prayer in public settings, and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who seemed more supportive of those challenging the prayer policy in Greece, a suburb of Rochester.

The high court heard the case after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that Greece officials relied on overwhelmingly Christian clergy, appearing to endorse their beliefs. The court noted that prayers at the town's legislative sessions regularly mentioned Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The appeals court differentiated the Greece dispute from a 1983 Supreme Court case allowing non-sectarian prayers in the Nebraska legislature. In that decision, Marsh v. Chambers, the justices relied on the historic nature of legislative prayer.

In key Supreme Court cases since 1983, the justices have focused on whether government might be endorsing a particular religion or coercing people to participate in prayer. In a 1989 case, they rejected a Pennsylvania county's courthouse crèche display and in 1992 they struck down a Rhode Island public school district's prayer at graduations.

In Greece's appeal, Hungar urged the justices to consider America's history of legislative prayer dating to its 18th century founding. The Obama administration filed a brief in support of the town.

""KEEPING GOVERNMENT NEUTRAL""

Douglas Laycock, a lawyer representing town resident Susan Galloway and other challengers to the Greece prayer sessions, countered that the town's practice ""coerces"" people who attend meetings to join Christian invocations. Laycock said he was not arguing against non-denominational, inclusive prayer.

""Give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus,"" Justice Samuel Alito insisted. As Laycock hesitated, Alito kept repeating, ""Give me an example. ... Give me an example.""

Chief Justice John Roberts also was skeptical of Laycock's rationale. ""What exactly is coercive in this environment?"" he asked. ""Having to sit and listen to the prayer?""

To sharp questioning by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has succeeded O'Connor as a pivotal vote among the nine, Laycock insisted the court could write a rule that would ensure legislative prayers were not exclusively Christian but that did not require excessive screening of prayers by officials.

Laycock disagreed with Kagan's remark that the court seems to be making the law worse rather than better.

""I don't think that's true,"" Laycock said. ""There are people who distort your decisions. There are people who misunderstand your decisions honestly ... But keeping government neutral as between religions has not been a controversial proposition in this court."" (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Howard Goller, Amy Stevens and Bill Trott)"

Pope Benedict sent his encouragement via his Twitter account

Event wants to appeal to a younger crowd through use of social media

Marchers are coming from across the USA

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to fill the National Mall on Friday to protest the 40-year-old landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the first trimester.

Buses are shuttling in anti-abortion protesters from all over the country for the annual March for Life. Organizers predict many of them will be young people rallied by church groups and social media.

Pope Benedict sent them his encouragement by way his personal Twitter account,@pontifex : ""I join all those marching for life from afar, and pray that political leaders will protect the unborn and promote a culture of life,"" he posted early Friday morning.

""We are expecting record-breaking crowds — 80% under the age of 20,"" said Jeanne Monahan, president of the March for Life Education & Defense Fund. ""Mostly teenagers come and we get a lot of high school groups.""

This is Monahan's first year leading the march. She predicts the event will be different from past years.

""It's a pretty big event to pull off — the planning for next year's march started last week,"" Monahan said.

Nellie Gray, who had led the anti-abortion demonstrators every year since the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, died in August at age 88.

""We want to appeal to the younger crowd, so we made big changes,"" Monahan said. ""We shortened the program from longer than two hours to an hour, picked speakers who are more engaging and we are deeply engaging social media.""

According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 37% of Americans do not know that Roe v. Wade dealt with the issue of abortion. Among the age group targeted by the March for Life, the number is higher — 57% of adults under age 30 don't know what the case is about.

Americans remain divided on abortion, according to a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. Significantly more Americans — 53% to 29% — want the decision kept in place rather than overturned. Another 18% have no opinion, the highest level of uncertainty Gallup has recorded on the issue.

Sydney Goldstein, 16, of Charlotte, is heading to the march with about 30 students from her government class at Charlotte Christian School.

""I am going to speak for the babies that are dying every day that don't have a voice to speak for themselves,"" Goldstein said. ""This is one way to voice my opinion because I cannot vote.""

Friday's rally will begin before noon on the Mall and around 1:15 p.m. the march will begin and follow its traditional route up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Speakers include Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn.

Benedictine College has sent seven full buses — nearly 400 people — for a 30-hour ride from Atchison, Kan., to Washington, D.C., for the march.

This is the largest group to go in the school's 28 years of involvement, spokesman Humam AlMukhtar said."

I think that attitude has changed. It’s an improvement. We continue to work on more bills. We want to address all three areas of immigration reform, enforcement first, legal immigration reform to help grow our economy, and finding the appropriate legal status for those who are not lawfully here. . .

I think it is unreasonable to think that we’re going to deport millions of people from the country. So having a legal status for them, where they can live here and work here and own a business here and pay their taxes here and travel to and from their home country, wherever else, would be a much better situation for our economy, for our country, than the current status of people not being accounted for."

I usually went at night, because it was less busy and more convenient.

One evening I went to the Safeway to pick up a few items. I grabbed a cart before entering the store, and started my journey through the many aisles. Somewhere near the tea aisle, I noticed two people having what appeared to be a rather one-sided conversation. The only thing I heard as I walked by them was the woman, who looked to be on the verge of tears, saying something like ""...but my husband is black."" Puzzled, I continued to make my way down the aisle.

My memory of that night is not perfect, but here's what I do remember...I remember the aforementioned man approaching me, and as he did, saying something like ""here's another white girl..."" He had one or both earphones in his ears, and spoke fairly loudly. He walked right up next to me and accused me of being a government informer (supposedly for some sort of white, conspiratorial government). I asked him to move out of the way, as he was between me and the items I was looking at on the shelf. He got louder and said that I must not like black people, as well as a few other things I don't quite remember. I told him that he was harassing me, and asked him to stop. He responded that he wasn't harassing me but confronting me, and my assumed racism. At this point I was pretty freaked out - the man was bigger than me and kept getting in my face - so I took my cart and walked quickly to another section of the store. The man threatened to kick me, and, according to witnesses, attempted to do so as I walked away from him. I approached a Safeway employee and asked for assistance in dealing with the harassment, but before either of us could do anything the man was chased out of the store by another customer.

I was pretty shaken up, and stopped briefly to talk with anther employee (store manager, I think) and the other woman who had been harassed on my way to the checkout lane. She was in tears, and I believe, had called the police shortly before the man had been chased out of the store. I said I was fine when asked, but was wary as I went to check out and put my groceries in the car (I was very glad that I had driven to the store that day instead of walking).

I believe the man who harassed me in the store had mental health issues, but it did not make what happened any less scary in the moment. Up to that point I had never been called out or stereotyped by anyone (at least not to my face) because of my race. It was shocking and humiliating, particularly for someone who has tried hard to work to understand and dismantle the unconscious racism and classism that I know exists in myself. I am not perfect, but I am trying to make the world a better place by confronting my own problematic beliefs, thoughts, and actions, and by talking about them with others.

It is not my intent to pretend that I know what it's like to be profiled, avoided, or treated in a negative way because of my race or class on a regular basis - I will never know what that feels like. I recognize that I have a certain amount of privilege as a middle class white person that others do not, and that this impacts how others think about and treat me. I do believe that this experience provided a tiny glimpse into what it's like to have someone judge and treat an individual a certain way because of the color of their skin. And it was scary, and uncomfortable, and I don't wish it on anyone.

This week, we once again publicly witnessed this type of thinking on a larger scale, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Some members of the public and media went crazy after the bombings, jumping to conclusions about the identity of those responsible (Muslim, Arab, person of color), claiming folks were suspects when they weren't and attacking innocent Muslims and sites associated with Islam, among other things. It was infuriating to watch it all happen, and somewhat ironic when the suspects were identified and did not fit the profile of the imaginary bomber.

I encourage folks to read this piece about white privilege and the Boston Marathon bombings, as it does a better job than I can describing how I feel about the whole thing."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","Non-residents have no right to a state’s records, court rules","WASHINGTON — Americans do not have a right to obtain public records from states other than their own, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, dealing a setback to businesses and researchers who gather data across the nation.

The unanimous decision upheld laws in Virginia and a handful of other states that release some public records only to their own citizens.

“This is disappointing. We have a national information economy now, and all sorts of activities depend on data from all 50 states,” said Washington attorney Deepak Gupta, who represented two men who had challenged the “citizens only” provision of Virginia’s public records law.

Despite the ruling, Gupta said the trend has been for states to open their public records on an equal basis. Only two other states — Arkansas and Tennessee — decline to do so, he said. “It’s not realistic for states to wall off their public information,” he said.

Roger Hurlbert, a Northern California man who runs a business obtaining hard-to-find real estate records, sued to challenge Virginia’s law. He was joined by Mark McBurney, a Rhode Island man who wanted to know why the Virginia agency that enforces payments of child support had been slow in processing a payment from his former wife, who lived in Virginia.

They sued after their requests for documents were denied. They contended that Virginia’s preferential treatment for its own citizens violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution, which says: “The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.” They were joined by news media organizations and ethics watchdog groups that argued for free and easy access to public records.

In rejecting the claim, the high court said the Constitution does not require states to treat out-of-state residents as though they were state residents. The justices noted that states typically charge higher fees for out-of-staters who seek a license to hunt or fish or to enroll in a state university.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens refer to “fundamental” rights, not “incidental” matters like obtaining local real estate assessments. Virginia’s law is not unconstitutional “simply because it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens of other states from making a profit by trading on information obtained in state records,” he said in McBurney vs. Young.

Alito added that public records laws have a special purpose. They permit citizens to hold their government “accountable.” They also require state agencies to “foot the bill” for gathering and releasing requested records, he said. Since a state’s taxpayers are paying the bill, it is reasonable to limit the benefit to them as well, he said.

In reaction, Hurlbert said he would “abandon” doing business in Virginia. “I’ve been doing this for 40 years, and I’ve gotten around to most of the states,” he said. “I gather records — property taxes, assessments and the like — that others have difficulty getting.”

Along the way, he said, he has filed more than 50 lawsuits, most of them in state courts, seeking to open public records. “It’s gotten much better over the years,” he said. “But there are still a few restrictive laws out there.”

This year the FCC is launching a wide-ranging study that will require news agencies to inform the government on what stories they cover.

What may follow that is a push for a new “fairness doctrine” as the FCC makes recommendations intended to force the media to air stories which the government wants reported.

The 2012 study was carried out by University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism–a school operated by the same group that employed a pre-President Barack Obama and domestic terrorist William Ayers in Chicago in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The study, as part of the Federal Communication Commission’s 2012 Report to Congress about the barriers to participation in the communications industry (also known as the Section 257 Report), was intended to “identify market entry barriers and whether such barriers impact the public’s critical information needs.” A second goal was to help the FCC make “proposals to eliminate statutory barriers to market entry by those entities, consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity.” The FCC intended to begin the process of laying down in the regulations definitions of what constitutes “critical information” and what doesn’t.

In 2013, the second leg of that project was announced as a “Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs.”

A study, titled “Research Design for the Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,” was released in April. The study was produced by a company called Social Solutions International, Inc.. SSI has been awarded hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts.

One of the goals of this new project is to conduct a “media census” on just what is being broadcast in the electronic media and published in magazines, newspapers, and on the Internet.

“Researchers will analyze the content of broadcasts, newspaper articles, and website postings to determine the extent to which eight defined ‘Critical Information Needs’ (CINs) are being covered,” reported Eve Reed.

In a May 24 announcement of the project, Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said that the FCC has a “duty” to find out what news is being broadcast.

The FCC has a duty to make sure that the industries it regulates serve the needs of the American public no matter where they live or what financial resources they have. The research design we announce today is an important next step in understanding what those needs are, how Americans obtain the information critical to their daily lives in a dynamic technological environment, and what barriers exist in our media ecologies to providing and accessing this information.

The FCC also issued the following comment: “The commission needs to conduct or commission research that illuminates the diversity of views available to local communities, the diversity of sources in local markets and the diversity of critical information needs of the American public, including women and minorities.”

Some of the eight CINs are telling as to what sort of criteria the FCC is using to quantify what is supposed to be useful information for a community. Two of the categories being assessed are whether or not a media outlet is properly informing customers about “the environment” and what “economic opportunity” news is reported–the latter as opposed to plain economics or news on the economy.

To determine if the media is fulfilling these CINs, media outlets will be required to fill out a very long survey to report to the government about what stories they are airing or publishing in the several categories being assessed.

Among other criteria, the study will ascertain: what “news philosophy” is pursued by the media outlet (i.e. it’s ideological direction); how the media outlet defines “critical information”; see if the media includes “community input” into its stories; and review the “decision making process” to find out how the media outlet determines what stories to cover.

Critics of this study, however, worry that with this government-enforced, intrusive survey into what stories the media is covering and how they are covering them, some freedoms will be lost.

Chuck Sweeny, for instance, wrapped up his recent report on the FCC’s study saying, “When ‘Big Brother is watching’ over reporters’ and editors’ shoulders, freedom of the press will be gone, and our liberty with it.”

For her part, Eve Reed also raised concerns. “But the questions that the researchers will be asking suggest a renewed interest on the part of the FCC in the inner workings of station and newspaper editorial decision-making, which may itself raise concerns,” she said.

All this raises worries that the FCC is looking for a backdoor way of re-instituting the Fairness Doctrine–the repeal of which gave us radio programs like the Rush Limbaugh show and paved the way for Fox News–in a new effort to control what goes on the air and who can own what media."

But there is little about war that is either about choice or fairness.

Here’s a big question President Obama ought to face head on: Is he willing to draft ""Julia"" on an equal basis with John and if not, why not? (""Julia"" was the Obama campaign's fictional construct of the average American woman, whose support they sought.)

[pullquote]

Because President Obama has just single-handedly gutted the legal rationale for excluding women from the draft.

In 1981, the Supreme Court upheld a males-only draft registration law for one reason alone: “Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft.”

That law excluding women from the draft is now a sitting duck, bereft of any legal legs to stand on unless President Obama steps forward to provide a new rationale.

Will Obama moms put up with the prospect that their daughters could be sent to war involuntarily, just like men? Will anyone put the question to them or to President Obama in a politically effective way?

Congress must use its power to find out the truth about women in combat. Three questions must be raised, and the data collected to answer them:

1. What is the cost to military effectiveness of sending women into combat?

2. What is the cost to the taxpayer per successful woman recruit compared to male combat troops?

3. Finally, what is the cost to the physical and mental health of young women themselves, compared to male soldiers?

Even with sharply lowered physical standards for women in the Army, for example, women’s failure, injury, and attrition rates are much higher than men’s. (Meaning that the cost of recruiting one female soldier is much higher). Women soldiers also have higher rates of hospitalization for mental disorders and also higher rates of evacuation from the field for psychiatric reasons, a 2011 review of the medical literature by Dr. Fatma Batuman and colleagues showed.

And then there’s the fact that at least one out of ten active-duty women soldiers is pregnant, unintentionally each year. A 2013 study by Kate Grindlay and Daniel Grossman found that almost 11 percent of women soldiers said they had been pregnant unintentionally in the past year.

If one out of ten men were unavailable for combat each year because of an unexpected medical condition, our military would literally be decimated.

The taxpayers, meanwhile, bear an unequal burden in hiring women soldiers who serve less time, sustain more injuries, and are much more likely to be non-deployable.

What about the cost to young women themselves? After ten years in combat-exposed service, the Pentagon should have hard data but if so it is not releasing it.

Women soldiers express the most concern.

Listen hard to Marine Capt. Katie Petronio, who was deployed twice under combat conditions with the engineering corps in Iraq and Afghanistan. “My main concern is a question of longevity,” she wrote in the Marine Corps Gazette, “At the beginning of my tour in Helmand Province, I was physically capable of conducting combat operations for weeks at a time.”

However, “By the fifth month into the deployment, I had muscle atrophy in my thighs that was causing me to constantly trip and my legs to buckle with the slightest grade change. My agility during firefights and mobility on and off vehicles and perimeter walls was seriously hindering my response time and overall capability. It was evident that stress and muscular deterioration was affecting everyone regardless of gender; however, the rate of my deterioration was noticeably faster than that of male Marines and further compounded by gender-specific medical conditions.”

Petronio lost 17 pounds and is now infertile.

This happened even though she was carrying a fraction of the physical load men carried.

For ""Julia’s"" own sake, as well as for the sake of our national defense and our taxpayers, Congress should demand accountability on the costs of this new experiment: the costs to the military first and foremost, the costs to the taxpayers, and finally, the costs to the women themselves.

If young women are assuming greater risk to their health or their children by volunteering for combat duty (or military service) compared to male soldiers, they ought at least to know it.

All of these inquiries need to feed into a fourth question which President Obama must be called on to answer:

Is he willing to draft ""Julia"" or not? If not, why not?

The Supreme Court will want to know."

President Obama discusses faith at National Prayer Breakfast

Obama says he hopes the prayers carry over from the event itself

Obama%3A %22Faith is not a possession%3B faith is a process.%22

President Obama told lawmakers Thursday he hopes the spiritual lessons of the National Prayer Breakfast carry over from the event -- something that hasn't really happened in years past, he confessed.

""You'd like to think that the shelf life wasn't so short,"" Obama joked.

After previous prayer breakfasts, he said, ""I go back to the Oval Office and I start watching the cable news networks -- and it's like we didn't pray!""

Making his fifth straight appearance at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Obama told the bipartisan gathering that grappling with the nation's problems -- and with politicians of different parties -- requires a constant renewal of faith.

""Faith is not a possession,"" Obama said. ""Faith is a process.""

Referring to last month's inaugural ceremony, Obama noted that he took the oath of office with Bibles owned by two icons who relied on faith to face immense personal and national challenges: Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.

As the civil rights movement faced violent resistance in the 1950s and 1960s, Obama said, ""we know that in Scripture, Dr. King found strength.""

Lincoln also found ""solace in Scripture"" during the Civil War of the 1860s, Obama said, and ""that allowed him to become a better leader.""

""Today, the divisions in this country are, thankfully, not as deep or destructive as when Lincoln led, but they are real,"" Obama said. ""The differences in how we hope to move our nation forward are less pronounced than when King marched, but they do exist.""

Meeting them demands both faith and humility, Obama said, adding: ""Let me suggest that those of us with the most power and influence need to be the most humble.""

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, prayer breakfast co-chair and a Republican who has clashed with Obama on many issues, concluded the event by saying ""we are one nation"" with one president.

""Thank you for being my president,"" Sessions said. ""Thank you for being our president."""

The A.P. said that the Justice Department informed it on Friday that law enforcement officials had obtained the records for more than 20 telephone lines of its offices and journalists, including their home phones and cellphones. It said the records were seized without notice sometime this year.

The organization was not told the reason for the seizure. But the timing and the specific journalistic targets strongly suggested they are related to a continuing government investigation into the leaking of information a year ago about the Central Intelligence Agency’s disruption of a Yemen-based terrorist plot to bomb an airliner.

The disclosures began with an Associated Press article on May 7, 2012, breaking the news of the foiled plot; the organization had held off publishing it for several days at the White House’s request because the intelligence operations were still unfolding."

Detroit Free Press

Supreme Court sent Texas ruling back to lower court

Burden of proving real need for affirmative action rests with colleges

Ruling could have implications for Michigan%27s Proposal 2

While a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action in a Texas case will do nothing to change practices at Michigan's public universities, it does offer hope to those supportive of Michigan's voter-approved ban on the use of affirmative action in college admissions, legal experts said.

In a 7-1 decision Monday, the Supreme Court allowed affirmative action programs to remain legal — for now — but told the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its earlier ruling upholding the University of Texas' admissions process, which uses race as a factor. The justices held that universities have to prove there is a real need for affirmative action programs to diversify student enrollment and that courts must take a strict review of such programs to determine whether they are justified.

That toughening stance on the use of affirmative action in college admissions signals what the high court might do this fall when it takes up an appeal of a lower federal court's decision last fall to throw out Michigan's Proposal 2, said Kevin Saunders and Philip Pucillo, both law professors at Michigan State University, in separate interviews.

""This ruling may indicate a reluctance by the majority of the court to allow the overturning of Prop 2 to stand,"" Saunders said.

Pucillo said making universities prove they need affirmative action programs could signal the court's willingness to allow voters to restrict or outlaw those programs.

In essence, the courts have been taking universities at their word that affirmative action programs were needed in order to get diverse student bodies. Monday's ruling reminds lower courts that justices want universities to prove that race-neutral programs weren't working to get more minority enrollment, Pucillo said.

""The court made it clear that when lower courts are reviewing the cases, they have to do it with rigor,"" he said. ""They were giving universities the benefit of the doubt. The University of Texas has to prove why it needs (affirmative action).""

Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said a stricter standard needed to be applied by federal courts in determining whether a university's use of racial preferences was justified and ""narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

""Strict scrutiny does require a court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university's serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives"" before signing off on race-based admissions practices, Kennedy wrote.

In the Texas case, the justices were looking at a program used to help fill the last quarter or so of the university's incoming freshman classes. Race is one of many factors considered by admissions officers. The rest of the roughly 7,100 freshman spots automatically go to Texans who graduated in the top 8 percent of their high school classes.

A white Texan, Abigail Fisher, sued the university after she was denied a spot in 2008.

Even those fighting to overturn the Proposal 2 ban passed by Michigan voters in 2006 agreed with experts' interpretation of Monday's ruling, that the court passed on making wholesale changes to affirmative action with this ruling.

""While everyone assumed the court would weigh in on the merits of affirmative action, that's not what they did,"" said Mark Fancher, an attorney with the ACLU of Michigan, one of the groups fighting against the Proposal 2 ban. ""In fact what they said, implicitly, was we've already done that. The only question is whether the rules are being applied properly by universities.

""The landscape is unchanged.""

Detroit attorneys Shanta Driver and George Washington of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, noted that Monday's decision did not strike the University of Texas affirmative action program, but only remanded it for reconsideration by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

""We believe that it will take a big fight in Texas and nationally to persuade the conservative Fifth Circuit to recognize this truth,"" they said in a written statement. ""To win this fight — which it is now clear we can do — we have to return to the streets. That is how affirmative action was won and the only means by which it can be defended today.""

They said when the Michigan case is heard before the Supreme Court this fall they will be ""organizing a massive demonstration at the Court on the day of the argument, and we ask for every individual and every organization that supports affirmative action to join us in building that rally and march.""

The Proposal 2 ballot initiative was pushed by Jennifer Gratz, who was denied admission to the University of Michigan and sued, and by Ward Connerly, a former University of California regent who backed a similar voter initiative in that state.

Michigan voters approved the ban, 58 percent-42 percent.

The ban came several years after U-M was involved in a landmark Supreme Court ruling governing race and universities in two companion lawsuits, one filed by Gratz and others over undergraduate admissions policies. The high court upheld the U-M Law School's use of race as a consideration in admissions, as long as there were no quotas attached, but threw out the undergraduate admissions system that awarded extra points to African-American, Hispanic and Native American students.

It was considered a win for U-M, despite the ruling on undergraduate admissions.

Proposal 2 erased U-M's court victory by banning the state's universities and other public institutions from considering an applicant's minority status or gender in their admissions or hiring processes.

A federal appeals court, in November, threw out Michigan's voter-approved ban on affirmative action.

November's ruling focused on university admissions, although the ballot initiative approved by Michigan voters in 2006 also banned the use of affirmative action in government contracting and hiring. Lawyers said the federal appeals court opinion struck down only what some consider the most significant piece, dealing with university admissions.

That case is about the equal protection clause, Fancher said.

""The only thing we suspected as we waited for the ruling (in the Fisher case) was that it wasn't going to knock us out of the ballpark, and it didn't,"" Fancher said.

But Gratz and her supporters were heartened by the Fisher ruling.

""It's hard to predict what the court will do, (but) this ruling shows the court barely tolerates these policies,"" she said."

He spoke one day after a bipartisan group of eight senators released their own blueprint for a comprehensive reform bill, and the back-to-back events gave the odd sensation — rare during the Obama administration — of seeing Congress and the White House moving in more or less the same direction.

“Now is the time,” Mr. Obama said, noting that Washington was having a bipartisan moment on immigration not seen since George W. Bush was president and Senator Edward Kennedy was leading the push for reform. The president restated the familiar and still-sound principles behind an immigration overhaul: a more secure border and workplace; legalization for 11 million undocumented immigrants; and a modernized system of legal immigration that eliminates backlogs, reunites families and has enough visas for valued workers and entrepreneurs. He also gave a helpful reminder that it’s wrong to cast immigration as a battle of “them” and “us.” A false distinction, he said, because most of us used to be “them.”

The fiercest point of debate and the biggest obstacle to a bill, of course, is whether and how to get “them” — that is, 11 million undocumented immigrants — out of the shadows, free to live and work here legally and to become citizens if they wish. “It should be clear at the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,” Mr. Obama said, stressing the “is.” An objectionable part of the senators’ blueprint is that it refuses to put undocumented immigrants on a path to permanent residency and citizenship until a host of border-enforcement actions is completed first.

Given existing immigration backlogs and the possibility of other administrative hurdles being placed in the way, any future path to citizenship could be so long and burdensome as to be all but imaginary. Mr. Obama, to his credit, made the citizenship path a central part of his plan and did not make it contingent on adding still more troops, border fencing and aerial drones."

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Five different Republican committees this morning released a joint memo

pushing back on the “Democrats’ War on Women” messaging to highlight

the sex scandals of a group of Democratic men and argue that Democrats

are hypocrites who only care about women when it is politically

convenient. It’s a fine message as far as it goes, which is as a kind of a summer

doldrums GOP base-riling play, reminding Republican women that there

are a bunch of Democratic men out there who they — and others! — think

are creeps.

Two things about this. First, Democrats underestimate how much stuff like this really gets under the skin of people on the other side. The entire “war on women” campaign is offensive to GOP women and to men who have wives and daughters.

But making a political point by crafting an obnoxious bit of hyperbole is something Democrats excel at lately. Whether it’s comparing the GOP to hijackers or terrorists over budget negotiations, the party has fully embraced argument by demonization. I’m not talking about a loose comment here or there, which always happens on both sides, I mean a coordinated campaign from the top down which includes the President.

Franke-Ruta argues that instead of acting on our entirely justifiable irritation with the left’s obnoxious memes we should design a more reasoned campaign built around women and security issues. I think it’s well intended and probably even a good idea. But–and this is point two–it fails to appreciate the extent to which policy arguments are merely backdrops for more energetic attacks in our elections these days.

To give a current example, these “no slutbags” flyers appearing around NYC are going to do more to hurt Anthony Weiner than any policy argument about his 64 points for a strong middle class. And the same applies to the 2012 election.

The left is kidding itself if it thinks the “war on women” was about expanded funding for birth control. It was about Rush calling Sandra Fluke a slut. That was the headline and the source of outrage onto which all the policy baggage was later loaded. Similarly, Todd Akin’s comments about rape did more to make the war on women a reality than any policy papers posted by the DNC. Populist outrage first, policy backstopping afterwards.

Don’t believe me? Have a look at this move on ad from last year. Notice the focus is on offensive statements not policy arguments. In fact, American Crossroads tried to respond

with their own “war on women” policy arguments, not

unlike what Franke-Ruta is suggesting the GOP try now. But as we all

know, those arguments did not get nearly the same level of media or popular traction.

Rush and Akin’s comments are to Democratic cultural politics what Jaws was to movies about killer sharks. The fascination on the left may have devolved into Sharknado-level parody by now, but there’s no doubting that a new genre was spawned. And to extend that metaphor, there’s no point responding to these memes with policy prescriptions anymore than there is giving the Sharknado sequel a stern and serious negative review. There is no policy response to “binders full of women.” None that matters.

Filner, Weiner and Spitzer give the GOP an easy (and potentially effective) opportunity to respond in kind. It may not be a reasoned policy argument but as we

learned in 2012 that’s not what wins elections."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/29/DOJ-Defunds-Youth-Programs-that-Reference-God,2013-06-29 00:00:00,['Warner Todd Huston'],DOJ Defunds Youth Programs that Reference God,"The Department of Justice has summarily removed federal funding from two Louisiana youth programs because a local official refused to sign a pledge stating he would require the programs to ban mentions of God.

Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.

Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30,000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”

Whittington told Fox, “We were informed that these are unacceptable, inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”

The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:

From this day forward, I sincerely promise, I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God, my Country and its flag, my parents, myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper Fidelis

Both the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”

As to the at-risk youth program, Whittington said,”We’re not promoting any specific religion, this is just voluntary prayer, mention of God, how offensive and bad can that be?”

In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge, Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.

“As a Christian, Sheriff and American citizen, I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs, specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement,” wrote the Sheriff.

In cutting off the funding, the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.

Fox’s Todd Starnes says that, “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1,000 young people have graduated from the program, directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”

Like Sheriff Whittington, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.

“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression,” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist, agnostic, secular organization.” “They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer,” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”

Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down, nothing is ever going to change,” he said."

USA TODAY

President Obama said Friday that all Americans should respect a jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, but white Americans should also understand that African Americans are pained by Trayvon's death and continue to face racial discrimination.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" the nation's first African-American president said during a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room.

Obama, who last year said the 17-year-old Florida shooting victim could just as easily have been his son, talked about how he has been subjected to casual prejudice. He also said African Americans need to address the problems of violence in their own communities.

African-American males know they are more likely to be both ""victims and perpetrators of violence,"" Obama said, and ""somebody like Trayvon Martin was probably statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.""

The problem is that so many people paint with a ""broad brush"" and see all black young men as potential criminals, Obama said.

A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on Saturday night of murder in the 2012 death of 17-year-old Trayvon. This was Obama's first on-camera comments on the case since the verdict was handed down Saturday night. He had had issued a written statement calling for calm on Sunday.

Obama has generally avoiding discussing racial issues -- today was probably his most extensive comments on the issue as president, reminiscent of his speech on race relations during the 2008 campaign.

In an extraordinary 19-minute appearance, Obama spoke personally and at times emotionally about the frustrations African-Americans have with the justice system, and the continuing racial divides that shadow the nation.

""I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said, and ""it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.""

Obama told reporters that, like other African Americans, he has been followed by security guards while shopping, and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them. While didn't want to ""exaggerate,"" Obama said ""those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.""

He cited racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and how blacks tend to be charged more often with drug offenses and sentenced to longer prison terms than whites. He also said it's fair to wonder what would have happened in Florida if the shooter had been a young African-American.

Obama said he respects the different views of the verdict, but the trial was conducted professionally, and ""once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works."" While demonstrations and peaceful protests are understandable, he said violence ""dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.""

Said Obama: ""Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this?""

While the Justice Department investigates whether to charge Zimmerman with civil rights violations in the case, Obama said state and local levels should examine whether changes to laws can head off violent confrontations. He cited laws to ban racial profiling, and proposed new kind of training for law enforcement in order ""to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.""

The president also questioned the wisdom of Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which, in the view of critics, all but encourages confrontation that could turn deadly.

Obama also suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground, adding: ""Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened?""

The nation should also think about ways to ""bolster and reinforce our African American boys,"" Obama said, saying there are too many kids out there who need help, but ""are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.""

Obama said all Americans should do ""soul-searching"" in the wake of the verdict and the reactions to it, but questioned whether a full-blown ""national conversation"" would do much good if too many politicians or pundits were involved.

""On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?"" Obama said.

Borrowing a quote from Abraham Lincoln, Obama said political leaders should do whatever they can to encourage ''the better angels of our nature."" rather than ""using these episodes to heighten divisions.""

Obama also said that Americans should realize that, over the course of decades, American race relations have improved, citing his daughters and their friends as examples. While that doesn't means ""we're in a post-racial society,"" Obama said there is progress.

""I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better,"" Obama said.

Obama also paid tribute to Trayvon's parents, saying that ""I can only imagine what they're going through and it's remarkable how they've handled it.""

In a statement, Trayvon's parents Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton said Friday, ""we are deeply honored and moved that President Obama took the time to speak publicly and at length about our son, Trayvon. The President's comments give us great strength at this time."""

http://news.yahoo.com/widow-works-preserve-evers-civil-rights-legacy-093438698.html,,[],Widow works to preserve Evers' civil-rights legacy,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Myrlie Evers-Williams acknowledges it would be easy to remain mired in bitterness and anger, 50 years after a sniper's bullet made her a widow.

Instead, she's determined to celebrate the legacy of her first husband, Medgar Evers — a civil rights figure often overshadowed by peers such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.

Events including a black-tie gala are being held this week to remember Evers, the first Mississippi field secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was 37 when he was assassinated on June 12, 1963.

""We are cursed as human beings with this element that's called hatred, prejudice and racism,"" said Evers-Williams, now 80. ""But it is my belief that, as it was Medgar's, that there is something good and decent in each and every one of us, and we have to call on that, and we have to find a way to work together.""

Evers-Willliams, who moved back to Mississippi in 2012, is treated with reverence by strangers who recognize her these days. She recently went to downtown Jackson's King Edward Hotel to meet reporters from The Associated Press for an interview — a hotel, she notes, that was off limits to black people decades ago. As she waited for her coffee, a white man approached to shake her hand and ask if she'd pose for a photo.

""I've always wanted to meet you,"" said Ron Walker, former mayor of the tiny town of Taylorsville.

Evers-Williams smiled cautiously, then beamed, as Walker said he believes she and Medgar Evers had made Mississippi a better, more open society.

Evers-Williams gave the invocation at President Barack Obama's inauguration in January, and met with the president June 5 at the White House. A ceremony of remembrance was held June 6 at Evers' gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery, attended by former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Myrlie Beasley and Medgar Evers met as students in 1950 at Alcorn College, a historically black school in rural southwest Mississippi. He was from Decatur, Miss., and served in the Army during World War II before becoming a star football player for the school. Nearly eight years his junior, she was a talented pianist raised by a protective grandmother in Vicksburg. The couple married in 1951.

Story continues

In 1954, Evers applied to the all-white University of Mississippi Law School. After he was rejected, he sought the NAACP's help to file a lawsuit. Instead, the organization hired him to coordinate its work in stubbornly segregationist Mississippi.

Evers spent years investigating violence against black people, including the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till. He helped James Meredith gain admission as the first black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962. Evers pushed for black voter registration, drew young people into the civil rights movement and, in the final months of his life, led a boycott of white-owned businesses in downtown Jackson.

Two weeks before his death, Evers helped coordinate a sit-in at an all-white lunch counter. That night, someone tossed a firebomb at his house. It was extinguished, but the warning clear.

Evers-Williams recalled that the night before her husband was slain, she sat with him on their couch and talked about the danger. He made her promise that if anything happened to him, she would take care of their three young children. She also vowed that if he were killed, she would seek justice and keep his memory alive.

The night he was killed, Medgar Evers stayed out late, attending a community meeting. Shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, he arrived home. His wife and children were still awake after watching a televised speech on civil rights by President John F. Kennedy.

""And as soon as the children said, 'There's daddy,' the shot rang out — one of the loudest and most powerful I had, and still have, ever heard. And I knew exactly what had happened,"" Evers-Williams recalled.

Neighbors drove Evers to the University of Mississippi Medical Center a few miles away. Within an hour, he was dead from the shot to his back.

Evers-Williams and her children moved to California just over a year later.

""We could no longer live in our home,"" she said. ""The memories were just too vivid, and I could never get all of the blood up off of the concrete driveway.""

A white segregationist, Byron De La Beckwith, was tried twice for Medgar Evers' slaying in the 1960s, but all-white juries failed to convict him. The case was re-opened in the 1990s based on new evidence, and he was convicted of murder in 1994. He was 80 when he died in prison in 2001.

Myrlie Evers-Williams remarried in 1976 to longshoreman Walter Williams, and the couple moved to Oregon in 1989. Williams died of cancer in 1995, about the time she became national chairwoman of the NAACP, a post she held until 1998. She is widely credited with putting the organization back on solid financial footing.

She had never planned to move back to Mississippi, but was drawn by an invitation to teach at her alma mater, now known as Alcorn State University.

Evers-Williams said she sees progress, such as Mississippi's large number of black elected officials, including a congressman, and mayors of Jackson and several other cities. It's common to see black and white people working together and socializing, though many neighborhoods are still largely one race or another.

Still, some things disturb her in Mississippi and elsewhere. Long lines to vote and voter-identification laws could limit access to the ballot, she said. When Obama was re-elected, clashes between students at the University of Mississippi were largely divided on racial lines.

What would Medgar Evers think about American society now?

""I believe he would look at the landscape of this country and realize what so many of us have said: We have made progress but there's still so much to be done, and if we don't guard the progress we've made, that too will slip away,"" Evers-Williams said.

She spoke at the University of Mississippi graduation May 11, and the university gave her a humanitarian award — the third it has ever given. After the ceremony, she was attending a campus reception when James Meredith and his wife arrived.

""I ran to the door and I stood there and held my arms out,"" Evers-Williams recalled with a smile. ""I said to him, 'You can't come in here unless you come through me.'""

It was an echo of long-dead segregationist governors.

""We had the biggest laugh,"" Evers-Williams said. ""We laughed until we cried. Here we are, 50-plus years later, and we can do that now.""

No one is arguing that the entire Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Section 2 is the most important part of the act. It gives people the right to challenge discriminatory laws in court. It applies to the entire nation. It is constitutional, and it will continue to protect all Americans.

What is unconstitutional is a different part of the act, Section 5. Section 5 applies only in a few states. Unlike any other law, Section 5 requires states to get permission from federal bureaucrats before making changes to their voting laws. This is costly, and Section 5 requires it even when the change is obviously lawful. For example, when parts of Alabama were evacuated recently because of a hurricane, local officials had to divert attention away from making people safe so they could get federal permission to postpone elections scheduled for that day.

Section 5 was supposed to be a short-term, emergency measure. It was constitutional when it prevented Southern officials from openly defying the Constitution in 1965. But the question before the Supreme Court is whether Congress had power, in 2006, to extend this measure for 25 more years. The answer is no. Congress could not conclude that a generation of people with no connection to the tragic events of the 1960s would be untrustworthy until 2031.

Alabama is not perfect on race relations, but we have seen great progress. Minority voter registration is better here than in states that don't have to comply with Section 5. The federal government hasn't rejected a statewide law in Alabama under Section 5 in 16 years. And the challenge from Alabama's Shelby County, which is before the Supreme Court today, has shown why unreliable data about Section 2 cases are no basis for treating states unequally. The problems Alabama faces today are not different than those faced by every other state in our Union.

Bull Connor, the Birmingham official who turned fire hoses on children in the 1960s, has been dead 40 years. The children of today's Alabama are not racist, and neither is their government. It is time for states covered by Section 5 to become equal parts of these United States.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/01/Exclusive-US-Civil-Rights-Commissioner-Amnesty-would-violate-blacks-civil-rights,2013-09-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Exclusive-US Civil Rights Commissioner: Amnesty Means Special, Not Equal, Treatment","Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, told Breitbart News that Attorney General Eric Holder’s claims that amnesty for illegal immigrants is a civil rights issue “profoundly ahistorical.”

“If you take a look at the basis of the civil rights movement, it was to have blacks treated in all respects the same as whites or everybody else,” Kirsanow (pictured) said in a phone interview. “What amnesty is doing is setting aside a special class of individuals who are going to put forward and treated more favorably than others. In other words, they’ve already broken the law and are being given amnesty.

“In terms of immigration policy… it would severely affect the rights of blacks generally and all low-income Americans. What it is going to do is displace those individuals from the labor market.”

The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Kirsanow said, has held extensive hearings in recent years detailing how amnesty would economically impact American workers, especially the black community.

“We had a hearing before the Civil Rights Commission on the effects of illegal immigration on black employment levels, both wage levels and unemployment rates,” Kirsanow said. “What we had were a number of experts from just about every sphere you can think of: business, academia and immigration experts in general. They spanned the ideological spectrum. We had individuals from the far left, individuals in the middle, individuals on the right.

“They disagreed in some respects about certain policy prescriptions but they were unanimous in their conclusion, backed by copious amounts of data,” he recalled, “that illegal immigration had a deleterious effect on the wage and employment levels of black Americans. And it’s not a small effect. It’s a clearly sizable effect.”

Kirsanow and some of his fellow U.S. Commission on Civil Rights members have pushed for members of Congress and key political figures in the national immigration debate like President Barack Obama himself to address these issues, but they have ignored the calls thus far.

“What’s interesting is those who have described themselves as the champions of civil rights are doing enormous damage to the ranks of black Americans by supporting and shepherding through comprehensive immigration reform that does nothing to control the borders, that grants amnesty and is going to create a legal population of individuals who are going to undercut the employment and wage prospects for low income Americans, generally, and specifically black Americans and more specifically black males,” he asserted.

Kirsanow questions who the lawmakers in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the political aisle are really representing, given that they have not substantively discussed the issue in their legislative deliberations. “I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee back in April on immigration reform on the same thing that we’re talking about right now,” he stated. “What was amazing is the number of senators who were either cavalier about it or they gave grudging acknowledgment to the fact that ‘yeah, there’s a possibility that there might be some dislocation to American workers as a result of illegal immigration’ and then just kind of moved on.

“The question I have is: Who do they represent? They are United States Senators. They represent Americans, presumably. Yet, what they’re proposing is they’re going to have a decided negative effect on Americans. What reason? What? Who do they represent? Do they represent illegal immigrants? Or do they represent lawful Americans? And that’s a question that needs to be posed to them.”

Kirsanow was originally one of only three witnesses who were going to be called to testify on the immigration situation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He; GOP establishment figure Doug Holtz-Eakin of American Action Forum (AAF), a group advocating in favor of amnesty; and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were going to be the only ones who testified were it not for public outcry about the rushed process.

Originally, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Senate Democratic Party leadership were not even going to call any hearings. “On a matter this large, it is an insult to the American people that only three people were going to testify regardless of how knowledgeable they may be about the subject matter,” Kirsanow said. “This is such a complex matter that they needed perspectives from so many different places. What we had was a bill that was gigantic. It was almost the size of Obamacare and yet it was released barely 36 hours before our testimony.

“In other words, we were testifying in an information vacuum on a momentous piece of legislation. Only after there was a bit of hue and cry did Senate leadership understand that they needed to open up the testimony to more witnesses.”

Kirsanow and others members of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission have written letters on this matter to President Obama and to Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), among other lawmakers, and they have received no response. Similarly, advocates opposed to amnesty like Leah Durant have written letters to members like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, raising these same concerns–which have gone ignored, as well.

Kirsanow said that while there are likely a number of reasons why members of the Congressional Black Caucus have ignored this real threat to their constituents, he thinks the most prevailing is that President Barack Obama, America’s first black president, is pushing the policy so they have no ability to stand up to him politically.

“I have asked them why they are not standing up for the needs of their constituents,” Kirsanow said. “We’ve sent these letters to Marcia Fudge. We’ve sent them to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Radio silence. Complete radio silence.”

“I wish reporters asked members of the Congressional Black Caucus what the heck they’re thinking,” he said. “They’ve not been challenged on this. One of the dynamics at play is the fact that we have the first black president who is in support of this. If he is in support of it, a lot of black Americans will reasonably presume that he is looking out for their best interests. So, the Congressional Black Caucus can use that as cover.

“If President Obama supports amnesty, and therefore 90 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus’ constituents will believe it’s in their best interests, those members of the Congressional Black Caucus are unlikely to be questioned by their constituents about whether it’s a good idea on that because they will have believed ‘Barack Obama looks out for my interests, it must be a good idea.'”

Kirsanow said the president is not sticking up for the black community and argued it might be because of special interests and potential future voter pools. “You know that old line, when you want to figure out why something is being done, follow the money? Well, in politics, you not only follow the money, but you follow the votes or potential votes,” he explained. “I think what a lot of sides see, both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, is this vast untapped pool of votes that they expect are going to materialize as a result of amnesty.

“Republicans don’t want to be seen as being anti-Hispanic, Democrats see this as a giant new constituency group and, so, what you’ve got I think, and I don’t know if this pertains to President Obama, but you’ve got a political class looking out for their interests. ‘I want more votes,’ as opposed to current interests of their constituents.

“I don’t necessarily want to ascribe that motive to them, but it’s as plausible and probably more rationale than anything else because I can’t figure out why it is representatives of the United States of America are doing something that is harmful to their constituents.”

While Kirsanow argues members of the political class in the black community like members of Congress and leaders of black groups like the NAACP and others do not stick up for their rank and file on this issue, he said he does get the impression many ordinary black citizens are aware of this threat to their economic well-being.

“A lot of folks do,” Kirsanow, who lives in inner-city Cleveland and used to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), said. “I was in Washington, D.C., and I also appear of black radio shows from time to time, and other radio shows, and what you get without question and what you used to get for quite some time was whenever the issue of illegal immigration came up, black callers were outraged because they feel the effects,” he declared.

“They see it with their own eyes. You get calls from people who have been displaced by illegal immigrants, people who can’t find jobs because they can’t compete against low wages offered to illegal immigrants and it’s fairly vigorous.”"

Editor’s Note: Katherine Culliton-González is senior attorney and director of voter protection at the Advancement Project, a next generation civil rights organization that focuses on issues of democracy and race

(CNN) —

This week, House Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will not consider immigration reform this year. Despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation’s Latino population, the House leadership has chosen to show it disrespect. How shameful.

Here is some context: Last year, 409,849 human beings – mothers, fathers, sons and daughters – were torn from their families and deported. Millions have been exploited, forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship. An entire generation of immigrants, the majority of whom are immigrants of color, are relegated to second-class status.

Sadly, many of the same corporations that build the country’s correctional facilities also build and run prison-like immigrant detention facilities. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform Act and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which cuts off long-standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented, and since 9/11, even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion.

The breakdown of our democratic values does not end there. The path to equal representation in our democracy — our fundamental right to vote — must also be urgently addressed. On June 25, the Supreme Court struck down the formula of the Voting Rights Act needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination. Just two hours after the decision, Texas announced it would reinstate its strict voter ID law. This law had already been struck down by the Justice Department as discriminatory against Latinos and African Americans – groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government-issued photo ID required under the law.

Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls, ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud. Under the purge procedure, Florida’s immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status, hearing dates, requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents. The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens, despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project, Latino Justice, other national voting rights groups, and Florida-based Latino and Haitian American community groups.

In state after state across the country, voter ID and other “show me your papers to vote” laws, laws that disparately impact immigrants of color, are being pursued at an alarming rate.

Given our nation’s long history of racial discrimination, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically. Restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black Americans first became “citizens” and eligible to vote. But disenfranchisement is not the American way. True democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens, and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn.

For a true and just democracy, we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights. Only when each person, regardless of race or ethnicity, is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy – and indeed, the American dream – be realized.

Story highlights Andrew McCarthy: Justice Department should handle cases based strictly on facts and law McCarthy: Attorney General Eric Holder should not have politicized the Zimmerman case He says Zimmerman case is not a federal case because civil rights was not an issue McCarthy: If justice had been served, Zimmerman case would never have been a criminal case

(CNN) —

We have a Department of Justice, not a Department of Social Justice. That is an essential distinction. It is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that George Zimmerman, having just been acquitted of murder by the state of Florida, be subjected to a second prosecution – a federal civil rights indictment – over the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

The Justice Department has earned the trust of the United States courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement. Its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every American, to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law, and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects.

Yet, though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who’ve confessed to mass murder, the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman, an American now acquitted of murder.

Even if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman – which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction – it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials, particularly the U.S. attorney general, to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Law enforcement officials speak in court – with public charges, if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up.

Andrew C. McCarthy

The justice system is not a morality play. It is not designed to right every wrong, nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy, such as the indescribable pain the Martin family endures after the loss of their 17-year-old son. In the face of such tragedy, the human instinct to demand some kind of “justice” – social, poetic or cosmic – is something we all feel. But that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense.

Federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts, and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. When a popular political narrative – such as the left’s portrayal of racism as the root cause of many American ills – crashes into uncongenial facts, the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield, and the Justice Department is supposed to ensure that it does.

Sadly, just the opposite has happened in the Zimmerman case. It has been bereft from the start both of proof that Zimmerman had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well-corroborated claim of self-defense. That is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges.

Yet Holder and his subordinates joined in the effort to induce Florida to file charges, unabashedly making common cause with the likes of the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose metier is racially divisive demagoguery.

Attending an anti-Zimmerman rally with Sharpton, Holder saber-rattled about filing a civil rights case. As the attorney general well knew, his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that Florida had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer. Simultaneously, Justice’s Community Relations Service worked closely with anti-Zimmerman activists to pressure Florida Gov. Rick Scott into reversing the police determination that there was no case. Scott finally caved, appointing the compliant special prosecutor Angela Corey, who dutifully lodged a groundless second-degree murder charge.

Standard, prudent Justice Department practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record. That is for the politicians. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court.

To the contrary, Holder has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign, and now finds himself in the hot seat: It’s been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts, and the facts have long been known – indeed, they’ve been tried in court.

Obviously, it is easier to promise to keep investigating – and to keep alive a race narrative dear to President Obama’s political base – than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against Zimmerman. The insurmountable proof problems Florida prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case.

A civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Martin out of racial animus. There is no evidence that Zimmerman has ever been a racist – jurors in the Florida case say race was not relevant to the case, and the FBI, after investigating extensively for months, has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation.

Furthermore, a federal prosecution would require proof that Zimmerman was trying to prevent Martin’s enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right – like attending school, applying for a job, staying in a hotel, going to a restaurant, or participating in a federal program. The Zimmerman-Martin altercation was purely local with no federal implications.

Finally, in light of the Justice Department’s heavy-handed role in pressuring Florida to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge, there may be a serious question whether the “dual sovereignty” exception to double jeopardy – allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal – applies.

This is not a federal case. If real justice had been served, it would never have been a criminal case at all.

He Previously Worked In The Los Angeles City Hall Bureau For The Times. He Is A Native Of San Diego', 'A Graduate Of San Jose State University.']",Immigration bills benefited from a more engaged Gov. Brown,"SACRAMENTO — Tom Ammiano was frustrated.

Gov. Jerry Brown had refused to meet with him, said the Democratic assemblyman from San Francisco, to talk about the Trust Act. Ammiano had proposed it to prevent immigrants in the U.S. illegally from being turned over to federal officials for possible deportation when arrested by local authorities.

Eventually, Brown skewered the measure with his veto pen, saying the bill was “fatally flawed” because it might have let some serious criminals escape deportation.

That was last year. This year, things were different. Ammiano said the two had multiple meetings in Brown’s office, where they discussed its threadbare carpet, their shared Roman Catholicism — and the Trust Act.

“He said, ‘I have some tweaks,’” Ammiano recalled. “Then we talked turkey and … came up with what everybody could live with.”

Brown signed the measure into law about a week ago, one of 11 immigrant-related bills he accepted this year. He also significantly expanded driver’s licenses for immigrants without documents. He rejected a measure to allow noncitizens to serve on juries, but gave those in the U.S. illegally permission to be lawyers and signed a bill protecting them from employers who threaten to report their status.

Brown’s embrace of new immigrant rights is a shift from three years ago, when he openly opposed the driver’s license idea while running for governor. He signed a small handful of immigrant-rights bills last year, permitting driver’s licenses for those eligible for temporary federal work permits and giving undocumented college students access to public financial aid. But mostly, he stayed focused on the state’s budget morass.

Now, with the fiscal crisis behind him, legislators describe the governor as more approachable and engaged. Instead of being handed off to his staffers, they hashed out differences with him face to face.

It helped that the Legislature’s 25-member Latino caucus, which led the charge on many immigrant bills, is mostly Democratic and that the party won supermajorities in both houses last November. This year’s efforts also coincided with a new recognition of California’s changing demographics: Even the Republican Party that once rallied voters against illegal immigrants has launched a Latino outreach effort.

“There is a change,” said Brown, who is expected to run for reelection next year in a state where 20% of voters are Latino and 10% are of Asian descent. “It’s in part the sheer numbers and participation by immigrants in the life of our communities. It’s also the advocacy and impressive work of immigrant groups and their supporters.”

The driver’s license law was long in the making.

Los Angeles City Councilman Gil Cedillo began working on the issue in 1997, when he was first elected to the Legislature. He eventually persuaded lawmakers to pass a bill that Gov. Gray Davis signed in 2003.

Arnold Schwarzenegger canceled the measure later that year, after replacing Davis in the recall election.

Ten years on, “what [has] changed was the political leadership and … the political climate,” Cedillo said in an interview last week.

Even so, the license expansion would have foundered this year but for one lawmaker’s chance remark to Brown.

The bill’s author, Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), planned to table it amid a fight over a distinguishing mark on the licenses — something Brown said federal law required.

With only one more day to go in the legislative session, Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) mentioned the stalled bill to the governor in a Capitol hallway. The senator said Brown, surprised, told him: “Send me the bill. I’ll sign it.”

Seizing the moment, DeLeon and a few colleagues revived the bill in the Senate, which passed it just hours before the Legislature adjourned. The Assembly quickly followed suit.

A couple of weeks later, more than 40 domestic workers — many of them Latino immigrants — were ushered into the governor’s inner office, where they tearfully watched him sign another long-sought bill. It requires overtime pay for nannies, healthcare aides and other personal attendants, a goal of community activists since 2006.

The group pressed in around Brown for a photo with him and Ammiano, the bill’s author. Many of those present had marched at the Capitol for years to make their case for equal employment rights, carrying babies or pushing in wheelchairs the disabled people they care for.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year that would have required rest and meal periods as well as overtime wages. But Brown rejected it, expressing concern in a long veto message about the “economic and human impact on the disabled or elderly person.”

Ammiano and Brown talked about the bill this year, providing the assemblyman with a road map for what the governor would support. Ammiano’s labor expert held meetings and conference calls with Brown’s aides to answer questions: How many workers were involved? How would work hours be counted? How would that affect the people being cared for?

In the end, only the overtime provision survived. But it was the one the workers most wanted.

In March of this year, a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that only 19% of Californians opposed a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. Among those with changing views are Republicans, who have a historically small minority in the Legislature and hold no statewide offices.

Two decades ago, the GOP was the main force behind Proposition 187, the effort to block public services for the undocumented, which drove up Democratic voter registration among Latinos. This year, the driver’s license bill received some GOP votes, and 16 Republican lawmakers signed a letter urging congressional leaders to change the nation’s immigration laws.

“Republicans chose the wedge of … Proposition 187, and we are paying the price for that decades later,” said Sen. Bill Emmerson (R-Hemet), who signed the letter, although he abstained from voting on the driver’s licenses bill. “It’s time for us to turn the page.”

Not all Republicans cede the issue. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly (R-Twin Peaks), a former Minuteman leader who may run against Brown next year, said the governor is “rolling the dice” with his flurry of immigrant-bill signings.

“We’ve created a precedent and an incentive for more people to come here illegally,” he said. “That’s a demerit for Gov. Jerry Brown.”

But Brown, immersed in California politics for the last four decades, has repeatedly proved his political instincts, noted Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College.

The governor’s bill actions are “no accident,” Dreier said. Latinos’ increasingly powerful voice has “made them impossible to ignore.”

In a statement, Obama said they'd been sentenced under an ""unfair system."" In 2011, Congress passed a law that effectively reduced the federal government's mandatory penalties for people convicted of crack offenses, but commuting the sentences represents the first time the reform has been applied to those convicted before it was adopted. ""If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,"" Obama explained in the statement.

Three of the inmates -- Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., Clarence Aaron and Stephanie George -- were featured in a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union about the thousands of people serving life in prison for nonviolent offenses. The report, which received attention from a range of media outlets, including The Huffington Post, revealed that more than 3,000 inmates were serving life without parole for drug, property and other nonviolent crimes as of 2012, comprising about 6 percent of the total life-without-parole population.

Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., 39, has spent half of his life in prison, according to the report. He was arrested at 19 for dealing drugs and declined a plea offer of 10 years, choosing to go to trial. He was a street dealer, but opened himself up to the life-without-parole sentence because he was held accountable for the entire amount of cocaine sold as part of a conspiracy in which he had a small role.

Clarence Aaron, 43, was sentenced to three life-without-parole sentences as a college student for playing a minor role in two large, planned drug deals. He wouldn't testify against his co-conspirators, but they testified against him and received reduced sentences.

Stephanie Yvette George, 43, was sentenced to life in prison without parole at age 26 after the father of one of her children used her attic to store drugs and cash. The harshness of the sentence was due, in part, to prior convictions for selling small amounts of crack. Though George said she didn't know the drugs were hidden in her home, six cooperating witnesses testified that she was paid to store cocaine.

Prior to Thursday, Obama had pardoned only 11 people for drug crimes, and had used his powers of clemency to provide relief to just 40 people in all -- fewer than any other modern president. In recent months, his administration has portrayed the country's tough drug policies as unjust, but his decision to commute these sentences may be the most significant step to curtail the war on drugs. In addition to the eight people convicted of crack offenses, he also pardoned 13 others for various crimes.

Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, called the decision an ""incredibly important development.""

""The president took the enormous step of giving hope and new life to people who were doomed to die behind bars for nonviolent offenses,"" she said. ""Of course, we know there are thousands who are in similar situations in prison, and so now we really need to do the work to change the laws around the country to prevent these sorts of extreme sentences from taking place on our soil.""

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated that the president had commuted the sentences of only 11 drug offenders prior to Thursday; that is in fact the previous number of pardons granted to drug offenders."

Wade Fast Facts,"Norma McCorvey (L) formally known as 'Jane Roe,' as she holds a pro-choice sign with former attorney Gloria Allred (R) in front of the US Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, just before attorneys began arguing the 1973 landmark abortion decision which legalized abortion in the US.

(CNN) —

Here’s a look at the US Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.

Case

1971 - The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.

Decision

January 22, 1973 - The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. The Court held that a woman’s right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy (recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut) protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision gave a woman the right to an abortion during the entirety of the pregnancy and defined different levels of state interest for regulating abortion in the second and third trimesters.

The ruling affected laws in 46 states.

Legal Timeline

1971 - The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.

1971 - The Supreme Court agrees to hear the case filed by Roe against Wade, who was enforcing the Texas abortion law that had been declared unconstitutional in an earlier federal district court case. Wade was ignoring the legal ruling and both sides appealed.

December 13, 1971 - The case is argued before the US Supreme Court.

October 11, 1972 - The case is reargued before the US Supreme Court.

January 22, 1973 - The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution.

June 17, 2003 - McCorvey (Roe) files a motion with the US District Court in Dallas to have the case overturned and asks the court to consider new evidence that abortion hurts women. Included are 1,000 affidavits from women who say they regret their abortions.

September 14, 2004 - A three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans dismisses McCorvey’s motion to have the case overturned, according to the Court’s clerk.

Judge rules that key parts of Utah%27s polygamy laws are unconstitutional

Utah%27s bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states

The Kody Brown and his 4 wives star in the TV reality show %22Sister Wives%22

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A federal judge ruled Friday that key parts of Utah's polygamy laws are unconstitutional, handing a legal victory to a polygamist family that stars in the TV reality show ""Sister Wives.""

U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups said in the ruling that the phrase in Utah law that forbids cohabitation with another person was a violation of the First Amendment.

Washington D.C.-based attorney Jonathan Turley has said that Kody Brown and his four wives drew the attention of Utah authorities because of their TLC hit series. The Brown family filed their lawsuit in July 2011, and fled Utah for Las Vegas last year under the threat of prosecution.

Turley argued the case before Waddoups in January.

Utah's bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states — most of the other states prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. Utah makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together.

The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1kHUIRd ) reports Waddoups took a narrow interpretation of the words ""marry"" and ""purports to marry"" in his ruling. That means that bigamy remains illegal in Utah only in the literal sense, such as when someone fraudulently acquires more than one marriage license.

""The decision affects a far greater range of such relationships than the form of polygamy practiced by the Browns,"" Turley said in a statement Friday. ""It is a victory not for polygamy but privacy in America.""

Utah officials had sought to have the suit thrown out. They first argued that the Browns couldn't challenge the bigamy law because they hadn't been charged. State attorneys later argued for dismissal because a prosecutor had pledged not to prosecute them for bigamy.

But Waddoups wrote in a 2012 ruling that the promise from the Utah County Attorney's Office appeared to be a ploy to avoid the suit.

Kody Brown said in a statement Friday that the family was ""humbled and grateful"" for the ruling.

""While we know that many people do not approve of plural families, it is our family and based on our beliefs,"" he said. ""Just as we respect the personal and religious choices of other families, we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices."""
http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/25/19062348-disabled-workers-paid-just-pennies-an-hour-and-its-legal,2013-06-25 00:00:00,"['Anna Schecter', 'Producer', 'Nbc News']",Disabled workers paid just pennies an hour – and it's legal,"One of the nation's best-known charities is paying disabled workers as little as 22 cents an hour, thanks to a 75-year-old legal loophole that critics say needs to be closed.

Goodwill Industries, a multibillion-dollar company whose executives make six-figure salaries, is among the nonprofit groups permitted to pay thousands of disabled workers far less than minimum wage because of a federal law known as Section 14 (c). Labor Department records show that some Goodwill workers in Pennsylvania earned wages as low as 22, 38 and 41 cents per hour in 2009.

""If they really do pay the CEO of Goodwill three-quarters of a million dollars, they certainly can pay me more than they're paying,"" said Harold Leigland, who is legally blind and hangs clothes at a Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana for less than minimum wage.

""It's a question of civil rights,"" added his wife, Sheila, blind from birth, who quit her job at the same Goodwill store when her already low wage was cut further. ""I feel like a second-class citizen. And I hate it.""

Section 14 (c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was passed in 1938, allows employers to obtain special minimum wage certificates from the Department of Labor. The certificates give employers the right to pay disabled workers according to their abilities, with no bottom limit to the wage.

Most, but not all, special wage certificates are held by nonprofit organizations like Goodwill that then set up their own so-called ""sheltered workshops"" for disabled employees, where employees typically perform manual tasks like hanging clothes.

The non-profit certificate holders can also place employees in outside, for-profit workplaces including restaurants, retail stores, hospitals and even Internal Revenue Service centers. Between the sheltered workshops and the outside businesses, more than 216,000 workers are eligible to earn less than minimum wage because of Section 14 (c), though many end up earning the full federal minimum wage of $7.25.

When a non-profit provides Section 14 (c) workers to an outside business, it sets the salary and pays the wages. For example, the Helen Keller National Center, a New York school for the blind and deaf, has a special wage certificate and has placed students in a Westbury, N.Y., Applebee's franchise. The employees' pay ranged from $3.97 per hour to $5.96 per hour in 2010. The franchise told NBC News it has also hired workers at minimum wage from Helen Keller. A spokesperson for Applebee's declined to comment on Section 14 (c).

Helen Keller also placed several students at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Manhasset, N.Y., in 2010, where they earned $3.80 and $4.85 an hour. A Barnes & Noble spokeswoman defended the Section 14 (c) program as providing jobs to ""people who would otherwise not have [the opportunity to work].""

Most Section 14 (c) workers are employed directly by nonprofits. In 2001, the most recent year for which numbers are available, the GAO estimated that more than 90 percent of Section 14 (c) workers were employed at nonprofit work centers.

Critics of Section 14 (c) have focused much of their ire on the nonprofits, where wages can be just pennies an hour even as some of the groups receive funding from the government. At one workplace in Florida run by a nonprofit, some employees earned one cent per hour in 2011.

""People are profiting from exploiting disabled workers,"" said Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. ""It is clearly and unquestionably exploitation.""

Defenders of Section 14 (c) say that without it, disabled workers would have few options. A Department of Labor spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News that Section 14 (c) ""provides workers with disabilities the opportunity to be given meaningful work and receive an income.""

Terry Farmer, CEO of ACCSES, a trade group that calls itself the ""voice of disability service providers,"" said scrapping the provision could ""force [disabled workers] to stay at home,"" enter rehabilitation, ""or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities.""

Harold Leigland, however, said he feels that Goodwill can pay him a low wage because the company knows he has few other places to go. ""We are trapped,"" he said. ""Everybody who works at Goodwill is trapped.""

Leigland, a 66-year-old former massage therapist with a college degree, currently earns $5.46 per hour in Great Falls.

His wages have risen and fallen based on ""time studies,"" the method nonprofits use to calculate the salaries of Section 14 (c) workers. Staff members use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes a disabled worker to complete a task. That time is compared with how long it would take a person without a disability to do the same task. The nonprofit then uses a formula to calculate a salary, which may be equal to or less than minimum wage. The tests are repeated every six months.

Leigland's pay has been higher than $5.46, but it has also dropped down to $4.37 per hour, based on the time-study results.

He said he believes Goodwill makes the time studies harder when they want his wage to be lower.

""Sometimes the test is easier than others. It depends on if, as near as I can figure, they want your wage to go up or down. It's that simple,"" he said.

His wife, Sheila, 58, spent four years hanging clothes at the Great Falls Goodwill for about $3.50 an hour. She said the time study was one of the most degrading and stressful parts about her job. ""You never know how it's going to come out. It stressed me out a lot,"" she said.

She quit last summer when she returned to work after knee surgery and found that her wage had been lowered to $2.75 per hour, a training rate.

""At $2.75 it would barely cover my cost of getting to work. I wouldn't make any money,"" she said.

Harold said he believes Goodwill can afford to pay him minimum wage, based on the salaries paid to Goodwill executives. While according to the company's own figures about 4,000 of the 30,000 disabled workers Goodwill employs at 69 franchises are currently paid below minimum wage, salaries for the CEOs of those franchises that hold special minimum wage certificates totaled almost $20 million in 2011.

In 2011 the CEO of Goodwill Industries of Southern California took home $1.1 million in salary and deferred compensation. His counterpart in Portland, Oregon, made more than $500,000. Salaries for CEOs of the roughly 150 Goodwill franchises across America total more than $30 million.

Goodwill International CEO Jim Gibbons, who was awarded $729,000 in salary and deferred compensation in 2011, defended the executive pay.

""These leaders are having a great impact in terms of new solutions, in terms of innovation, and in terms of job creation,"" he said.

Gibbons also defended time studies, and the whole Section 14 (c) approach. He said that for many people who make less than minimum wage, the experience of work is more important than the pay.

""It's typically not about their livelihood. It's about their fulfillment. It's about being a part of something. And it's probably a small part of their overall program,"" he said.

And Goodwill and the organizations that run the sheltered workshops are not alone in their support for Section 14 (c). In many cases, the families of the workers who have severe disabilities say their loved ones enjoy the work experience, enjoy getting a paycheck, and the amount is of no consequence.

""I feel really good about it. I don't have to worry so much about him,"" said Fran Davidson, whose son Jeremy has worked at Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana, for more than a decade. ""I know he's not getting picked on, and he's in a safe place. He enjoys what he's doing, and he's happy, and that's what we like for our kids."" Jeremy started out working for a sub-minimum wage but did well on his last time study and is currently earning $7.80 an hour, Montana's minimum wage.

But foes of Section 14 (c) have hopes for a new bill that's now before Congress that would repeal Section 14 (c) and make sub-minimum wages illegal across the board.

""Meaningful work deserves fair pay,"" the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Gregg Harper, R.-Miss., told NBC News. ""This dated provision unjustly prohibits workers with disabilities from reaching their full potential.""

The bill is opposed by trade associations for the employers of the disabled, and past attempts to change the law have failed. But Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind and a foe of the sheltered workshop system, is cautiously optimistic that this time the bill will pass, and end what he called a ""two-tiered system.""

That system, explained Maurer, says ""'Americans who have disabilities aren't as valuable as other people,' and that's wrong. These folks have value. We should recognize that value.""

That’s a good thing.","Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and lead counsel in the “Sister Wives” polygamy case.

The decision this month by a federal court striking down the criminalization of polygamy in Utah was met with a mix of rejoicing and rage. What was an emancipating decision for thousands of plural families was denounced as the final descent into a moral abyss by others.

Former senator Rick Santorum was among the social conservatives trying to claim the moral high ground. He tweeted on Sunday: “Some times I hate it when what I predict comes true” — referring to his 2003 claim that legalizing “consensual sex within your home” would lead to the legalization of polygamy and “undermine the fabric of our society.” (On Wednesday, with no apparent sense of self-contradiction, he expressed outrage over the removal of a Nativity scene at a South Carolina military base, tweeting: “Our Constitution protects free exercise of religion. No govt entity/official has the right to limit that.”)

It’s true that the Utah ruling is one of the latest examples of a national trend away from laws that impose a moral code. There is a difference, however, between the demise of morality laws and the demise of morality. This distinction appears to escape social conservatives nostalgic for a time when the government dictated whom you could live with or sleep with. But the rejection of moral codes is no more a rejection of morality than the rejection of speech codes is a rejection of free speech. Our morality laws are falling, and we are a better nation for it.

In the Utah case, I was the lead counsel for the Browns, the polygamous family featured in the TLC reality program “Sister Wives.” They are members of the Apostolic United Brethren Church, and they have one marriage license and three “spiritual” marriages among them. After the first episode of “Sister Wives” aired, state prosecutors threatened to bring charges under a Utah law that made it a crime when a married person “purports to marry another person or cohabits with another person.” The Browns were under investigation for two years and were publicly called felons before they took prosecutors to court in a challenge to the constitutionality of the law.

The case was never about the recognition of multiple marriages or the acceptance of the religious values underlying this plural family. It was about the right of consenting adults to make decisions for themselves and their families. Judge Clark Waddoups, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, ruled that the criminalization of cohabitation clearly violated the due process clause and the free exercise clause of the United States Constitution.

In doing so, he departed from the prevailing precedent: the Supreme Court’s opinion in Reynolds v. United States , which upheld a ban on polygamy in 1879. Waddoups wrote that courts today are “less inclined to allow majoritarian coercion of unpopular or disliked minority groups, especially when blatant racism . . . religious prejudice, or some other constitutionally suspect motivation, can be discovered behind such legislation.”

Indeed, in Reynolds, religious and racial prejudice were vividly on display. The court unleashed a tirade of indignation and condemnation, stating, “Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people.” Just a few years later, the Supreme Court also upheld the criminalization of mixed-race relations in Pace v. Alabama .

The idea that polygamy was a “barbarous practice” and contrary to democratic principles drove the demand in the late 1880s and ’90s that Utah outlaw it as a condition of statehood. And in Mormon Church v. United States (1890), the Supreme Court labeled polygamy as “abhorrent to the sentiments and feelings of the civilized world.”

The stigma attached to polygamy continued to distort legal analysis into this century. As recently as 2006, Utah Justice Ronald Nehring began his opinion in a ruling upholding the criminalization of polygamy by lamenting, “No matter how widely known the natural wonders of Utah may become, no matter the extent that our citizens earn acclaim for their achievements, in the public mind Utah will forever be shackled to the practice of polygamy.” Nehring frankly admitted that this hostility “has been present in my consciousness, and I suspect has been a brooding presence . . . in the minds of my colleagues, from the moment we opened the parties’ briefs.” Rather than overcome that prejudice, Nehring not only yielded to it but warned any Utah judge of the peril of being the first to recognize the rights of polygamists: “I have not been alone in speculating what the consequences might be were the highest court in the State of Utah the first in the nation to proclaim that polygamy enjoys constitutional protection.”

Well, it wasn’t. A federal judge in Utah assumed that burden. Gov. Gary Herbert objected to the court making “decisions on social issues.” (He has not yet announced an appeal.) Waddoups, however, was not dictating a decision on a social issue but rather saying that governments could not impose a single version of morality. He limited prosecution under Utah’s anti-polygamy law to cases of bigamy, where someone acquires more than one marriage license — which is an offense more common to monogamous couples, who care about state recognition, than polygamists, who care about spiritual recognition.

Across the country, the era of morality codes is coming to an inglorious end. This year, the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act barring the federal recognition of same-sex marriage. And this week, the New Mexico Supreme Court and another federal judge in Utah struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in those states — bringing the number to 18 states (plus the District of Columbia) where same-sex couples can marry. Meanwhile, Virginia recently repealed its 1877 cohabitation law and Colorado replealed a criminal adultery law from the 1850s — both relics of a time when states used their criminal codes to force citizens to comply with the religious values of their neighbors.

Most states have wisely turned away from absurd laws criminalizing masturbation and fornication. Obscenity laws have also been curtailed by the Supreme Court in deference to the First Amendment.

Still rightly on the books are laws against bestiality, which involves an obvious lack of consent as well as manifest harm. Likewise, incest bans are based on claims of medical, not moral, harm.

Once any crimes or abuses are stripped away in cases like the Browns’, what remains is religious animus. Yet, polygamy is widely practiced around the world by millions of families and was condoned by every major religion — from Judaism to Christianity to Islam — at one time. While plural families are called polygamists in our popular lexicon, “polygamy” actually refers to a broad array of plural relationships, from polygyny (one husband and multiple wives, like the Browns) to polyandry (a single wife and multiple husbands) to polyamory (couples who reject the exclusivity of sexual relations). The vast majority of these families are based on consenting relations among adults without abusive or criminal histories.

Critics often ignore these other plural relationships (and even polygynists like the Browns) in favor of a stereotype of “compound polygamists,” living in remote walled communities where women appear captive and molestation flourishes. It is Warren Jeffs, not Kody Brown, whom critics want to invoke in debating decriminalization — a sinister figure in a secluded compound where women wear prairie outfits and hairdos from the 19th century.

Obviously, there will always be abusers like Jeffs among polygamists — just as there are abusers among monogamists. However, it is no more persuasive to criminalize all plural relationships because of a small number of abusive individuals than it would be logical to outlaw monogamy based on the convicted spouse- and child-abusers in conventional marriages.

One of the great ironies about the focus on compound polygamists is the circular logic of criminalization. The government first declared polygamists felons and then pointed to their hiding as evidence of their guilt. But decriminalization will allow these families to be plural, open and law-abiding as they reintegrate into society.

In truth, 19th-century Americans were no more moral than we are today. It simply appeared that way with the imposition of official morals, including (as Santorum recalls so fondly) being told whom we could love in our own homes. It is not a single moral voice that is heard today but a chorus of voices. Each speaks to its own values but joins around a common article of faith: the belief that morality is better left to parents than to politicians.

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",Obama strongly defends phone and Internet surveillance,"WASHINGTON — From the time he stepped onto the national stage, Barack Obama presented himself as a civil libertarian who would take a different path from that of his predecessor, who authorized surveillance on Americans in the fight against terrorism. “It is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11,” Obama said in a 2007 speech that outlined his vision for national security.

But revelations this week of a massive phone and Internet data collection program illustrated that as president, Obama has allowed the government to sweep up vast amounts of information about its citizens while establishing some checks on executive power.

The result has been a surveillance regime that largely continues the policies of the later years of George W. Bush’s administration, while provoking far less dissent from Congress.

Indeed, a major part of Obama’s national security legacy is likely to be as the president who institutionalized the broad powers in targeted killings abroad and in surveillance at home that Bush claimed for the federal government after the Sept. 11 attacks. Once seen as Republican initiatives, they are now endorsed by both parties.

Obama defended the extensive surveillance Friday, saying he’d come into office skeptical and had bolstered congressional oversight and judicial review.

“We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of safeguards,” he said at a news conference in San Jose. “I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience. We’re going to have to make choices as a society.”

Critics say Obama has not only embraced tactics he denounced as senator, but has also set up a framework that cements their place in law. They note he has often used the same justifications that he once blasted as the Bush administration’s “false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand.”

“Clearly, he took a critical stance toward surveillance as a senator. That has been all but absent from his policies as president,” said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the American Federation of Scientists. “He has not really articulated or tried to justify the changes in his public positions. So there is a something of a credibility gap that has emerged as a result.”

The Obama administration’s programs could soon be reviewed by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent federal panel that advises the president and lawmakers. The board, without confirmed appointees, had been essentially defunct for years. Obama waited until December 2011 to nominate David Medine as chairman. He was confirmed last month.

Medine declined to comment on the surveillance, but said he had requested a classified briefing. He said the board was “very energized and focused” on carrying out its mission, which he said seemed “ever more timely.”

Although his statements as a candidate were cheered by liberals in his party, it was also clear that Obama was far more constitutional law scholar than civil libertarian. Obama’s earliest criticism of the Bush-era programs focused more on the need for oversight by Congress and the courts than worries about Big Brother.

Obama continued that emphasis Friday. He sought to reassure Americans that “nobody is listening” to their telephone calls, but most of his remarks focused not on the substance of the government’s efforts to amass data but on process and legal structures. He made repeated references to the role of Congress and the courts in supervising the

programs, touting the “checks and balances” created in recent years, some of which were put in place in the last two years of Bush’s tenure.

“That’s not to suggest that you just say, ‘Trust me. We’re doing the right thing. We know who the bad guys are,’” Obama said. “And the reason that’s not how it works is because we’ve got congressional oversight and judicial oversight.”

Advertisement

That focus on process could also be seen in Obama’s voting record in the Senate on surveillance, which was a study in compromise.

In 2005, Obama spoke out against a reauthorization of the Patriot Act, which enhanced the power of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But Obama’s key objection was about a lack of judicial review of searches, not about how much information was gathered.

Advertisement

“This legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law,” he said. “No judge will hear their plea; no jury will hear their case.”

Obama eventually voted for a compromise that allowed court review of national security letters, which the FBI and other federal agencies use to demand such records as lists of phone calls. The compromise also added some restrictions to Section 215 requests, secret court orders for business records, such as the one leaked this week that exposed the government’s mass collection of phone records.

Advertisement

In 2007, Obama voted against the Protect America Act, the bill that empowered authorities to conduct the sort of Internet surveillance on foreigners also uncovered this week. But a year later, Obama voted to renew those powers as part of compromise bill to overhaul some surveillance practices.

The legislation established a legal framework and congressional oversight for wiretapping without warrants, a step critics say essentially codified the practice. It also brought lawmakers and the courts into process.

Advertisement

“The programs today are more or less what they were in 2007, 2008,” said Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas who studies national security law.

Congressional oversight and judicial review have not led to a shift in policy, experts note. The surveillance tends to have bipartisan support, and the secret federal court that reviews the government’s actions has not put up any known roadblocks.

Advertisement

That may be in part because lawmakers have little reason to balk in an age where the expectation of privacy is a shrinking notion. In a National Journal poll earlier this month, 85% of adults said it was likely that their “communications history, like phone calls, emails and Internet use” was “available for businesses, government, individuals and other groups to access” without consent.

With apparent court and congressional sanction, and broad public acceptance, some said, it would be dicier for a president not to exercise the powers at his disposal.

“There’s real risk that people might try to hurt America, and no president is going to ignore that. He’s not going to pull back on these programs unless they don’t work or there’s evidence they’re not legal,” Chesney said. “Can you imagine if a president went in and said, ‘I know Congress signed off on this, and courts approved it, but I’m not comfortable with this, therefore, we’re shutting it down.’? Now, that would leak.”

In a brief, three-line order Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gary Feess formally lifted the binding agreement the U.S. Department of Justice imposed on the LAPD in 2001, which spelled out dozens of major reforms the police agency had to implement and frequent audits it was required to undergo by a monitor who reported to Feess.

The dismissal of the so-called consent decree, which arose largely out of the Rampart corruption scandal and addressed basic problems of accountability that stretched back decades, delivered a largely symbolic, but nonetheless important milestone for the LAPD as it continues to disassociate itself from a past marked by abuses and turmoil. Following revelations in 1999 that officers assigned to the LAPD’s Rampart Division were implicated in serious misconduct, including physical abuse of suspects, evidence tampering and perjury, public trust in the police plummeted and federal officials responded to calls from a growing chorus of critics for intervention.

L.A. NOW LIVE: Discuss what comes next at 9 a.m.

Though many in the department bitterly disliked the idea of federal oversight, Department of Justice officials threatened to sue the city for complete control of the LAPD if department and city officials resisted the idea of the consent decree.

“In these last 12 years the Los Angeles Police Department did not just comply with the consent decree, they took it to heart. They used it as a guide to change their culture,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at a late afternoon news conference with Police Chief Charlie Beck and members of the Police Commission, the civilian board that oversees the department. “The entire department, from the officers on the beat in the neighborhoods to the top brass downtown, have made these reforms their reforms.”

Advertisement

Although his predecessor, Bernard Parks, was lukewarm on it, former Chief William J. Bratton, who ran the department from late 2002 to 2009, embraced the consent decree. An outsider hired on his reputation for overhauling large, troubled police departments, Bratton used the decree as a ready-made blueprint for remaking the LAPD. Under the terms of the decree, the LAPD was required to revamp its tools for tracking officer misconduct, investigations into cases involving force by officers, training, an independent watchdog office and more.

In 2006, however, as the decree was set to expire, Feess angrily rebuked the department for what he found to be its slow pace of reform and extended the decree for five years.

As the years wore on, Bratton and other senior LAPD officials grew increasingly impatient with the judge’s refusal to loosen his grip on the department and called openly to be let out from under the consent decree. The department, they argued, had implemented the vast majority of the reforms called for in the decree, proved its ability to operate responsibly and needed the freedom to run on its own. Bratton pointed out frequently that about two-thirds of the department’s roughly 10,000 officers had joined the force while it was under the decree — a sign, he said, that the department had, in fact, broken with its unsavory past.

On the eve of Bratton’s departure, Feess relented and approved a transitional plan that called on the Los Angeles Police Commission, which oversees the LAPD, to assume responsibility for keeping tabs on the department’s efforts to fully implement the few issues that had not yet been completely addressed. If Department of Justice lawyers were unsatisfied with the commission’s oversight, the agreement allowed them to object and bring the department back before Feess.

Advertisement

With Wednesday’s order, Feess severed that remaining authority, leaving the LAPD fully as its own master for the first time in 12 years. With the transition agreement completed, Feess had been waiting for Department of Justice officials to file necessary paperwork before taking his final step, police officials said.

Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, praised Bratton, Beck and Villaraigosa for their “stewardship” in seeing the consent decree through. The reform package, he said in a statement, has “accomplished its purpose by and large. This is no longer your father’s Los Angeles Police Department. The LAPD has made serious culture changes.”

Advertisement

Villagra, however, cautioned that the department must guard against backsliding into its old ways and had more work to do on “persistent racial disparities in policing” and officers’ treatment of homeless people.

Andrea Ordin, the president of Police Commission, echoed Villagra, saying at the news conference that “there’s lots more to do, we know that. But it should be done by the department.”

Advertisement

Beck credited the department’s officers for adopting the changes imposed on them from the outside. He reserved special praise for an advisor, Gerald Chaleff, who worked closely with him and Bratton on putting the decree in place. “Without him, this new day would never have dawned,” Beck said of Chaleff.

“The consent decree has made this a department that I am proud to hand over to my children,” said Beck, who has a daughter and son on the force. “It has been the catalyst for incredible change in my Police Department. We’ve become accountable, we’ve become transparent and we’ve become more effective than we’ve ever been.”

Story highlights People fasting in D.C. to protest inaction on immigration reform with path to citizenship ""Fast for Families"" participants have gone about two weeks surviving only on water Sally Kohn: Strong majority of Americans support reform, Republicans coming around Kohn: But the holdup is House Speaker John Boehner refusing to bring reform to a vote

Editor’s Note: Sally Kohn is a progressive activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter at @sallykohn.

(CNN) —

In a tent on the lawn just in front of the United States Capitol, immigration reform advocates are entering their second week without food to protest congressional inaction on legislation that would create a road to citizenship for 11 million aspiring Americans.

The core group at the “Fast for Families” has gone 13 days surviving only on water — including Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, Dae Joong Yoon of the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium and Cristian Avila with the group Mi Familia Vota. They have pledged to continue their fast until immigration reform is enacted by Congress or until doctors tell them their lives are at risk.

Sally Kohn

Last week, Vice President Joe Biden and Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council in the White House, visited the fasters. This week, during a speech in San Francisco about the urgent need for immigration reform, President Obama gave a shout-out to those fasting. The president said, “We hear you. The whole country is with you.”

Which is, of course, partially true. The fact is that a strong majority of Americans do indeed support the goals of those fasting and want a comprehensive immigration law that includes a road to citizenship. According to a recent poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute, at least 73% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans support such a measure. Not only that, but about three-in-four voters in key Republican-represented swing Congressional districts also support immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.

Win McNamee/Getty Image Eliseo Medina, who is fasting, says he has ""a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery.""

So who, exactly, isn’t with the fasters? Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. If the immigration reform bill already passed by the Senate were brought for a vote in the House, it would likely pass — because 29 House Republicans have indicated their support, including many from those swing districts and districts with growing Latino communities. Yet Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner refuses to give the bill a vote.

Yeah, you read that correctly — a bill that would bring relief to millions of undocumented immigrant families just in time for the holidays, a bill that a strong majority of voters in both parties support, a bill that everyone from community groups to business groups resoundingly supports, a bill that would actually pass both Houses of Congress and become law despite our historic levels of gridlock — that bill isn’t even being brought up for a vote because John Boehner just doesn’t want to do it. Such is the sad state of so-called leadership in the Republican Party today.

If you haven’t seen the video in which teen activists confront Boehner while he’s eating his breakfast at a diner and tell him their stories of how immigrant families are being ripped apart every day in America, it’s worth a watch. Boehner says he’ll “try to find a way to move a bill forward.” But in fact, he has been the one singlehandedly blocking a vote.

So the brave souls in the tent in front of the Capitol continue not to eat. Are they hungry? Sure. But, as Eliseo Medina, a son of Mexican migrant farmworkers, told the Washington Post, “(T)here is a deeper hunger within me, a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery among those who come here to escape poverty and violence in search of the American dream.”

The juxtaposition is powerful. At a diner near the Capitol, you have Boehner casually dumping salt on his plate of food while seeming completely uninterested in the plight of the two teens who are telling him how their families have been torn apart by America’s broken immigration policies. In a tent near the Capitol, advocates are literally starving themselves to protest Boehner’s callous inaction.

This Thanksgiving, may we remember the story of our nation’s founding — not always a simple story for all involved, and certainly not since, but at it essence, a story of people coming to a new land seeking new opportunity.

And when we sit down to eat our turkey and fixings, may we remember those who are going without food to support the millions of aspiring Americans whose families cannot be together this holiday season because of our broken laws.

And may we pray that John Boehner, sitting with his own family and saying grace, can find it in his heart and political calculus to bestow grace on others — and finally let immigration reform have a vote.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/martin_luther_king_01.shtml,,[],Martin Luther King's Style of Leadership,"There were many leaders in the civil rights struggle, but Martin Luther King was more than just the most conspicuous -and eloquent - among them. Peter Ling examines King's leadership role during his campaign for peace and justice.

The 'great leader' myth

Thanks to the miracle of television, Martin Luther King Junior is vividly remembered as an inspirational speaker, whose leadership was seemingly rooted in oratory. Speeches such as the 'I Have A Dream' speech at the civil rights march on Washington of August 1963 galvanised people of all races, and created an unprecedented bipartisan coalition for anti-racist legislation.

King undoubtedly spoke to, and for, African Americans, and their mounting challenge to white oppression sprang from hearing his non-violent call to arms. When he died the non-violent movement seemed unable to continue without him, and this deepened the impression that he was its essential leader. His leadership, however, was always being questioned during his lifetime, and this has continued since his death.

Movement activists, particularly militant black separatists, never saw King as their one great leader. When his lieutenants introduced him as a 'Moses' for African Americans, for example, it rankled. Hearing Wyatt Walker, a key aide, introduce King publicly as the people's saviour prompted Bob Moses of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to ask: 'Don't you think we need lots of leaders?'

Privately, King's supporters knew that non-violence was not an outlook everyone shared, and Walker amused King by telling him of how one black Virginian had responded to a white bus driver who wanted him to enter his bus by the back door. A massive figure, the man had picked up the driver with one hand and said bluntly: 'Know two things. I can break your neck, and I ain't one of Martin Luther King's non-violent Negroes.'

'Privately, King's supporters knew that non-violence was not an outlook everyone shared ...'

This recognition that King's non-violent approach was just one tendency within a larger movement - and that he was created by the movement, rather than being the creator of it - has become a staple of recent scholarship. It was not King but other local figures, for instance, who planned the famous Montgomery bus boycott of 1955.

The first student protesters of the 1960s sit-ins similarly denied that they were following King's orders, and it was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), rather than King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), that launched the freedom rides of 1961 - and SNCC volunteers who ensured their success. Furthermore, when members of the SNCC asked King to join them on the ride into Mississippi, he pompously declined, saying: 'I think I should choose the time and place of my Golgotha'. Thereafter, they referred to him sarcastically as 'De Lawd' - and mistrusted a leader who preferred to cheer from the sidelines.

The topic of Obama%27s race has been front-and-center throughout his presidency

His most compelling remarks on race over the years include reflections as a young man grappling with his identity

Obama%27s remarks on racial issues have been lauded by supporters%2C criticized by detractors as divisive

WASHINGTON — President Obama is no stranger to talking about race.

As the nation's first African-American president, Obama's racial identity has remained front-and-center through the first 4½ years of his presidency. He's spoken of his own improbable story as evidence of how far the nation has come, even as he's battled with detractors who have spoken of his ""otherness"" as a handicap to leading the nation.

When the president steps to the dais at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday to deliver remarks marking the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, he will undoubtedly note that his own rise connects directly to the blood, tears and work of Martin Luther King Jr.and his civil rights contemporaries.

Over the years, his most compelling remarks on race stretch from reflections as a young man grappling with his identity to his thoughts last month after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.

Some of these comments have been lauded by his supporters as thoughtful and heartfelt, while others have derided them as divisive rhetoric that stoke the nation's continued racial divide.

July 1995, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance

Before launching his political career, Obama penned a book delving into his own journey as the son of a black African father and white American mother:

""The emotions between the races could never be pure; even love was tarnished by the desire to find in the other some element that was missing in ourselves. Whether we sought out our demons or salvation, the other race would always remain just that: menacing, alien, and apart.""

March 5, 2007, Selma, Ala.

The then long-shot presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama spoke from the pulpit of the historic Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church of his own claim to a place in the civil rights movement:

""I'm here because somebody marched. I'm here because you all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the Moses generation; but we've got to remember, now, that Joshua still had a job to do. ""

March 18, 2008, Philadelphia

After video of Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, making a series of racially controversial statements surfaced in the heat of the presidential race, Obama spoke about race in the USA:

""I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother — a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.

""These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love.""

July 22, 2009, news conference

About six months into his first term, Obama was asked during a prime-time news conference about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates, a noted African-American scholar who was arrested outside his own home:

""I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that (Gates case). But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.""





March 23, 2012, Washington

President Obama weighed in on the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin for the first time more than a month after the killing had spurred a national uproar:

""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.""

May 19, 2013, at Morehouse College, Atlanta

Obama delivered the commencement address at Morehouse, the country's pre-eminent historically black college and the alma mater of King:

""Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there's no longer any room for excuses.""

July 19, 2013, Washington

After George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, Obama tried to explain African Americans' response:

""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. ... When you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain. It's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and history that doesn't go away.""

President Obama says immigration plan can be split up if that will help it pass

Obama faced protesters over deportations

The Senate has passed an immigration bill%3B the Republican-run House has not

While urging House Republicans to back new immigration legislation, President Obama said Monday he is willing to split a bill into pieces if that will get it passed.

""That's okay,"" Obama said during a speech in San Francisco. ""It's Thanksgiving. We can carve that bird into multiple pieces — a drumstick here, breast meat there.""

But Obama also said a final package must include certain elements, including a proposed pathway to citizenship that has drawn opposition from Republicans.

Said Obama: ""As long as all the pieces get done, soon, and we actually deliver on the core values we have been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it.""

Obama caught flak during his speech as protesters yelled at him over the number of deportations during his time in office.

""Stop deportations! Stop deportations!"" protesters chanted.

The president said he is bound by the law. When someone yelled he had the ""power"" to stop deportations, Obama replied, ""Actually, I don't. And that's why we're here.""

Obama told the protesters that it's ""easy"" to shout about problems, but he is seeking a harder path designed ""to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting.""

The Democratic-led Senate passed an immigration bill earlier this year; the Republican-run House has not taken action on the issue.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said Republicans want to take a ""step-by-step"" approach to immigration challenges.

""The American people are skeptical of big, comprehensive bills, and frankly, they should be,"" Boehner said last week. ""The only way to make sure immigration reform works this time is to address these complicated issues one step at a time.""

Obama, who has offered the piecemeal approach before, said a final immigration package should include strengthened border security, punishment for businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers, and a modernization of the immigration system.

He also advocated ""a pathway to earned citizenship"" for people who are already in the country illegally, a sticking point in past immigration debates in Congress.

Many Republicans oppose a pathway to citizenship, likening it to amnesty to lawbreakers,

Neither Obama nor Boehner have specified what pieces of an incremental immigration plan might look like.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who opposed the immigration bill in the Senate, said the issue surfaces at a time of high unemployment and flat wages.

""The president must be asked — by media and lawmakers alike -- how he can possibly justify a plan that will double the flow of immigrant workers at a time when 91.5 million Americans are outside the labor force?"" Sessions said.

During his speech, Obama said immigration is not just a problem along the U.S.-Mexican border, saying, ""We're blessed with immigrants from all over the world.""

Obama spoke at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, part of a three-day trip focused mainly on campaign fundraising. (Ong was a flight attendant who died on 9/11.)

Here's an excerpt from an August 6 report in the Arizona Republic (http://www.azcentral.com/...):



Obama foes at one point sang, ""Bye-Bye Black Sheep,"" a derogatory reference to the president's skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!""

Bye-Bye black sheep? I think those wingnuts got their nursery rhymes mixed up. I believe they were referencing the line that goes ""Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?"" Perhaps they meant to chant ""Bye-bye black bird?"" Those are the words to a song that's been around for decades. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the fans at the University of Kentucky's home basketball games would sing, ""Bye-Bye, Blackbird"" when a black player on the opposing team fouled out. It's a damned shame those tools in Phoenix were so dumb and hateful they couldn't even get their racist chants straight.

And please note the language in the sign held by Ms. Bartram. Sounds pretty racist and anti-Muslim doesn't it? But check out this quote from her later in the story:



“Obama is ruining American values. He is ruining the Constitution. He needs to go back to where he came from because obviously, he is a liar,” she said. “I am not racist. I am part Indian. Obama’s half Black, half White.”

A liar who needs to go back where he came from? Ruining the Constitution? ""I am not a racist,"" she said. I guess in her narrow mind, nobody who is part Indian can be full racist and that you can't practice racism against the President because he's half white. Sadly, this ignorant young woman is only 17. Some say America's future is in good hands, but I'm not so sure. One can only hope.

And finally, there was this tidbit from the Republic's story:



Judy Burris said that she blames Obama for racism in America reaching heights not seen since the 1960s Civil-Rights Era. “We have gone back so many years,” she said. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

Say what? She hates President Obama and blames him for American racism?! That's is such the Republican way: Blaming others for the evil and hatred you cultivate and perpetrate. Sad.

It's reprehensible that an American President has to endure the disrespect and hate that Barack Obama sees daily. I don't know for sure, but I don't think people in South Africa dissed Nelson Mandela this much when he became that formerly Apartheid nation's first black President in 1994.

You'd like to think that if for no other reason than the office he holds, the President of the United States of America would be immune from such repugnant racist attacks, but he's not. In fact, this bold ignorance makes it clear to me why some refer to our country as ""AmeriKKKa.""

I want to believe we're better than that, but when bigots openly taunt our President with racist epithets and freely give their names for attribution with those vile statements like those in the Arizona Republic I just don't know. Our nation is still very much a racist nation. Sigh."

At the unveiling of a statue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol Wednesday, President Obama said it is because of people like her that he “stands here today.” (Nicki Demarco/The Washington Post)

She was a seamstress whose simple and defiant act more than half a century ago galvanized a movement and propelled her into history.

On Wednesday, President Obama and congressional leaders unveiled a nine-foot bronze statue of Rosa Louise Parks, making her the first black woman honored with a full-length statue in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall.

Parks, born 100 years ago this month in Tuskegee, Ala., was a civil rights icon whose activism led to the desegregation of public facilities across the South and the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, portions of which were being argued before the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the statue was being dedicated.

It was a congressional homecoming of sorts for Parks, who worked as an aide to Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) for nearly two decades in his congressional office in Detroit. And when she died in 2005, she became the first woman and second black person to be honored with a casket viewing in the Capitol Rotunda. Slain U.S. Capitol Police officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut was the first African American so honored, in 1998.

The statue renders her as legions of schoolchildren will probably think of her — sitting primly with ankles crossed, hands in her lap, clutching a purse and staring straight ahead.

Obama joined with House and Senate leaders as well as relatives of Parks in unveiling the statue, which comes as the Postal Service released a stamp this month honoring the longtime civil rights leader.

Obama drew a direct connection between his presidency and Parks’s activism.

“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do. She tells us that we all have responsibilities, to ourselves and to one another,” he said.

Recalling Parks’s years of activism, he said, “She reminds us that this is how change happens — not mainly through the exploits of the famous and the powerful, but through the countless acts of often anonymous courage and kindness and fellow feeling and responsibility that continually, stubbornly, expand our conception of justice — our conception of what is possible.”

The Rosa Parks legend dates back to 1955, when Parks, then 42, refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., and was arrested.

Parks would later recall in an interview the words she exchanged with the police officer.

“I said, ‘Why do you push us around?’ He said, ‘I do not know, but the law is the law and you are under arrest.’ ”

Her cause and her case catapulted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence and led to a year-long boycott, stirring thousands of African Americans to organize and to protest against segregation.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1956 that Alabama’s segregated bus system was unconstitutional about a year after Parks refused to give up her seat.

Lionized as the “mother of the civil rights movement,” Parks became an iconic figure, praised for her “quiet dignity that was itself an argument against unfair treatment under the law.

“With this statue, we affirm that the courage and the cause of Rosa Parks not only earned her a place in the hearts of all Americans, but a permanent place among the other figures in this hall of national memory,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Rosa Parks may not have led us to victory against the British. She didn’t give a single speech in the Senate or the House, or blast off into space, or point the way in the Western wilderness. Yet, with quiet courage and unshakable resolve, she did something no less important on a cold Alabama evening in 1955.”

The statue, sculpted by Eugene Daub and co-designed by Rob Firmin, was the first full-size statue to be commissioned and paid for by Congress since 1873.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) called the dedication “a red-letter day for the American people.”

“Here in the Old Hall, she casts an unlikely silhouette: unassuming in a lineup of proud stares, challenging us once more to look up and draw strength from stillness,” Boehner said, noting the long march of history that led to this moment. “So we place her here, in a chamber where many fought to prevent a day like this . . . and right in the gaze of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. It brings to mind Lady Liberty herself, rising amid the titans of finance and presiding over New York Harbor, the promise of America clear for all to see.”

President Bill Clinton awarded Parks a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, recalling that, as a 9-year-old, he was moved to begin sitting in the back of the segregated Arkansas public buses in solidarity with Parks and other African Americans.

“We do well by placing a statue of her here,” Obama said. “But we can do no greater honor to her memory than to carry forward the power of her principle and a courage born of conviction.”

(CNN) —

A federal judge ordered Monday that the New York Police Department’s controversial stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it violates the Constitution in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos.

But city officials bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects, and vowed to appeal the ruling, contending the policy has cut crime.

“You’re not going to see a change in tactics overnight,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Monday, saying it would take time to implement the judge’s changes even if an appellate court doesn’t temporarily halt it.

Asked if he hopes an appeal will delay the order until he leaves office next year, Bloomberg said: “Boy, I hope so, because I wouldn’t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.”

Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, ruling on a class-action lawsuit, wrote that the policy violated plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion.

She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs’$2 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection.

The police department had said that the policy – in which police stop, question and frisk people they considered suspicious – is used to deter crime.

“The city’s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,” Scheindlin wrote. “In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting ‘the right people’ is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the United States Constitution.”

Coupling Monday’s ruling with a similar decision in January, she ordered that the policy be altered so that stops are based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner.

Among her orders:

– She appointed Peter Zimroth, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, to develop and oversee near-term reforms, including changes to the NYPD’s policies and training.

– In a pilot project, NYPD patrol officers in five precincts – one per borough – must wear video cameras. The chosen precincts would be those with the most stops in 2012. “The recordings should … alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the police and the black and Hispanic communities,” and “will be equally helpful to members of NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate behavior,” Scheindlin wrote.

– Other, longer-term reforms would come after community input.

NYPD: Names of innocent to be erased from stop-and-frisk records

The lawsuit, filed in 2008, went to trial for nine weeks this spring. The lead plaintiff in the case was David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice – once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit.

Another plaintiff, Leroy Downs, described to CNN how he, too, was confronted and frisked as he sat on the steps in front of his own home.

“The officers drove past me, went up the street, reversed, came back, jumped out and they approached me,” Downs said, adding that the officers told him, “You look like you (were) smoking weed.”

Downs said he told the officers, “Come on, I’m talking on a cell phone.”

“They cursed at me and said, ‘Get against the fence,’ and started pushing me toward the fence and commenced to searching me,” added Downs. Police found nothing on Downs.

“I’ve been so much of this throughout my life, that’s one of the reasons why I took part in this – I just want it to stop,” Downs said.

David Ourlicht, also among those stopped, reacted to the judge’s ruling with tears and with an assessment: “This is a big thing for New York, but as far as for America as a whole, it shows the polarization of people of color in this country, as how we’re viewed.”

In her ruling, Scheindlin said more than 80% of the stops involved blacks or Hispanics. The NYPD made more than 4.4 million total stops under the policy from 2004 to June 2012.

She wrote that the NYPD carried out more stops where there were more black and Hispanic residents, at a rate disproportionate with crime rates. She also wrote that the department has an unwritten policy of targeting “the right people” for stops – encouraging, in practice, the targeting of young blacks and Hispanics based on their prevalence in local crime complaints.

“No one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life,” she wrote. “Those who are routinely subjected to stops are overwhelmingly people of color, and they are justifiably troubled to be singled out when many of them have done nothing to attract the unwanted attention.”

Officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas

The city will ask the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to block the ruling until an appeal is heard, city attorney Michael Cardozo said Monday.

The ruling hardly impressed Bloomberg and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who called Scheindlin’s finding of racial profiling “disturbing and offensive.”

“We do not engage in racial profiling. It is prohibited by law,” Kelly said. “We train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop, and I can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop.”

The policy “is certainly a tool that every police officer needs throughout America,” Kelly said.

“If you see something suspicious, you pay your police officers to ask a question, stop to inquire. To the extent that this significantly impacts on that, I think you’re going to have a problem, not only here, but across America.”

Bloomberg said the policy was one of a number of programs that helped the city’s murder rate drop – it’s 50% below the rate when he took office nearly 12 years ago, he said.

The mayor said “we want to match the stops to where the reports of crime are.”

“One of the problems we have in our society today is that victims and perpetrators of crime are (disproportionately) young minority men – that’s just a fact,” he said. “If there’s any administration that’s ever worked hard on that, I think it’s ours … we’re trying to do something about it.

“That has nothing to do with, however, where we stop people. We go to where the reports of crime are. Those unfortunately happen to be poor neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods. But that’s not the original objective or the intent or how we get there. We get there when there’s a crime reported, and we will continue to do that.”

The trial, which ended in May, included testimony from men who said police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops.

Closing arguments gave conflicting accounts of stop-and-frisk incidents. While attorneys for the city argued that one man was stopped because he appeared to be smoking marijuana, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was simply talking on a cell phone.

Another man was reportedly stopped because he fit the description of a wanted man in a high-crime area with a recent string of burglaries, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was more than a mile from where the burglaries occurred and that the last burglary in that area occurred more than 25 days earlier.

According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, the Police Department logged its 5 millionth stop-and-frisk under Mayor Michael Bloomberg in March.

(AP) — Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said emphatically Saturday that the Boy Scouts of America should not soften its strict policy barring gay members, and dismissed the idea of bending the organization to the whims of “popular culture.”

Mr. Perry, the country’s longest-serving governor, is an Eagle Scout, and in 2008 he wrote the book “On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For.” It detailed his deep love for the organization and explained why it should continue to embrace traditional conservative values — including excluding openly gay members and leaders.

The governor spoke at the Texas Scouts’ 64th annual Report to State, where hundreds of scouts from across the state filled the State House of Representatives to announce their delegations’ recent accomplishments. Mr. Perry had addressed the gathering several times before, most recently in 2010.

The Scouts’ national leadership announced last week that it was considering ending the mandatory exclusion of gay members. The group could allow different religious and civic groups that sponsor Scout units to decide for themselves whether to maintain the exclusion or open up their membership."

The case is the second this year in which a three-star Air Force general has raised lawmakers’ hackles by effectively pardoning an officer found guilty of sexual assault, a crime many experts see as a growing problem in the military.

This time the general is a former astronaut who has served as a role model for other female officers as she climbed into the upper ranks of the Air Force.

Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms, who as a crew member of the space shuttle Endeavour became the first U.S. military woman to travel in space in 1993, was poised to make another ascent in her career in March when the White House nominated her to become vice commander of the Air Force’s Space Command.

But her nomination has been blocked by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, who wants to examine Helms’s previously unpublicized decision to overturn the conviction, on charges of aggravated sexual assault, of a captain at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Helms’s action mirrors another case that has drawn angry attention from Congress and prompted legislators to propose landmark changes in military law. In that instance, victims’ advocates called for the firing of Lt. Gen. Craig A. Franklin, commander of the Third Air Force in Europe, after he tossed out the sexual-assault conviction of a star fighter pilot in February.

In both cases, the generals ignored the recommendations of their legal advisers and overruled a jury’s findings — without publicly revealing why. Neither general was a judge and neither observed the trials, but they intervened to grant clemency before the convictions could be heard by an appeals court.

Helms explained in an internal memo that surfaced only recently that she reversed the jury after reviewing the evidence and finding the captain’s testimony more credible.

Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for McCaskill, said the senator is blocking Helms’s nomination until she receives more information about the general’s decision.

“As the senator works to change the military justice system to better protect survivors of sexual assault and hold perpetrators accountable, she wants to ensure that cases in which commanders overturned jury verdicts . . . are given the appropriate scrutiny,” Pusateri said.

A string of abuse scandals

The Air Force has been rattled by a string of sexual-abuse scandals over the past year, including the rape and assault of dozens of recruits by basic-training instructors at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

The latest embarrassment struck Sunday, when Arlington County police arrested the chief of the Air Force’s sexual-assault prevention branch and charged him with sexual battery. Police said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was drunk when he approached a woman in a Crystal City parking lot and grabbed her breasts and buttocks. Maj. Mary Danner-Jones, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said Krusinski was “removed from his position immediately” when the Air Force learned of his arrest.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Air Force Secretary Michael Donley to “express outrage and disgust” over Krusinski’s arrest and promise that the matter will be dealt with “swiftly and decisively,” according to a Pentagon statement.

The Pentagon has acknowledged that sexual assault in the military is widespread. It estimates that 19,000 offenses are committed each year but that fewer than one in six cases are officially reported. Many victims say they are reluctant to press charges because they lack faith in the military justice system. Of those cases that are reported, about one in 10 proceeds to trial.

It is rare for commanders to grant clemency. The Air Force said it has recorded 327 convictions over the past five years for sexual assault, rape and similar crimes, but only five verdicts have been overturned in clemencies.

Advocacy groups, however, said any decision to overrule a jury’s verdict for no apparent reason has a powerful dampening effect.

“When commanders and those in authority set convictions aside, reduce sentences or drop charges, it creates a chilling effect in the system,” said Nancy Parrish, president of Protect Our Defenders, a group that represents victims of sex crimes in the military.

Hagel last month said he would support a legislative proposal to change military law so that commanders could no longer set aside convictions for serious sex crimes. His decision marked a reversal for the Pentagon, which had long resisted the measure. Some lawmakers want more far-reaching legal changes.

A verdict appealed

The case in which Helms overturned the jury finding began in October 2010, when a noncommissioned officer at Vandenberg reported that she had been sexually assaulted by Capt. Matthew S. Herrera in his bedroom after a night of drinking.

Herrera’s housemate told authorities that he had a history of acting aggressively with women, according to the case file obtained by The Washington Post. Investigators found another woman, a second lieutenant, who said Herrera sexually assaulted her in the back seat of a car a year earlier, although she did not report it at the time.

Herrera was charged in both cases. At his court-martial, his attorneys argued that the sexual encounters were consensual. A jury of five Air Force officers found Herrera guilty of sexually assaulting the lieutenant and sentenced him to 60 days behind bars, a loss of pay and dismissal from the Air Force. He was found not guilty of assaulting the noncommissioned officer.

Herrera applied for clemency, arguing that he was innocent and that it would be an injustice to force him to register as a sex offender. Documents show that Helms’s legal adviser urged her to reject Herrera’s request. But in February 2012, the general granted clemency without explanation, erasing Herrera’s conviction.

Soon afterward, the noncommissioned officer who had accused Herrera of sexually assaulting her said that she had crossed paths with him at Vandenberg and, because she was junior in rank, she was required to salute him.

“He had a very smug look on his face,” Tech. Sgt. Jennifer J. Robinson said in an interview. “I was devastated and shocked.”

Herrera did not respond to interview requests placed through his attorney, Richard P. Lasting of Los Angeles.

General’s rationale

Helms declined to comment through an Air Force spokesman. Although the general did not publicly divulge her reasons for overturning the conviction, she wrote a memo for her personal files explaining her decision, said the spokesman, Lt. Col. John Dorrian.

The memo was not made part of the case file or shared with prosecutors, defense lawyers, Herrera or his accusers, Dorrian said. In response to an inquiry, however, the Air Force provided a copy to The Post. It also gave a copy to McCaskill’s office.

In the five-page memo, dated Feb. 24, 2012, Helms wrote that she reviewed the court-martial transcript and trial exhibits. She said she came to the opposite conclusion of the jury and found Herrera to be a more credible witness than the lieutenant. Helms wrote that it was not unreasonable for Herrera to believe that the woman had given implied consent.

“It is undoubtedly true that [the accuser’s] feelings of victimization are real and justifiable,” Helms wrote. “However, Capt. Herrera’s conviction should not rest on [the accuser’s] view of her victimization, but on the law and convincing evidence.”

Instead of sexual assault, Helms found Herrera guilty of committing “an indecent act,” a lesser offense. The Air Force said Herrera was involuntarily discharged in December."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) warned Thursday that a coming Supreme Court case that could ultimately eliminate certain campaign contribution limits is a ""clear danger"" that threatens to expand the influence of large and wealthy corporations on elections.

The case -- McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, set to be argued on Oct. 8 -- challenges the aggregate limit on campaign contributions that an individual donor can make in a single election. Currently, a donor may only give $123,300 in total, made up of sub-limits of $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to party committees and PACs.

The plaintiff, Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, hopes that the court will eliminate these limits, arguing earlier this year that the issue is ""a very important First Amendment case about freedom of speech.""

On Thursday, speaking at an event held by the Constitutional Accountability Center, Warren argued, ""If the court continues in the direction of Citizens United, we may move another step closer to neutering Congress' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees.""

Warren also endorsed the research of her former academic colleague, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, on the framers of the Constitution's original definition of corruption and on the ways in which Congress has become warped by monied interests.

Lessig, who followed Warren Thursday with a presentation on his research, sought to frame the McCutcheon case, and the money-in-politics issue generally, in terms the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would respond to. Lessig and the Constitutional Accountability Center have filed an amicus brief in the McCutcheon case based on his research and arguments.

The Supreme Court -- most dramatically in the 2010 Citizens United decision -- has stated that the only type of corruption able to be regulated is quid pro quo, cash-for-votes corruption. But, according to Lessig, this is not the way the framers understood corruption and, thus, neither should the five conservative justices on the court.

Two chapters from the Federalist Papers are of particular interest to Lessig. In Federalist 52, James Madison writes that the federal government created by the Constitution should have at least one branch ""dependent upon the people alone."" In Federalist 57, Madison writes that the people on whom that branch depends should be ""not the rich, more than the poor.""

Lessig argued that the oversized reliance of members of Congress on their campaign donors is an institutional corruption of the dependence that Congress is supposed to have ""upon the people alone."" The foundation for his argument is a number of statements and writings by the framers concerning corruption of this nature -- evidence a constitutional originalist would take into consideration.

Lessig said he had found at least 325 specific instances in which the framers used the term corruption (collected here in a Tumblr blog). Of those, only six explained corruption as a trading of favors, while there were 29 mentions of corruption as an ""improper dependence."" He also found that 57 percent of the mentions of corruption were about institutions, rather than individuals.

This argument is designed to paint into a corner the five conservative justices, who commonly favor eliminating campaign finance limits, by suggesting that their efforts conflict with the original intent of the framers.

In the McCutcheon case, he argued, the elimination of campaign contribution limits would likely reduce the overall number of donors to campaigns and, thus, make Congress even more dependent upon an even smaller slice of donors, who are not representative of the people. Lessig used research done by National Institute of Money in State Politics executive director Ed Bender that shows that contribution limits expand the number of donors while the elimination of contribution limits reduces the number of donors.

""If you eliminate the cap on aggregate contributions, the number of funders in the system will fall even more than it has so far,"" Lessig said. ""And if the number of funders drop, then the dependence corruption within the system, as I've just described it, only gets worse.""

But Lessig said he is optimistic that the justices will look at the McCutcheon case and the original definition of corruption used by the framers and form a strong majority to uphold the aggregate campaign contribution limits."

(CNN)– Linda Stephens has lived in her upstate New York community for more than three decades and has long been active in civic affairs.

But as an atheist, those views have put her at the center of a personal, political, and legal fight that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

The issue is public prayer at her local town board meetings, another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena.

The justices on Wednesday will hear arguments over whether Greece, New York, may continue sponsoring what it calls ""inclusive"" prayers at its open sessions, on government property.

Stephens and co-plaintiff Susan Galloway have challenged the policy, saying virtually all of those invited to offer legislative prayers over the years were Christians.

""It's very divisive when you bring government into religion,"" Stephens told CNN from her home.

""I don't believe in God, and Susan is Jewish, so to hear these ministers talk about Jesus and even have some of them who personally question our motives, it's just not appropriate.""

The town of about 94,000 residents counters that after concerns from the two women and others, it sought diverse voices, including a Wiccan priestess, to offer invocations. Officials say they do not review the content of the remarks, nor censor any language.

""The faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all,"" said John Auberger, Greece's board supervisor, who began the practice shortly after taking office 1998. ""We accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings.""

A federal appeals court in New York found the board's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion.

Those judges said it had the effect of ""affiliating the town with Christianity.""

""To the extent that the state cannot make demands regarding the content of legislative prayers,"" said Judge Guido Calabresi, ""municipalities have few means to forestall the prayer-giver who cannot resist the urge to proselytize. These difficulties may well prompt municipalities to pause and think carefully before adopting legislative prayer, but they are not grounds on which to preclude its practice.""

Some legal experts say while the high court has allowed public prayers in general, it has not set boundaries on when they might become too sectarian in nature.

""The case involves a test between two different kinds of legal rules,"" said Thomas Goldstein, SCOTUSblog.com publisher and a leading Washington attorney.

""The Supreme Court has broadly approved legislative prayer without asking too many questions. But in other cases where the government is involved with religion, it has looked at lots of different circumstances. So we just don't know whether this court will be completely approving of legislative prayers in this instance.""

The justices are now being asked to offer more firm guidelines over when and if such public prayers are constitutionally acceptable.

Felt marginalized

Galloway and Stephens say the elected board of the community outside Rochester almost always invited Christian clergy to open the meetings, usually with sectarian prayers. And they say they felt ""marginalized"" by the practice.

""When we tried to speak with the town, we were told basically if we didn't like the prayers, we didn't have to listen,"" said Stephens, ""or could stand out in the hallway while they were going on.""

Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Washington-based group that is representing the two women, cited records showing that between 1999 and 2010, approximately two-thirds of the invocations contained the words ""Jesus Christ,"" Jesus,"" Holy Spirit,"" or ""Your Son.""

And the lawsuit claims that from 1999 through 2007, every meeting had a Christian-only invocation. Following the complaints from the plaintiffs, four other faiths were invited in 2008, including a Baha'i leader and a Jewish lay person.

The plaintiffs say the Christian-only invocations resumed from January 2009 through June 2010. They claim those invited to the monthly meetings were selected by a city employee from a local guide that had no non-Christian faiths listed.

""Politics and religion simply don't mix, and they certainly don't mix in the local context of the Greece town council,"" said the Rev. Barry Lynn, AUSCS executive director.

""The town seems to take the position that because once or twice over a decade, it hears from someone of a different religion, that somehow is inclusive. It trivializes what's going here - a local government that should be willing and interested in participation of all its citizens, it wants those citizens to participate in an almost inevitably Christian prayer, in order to begin doing their business.""

Different rulings

While the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York last year unanimously ruled against Greece's policy, other courts around the country have found such invocations - if inclusive and limited in scope - to be permissible.

Congress regularly opens its sessions with a prayer. Wednesday's invocation by House Chaplain the Rev. Patrick Conroy began: ""Eternal God, we give you thanks for giving us another day. Once again, we come to ask wisdom, patience, peace, and understanding for the members of this people's House.""

Nearly 120 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with several state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. So has the Obama administration.

""The history of prayers offered in connection with legislative deliberation in this country makes clear that a legislative body need not affirmatively solicit a court-mandated variety of different religious faiths– from inside and outside the borders governed by the legislative body– in order to avoid running afoul of the Establishment Clause,"" said Justice Department lawyers' in their amicus brief.

The Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal ministry based in Scottsdale, Arizona, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Greece Town Board, saying the Supreme Court has upheld the practice of government bodies ""to acknowledge America's religious heritage and invoke divine guidance and blessings upon their work.""

""A few people should not be able to extinguish the traditions of our nation merely because they heard something they didn't like,"" said Brett Harvey, an attorney for the group. ""Because the authors of the Constitution invoked God's blessing on public proceedings, this tradition shouldn't suddenly be deemed unconstitutional.""

Stephens realizes the stakes are high for her community and for the law as a whole. But on a personal level, this legal fight has been tough.

""I've received something of a backlash, both Susan and me,"" the retired librarian said. ""Threatening letters, some vandalism to my property, things like that. The prayers, and all the controversy, it makes you feel like an outcast, like we don't count in our town.""

The case is Town of Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway (12-696). A ruling is expected by early summer."

Penalty is up to six months in jail and %241%2C000 fine

Revenge porn is a growing problem in age of social media

American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill on free speech grounds

SACRAMENTO, California (AP) — California Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible jail time for people who post naked photos of their exes after bitter breakups.

Senate Bill 255, which takes effect immediately, makes it a misdemeanor to post identifiable nude pictures of someone else online without permission with the intent to cause emotional distress or humiliation. The penalty is up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

""Until now, there was no tool for law enforcement to protect victims,"" the bill's author, Sen. Anthony Cannella, said in a statement. ""Too many have had their lives upended because of an action of another that they trusted.""

Cannella, a Republican, has said revenge porn is a growing problem in the age of social media, when photos and videos that were made privately during a relationship can find their way onto hundreds of websites.

Before the criminal law was enacted, California allowed victims to sue their virtual assailants, but that is an expensive and time-consuming option.

The American Civil Liberties Union had opposed the bill, arguing it might restrict free speech rights, which has been a concern in other states as well.

Florida lawmakers rejected a similar bill this year after constitutional free speech concerns surfaced there. Last year, the Missouri Supreme Court cited concerns about free speech in striking down part of a 2008 law enacted after a teenager who was teased online committed suicide."

USA TODAY

One case pits backers of California%27s gay marriage ban against two couples who want to marry

The ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act could be broader

Same-sex marriage foes don%27t think court will extend gay marriage rights nationwide

WASHINGTON — Mitchell Katine came to the Supreme Court 10 years ago for the final chapter of Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark gay rights case in which the justices struck down state sodomy laws.

Not even Katine nor the other lawyers working for John Lawrence and Tyron Garner in their battle against Texas' sodomy law imagined the length and breadth of Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority decision, which struck down all remaining state sodomy laws.

In a blistering dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia warned that the 6-3 ruling ""leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples."" His warning proved prophetic within months, when Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court became the first to legalize same-sex marriage.

As the Supreme Court prepares to issue two historic decisions on gay marriage this month, however, the judges and lawyers who worked on both sides of those earlier cases don't expect anything quite so eloquent or all-encompassing from a cautious and conservative court.

The consensus view: The justices will limit the expansion of gay marriage rights to California, with few if any implications for the rest of the country. Only on the Defense of Marriage Act, most agree, will the court strike a broad blow against discrimination by striking down the ban on federal benefits for married same-sex couples.

""It will really move us forward without going all the way,"" Katine predicts, lamenting that Lawrence and Garner did not live to witness the moment. ""I really wish they had not died and could see the true fruits of their labor.""

Houston attorney Gary Polland was on the other side of the issue in Lawrence. As chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, he backed the anti-sodomy statute and encouraged the state to prosecute the case. And while Katine celebrated Kennedy's sweeping declaration of homosexual rights on June 26, 2003, Polland criticized what he saw as ""legislating courts.""

Still, Polland says he won't be surprised or angry if the high court does what Katine expects in the two same-sex marriage cases this month. The federal government had no business getting involved in family law in 1996 by defining which married couples could receive federal benefits, he says. And unlike 2003, he says, the Supreme Court would be right to limit its ruling on California's gay marriage ban to that state only.

""I think it's going to be an incremental move, whatever it is,"" Polland says. ""This court doesn't want to be in the position of making political decisions for the country.""

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN

The guessing game on the same-sex marriage cases is a complex one, due not only to their nature but the wide array of choices facing the justices.

In Hollingsworth v. Perry, pitting backers of California's gay marriage ban against two couples who want to marry, the ruling conceivably could affect just those two couples — or the entire country. The justices could rule broadly or narrowly on the merits of the case, or they could decide it doesn't belong before them and send it back.

Several potential decisions would have the same effect, however: Gays and lesbians in California could marry, as two lower federal courts said they could. That result, veterans of past gay rights cases say, offers the court a reasonable middle ground.

""Anything that avoids giving momentum to either side in this highly debatable and intensive social debate that's going on throughout the country would be the route, I think, that would guide them,"" says John Greaney, a law professor at Suffolk University School of Law in Boston, who served on the Massachusetts court and voted with the majority in the 2003 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health case that legalized gay marriage. To get five votes on the Supreme Court, he says, ""you have to tailor it as narrowly as possible.""

Opponents of same-sex marriage who have been on the losing side of cases dating back to Romer v. Evans — the 1996 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado voters could not rescind local laws banning discrimination against gays — take solace in the likelihood that the court won't extend gay-marriage rights nationwide.

They cite several reasons for a go-slow approach: Chief Justice John Roberts' preference for narrow rulings. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's criticism of the 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion decision for going too far and setting off recriminations from abortion opponents. The continuing debate that has led a dozen states to approve gay marriage and three dozen others to ban it.

""I think there's a better chance of the people of California winning it all than there is of the country being placed under a constitutional regime requiring the creation of gay marriage,"" says Teresa Collett, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota, who filed an amicus brief in support of Texas' sodomy ban a decade ago.

One particularly popular prediction: The high court will decide that the ban's supporters lack the legal right to appeal the lower court rulings, given they do not represent the state government.

""It would be surprising if the court reaches a decision about Proposition 8's constitutionality, because long-standing case law indicates that Proposition 8's sponsors do not have standing,"" says Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who represented those challenging the Colorado referendum in Romer and the Texas statute in Lawrence.

Walter Dellinger, a former U.S. acting solicitor general who filed a brief against Texas in 2003, notes the justices referred often during oral argument to his Proposition 8 brief, which contends that the ban's supporters have no fiduciary duty to the state of California and could not appeal on the state's behalf.

Paul Smith, the lead attorney representing Lawrence before the Supreme Court a decade ago, says the decision may be several different opinions that add up to a plurality. ""There's going to be at least two opinions,"" he predicts. ""There may be five.""

DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT

If the Proposition 8 decision is destined to be limited, these litigators say, the ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act in United States v. Windsor is more likely to be a broad one denying its constitutionality.

Among the reasons: Even though the Obama administration isn't defending the federal law, which creates another issue of legal standing, it continues to enforce it. As a result, Edie Windsor, the lesbian widow challenging the law in New York, is out $363,000 in estate taxes.

In addition, gay marriage proponents and opponents agree, the court probably won't want to decide both cases on narrow, procedural grounds. ""I think there will be enormous pressure to decide the DOMA case on merits grounds,"" Goldberg says.

But both sides also predict that while striking down DOMA, the justices won't go so far as to grant gays and lesbians the additional legal protection accorded women and African-Americans known as ""heightened scrutiny."" That would set a precedent that could be applied in other cases.

""That might open up a plethora of additional lawsuits,"" says Greaney, the retired Massachusetts judge. ""It would give the gay rights folks tremendous leverage going forward in all areas. The court probably would not want that.""

Judging from Kennedy's questions during oral argument in March, they say, a narrow majority of justices could decide the case on grounds of federalism, or states' rights, rather than on broader grounds of due process or equal protection.

Says Polland, the former GOP county chairman: ""The federal government doesn't have any jurisdiction in the family law field.""

The court concluded arguments early Wednesday afternoon on the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act provision that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The hearing was the second in back-to-back gay marriage cases before the court this week, both of which have attracted intense public interest.

In the two-hour hearing Wednesday, Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the decisive vote in close cases, joined the four more liberal justices in raising questions about the provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that is being challenged.

Kennedy said the law appears to intrude on the power of states that have chosen to recognize same-sex marriages. Other justices said the law creates what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called two classes of marriage, full marriage and ""skim-milk marriage.""

Click to listen to the oral arguments.

The motivation behind the 1996 federal law, passed by large majorities in Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton, was questioned repeatedly by Justice Elena Kagan. She read from a House of Representatives report explaining that the reason for the law was ""to express moral disapproval of homosexuality."" The quote produced an audible reaction in the courtroom.

Paul Clement, representing the House Republican leadership in defending the law, said the more relevant question is whether Congress had ""any rational basis for the statute."" He supplied one, the federal government's interest in treating same-sex couples the same no matter where they live.

Clement said the government does not want military families ""to resist transfer from West Point to Fort Sill because they're going to lose their benefits."" The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is in New York, where same-sex marriage is legal, and Fort Sill is in Oklahoma, where gay marriages are not legal.

The law affects a range of benefits available to married couples, including tax breaks, survivor benefits and health insurance for spouses of federal employees.

It also is possible the court could dismiss the case for procedural reasons, though that prospect seemed less likely than it did in Tuesday's argument over gay marriage in California.

Marital status is relevant in more than 1,100 federal laws that include estate taxes, Social Security survivor benefits and health benefits for federal employees. Lawsuits around the country have led four federal district courts and two appeals courts to strike down the law's Section 3, which defines marriage.

In 2011, the Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law but continues to enforce it. House Republicans are now defending DOMA in the courts.

The justices chose for their review the case of Edith Windsor, 83, of New York, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009.

Windsor, who goes by Edie, married Thea Spyer in 2007 in Canada after doctors told them that Spyer would not live much longer. She suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years. Spyer left everything she had to Windsor.

There is no dispute that if Windsor had been married to a man, her estate tax bill would have been zero.

The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York agreed with a district judge that the provision of DOMA deprived Windsor of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.

Like the Proposition 8 case from California, Windsor's lawsuit could falter on a legal technicality without a definitive ruling from the high court.

The House Republicans, the Obama administration and a lawyer appointed by the court were to spend part of the hearing discussing whether the House Republican leadership can defend the law in court because the administration decided not to, and whether the administration forfeited its right to participate in the case because it changed its position and now argues that the provision is unconstitutional.

If the Supreme Court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, Windsor probably would still get her refund because she won in the lower courts. But there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books.

On Tuesday, the justices weighed a fundamental issue: Does the Constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender? That case involved California's Proposition 8 ban on gay marriage.

If the justices choose to rule broadly, they could overturn Prop 8 and in doing so invalidate every other restriction on gay marriage in the country.

But the justices suggested Tuesday they could decide the case without issuing a ruling that ripples through all 50 states.

Several justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, raised doubts that the case was properly before them. Such an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California but would have no impact elsewhere.

The justices' statement spanned the gamut. Chief Justice John Roberts said it seemed supporters of gay marriage were trying to change the meaning of the word ""marriage"" by including same-sex couples.

Lawyers representing supporters of the California ban known as Proposition 8 argued that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the some 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed.

Decisions in both cases are expected by June.

Americans as a whole are divided on the issue. A Fox News poll released Thursday showed 49 percent of voters favor legalizing gay marriage, while 46 percent oppose it.

That marks a shift since the question was first asked in 2003 -- when 32 percent said gay marriage should be legal, and 58 percent opposed it.

Gay marriage has been approved in nine states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington -- and the District of Columbia. But 31 states have amended their constitutions to prohibit same-sex marriage. North Carolina was the most recent example last May.

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, is lionized each year at ceremonies on the federal holiday in his honor. Here’s what you may not know about him.

Peter Dreier is the E.P. Clapp distinguished professor of politics and chair of the urban and environmental policy department at Occidental College. His latest book is “The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame.”

What would the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. march for if he were alive today?

America has made progress on many fronts in the half-century since King electrified a crowd of 200,000 people, and millions of Americans watching on television, with his “I Have a Dream” address at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But there is still much to do to achieve his vision of equality.

Fortunately, many Americans are involved in grass-roots movements that follow in his footsteps. King began his activism as a crusader against racial segregation, but he soon recognized that his battle was part of a much broader fight for a more humane society. Today, at age 84, King would no doubt still be on the front lines, lending his voice and his energy to major battles for justice.

Voting rights: Along with other civil rights leaders, King fought hard to dismantle Jim Crow laws that kept blacks from voting. He was proud of his role in pushing Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965. He’d be outraged by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling to weaken the law that, among other things, increased the number of black voters and black elected officials.

Since that ruling, a movement has burgeoned to stop states’ efforts to require photo IDs in order to vote, shrink the early-voting period, and end same-day voter registration and pre-registration for teenagerswho will turn 18 by Election Day. Today, King might lend his name to these campaigns and join the Moral Monday protests in North Carolina, where thousands have opposed that state’s efforts to restrict voting rights.

Gun violence: During the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, King faced constant death threats and feared for his family’s life. He owned several guns and allowed armed guards to protect his home. But Bayard Rustin — a pacifist who was one of King’s closest advisers — persuaded King to give up his guns and guards and embrace a nonviolent strategy.

King’s commitment to nonviolence grew stronger as he grew older. After John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, King wrote: “By our readiness to allow arms to be purchased at will and fired at whim, by allowing our movie and television screens to teach our children that the hero is one who masters the art of shooting and the technique of killing, by allowing all these developments, we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes.”

Today he would probably push for tougher limits on gun ownership. He would have joined the college and high school students who recently camped outside Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s office for 31 days, demanding repeal of that state’s shoot-first “stand your ground” law. And he’d probably support the activists in Chicago who recently protested for several days outside a conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate-sponsored lobbying group that has been a major advocate of “stand your ground” laws. He might call on cities, colleges and churches to divest from companies that manufacture military-style assault weapons.

Mass incarceration: King recognized that the criminal justice system has long had a double standard when it comes to the treatment of black and white Americans. Today he would be joining prison reform groups, the ACLU, the NAACP and others that have been protesting racial profiling by police and drug policies that have resulted in 2.3 million Americans behind bars, many for nonviolent, minor offenses.

King would have applauded Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.’s recent speech outlining plans to reduce mass incarceration rates by limiting the number of people sentenced under mandatory-minimum laws. You could hear King’s spirit echoed in Holder’s words: “A vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. We cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safe nation.”

Women’s reproductive freedom: In 1966, King was one of four recipients of Planned Parenthood’s first Margaret Sanger Award, named for the group’s founder, a pioneer in educating women about birth control. In accepting the award, King said that “there is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger’s early efforts.” He noted how “at the turn of the century, she went into the slums and set up a birth-control clinic, and for this deed she went to jail because she was violating an unjust law. Yet the years have justified her actions.”

King never spoke publicly about his views on abortion, and he was murdered five years before the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, but he was a fervent advocate for universal health care. “Of all the forms of inequality,” he said in 1966, “injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” Today King probably would speak at rallies and participate in vigils at state capitals in Maine, North Carolina, Texas and elsewhere to protect women’s access to health care and reproductive freedom — and challenge those who are trying to shut down Planned Parenthood clinics.

Immigrant rights: King would be pleased by the ties between the civil rights and immigrant rights movements. Ten years ago, a coalition of union, immigrant, faith and civil rights groups organized an Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride. More than 900 riders on buses from nine cities traveled 20,000 miles, in the tradition of the 1960s Freedom Riders, to support immigration reform. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), one of the original Freedom Riders, spoke at a rally when the buses reached New York, declaring: “Martin Luther King would be very proud. We are white, black, Hispanic, Native American — we are one family, in one house, and we are not going to let anybody turn us around.”

Now a much broader coalition is pushing for comprehensive immigration reform, energized by young activists who call themselves Dreamers, a term that evokes King’s 1963 speech. Many of these young people share the values, culture and aspirations of other American youth, but they feel, as King described the typical African American 50 years ago, like “an exile in his own land.”

National spending priorities: By 1965, King had turned against the Vietnam War, arguing that it was stealing precious resources from domestic programs and that it was “an enemy of the poor.” In his last book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” King wrote, “The bombs in Vietnam explode at home; they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent America.” At the time, he called for a comprehensive plan to create jobs, rebuild cities, improve schools and lift the poor out of destitution.

Today, King would probably be working with unions, religious organizations and activist groups such as Code Pink to cut the defense budget and redirect money to help rebuild our cities and social safety net. He’d be speaking out against Congress’s recent cuts to food stamps, Head Start and other anti-poverty programs. In particular, King, who had close ties to the United Auto Workers — once the backbone of a powerful labor movement that helped build the postwar middle class — would be calling on the president and Congress to help revitalize Detroit with loans and grants to create jobs, restore public services and create a smaller but more humane city.

Income inequality and the working poor: A half-century before Occupy Wall Street, King warned about the “gulf between the haves and the have-nots” and insisted that America needed a “better distribution of wealth.” During the final few years of his life, King focused much of his energy on helping low-wage workers fight for rights and respect. He was in Memphis to support striking garbage workers when he was assassinated in April 1968.

Today he would join the growing campaigns to unionize and improve pay and working conditions for workers who earn poverty-level wages. He might disrupt Wal-Mart stockholder meetings to demand that the company pay employees a living wage, join fast-food workers in their nationwide walkout on Aug. 29, and urge consumers to boycott the Gap, Wal-Mart and other companies until they stop manufacturing their products in overseas sweatshops. He’d also be vocal about raising the federal minimum wage, which was one of the demands of the March on Washington.

Housing and predatory lending: Appalled by the slums and blatant residential segregation in our major cities, especially in the North, King lobbied hard for anti-discrimination laws in the 1960s. Today, King would be equally outraged to learn that banks targeted African American and Latino neighborhoods with subprime loans in recent decades. As a result, in the past few years, about one-quarter of black and Latino borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure or are seriously delinquent on their mortgages, compared with about 12 percent for white borrowers. From 2009 to 2012 African Americans lost about $200 billion in wealth, and the wealth gap between whites and blacks now stands at an astonishing 20 to 1 ratio.

King would find common cause with community groups such as the Home Defenders League and state attorneys general, such as California’s Kamala Harris and New York’s Eric Schneiderman, who are pressuring Wall Street banks to reset mortgages for underwater homeowners. King might link arms with homeowners such as Rose Gudiel of Los Angeles, who, with friends and neighbors at her side in 2011, refused to leave her house when the bank sought to evict her after she missed a few mortgage payments because her brother, who had been helping her, died. Gudiel and her friends occupied the bank’s office and later got arrested at Fannie Mae’s regional office. The bank reset her loan, and she is back in her modest home with her family. But she’s now working with the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment to help other homeowners in similar circumstances. Gudiel was carrying out King’s view that sometimes you have to break an unjust law — and get arrested — to change it.

LGBT equality: Typical of most Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, King did not approve of homosexuality, even though his close adviser Bayard Rustin was openly gay. But when some civil rights leaders objected to Rustin’s role as the key organizer of the March on Washington, worried that it would tarnish the movement, King insisted that Rustin stay in the job.

Since the 1960s, public opinion toward gay Americans has shifted dramatically. Had King encountered more openly gay men and women, his views probably would have evolved as well. After all, when King spoke out against state laws banning interracial marriage in 1958, he sounded a lot like those who advocate for same-sex marriage today: “When any society says that I cannot marry a certain person, that society has cut off a segment of my freedom.”

Today, with the support of the NAACP and a growing number of black clergy members supporting gay rights, King would stand — and sit in when necessary — with the LGBT community to help push states toward legalizing same-sex marriage and ending other forms of discrimination against gay Americans.

The night before he was shot, King spoke at a rally for the striking garbage workers in Memphis. He told the crowd about a bomb threat on his plane from Atlanta that morning, saying he knew that his life was in danger because of his political activism.

“I would like to live a long life,” he said. “Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.”

We haven’t gotten there yet. The best way to honor his memory is to continue his struggle for social justice. dreier@oxy.edu

The refrain in the song's lyrics:



But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears

Take the rag away from your face

Now ain’t the time for your tears

I've been following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin for ""walking while black"" since it occurred, and the media campaign of George Zimmerman's defense attorneys and his family members—father and brother—both named Robert Zimmerman (Sr. and Jr.). It wasn't until recently that it struck me why the name ""Robert Zimmerman"" rang a bell, not related to this case. I often forget that Bob Dylan was born Robert Zimmerman.

How ironic.

One Robert Zimmerman (Dylan) will be remembered for writing and performing songs pointing out racism and injustice in U.S. society, while the other (Zimmerman Sr.) has just penned what can only be described as a racist screed blaming black people and black organizations for his son's ""persecution"" and calling them ""racists."" In tandem, Robert Zimmerman Jr has been making the media rounds and sent out racist tweets.

I shed no tears for George Zimmerman, and can only state that the apple hasn't fallen far from a racist Zimmerman tree when watching his father.

Let's examine Robert Zimmerman Sr's list, as reported by ThinkProgress. I am not going to buy a copy of his rant so I'll just have to trust their quotes.

The most striking chapter is called “Who Are The True Racists,” an apparent effort to rebut claims that his son’s actions were racially motivated. Previously, Zimmerman Sr. “believed generally racism was a thing of the past.” He says that, personally, he hadn’t encountered much racism, even though his wife is Hispanic. But after his son shot and killed Trayvon Martin, however, Zimmerman learned that racism is “flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community.” He then goes on to list various black leaders and organizations that he believes are racist: Congressional Black Caucus. “[A] pathetic, self-serving group of racists… advancing their purely racist agenda.” He later adds that “all members of Congress should be ashamed of the Congressional Black Caucus, as should be their constituents.” And finally: “They are truly a disgrace to all Americans.” The NAACP. “[S]imply promotes racism and hatred for their own, primarily finical, interests” and “without prejudice and racial divide, the NAACP would simply cease to exist.” NAACP President Benjamin Jealous. “[W]hat I would expect of a racist.” Trayvon Martin’s funeral director. A “racial activist and former head of the local NAACP.” Benjamin Crump, Natialie Jackson and Darrly Parks, attorneys for Travyon Martin’s family. “The scheme team.” The National Basketball Players Association. Black Chamber of Commerce. National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers. National Black United Fund. United Negro College Fund.



From Robert Zimmerman's perspective, his son shoots and kills an unarmed young black man, and when there is an outcry, those who have something to say about it are racists. Too often the response to racism is to label those who address it as racists.

If his list wasn't so blatantly bigoted, I might even laugh. Except this isn't funny, and looking at racist reviewer comments at Amazon.com where he is selling the e-book makes it even more disgusting.

The tin-foil list at first glance doesn't contain any references to anyone other than blacks. Except when you think about it ""the NBA"" has players other than blacks, and as a player's union was founded by Bob Cousy. The NAACP has always had white members and was founded by blacks and whites.



The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family), Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP.

Obviously, from Zimmerman Sr.'s perspective only black people push back against the racism that is embedded in the foundations of this society.

But wait. That ""other"" Zimmerman (Bobby) isn't black.

As the news just announced a jury selected for the Zimmerman trial without a single black person on the panel, my thoughts move again to another song by Dylan/Zimmerman, on the murder of Emmett Till and subsequent trial

And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial

Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till

But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this

awful crime

And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see

The smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs

For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free

While Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea

Bob Dylan's lyrical power has influenced a host of other songwriters and his body of work will be remembered long after he leaves this mortal plane.

Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, last year by President Obama, Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman will hold a place in our hearts and history.

One young singer has taken the melody and lyrics of Dylan's Hattie Carroll tune and revised it to ""The Lonesome Death of Trayvon Martin.""

Robert Zimmerman Sr. will be remembered for fathering a son who took the life of someone else's son. And for blaming the victim for being black."

When asked by Chris Wallace if the dream has been fulfilled, Williams noted that there isn’t, “any question that [African Americans] have come along way,” before importantly pointing out that blacks have to address the problems that are created within their communities. “I think that if you look at the realities of today, you’ve got to talk about things like family breakdown,” Williams said. “You’ve got to talk about the fact that 70 percent of black children today are born out of wedlock. I think Dr. King would cry.”

I agree with Juan, but instead of invoking King’s legacy to lament about present problems I’ve decided to share my own dream.

I have a dream that all black parents will have the right to choose where their kids attend school.

I have a dream that all black boys and girls will grow up with a father.

I have a dream that young black men will stop shooting other young black men.

I have a dream that all young black men will say ""no"" to gangs and to drugs.

I have a dream that all black young people will graduate from high school.

I have a dream that young black men won't become fathers until after they're married and they have a job.

I have a dream that young unmarried black women will say ""no"" to young black men who want to have sex.

I have a dream that today's black leadership will quit blaming racism and ""the system"" for what ails black America.

I have a dream that black America will take responsibility for improving their own lives.

I have a dream that one day black America will cease their dependency on the government plantation, which has enslaved them to lives of poverty, and instead depend on themselves, their families, their churches, and their communities."

On his relationship with Republicans after endorsing Barack Obama for President: ""I'm still a Republican,"" Powell said.

RELATED: Aides Fight Over Who Is More Confident in Ohio

On Hagel: Powell is a big fan. ""He's had a very, very distinguished public service record that he can stand on,"" Powell said. Powell said he believes Hagel will be confirmed after he's given a chance to respond to questions at his hearing with the Senate. ""I think he gets confirmed,"" Powell said. ""I've read some of the responses that he's already put together, and I think he will make a very, very spirited defense of his position. And I think he'll be confirmed."" Powell defended Hagel's support for the state of Israel. ""There are people who are very supportive of the state of Israel,"" Powell said. ""I'm very supportive of the state of Israel. So is Senator Hagel, and you'll see that in the confirmation hearings, but it doesn't mean you have to agree with every single position that the Israeli government takes."" He also defended Hagel from accusations of anti-Semitism. ""When they go over the edge and say because Chuck said 'Jewish lobby' he's anti-Semitic, that's disgraceful,"" Powell said. ""We shouldn't have that kind of language in our dialog.""

On the rumor mill and the potential nominations of Susan Rice and Hagel: ""I think it was not handled well,"" Powell said. ""One of the problems, both with Ambassador Rice and with Chuck Hagel, these sort of signals come out that, ""This is who we are thinking about."" And you're left out there to dangle for weeks. Well, if this is who you're going to nominate, nominate them, and let's get on with the process.""

On racism in the GOP: It's bad. ""There's also a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party,"" Powell said. ""What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities."" Powell pointed to Sarah Palin's controversial 'shuckin' and jivin'' remark, and Romney surrogate John Sununu saying the President was 'lazy' in the first debate. ""He didn't say he was slow, he was tired, he didn't do well; he said he was 'lazy,'"" Powell said ""Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans, but to those of us who are African Americans, the second word is ""shiftless,"" and then there's a third word that goes along with it."" Powell also chided the Republican party for even allowing the birther movement to exist. ""The whole birther movement: Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party?"" Powell asked. ""I think the party has to take a look at itself."" Powell blamed a hard shift to the right for the party's recent down spell. ""In recent years, there's been a significant shift to the right, and we have seen what that shift has produced: two losing presidential campaigns,"" Powell said. ""I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they're going to be in trouble."" But he did have idea about what they could do in the future to change their fortunes, namely education, immigration and climate change policy. ""Everybody wants to talk about, 'Who's going to be the candidate?'"" Powell said. ""You've got to think first about what's the party actually going to represent? If it's just going to represent the far right wing of the political spectrum, I think the party is in difficulty. I'm a moderate, but I'm still a Republican.""

On gun control: Powell seemed to be in favor of an assault weapons ban. He said he is a gun owner and he is familiar with the Second Amendment, but that there still needs to some kind of restrictions in place to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on powerful guns. ""I see no need for Bushmasters in the hands of an individual person who might be deranged,"" Powell said. ""You want to fire a Bushmaster, go out to a range and fire a Bushmaster. But whether or not it's in our overall interest to have these kinds of weapons in the hands of Americans who might not be responsible is a question we have to answer. How much are we really giving up if we said that this kind of weapon should not be readily available to anybody who wants to buy one?"" He also seemed to support a more complex gun registry, and an increase in required background checks. ""Surely we should be able to find some meeting of the minds on this issue,"" Powell said. ""Why can't we test everybody, or have everybody run through a screen to make sure that they're a responsible person before they're allowed to buy a weapon, either in a store or in a private transaction? Why can't we do a better job of registering things?""

John McCain and Joe Manchin wouldn't say whether they were going to support Chuck Hagel in his Senate hearing on CBS's Face the Nation. Manchin is scheduled to have a one-on-one with Hagel soon, which should help Manchin make up his mind. ""He's coming in next week to speak with me,"" Manchin said. ""I look forward to that. Manchin said he plans on asking Hagel about Israel, the Iraq War, Iran and Afghanistan. Host Bob Schieffer asked McCain if he would be voting against Hagel. ""No, nor would I vote for him,"" McCain said. ""This is why we have hearings."" Hagel and McCain used to be close friends on the hill, but they've suffered from a falling out in recent years. ""My questions about him, and they will be raised in the Senate, are, what his view of America's role in the world?"" McCain said. ""Whether he really believes that the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War? That clearly - that's not correct. In fact, it's bizarre. Why would he oppose calling the Iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization?""

Sen. Kelly Ayotte told Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace she's confused by the President's choosing Chuck Hagel as his nominee for Secretary of Defense. ""I'm very troubled,"" Ayotte said. ""I think that the hearings on this nomination are going to be consequential. I have not made up my mind, but here's where we are. You put up his prior positions. It makes we wonder - it perplexes me why the president nominated Sen. Hagel."" One of her biggest concerns involves how Iran took the news of Hagel's nomination. ""Iran this week kind of reacted favorably somewhat,"" Ayotte said. ""There were some statements that were favorable to his nomination. In fact, they said they were hopeful that with his nomination, they hoped that we would change our policies. What I want to make sure is that Iran is actually not hopeful, but they're fearful as a result of our nominee from the secretary of defense perspective because I think that will cause them to stop marching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon."" When Wallace asked if Ayotte was leaning towards voting against Hagel, she would only say that Hagel ""has a lot of questions to answer.""

Sen. Bob Corker brought up a new concern about Hagel's nomination on ABC's This Week: Hagels's temper. Apparently a number of his former aides have come forward to Corker to speak about how he handled things in the office. ""There are number of staffers who are coming forth now just talking about how he dealt with them,"" Corker said. Corker wants the Senate to consider whether Hagel is fit to manage an organization as stressful and complex as the Pentagon. But Corker will get his own one-on-one time with Hagel when the two meet to discuss things this week. Hagel reached out to him to set up a meeting. ""He's coming in to see me next week, this is going to be a whole process,"" Corker said.

NRA President David Keene thinks the current state of Congress is going to protect him from Dianne Feinstein's proposed assault weapons ban. ""I would say that the likelihood is that there not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through this Congress,"" David Keene told Candy Crowley on CNN's State of the Union. Keene did concede the President could spend some political capital and get the bill through. When asked if the NRA was trying to ""gin up"" second amendment fear to increase gun sales, Keena blamed the President and Feinstein. ""The two people who were selling so called assault rifles are Sen. Feinstein and President Obama,"" Keene said. ""They're the ones scaring people, not us.""

Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he's still not sure whether he will run for Senate in 2014 or not. ""That's my intention, but it's over a year away,"" Booker said on NBC's Meet the Press. ""A lot could change between now and then."" So, Booker wouldn't come out and confirm that he is running, despite already filing paperwork to start a campaign. ""I'm not ruling out anything right now but it's premature to be speculative,"" Booker said. ""You have to file the papers even to do research on the issue."" Booker did rule out taking on Gov. Chris Christie in what would surely be a losing battle."

NC NAACP Responds to the Disturbing Repeal of the Racial Justice Act

On Juneteenth Holiday

June 19, 1865–or Juneteenth–is celebrated around the world as the day of liberation for millions of enslaved African Americans in the southern states. Although all enslaved people in the southern states that were still engaged in an open rebellion against the United States had been declared free in January 1, 1863, in most of the states there were not enough U.S. military forces to enforce the end of slavery. When the U.S. Navy fleet sailed into the Galveston Harbor in Texas, however, with sufficient U.S. military forces to back up his words of freedom, U.S. General Gordon Granger read U.S. Army General Order #3: ”The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.”

“Gov. Patrick McCrory picked Juneteenth–of all the days in the year, –to reinstate North Carolina’s proven race-based system of death, to sign an unconstitutional and flawed law that repeals North Carolina’s nationally-acclaimed Racial Justice Act, ” said Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, President of the NC State Conference of over 100 adult and youth branches across the state. ”The extremists who racially gerrymandered themselves into power with obscene donations from Art Pope and national secret political societies have now placed their approval on the proven racist system of death in our courthouses. The Racial Justice Act – which raised the window and turned on the lights on the racism in death penalty cases, was a major step in our efforts to carry out General Order #3, and to achieve “absolute equality of rights” between former masters and slaves.”

“It is not disputed that the repealed Racial Justice Act was a huge success and allowed death row inmates to present overwhelming evidence that the criminal justice system which resulted in their convictions was fatally flawed. If past cases, where four death row inmates were able to establish the existence of racial bias in jury selection during their trial, are any indication of the evidence which exists in these pending cases, more death sentences will be struck down”, said NC NAACP Lead Attorney Irving Joyner. “It is a ‘down right – dirty shame’ that our political leaders, in light of these past revelations of a systemic breakdown and misuse of our prosecutorial process, chose to destroy a viable remedy, rather than to repair the race-based defects found in the system. Gov. McCrory’s repeal seeks to make the new law apply retroactively, blunting appeals by death row inmates to assert their discrimination claims. Applying the repeal retroactively is clearly unconstitutional, since it is an ‘ex post facto law.’ This poorly disguised discriminatory attempt to strip the rights of death row inmates will now cost the State substantially more money in legal fees, as it must defend the tea party zealots’ agenda to disregard and diminish the constitutional protections of poor and working people.”

Juneteenth, which should be a day of rejoicing, has been turned into a day of sadness in North Carolina. Governor McCrory had the opportunity to veto this bill, and separate himself from the Pope-Tea Party zealots who have seized control in the legislature. Instead, he joined the forces of denial, which see no racism, hear no racism, in the back rooms and court rooms of our legal system of death. The citizens of North Carolina have not and will not sit by and allow the extremists to take control of the State. Governor McCrory, you have been put on notice.

The NC NAACP has always opposed the death penalty. The Racial Justice Act passed in 2009 to allow men and women on death row to change their death sentences to life without parole, if they could prove racial bias in their death sentences. Irrefutable research has shown that racial bias remains prevalent in North Carolina’s justice system. Ignoring this fact is an embarrassment to all the people of North Carolina."

But she said she did not expect to encounter discrimination from a fraternity at prestigious Duke University, where she’s a senior.

Over the weekend, a party hosted by Kappa Sigma fraternity mocked Asians and spoofed Asian dress. Tsai and other Asian American students organized a protest that included a “Race Is Not a Party” Facebook page and a campus rally Wednesday where students chanted, “Don’t party at our expense!” and “No more hate, make Duke great!”

“It was shocking and hurtful,” Tsai said of the party, which advertised the event via an email with the greeting “Herro Nice Duke Peopre!!”

Photos from the party, posted on Facebook, showed partygoers dressed in Asian gowns and conical caps. The email invitation closed with a mocking “Chank You.”

As soon as she saw the invitation, Duke junior Katherine Zhang said, she nearly broke down in tears. “I knew I had to do something about this,” she said at the rally Wednesday.

Kappa Sigma President Luke Keohane sent an apologetic email to the campus newspaper, saying, “Upon learning of the deeply damaging effects of our email to our fellow students, we should have completely canceled the aforementioned party.”

But the Asian American students said the event was the latest in a series of offensive race- or ethnic-themed parties on campus, among them a “Pilgrims and Indians” event last year and a “South of the Border” party several years ago, which students said mocked Native Americans and Latinos.

The students demanded the formation of a campus task force to, in part, “adjudicate punitive measures” for similar offensive incidents. They asked the university to hold the fraternity accountable.

Larry Moneta, vice president for student affairs at Duke, said university officials confronted fraternity members about their “thoughtless and offensive actions” and urged them to apologize to those offended.

At this point, Moneta said, the university does not plan to formally discipline the fraternity, but reserves the right to do so.

Zhang said in an interview that although most people on campus welcomed Asian Americans, there had been a persistent undercurrent of discrimination.

“Growing up, I always felt like an outsider because of the color of my skin,” she said. “I thought it might be different at Duke.”

Zhang said she received an email from Jack Riker, president of the Interfraternity Council on campus, promising to work with fraternities to prevent offensive, racist or sexist incidents.

“The Brothers of Kappa Sigma understand the unfortunate negative impact their event has had on the Duke community,” Riker wrote. “Through this experience, we welcome the opportunity to become more socially aware Greeks, Duke students and human beings.”

That group, and others even more militant, wanted to make sure not one bill emerged from the Newtown shooting, and they got their way. A vast majority of Republicans meekly followed along, joined by a few nervous red-state Democrats, giving far more weight to a small, shrill and largely rural faction than to the country’s overwhelming need for safety and sanity.

Guns had not been on the president’s campaign agenda, but, to his credit, he and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. came up with a solid package of proposals after Newtown that would have reduced the number of dangerous weapons on the street and in the hands of criminals. Mr. Obama traveled the country to promote it in 13 speeches, and he has spent the last weeks unsuccessfully trying to pry senators out of the pocket of the gun lobby.

The most important aspect of his proposal, in the eyes of many gun-control advocates, was the expansion of background checks, both because it closed an important loophole and because it seemed the easiest to pass. From 20 percent to 40 percent of all gun sales now take place without a background check, and the bill rejected on Wednesday would have required the check for buyers at gun shows, on the Internet and at other commercially advertised sales. It was sponsored by two pro-gun senators with the courage to buck the lobby, Joe Manchin III, a Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania.

The critical need for this measure was illustrated by a report in The Times on Wednesday that showed how easy it is for criminals to buy weapons on the Internet without a look at their backgrounds. One widely popular Web site contains tens of thousands of private postings of gun sales, and The Times’s investigation found that many buyers and sellers were criminals. Some of the guns have been used to kill.

A vote to continue this practice would be hard to explain to constituents, so lawmakers simply invented reasons to oppose background checks. Some insisted it would lead to a national gun registry, though the plain language of the bill prohibited that. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said it would raise taxes. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said it would require checks even when a gun sale is posted on an office bulletin board. (There’s nothing wrong with that, but it wouldn’t.) Mr. Obama, after the vote, said those who made these arguments had “willfully lied.”"

It was a statement about the founding of the United States of America. Here's the sentence:

""The United States of America was established as a white society, founded upon the near genocide of another race and then the enslavement of yet another.""

The comments were overwhelming, with many calling the statement outrageous and some calling it courageous. But it was neither. The sentence was a simply a historical statement of the facts. It was the first sentence of a Sojourners magazine cover article, published 26 years ago, titled ""America's Original Sin: The Legacy of White Racism.""

An extraordinary new film called 12 Years a Slave has just come out and Sojourners hosted the premiere for the faith community on March 9 in Washington, D.C. Rev. Otis Moss III was on the panel afterward that reflected on the film. Dr. Moss is not only a dynamic pastor and preacher in Chicago, but he is also a teacher of cinematography who put this compelling story about Solomon Northup -- a freeman from New York, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery -- into the historical context of all the American films ever done on slavery. 12 Years is the most accurate and best produced drama of slavery ever done, says Moss.

In her New York Times review, ""The Blood and Tears, Not the Magnolias,"" Manohla Dargis says, 12 Years a Slave ""isn't the first movie about slavery in the United States -- but it may be the one that finally makes it impossible for American cinema to continue to sell the ugly lies it's been hawking for more than a century."" Instead of the Hollywood portrayal of beautiful plantations, benevolent masters, and simple happy slaves, it shows the utterly brutal violence of a systematic attempt to dehumanize an entire race of people -- for economic greed. It reveals how morally outrageous the slave system was, and it is very hard to watch.

That's why we have to see it, all of us -- especially all of us white people. You can read the blog series on the film that we have been running in Sojourners, but you must go see it. I say that because many white people, even white people who care about social justice, have told me they don't want to see it. ""Too violent,"" I hear them say, ""Sounds too intense for me."" The enslavement of more than 4 million people of African descent by white Americans was always that violent and too intense for most white people to really accept the truth -- even now.

My comment from the panel afterward was that most white people, the vast majority in both the South and the North including our ""founding fathers,"" all accepted slavery. Most white people, white Christians, and white churches tolerated slavery for 246 years. This historically horrendous evil existed because we tolerated it. That's why evil always continues to exist: because we tolerate it.

What do we tolerate today, I asked. The film is so breathtaking, I worry that it becomes a museum movie, a film about a horrible past that is gratefully all over now. We did tolerate this gratuitous evil, and still tolerate the devaluing of black lives today. Would we tolerate completely dysfunctional urban schools if they were full of young white children? We tolerate a criminal justice system where the racial disparities between white and black arrests, convictions, and sentencing are abundantly clear, resulting in the mass incarceration of men of color. We tolerate the murder rates for people of color that we would never tolerate for whites. We tolerate the clear racial profiling of young black men, with results that we would never tolerate for our white teenage boys. And we tolerate deliberate and clear political efforts to diminish the votes of minority communities.

And it's time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of ""playing the race card."" So let me, as a white man and an evangelical Christian, do some truth-telling about race in American politics right now.

In only about 30 years, most Americans will come from Africa, Asia, or Latin America. Most Americans will no longer be white, and many white Americans are clearly not ready for that profound demographic change in their country. That white fear of who ""we"" Americans will be is at the heart of resistance to immigration reform. Many older conservative Republican and Tea Party voters are acutely aware of being ""white"" in a country that is becoming increasingly ""minority."" Congressional voting districts have been oddly gerrymandered along racial lines to protect dominant racial majorities. Shutting down a government that they believe to be too generous to minorities becomes an urgent matter. ""Obamacare"" becomes the great threat of government providing medical insurance disproportionately to poor people of color. Giving food stamps to poor families becomes another racial flashpoint for conservative white voters.

Finally, a black president becomes the most hated symbol of the demographic changes they most fear for their country.

Questioning Barack Obama's birthplace and parentage, calling him a non-Christian Muslim, naming him as a ""foreigner"" and not a ""real American"" are all ways to define this president as ""the other"" and not one of ""us."" The hatred goes far beyond Obama's policies and extends to his personage as the wrong kind of American. Obama shows them they are losing elections, and they fear that means losing ""their"" country.

Who will lead in our racially polarized time? Who will help America navigate its changing demographic future? Who will help a new generation create a diverse, multiracial society? Perhaps a community of faith that is intrinsically multiracial and is becoming so more and more.

Because of recent events that demonstrate the racial challenges ahead, more than 70 Christian leaders -- white, African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and Native American --are launching a pledge called ""One Church | One Body."" The pledge invites everyone to engage three commitments -- first, to help build a multiracial faith community; second, to help fix an unjust criminal justice system; and third, to protect voting rights for minority citizens. Consider joining us in our pledge and do not shy away from seeing 12 Years a Slave. It's the start of a conversation that's long overdue."

http://news.yahoo.com/congress-passes-bill-renewing-anti-violence-law-170141520.html,,[],Congress passes bill renewing anti-violence law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans raised the white flag Thursday on extending domestic violence protections to gays, lesbians and transsexuals after months of resisting an expansion of the Violence Against Women Act.

GOP leaders, who had tried to limit the bill before last November's election, gave the go-ahead for the House to accept a more ambitious Senate version written mainly by Democrats.

Democrats, with a minority of Republicans, were key to the 286-138 House vote that sent to President Barack Obama a renewal of the 1994 law that has set the standard for how to protect women, and some men, from domestic abuse and prosecute abusers.

It was the third time this year that House Speaker John Boehner has allowed Democrats and moderates in his own party to prevail over the GOP's much larger conservative wing. As with a Jan. 1 vote to avoid the fiscal cliff and legislation to extend Superstorm Sandy aid, a majority of House Republicans voted against the final anti-violence bill.

Obama, in a statement, said that ""renewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear"" and said he would sign the bill ""as soon as it hits my desk.""

The law has been renewed twice before without controversy, but it lapsed in 2011 as it was caught up in the partisan battles that now divide Congress. Last year, the House refused to go along with a Senate-passed bill that would have made clear that lesbians, gays, immigrants and Native American women should have equal access to Violence Against Women Act programs.

It appeared the scenario would be repeated this year when the House introduced a bill that didn't mention the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and watered down a Senate provision allowing tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians who attack their Indian partners on tribal lands.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who has spent months working on the issue, defended the Republican plan: ""Our goal in strengthening the Violence Against Women Act is simple. We want to help all women who are faced with violent, abusive and dangerous situations. ... We want them to know that those who commit these horrendous crimes will be punished.""

Story continues

But the House proposal encountered quick and strong opposition from women's groups, the White House, Democrats and some Republicans, and on Tuesday, the GOP leadership agreed to give the House a vote on the Senate bill. It passed immediately after the House rejected Cantor's bill, 257-166, with 60 Republicans voting against it.

Vice President Joe Biden, who as a senator was instrumental in moving the 1994 act through Congress, praised Cantor for not standing in the Senate bill's way. ""He kept his word,"" Biden said.

The GOP decision to step aside and let the Senate bill pass came after the party's poor showing among women in last fall's election and Democratic success in framing the debate over the Violence Against Women Act as Republican policy hostile to women. Obama won 55 percent of the women's vote last November. Republican presidential candidates haven't won the women's vote since 1984, when Ronald Reagan held a 12-point lead over Walter Mondale among women.

The anti-violence bill should never have become partisan, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a sponsor of the Senate bill. ""That is why I applaud moderate Republican voices in the House who stood up to their leadership to demand a vote on the Senate bill.""

The Senate passed its bill on a 78-22 vote with every Democrat, every woman senator and 23 of 45 Republicans supporting it.

A turning point in the debate came earlier this month, when 19 Republicans, led by Rep. Jon Runyan, R-N.J., wrote a letter to their leadership urging them to accept a bipartisan plan that would reach all victims of domestic violence. The letter, Runyan said, was a catalyst in showing the leadership ""a willingness of people in the House to really compromise"" and see that the Senate ""has a pretty good bill.""

Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a Native American, also wrote his Republican colleagues saying he was voting against the House alternative because ""it falls short of giving tribes what they need to keep their women safe.""

Indian women suffer incidents of domestic violence at rates more than double national averages, but Indian courts don't have jurisdiction over non-Indians, and federal prosecutors don't take up about half the violence cases on reservations because of lack of resources to pursue crimes on isolated Indian lands. The Senate bill would give Indian courts the ability to prosecute non-Indians for a set of crimes limited to domestic violence and violations of protecting orders. Opponents have said that raises constitutional issues.

""With this authority comes a serious responsibility, and tribal courts will administer justice with the same level of impartiality that any defendant is afforded in state and federal courts,"" said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians.

The Violence Against Women Act is credited with helping reduce domestic violence incidents by two-thirds over the past two decades. The Senate bill would authorize some $659 million a year over five years to fund current programs that provide grants for transitional housing, legal assistance, law enforcement training and hotlines.

The Senate bill adds stalking to the list of crimes that make immigrants eligible for protection and authorizes programs dealing with sexual assault on college campuses and with efforts to reduce the backlog in rape kit analyses. It reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act."

Ron Calderon,"Story highlights Calderon's lawyer: ""It's sinful how the FBI just shows up"" Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello FBI spokeswoman says no arrests are planned

(CNN) —

FBI agents raided the offices of California state Sen. Ron Calderon and the Latino legislative caucus on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear why.

“This afternoon, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants in the State Capitol at the office of Sen. Ron Calderon and in the Legislative Office Building at the Latino Legislative Caucus office,” Tony Beard, chief sergeant at arms for the California Senate, said in a statement.

“Those warrants are sealed by order of the federal court; therefore we have no further information. The Senate has and will continue to fully cooperate with the agents in this matter.”

Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello in Los Angeles County.

His spokesman, Rocky Rushing, declined to comment.

But his attorney, Mark Geragos – a high-profile lawyer who has represented Michael Jackson, among other celebrities – said the raid is “an example of how out-of-control this Department of Justice is.”

“They leak the search warrant but won’t reveal information about the investigation. It’s sinful how the FBI just shows up,” he said. “Senator Calderon is a victim of this agency that has no moral compass.”

The searches are not in response to anything recent and have nothing to do with public safety, said Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Sacramento.

According to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, no arrests are planned. She declined to identify the target and nature of the investigation.

John Hickenlooper this week blocked the execution of Nathan Dunlap, he called for a statewide conversation about the death penalty. His decision to reprieve the Chuck E. Cheese’s murderer came weeks after Colorado lawmakers killed a bill to abolish capital punishment on grounds that the topic needs more public debate.

But no such discussion has yet been planned yet by the politicians. In the meantime, civil rights watchdogs are hoping to advance the conversation in court by continuing to pursue a lawsuit tied to Dunlap’s execution.

“Up until two days ago, Colorado was scheduling an execution for this summer. The Governor has taken that execution off the calendar, but he has not taken the death penalty off the public agenda,” Mark Silverstein, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said Friday. “The public has an interest in learning exactly what the state plans to do the next time an execution [lands on its calendar].”

Dunlap was convicted of killing four people in an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurant in 1993. He exhausted legal appeals this spring and was scheduled for execution in August. The ACLU sued Colorado’s Department of Corrections on Tuesday seeking access to documentation that would detail how the state planned to put Dunlap to death.

Despite Dunlap’s reprieve and the fact that neither of the state’s two other death row inmates are scheduled for execution, the ACLU’s interest in state policies and procedures still stands. The group plans to pursue its legal battle to uncover details about the training, procedures and protocols the corrections department has put in place since executing its last inmate, Gary Davis, in 1997.

Of particular concern is how a lethal injection, the state’s method of execution, would be implemented. Davis was killed 15 years ago with three drugs, including a non-lethal dose of barbiturate or anesthetic, followed by a drug that caused paralysis and then a drug that caused death by cardiac arrest. The so-called three-drug cocktail, in which the anesthetic dosage sometimes is too low and doesn’t work, has drawn medical, legal and ethical criticism in several states for causing extreme pain while the prisoner is paralyzed and enduring a heart attack.

Colorado law specifically requires lethal injection be carried out by the continuous injection of just one drug.

Concerns about the methods to be used in Dunlap’s case heightened last month when corrections officials sent a letter to several pharmacists requesting “sodium thiopental, pentobarbital, pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, or similar drug or drugs that the CDOC can purchase.” The drug list raised questions about whether corrections officials intended to abide by the one-drug statute, prompting the ACLU to seek copies of communications between the state and pharmacies and a secret document outlining DOC’s execution protocols.

Corrections officials refused to disclose those documents. They also declined to comment about the ACLU suit after Dunlap’s reprieve other than to say they intend to conceal the identities of the pharmacists willing to provide the drugs. Officials said they wanted to protect the pharmacists’ privacy and prevent “public pressures” such as protests and boycotts that, as spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson put it, “could interfere with our duty under the statute.”

Jacobson said her department is dedicated to carrying out the wishes of its former director Tom Clements, a death penalty opponent who was slain in March and who sought to improve relationships with the ACLU and other groups watchdogging the state prison system. She added that she “doesn’t disagree” that seeking the documents is a way to further the debate about the death penalty in Colorado.

“Still, our opinion is that the documents are restricted,” she added. “It looks like we’ll be discussing it in court.”

Continued conversation about how exactly Colorado would put inmates to death could affect the likelihood that the state’s two other death row inmates, Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray, are ever executed. It could also affect sentencing decisions in cases in which the death penalty is being sought, cases such as the one against Edward Montour, whose guilty plea in the 2002 murder of a prison guard was tossed by a judge in April, and James Homes, the alleged shooter in last summer’s Aurora movie theater massacre.

The ACLU’s Silverstein says access to the DOC’s secret documents is as relevant as ever.

“We’re moving forward. More facts and more details about how executions are carried out will facilitate lots of conversations that need to take place about the death penalty.”

Hickenlooper’s announcement Wednesday to block Dunlap’s execution was applauded by dozens of social-justice groups, including the ACLU. Critics have derided Colorado’s capital punishment practices on legal and ethical grounds, including the fact that all three men on death row — Dunlap among them — are African American in a state with a population that’s less than 5 percent black.

“Colorado’s system of capital punishment is imperfect and inherently inequitable,” Hickenlooper said in announcing his decision. “Such a level of punishment really does demand perfection.”"

The Des Moines Register

Melissa Nelson was fired in 2010 after working for dentist for 10 years

Court decision that dentist%27s conduct did not constitute sexual harassment drew national attention

No new testimony will be considered when justices reconsider the case

DES MOINES, Iowa -- A woman fired from her job because she was an ""irresistible employee"" has gotten another chance at her sexual discrimination lawsuit after the Iowa Supreme Court this week took the rare step of withdrawing the unanimous opinion it issued in the case in December.

Melissa Nelson had worked for 10 years for Webster County dentist James Knight before she was fired in 2010 because of her looks. Knight eventually told Nelson's husband that ""she's a big threat to our marriage"" and that Knight feared he would attempt an affair if Nelson continued to work for him.

The court ruled that such conduct does not amount to sexual harassment because it was based on specific emotions tied to a specific relationship and not based solely on a person's gender.

The decision drew national attention that included segments on ""Good Morning America"" and the Comedy Central program ""Tosh.0.""

Nelson earlier this year asked the court to reconsider its decision.

On Monday, Chief Justice Mark Cady signed an order resubmitting Nelson's lawsuit for reconsideration by the court. Cady's order says the case will be reopened for discussion by the court; there will be no further oral arguments or additional input from Knight. Nelson's appeal will simply be re-evaluated based on previously submitted evidence and legal briefs.

A new decision could come as early Friday, when justices theoretically are scheduled to wrap up all pending cases submitted during the prior term.

An Iowa Supreme Court spokesman said it's ""rare"" for justices to grant petitions to rehear a case. Five such requests have been granted over the past decade.

Ryan Koopmans, a Des Moines attorney who blogs about legal cases at iowaappeals.com, said justices could have made technical changes to the opinion without granting a formal rehearing.

""In all likelihood, at least one justice has already changed his mind; otherwise there would be no need to rehear the case after six months,"" Koopmans said. ""So I expect that there will be at least one opinion coming out in favor of Melissa Nelson. The question is whether that opinion is the majority or the dissent.""

Neither Nelson nor her attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday.

Randall Wilson, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, called the court's decision to rehear Nelson's case ""an encouraging development"" because ""an issue of this importance probably deserves a second look.""

""On balance, while there's no right to dress the way you want to in the workplace, there is a right to be a woman,"" Wilson said.

Nelson, a former assistant, filed her lawsuit after she was fired based on Knight's stated irresistible attraction to her.

Court papers say it was roughly 18 months before the end of Nelson's employment that Knight began to complain about the distractions caused by Nelson's appearance. According to the previous ruling, ""Dr. Knight acknowledges that he once told Nelson that if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing.""

Documents say Knight's wife discovered in late 2009 that her husband had been exchanging text messages with Nelson (usually about child-related matters) and demanded that the assistant be fired.

Nelson's lawyer had argued on appeal, according to court documents, that ""if Dr. Knight would have been liable to Nelson for sexually harassing her, he should not be able to avoid liability for terminating her out of fear that he was going to harass her.""

The court's December opinion saw a difference between decisions based on personal relationships and one based on gender.

""The civil rights laws seek to insure that employees are treated the same regardless of their sex or other protected status,"" the justices wrote. ""Yet even taking Nelson's view of the facts, Dr. Knight's unfair decision to terminate Nelson (while paying her a rather ungenerous one month's severance) does not jeopardize that goal."""

But the swollen, chaotic state of California's 33 prisons -- 18 of which operate at more than 180 percent capacity -- may lead to another unconstitutional policy: race-based lockdowns. The California system is currently under fire for managing violence among the massive numbers of inmates by confining whole races of individuals to their cells for 24 hours a day during lockdowns that can last for years.

""It's incredible that this is happening in the 21st century,"" said Rebekah Evenson, the attorney for the Prison Law Office, which filed a class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last month on behalf of inmates claiming they were victims of race-based lockdowns. ""The level of violence and level of lockdowns are very closely tied to overcrowding,"" said Evenson.

But the overcrowding does not justify controlling populations based on race, Evenson argued. California is the only state in the country to adopt this type of policy, and it imposes approximately one race-based lockdown each day in one of the system's 30 male prisons, the suit alleged.

During these types of lockdowns, usually the result of a fight between a gang of one race and a gang of another race, all members of each race are confined to their cells for 24 hours a day, regardless of whether they were involved in the incident. This means that many inmates can find themselves denied exercise, educational programs, family visits and even sunlight for months at a time for merely being the same race as an inmate involved in a fight.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation denies they have an institutional policy of race-based lockdowns. However, multiple documents from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations Appeals Branch ""note that the CDCR policy is that when there is an incident involving any race, all inmates of that race are locked up.""

""There is no policy,"" said Levance Quinn, public information officer for Sacramento State Prison, where currently about 500 inmates remain on 24-hour lockdown following a riot on Friday. ""But I understand from the outside looking in how someone could confuse that,"" he said.

Quinn explained that gang fights happen all the time and that multiple gangs exist within each racial or ethnic group. Those types of fights -- when one white gang fights another white gang, for example -- aren't big security issues. The problem occurs when members of two different racial groups fight, said Quinn, because prison culture dictates that inmates must stick up for their fellow brothers.

""If someone from a black gang fights someone from a white gang, then all the blacks and all the whites get involved. So then you have to lock everyone down to make sure it's safe,"" he said.

This type of situation occurred last year in Sacramento, leading to a 24-hour lockdown that ran from Jan. 19 to Dec. 11 for every black and southern Hispanic inmate in the prison section known as B Facility, a building that houses 500 inmates in all. (Northern and southern Hispanics are often in opposing gangs, and CDCR sometimes divides the ethnic group into these two categories.) This lockdown ran for so long, the prison arranged for the two groups to make alternate trips to the yard to get exercise.

Quinn said that even though black and southern Hispanic inmates who had nothing to do with the fight were on lockdown for nearly a year, it's not indicative of an institutional race-based policy.

""It's not based on their race; it's based on these two knuckleheads that got in a fight,"" said Quinn. ""It's really hard to explain to the outside world,"" he added.

A blue sign hangs outside the wall of one of Evenson's defendants, Hanif Abdullah, jailed at Solano. It denotes a black inmate, and Abdullah has been confined to his cell for 24-hour lockdowns that applied to all black inmates five times in the last two years, Evenson's suit alleges.

Abdullah's cell, which he shares with one other inmate and is so small the two can barely stand up at the same time, has one window that looks into the interior of the dormitory. Each day during his confinement, which lasted a total of approximately six months over the course of two years, Abdullah watched the rest of the prison world go about their business just by virtue of not being black.

""He could hear staff announcing the privileges available to other races, 'School release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,' 'Yard release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,'"" the suit reads. ""Mr. Abdullah suffered from the indignity, humiliation, and inhumanity, of the stark race discrimination.""

It was a statement about the founding of the United States of America. Here's the sentence:

""The United States of America was established as a white society, founded upon the near genocide of another race and then the enslavement of yet another.""

The comments were overwhelming, with many calling the statement outrageous and some calling it courageous. But it was neither. The sentence was a simply a historical statement of the facts. It was the first sentence of a Sojourners magazine cover article, published 26 years ago, titled ""America's Original Sin: The Legacy of White Racism.""

An extraordinary new film called 12 Years a Slave has just come out and Sojourners hosted the premiere for the faith community on March 9 in Washington, D.C. Rev. Otis Moss III was on the panel afterward that reflected on the film. Dr. Moss is not only a dynamic pastor and preacher in Chicago, but he is also a teacher of cinematography who put this compelling story about Solomon Northup -- a freeman from New York, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery -- into the historical context of all the American films ever done on slavery. 12 Years is the most accurate and best produced drama of slavery ever done, says Moss.

In her New York Times review, ""The Blood and Tears, Not the Magnolias,"" Manohla Dargis says, 12 Years a Slave ""isn't the first movie about slavery in the United States -- but it may be the one that finally makes it impossible for American cinema to continue to sell the ugly lies it's been hawking for more than a century."" Instead of the Hollywood portrayal of beautiful plantations, benevolent masters, and simple happy slaves, it shows the utterly brutal violence of a systematic attempt to dehumanize an entire race of people -- for economic greed. It reveals how morally outrageous the slave system was, and it is very hard to watch.

That's why we have to see it, all of us -- especially all of us white people. You can read the blog series on the film that we have been running in Sojourners, but you must go see it. I say that because many white people, even white people who care about social justice, have told me they don't want to see it. ""Too violent,"" I hear them say, ""Sounds too intense for me."" The enslavement of more than 4 million people of African descent by white Americans was always that violent and too intense for most white people to really accept the truth -- even now.

My comment from the panel afterward was that most white people, the vast majority in both the South and the North including our ""founding fathers,"" all accepted slavery. Most white people, white Christians, and white churches tolerated slavery for 246 years. This historically horrendous evil existed because we tolerated it. That's why evil always continues to exist: because we tolerate it.

What do we tolerate today, I asked. The film is so breathtaking, I worry that it becomes a museum movie, a film about a horrible past that is gratefully all over now. We did tolerate this gratuitous evil, and still tolerate the devaluing of black lives today. Would we tolerate completely dysfunctional urban schools if they were full of young white children? We tolerate a criminal justice system where the racial disparities between white and black arrests, convictions, and sentencing are abundantly clear, resulting in the mass incarceration of men of color. We tolerate the murder rates for people of color that we would never tolerate for whites. We tolerate the clear racial profiling of young black men, with results that we would never tolerate for our white teenage boys. And we tolerate deliberate and clear political efforts to diminish the votes of minority communities.

And it's time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of ""playing the race card."" So let me, as a white man and an evangelical Christian, do some truth-telling about race in American politics right now.

In only about 30 years, most Americans will come from Africa, Asia, or Latin America. Most Americans will no longer be white, and many white Americans are clearly not ready for that profound demographic change in their country. That white fear of who ""we"" Americans will be is at the heart of resistance to immigration reform. Many older conservative Republican and Tea Party voters are acutely aware of being ""white"" in a country that is becoming increasingly ""minority."" Congressional voting districts have been oddly gerrymandered along racial lines to protect dominant racial majorities. Shutting down a government that they believe to be too generous to minorities becomes an urgent matter. ""Obamacare"" becomes the great threat of government providing medical insurance disproportionately to poor people of color. Giving food stamps to poor families becomes another racial flashpoint for conservative white voters.

Finally, a black president becomes the most hated symbol of the demographic changes they most fear for their country.

Questioning Barack Obama's birthplace and parentage, calling him a non-Christian Muslim, naming him as a ""foreigner"" and not a ""real American"" are all ways to define this president as ""the other"" and not one of ""us."" The hatred goes far beyond Obama's policies and extends to his personage as the wrong kind of American. Obama shows them they are losing elections, and they fear that means losing ""their"" country.

Who will lead in our racially polarized time? Who will help America navigate its changing demographic future? Who will help a new generation create a diverse, multiracial society? Perhaps a community of faith that is intrinsically multiracial and is becoming so more and more.

Because of recent events that demonstrate the racial challenges ahead, more than 70 Christian leaders -- white, African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and Native American --are launching a pledge called ""One Church | One Body."" The pledge invites everyone to engage three commitments -- first, to help build a multiracial faith community; second, to help fix an unjust criminal justice system; and third, to protect voting rights for minority citizens. Consider joining us in our pledge and do not shy away from seeing 12 Years a Slave. It's the start of a conversation that's long overdue."

If they valued their lives, and the lives of their families, the last thing they would have done was voiced a complaint about ""white people"" to a man like Robertson.

The corpse of 16-year-old Freddie Moore, his face showing signs of a severe beating, hands bound, remained hanging for at least 24 hours from a metal girder on the old, hand-cranked swing bridge spanning Bayou Lafourche. Hanged by the neck the night of Oct. 11, 1933, in a mob lynching, the black youth had been accused in the death of a neighbor, a white girl ... Arrested Oct. 10, 1933, in the slaying days earlier of Anna Mae LaRose, a 15-year-old girl who was his friend, Moore was pulled from the parish jail in Napoleonville the next night by an angry mob of 50 to 200 armed and unmasked people who had the prison keys.

After being hauled from the jail, Moore was brought to the field where LaRose’s body was found, according to an Oct. 14, 1933, account in the black-owned New Orleans newspaper, The Louisiana Weekly. With a rope around his neck and clothes stripped to his waist, the teen was then marched, while being beaten, from the murder scene to the bridge and subjected to a branding iron whenever he fell. Hanging from his body, a sign offered the final indignity: “Niggers Let This Be An Example. Do-Not-Touch-In 24 Hr. Mean it.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates thinks he understands why Phil Robertson didn't see any Louisiana black folk complaining about ""doggone white people"" as they happily toiled in the cotton fields of pre-Civil Rights-era Louisiana. His thought is that blacks' reluctance to express their grievances too loudly may have been tempered by certain events in their state's record on matters of racial tolerance:Ah, 1933. The same year our white European brethren began their novel legislative experiments in civic gentrification, the American South for its part continued to take care of its business the old-fashioned way--by mob rule.In his folksy diatribe about his purported experiences in the cotton fields working alongside ""godly"" blacks humming spirituals, Phil Robertson refers to himself as ""white trash,"" apparently in an effort to align himself with their experience (""I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash.""). He never stops to think about why he had to say ""white."" After all, trash is trash, right?

Well, not exactly. Without blacks there'd be no need for Robertson to describe himself as ""white trash.""

Michael Pfeifer, associate Professor of History at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has identified 422 victims of lynching in Louisiana between 1878 and 1946. These are among approximately 2500 lynchings in the South that occurred after Reconstruction. The number of lynchings prior to Reconstruction was in the thousands. Whether Moore was actually guilty of the killing has faded from the public record (some witnesses claimed the girl's stepfather later confessed, although distant members of the girl's family disputed this). Other witnesses identified two deputy sheriffs from the Assumption Parish as leading the lynch mob, an allegation also disputed by the Parish sheriff, Lizen H. Himel. A Federal Jury in 1936 ultimately held Himel liable for his deputies' actions and awarded Moore's parents a judgment of $2500.

To his credit, Coates is less concerned about the statements of self-promoters like Robertson than he is about making a ""teachable moment"" out of this media fiasco. The idea that Robertson could ever place himself in the shoes of these black farm workers--or any other black person in Louisiana -- simply ignores the reality of the times:

That is because governance in Phil Robertson's Louisiana was premised on terrorism. As late as 1890, the majority of people in Louisiana were black. As late as 1902, they still lived under threat of slavery through debt peonage and the convict-lease system. Virtually all of them were pilfered of their vote and their tax dollars. Plunder and second slavery were enforced by violence, as when the besiegers of Colfax massacred 50 black freedmen with rifles and cannon and tossed their bodies into a river. Even today the Colfax Massacre is honored in Louisiana as the rightful ""end of carpetbag misrule."" .

The black people who Phil Robertson knew were warred upon. If they valued their lives, and the lives of their families, the last thing they would have done was voiced a complaint about ""white people"" to a man like Robertson.

The belief that black people were at their best when they were being hunted down like dogs for the sin of insisting on citizenship is a persistent strain of thought in this country. This belief reflects the inability to cope with an America that is, at least rhetorically, committed to equality.

The ""Colfax"" massacre , as it became known, occurred in 1873 in Colfax, Louisiana, and is described as the worst instance of racial violence in Reconstruction. This atrocity as well as the Moore slaying and the never-ending specter of the lynch mob were the realities of black life in Louisiana before the Civil Rights movement.Coates sees a familiar pattern in statements like those of Mr. Robertson--the deliberate willful retreat into a mythical past that never existed:From the struggle of African-Americans for civil rights, Coates draws a direct parallel to the modern-day struggle for same-sex equality, noting that Robertson's tirade against gays follows the same reliance on Biblical proscriptions, the same type of proscriptions that were once used to justify slavery:

“Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God.""

Phil Robertson

[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.

Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America

http://en.wikipedia.org/...

Coates concludes that the bigot's song remains the same:

This is not just ignorance; it is a willful retreat into myth. And we must have the intellectual courage and moral strength to follow the myth through. If swindlers, goat-fuckers, and gay men are really all the same—disinherited from the kingdom of God—why not treat them the same? How does one argue that a man who is disfavored by the Discerner of All Things, should not be shamed, should not jeered, should not be stoned, should not be lynched in the street? Further retreat into the inanity of loving the sinner but hating the sin—a standard that would clean The Wise Helmsman himself—will not do. Actual history shows that humans are not so discriminating. Black people were once thought to be sinners. We were rewarded with a species of love that bore an odd resemblance to hate. One need not be oversensitive to be concerned about Phil Robertson's thoughts on gay sex. One simply need be a student of American history.

Phil Robertson is simply a sad, deluded little man. What he thinks or says is of no particular importance except what it reveals, however unwittingly, about America's ongoing struggle with itself over race. The fact that his supporters and detractors have lined up yet again along political lines just shows how little the country has changed in a hundred and fifty years."

Buffett challenged male executives to think about how women can boost productivity.

“Obama sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him,” they said in a statement. “This is a beautiful tribute to our boy.”

The president surprised the White House press corps Friday afternoon, relating his own experiences to those of Martin and other African American youths.

TRANSCRIPT: Obama on Trayvon Martin case

“There are very few African American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me,” Obama said. “There are very few African American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.”

Obama also called for closer inspection of “stand your ground” laws in the wake of the acquittal of Martin’s shooter, George Zimmerman. Robert Zimmerman, George’s brother, thanked Obama for his “sincere” remarks, but advised him to go a step further in an interview with Fox News.

“The president talked about encouraging African American youth but I would say also youth of all colors,” Zimmerman said. “It might be in situations in their life that they don’t feel like they’re getting the encouragement from society that they need. That’s one of the things my brother was doing before this incident.”

Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) praised Obama for providing “a great starting point to reignite a dialog on what should be done on a number of fronts to address the challenges confronting black youth in America.”

“As the president said, ‘We’ve made progress,’ but progress doesn’t mean we’ve closed the book,” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) said on his Facebook page. “All children deserve to walk home from a convenience store, having done nothing wrong, free from fear of being profiled, harassed or killed.”

Obama supporters saw the address as a landmark moment for the president, while members of the press were surprised by the frank and lengthy delivery from a president who talks little about race.

Appearing in a Monday interview on Al Jazeera America’s Talk to Al Jazeera with David Shuster, West said 2.5 million new prisoners have been incarcerated while Obama has been in office mostly “because of soft drugs” and the disparity in “crack cocaine versus regular cocaine” users. West referred to this phenomenon as the “new Jim Crow” because he said minority communities and the poor are disproportionately impacted.

West blasted the level of corruption on Wall Street that has seen few people to go jail and said there has been a “two-tiered” system of justice under Obama.

West said that disparity applied to Obama’s economy as well, as corporations have made record profits while there has been “massive unemployment” and “increasing wealth inequality.” He said struggling Americans are “giving up work” or “working part time” in Obama’s economy and those numbers are not reflected in the official unemployment numbers.

Shuster, conversely, gushed over Obama’s accomplishments, saying Obama’s presidency should be considered a success if his presidency was judged by “morality” because Obama prevented a depression, passed Obamacare, ended the Iraq War, ended “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and appointed the first Latina Supreme Court justice. He continued to defend Obama, saying Obama saved the economy and the unemployment rate would have been worse without Obama.

But West disagreed, saying Martin Luther King Jr. would not approve of the “vanilla suburbs” at home that symbolize the income inequality that he said has gotten worse since King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” 50 year ago. West acknowledged that Appalachia also had problems with income and crime inequality."

Among other issues, the RAND study tries to match up stops to compare how whites and blacks are treated but in doing so fails to account for basic things like which potential crime prompted the stop and how reasonable the cop's suspicion was. The sample of officers the RAND study looks at isn't representative, and the benchmark they use to determine the races of those stopped is derived from analysis of violent crimes, which make up a tiny fraction of stops. Fagan concludes that ""the analyses in the report are unreliable and methodologically flawed to the extent that it is not reliable evidence that racial bias is absent in NYPD stop and frisk activity."""

Only 19% of California voters in a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll said those in the country illegally should be required to leave the United States. About two-thirds of survey respondents said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay with eventual citizenship rights. An additional 10% said they should be permitted to remain in this country to work but should not be allowed to apply for citizenship.

At a time when the push for immigration reform has gained momentum in Washington, more than two-thirds of California voters say the current immigration system isn’t working and nearly three-quarters favor President Obama’s plan to change it, the poll found.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

Across different ages and ethnic groups, voters were largely supportive of the measures outlined by Obama and a bipartisan group of senators, including enhancing border security, requiring employers to verify the legal status of their employees and permitting certain undocumented workers to become citizens as long as they pay taxes and fines and are processed behind those who come legally.

Though Obama’s association with the proposal made it less palatable to some Republicans, a slender majority of GOP voters in the state said they backed the president’s plan — a finding that, along with the drubbing their party took from Latino voters last fall, helps to illustrate why Republicans have grown more comfortable aligning themselves with citizenship for illegal immigrants.

“There’s really not much of a debate in California about immigration anymore, and there may not even be a national debate,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic firm that conducted the poll with the Republican firm American Viewpoint. “It’s no longer a partisan or racial issue for Californians.”

The state’s voters have long held more moderate views on immigration than voters in other parts of the country, in part because of California’s burgeoning Latino population. But the poll results illustrated that, even here, views about illegal immigrants have changed notably.

Advertisement

In 2010, when pollsters asked about the effect of illegal immigrants on the California economy, 48% of respondents said their effect was negative and 40% said it was positive. In the latest survey, only 36% said their impact was negative, and 53% said it was positive — a “huge shift,” Lieberman said, that spanned all age groups and could not be explained simply by the surging population of Latinos in the state.

Part of what appears to be driving that change are the personal connections that many California voters have formed with illegal immigrants. Latinos were more likely than whites to know one — a majority of Latinos described that person as either a friend or family member — and among all voters who knew any, only 8% said illegal immigrants should be forced to leave the country.

Advertisement

“That tells me that immigration reform is really about la familia, especially for Hispanics, but even white voters can kind of understand that,” said Dave Kanevsky, the research director at American Viewpoint.

And that familiarity has affected views across political lines. Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, noted that California Republicans live in a much more multicultural society than party members elsewhere, “so the lives they live every day and the people they see are probably the main reason that their feelings are different than their national counterparts’.”

Advertisement

That has been the case for 33-year-old Fresno Republican Chris Leake, who said the friendships he developed with undocumented workers in the U.S. and while doing volunteer work in Mexico have made him more inclined to support a path to citizenship.

“I understand why they come up here illegally — I don’t agree with it, per se, but I understand why,” said Leake, who works in Internet marketing. For many workers, he said, “it was extremely expensive and they ran great personal risk to do it, but they did it because they felt like they needed the income.”

Advertisement

Leake, along with 73% of poll respondents, said he would favor the inclusion of a guest worker program in any new immigration package, which he said “would start to solve the problem.”

“There’s a significant percentage that want nothing more than to come up here, earn money for a time and then go back to Mexico,” Leake said. “Instead they stay for years at a time, because it’s so hard to get up here in the first place. And that’s having devastating effects on their families.”

Advertisement

Julie Rapoza, a 54-year-old Democrat from Manteca, said her brushes with illegal immigrants have had the opposite effect. The number of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, she said, has hardened her view that most undocumented workers should be required to return home — a view that puts her at odds with most in her party.

At the same time, however, Rapoza said she believed illegal immigrants had a beneficial effect on California’s economy. “A lot of them do jobs that even unemployed citizens won’t do,” said Rapoza, who favors an expansive guest worker program. Otherwise, employers “would be paying an arm and a leg to get workers to do it and that would make prices go way up.”

Other poll respondents said they felt it would be impossible to deport an estimated 11 million immigrants.

“We don’t have any choice,” said James Scoville, a 67-year-old independent voter, when asked whether he favored giving illegal immigrants a way to become citizens. “Some of them have been here 20, 30, 40 years and have jobs and houses and everything else. Create a path for them, put them at the bottom of the list. I think that’s pretty much the only sensible thing to do.”

Some demographic differences were evident: White voters were more likely than Latinos to support stricter border security measures and requiring employers to verify, under threat of fines, that all employees are legal. Still, a majority of Latinos backed both those ideas.

But white respondents were nearly as supportive of a path to citizenship as Latino voters — 81% and 86% respectively. Not surprisingly, Democrats were the most supportive of all. In the survey, 88% said they favored creating that path, compared with 76% of Republicans and 83% of decline-to-state voters.

The poll, which interviewed 1,501 registered voters by telephone, was conducted March 11-17 for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times. The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.9 percentage points, with a higher margin of error for subgroups.

“We welcome the government’s belated recognition that it must give notice to criminal defendants who it has monitored under the most sweeping surveillance law ever passed by Congress,” Mr. Toomey said. “By withholding notice, the government has avoided judicial review of its dragnet warrantless wiretapping program for five years.”

The Justice Department change traces back to June, when The Times reported that prosecutors in Fort Lauderdale and Chicago had told plaintiffs they did not need to say whether evidence in their cases derived from warrantless wiretapping, in conflict with what the Justice Department had told the Supreme Court.

After reading the article, Mr. Verrilli sought an explanation from the National Security Division, whose lawyers had vetted his briefs and helped him practice for his arguments, according to officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations. It was only then that he learned of the division’s practice of narrowly interpreting its need to notify defendants of evidence “derived from” warrantless wiretapping.

There ensued a wider debate throughout June and July, the officials said. National security prosecutors raised operational concerns: disclosing more to defendants could tip off a foreign target that his communications were being monitored, so intelligence officials might become reluctant to share crucial information that might create problems in a later trial.

Mr. Verrilli was said to have argued that there was no legal basis to conceal from defendants that the evidence derived from legally untested surveillance, preventing them from knowing they had an opportunity to challenge it. Ultimately, his view prevailed and the National Security Division changed its practice going forward, leading to the new filing on Friday in Mr. Muhtorov’s case.

Still, it remains unclear how many other cases — including closed matters in which convicts are already service prison sentences — involved evidence derived from warrantless wiretapping in which the National Security Division did not provide full notice to defendants, nor whether the department will belatedly notify them. Such a notice could lead to efforts to reopen those cases."

It should begin by tackling comprehensive immigration reform.

After all, much of the heavy lifting on this complicated and controversial issue has been done. Earlier this year, the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that calls for allowing more high-skilled and low-skilled workers into the U.S. while also establishing a new guest-worker program that includes additional protections for farm workers. It would set out a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but only after they paid fines and passed a background check, and after additional border security measures were put in place. It’s not a perfect plan, but it takes the kind of broad approach that is needed to restructure the dysfunctional system.

The Republican-led House, however, has not signed on, opting instead for a piecemeal approach. Among the separate proposals waiting to reach the floor are an enforcement bill, known as the SAFE Act, which would for the first time designate as criminals all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and would allow states such as Arizona to enforce their own immigration laws. Another bill would create a new guest-worker program that would likely please growers but leave farm laborers unprotected from abusive employers. Two other bills would expand the use of federal databases to verify the immigration status of new employees.

The two sides are far apart, obviously. But there is some reason for hope after months of stalemate. In an effort to repair some of the political damage the GOP inflicted on itself during the shutdown, some House Republicans apparently are calling for action on immigration reform to win back moderate support. If the House approved just one of its piecemeal bills, it could move to a conference committee, where Senate and House members could begin to reconcile their differences. If it goes that route, the House should pass its border security measure, which is the best of the bills introduced so far. But it’s unclear whether Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will allow any of the bills to move forward.

The reality is that the current immigration system isn’t working for American employers, who rely on the low-wage labor that comes in over the border, or for the millions of immigrants stuck in the underground economy. That’s why a broad coalition of religious, law enforcement and business leaders has repeatedly called for a compromise.

Immigration reform can still be achieved, if only GOP lawmakers stop stalling, stop grandstanding and get to work."

[twitter-follow screen_name='EricCNNBelief']

(CNN) –The Obama administration will not label Westboro Baptist Church a hate group, saying it's not the government's practice to apply the designation.

More than 367,000 petitioners had called on the White House to ""Legally recognize Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group."" For months the Westboro petition was the top petition on the White House's ""We The People"" website.

Four related petitions, including one calling for the Internal Revenue Service to revoke Westboro's tax exemption, also garnered more than 300,000 signatures.

A White House official, speaking on background, told CNN that petitions that cross the threshold of 100,000 signatures are reviewed by policy staff and receive a response.

On Tuesday, the White House posted its response to the Westboro petitions.

Officially, the response to the requested hate group designation was ""no comment.""

""As a matter of practice, the federal government doesn't maintain a list of hate groups,"" the White House said.

Instead, labeling hate groups is the job of private groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, the White House said.

But the administration did comment on other aspects of the petitions, agreeing that protesting at military funerals - one of Westboro's favorite practices - is ""reprehensible."" An animated map posted online shows what the White House says is opposition to the church spreading across the country.

""We agree that practices such as protesting at the funerals of men and women who died in service to this country and preventing their families from mourning peacefully are reprehensible - a point that President Obama has made for years,"" the White House said.

In response to Westboro, Congress and Obama enacted a law in 2012 restricting protesters' time at, and proximity to, military funerals. The law followed a 2011 Supreme Court decision upholding Westboro's free speech rights to protest at funerals.

Led by its pastor, Fred Phelps, Westboro says soldiers' deaths are part of God's punishment on the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality.""

Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags.""

Westboro Baptist Church is not affiliated with a broader Baptist denomination. The autonomous church has 50 members, many of whom are members of the Phelps family. The church says they have picketed more than 50,000 events.

A GIF map created by the White House highlights the ZIP codes of the people who signed the anti-Westboro petitions.

The map shows heavy concentration of signers in Kansas and Connecticut, ""two places that have unique insight into the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church,"" the White House said. The church is based in Topeka, Kansas. As for Connecticut, the Obama administration suggests the anti-Westboro animus stems from the church's threats to protest the funerals of students killed in December's Sandy Hook School shooting.

Westboro responded to the petition on social media.

""About to swoon with glee! @ whitehouse @ barackobama telling the world about @ WBCSays preachments!"" they wrote, adding a picture of the president with horns and the title ""AntiChrist Obama.""

The Supreme Court today – in a 5-4 decision – delivered another victory to corporate America. In Vance v. Ball State University, the court made it more difficult for employees to sue their employers over harassment in the workplace, the latest instance in which Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's conservatives have pledged fealty to business interests, to the detriment of American workers. In this case, the court narrowed the definition of ""supervisor"" in the workplace, making it so that supervisor means only those with the ability to hire and fire. As Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority's opinion, someone is only a supervisor ""if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim."" [...] It's not hard to see the problem with limiting ""supervisor"" to only those who have hiring and firing power. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the dissent, the court's decision ""strikes from the supervisory category employees who control the day-to-day schedules and assignments of others,"" which ""ignores the conditions under which members of the work force labor.""

In a pair of 5-4 decisions handed down Monday morning, a conservative pro-business majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has closed the courthouse doors to individuals seeking redress against their employers. [...] In both cases, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sided with the corporations, bringing its record to 13-3 this term. (Good enough for a first-round bye, because clearly the Chamber has home-field advantage before the Supremes.) And in both cases, this will lead to fewer lawsuits trying to hold employers accountable—indeed, in Dr. Nassar's case, the five conservative Justices openly decry just how many retaliation lawsuits are filed, and cheer on the closing of the courthouse doors to these victims.

The most remarkable thing about the Supreme Court’s opinions announced Monday was not what the justices wrote or said. It was what Samuel Alito did. The associate justice, a George W. Bush appointee, read two opinions, both 5-4 decisions that split the court along its usual right-left divide. But Alito didn’t stop there. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, Alito visibly mocked his colleague. Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the high court, was making her argument about how the majority opinion made it easier for sexual harassment to occur in the workplace when Alito, seated immediately to Ginsburg’s left, shook his head from side to side in disagreement, rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling. His treatment of the 80-year-old Ginsburg, 17 years his elder and with 13 years more seniority, was a curious display of judicial temperament or, more accurately, judicial intemperance.

PRESIDENT OBAMA’S first major trip to sub-Saharan Africa on Wednesday is expected to cost from $60 million to $100 million, prompting many calls for the president to cancel his trip. Yet, such opposition is shortsighted: Now, more than ever, the United States cannot afford to ignore Africa. Geopolitically, Africa is an emerging force to be reckoned with. Economically, it hosts several of the world’s fastest growing economies — including Rwanda, Zambia, and Mozambique — while the continent as a whole is expected to outstrip global growth for at least the next three years. Simultaneously, the rise of fundamentalist actors hostile to US interests — especially in Somalia and Nigeria — means that the continent presents unprecedented exigencies in the security realm as well.

the excessive, flamboyant nature of the Hoeven-Corker approach is its entire point. Yes, people like Rand Paul and John Cornyn can and will continue to claim that they oppose the overall immigration bill because it just isn't tough enough on border security. But with this amendment now part of the bill, any plausibility that excuse might once have had is gone. If you oppose the Senate bill, even after all this, you oppose it because you oppose a path to legitimacy for the 11 million or so illegal immigrants in this country. Period. If you oppose the Senate bill, you cast your lot with Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and other hardliners who offer no solution to the problem other than keeping those people in the shadows as a permanent underclass for the rest of their lives.

Cable news channels regularly stoke their viewers' fears about China holding $1.1 trillion of U.S. debt. But they're focused on the wrong $1.1 trillion of loans. The borrowers of this other $1.1-trillion debt are far more likely to default on their obligations: students, particularly those who went to for-profit colleges. The global consequences could be — and likely will be — staggering. More than 38 million Americans have student loans outstanding. To put this in perspective, 38 million is the combined population of New York and Florida. And this collective debt is on par with the entire GDP of Mexico.

And, of course, don't forget to read Adam Bonin's excellent analysis Switching topics, Jason Warner at The Boston Globe examines the context of President Obama's trip to sub-Saharan Africa:On the topic of immigration reform, the other big topic of the week, Jay Bookman at The Atlanta Journal Constitution points out that immigration foes are ""down to just one argument"" now that the heavy-handed Hoeven-Corker amendment is on the table:Finally, Adam B.

In a letter to the district’s lawyer on Friday, the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney, said that it was “specifically” looking into whether the school system, its Board of Education, employees and agents “have discriminated against students on the basis of national origin and religion.”

The New York Times reported on Friday that some Jewish students in the Pine Bush schools were subjected in recent years to anti-Semitic bullying and slurs and other intimidation.

The activity grew so severe that three families last year sued the school system in Federal District Court in White Plains, charging that their children’s rights were being violated by “rampant anti-Semitic discrimination and harassment” and “deliberate indifference” by administrators. The district, which is about 90 minutes north of New York City, serves 5,600 children from Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties."

They apparently felt that her phone call to her mother was taking too long.

“[Police officer Ricky Grissom ] said, ‘I’ve been waiting here all this time when I could have been out patrolling, waiting on you. This is stupid,’” Diggles recalled. “He just went to cussing. And then I was like, ‘Well, you don’t have to yell at me.’”

Grissom then pushed Ms. Diggles into a wall, before the other officer, Ryan Cunningham, arrived on the scene. He grabbed her hair, at which point she had her head slammed into a counter top at the police station. Next, the two officers violently took her to the floor where she was handcuffed. They then tore off her shoes and dragged her by her feet and ankles to a nearby holding cell. Their actions resulted in a broken tooth and other injuries. Naturally she was charged with resisting arrest. Here's the police station's surveillance video recording of the incident (no audio available):

At least these two lawless ""law enforcement officers"" (and I use that term loosely) were fired for their physically abusive actions and the charges of resisting arrest against Ms. Diggles were dropped. Jasper, Texas, by the way, is the same community where James Byrd was infamously murdered by several white men in a most gruesome manner: he was tied to the back of their pick-up truck and dragged down local streets until he died from his injuries. Jasper certainly sounds like a terrible place to live if you are not white:

Jasper's interim city manager confirmed the terminations [of the two white officers], but referred questions about the Diggles case to the interim police chief, who was unreachable Monday afternoon. “The more things change, the more they remain the same,” Jasper City Council Member Alton Scott said of the city's racial troubles. Scott obtained the video in the Diggles’ incident and turned it over to a local TV station after he heard that her written complaint against the officers was apparently being ignored. “There’s nothing she said that could have justified what they did,” Scott said. “They are supposed to be trained professionals. They are supposed to be above that. It was inexcusable.” After terminating the officers on Monday [June 3rd], the council requested that the pair be investigated for possible criminal charges. Bernsen said he hopes that probe is done by the FBI or state police.

My guess is that nothing more will come of this other than a civil settlement between the town and Ms. Diggles, and that these now former police officers will find employment in the law enforcement field elsewhere, but I could be wrong. Maybe they actually will be prosecuted and convicted of criminal assault and/or a hate crime. However I won't hold my breath awaiting that outcome."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/10/1215056/-Supremes-enforce-ex-post-facto-clause-while-Justice-Thomas-would-go-back-to-1798,2013-06-10 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']","Supremes enforce ex post facto clause, while Justice Thomas would go back to 1798","First, this reminder: The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are, at this point in the law, only guidelines. Post-Apprendi and Booker, a federal district court judge must use the guidelines as a starting point, but is free to depart from them (in either direction) based on stated reasons so long as it is deemed a reasonable use of the judge's discretion.

Justice Sotomayor's decision starts with Calder v Bull, a 1798 decision of the Court, which held that the Ex Post Facto clause applies to:

“1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.”

That a district court may ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the Guidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that an incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error ensures that they remain the starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system.... Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicating that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges. Even after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases imposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences that depart downward from the Guidelines on the Government’s motion. In less than one-fifth of cases since 2007 have district courts imposed above- or below-Guidelines sentences absent a Government motion. Moreover, the Sentencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guidelines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move with it. The federal system adopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.

First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended Guidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive a harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guidelines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply with §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in essence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sentence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological goals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve such pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create a risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The Government does not challenge these holdings but rather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise to an ex post facto violation.... On the Government’s account, the Guidelines are just one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court can consult, no different from a “policy paper.” The Government’s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that district courts are not required to consult any policy paper in order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must they “consider the extent of [their] deviation” from a given policy paper and “ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance."" Courts of appeals, in turn, are not permitted to presume that a sentence that comports with a particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of appeals, in considering whether the district court’s sentence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure from a given policy paper in determining whether the district court abused its discretion. It is simply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely a volume that the district court reads with academic interest in the course of sentencing…. District courts must begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense and use them to calculate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines will anchor both the district court’s discretion and the appellate review process in all of the ways we have described. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the status of one of many reasons a district court might give for deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is simply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.

The arguments put forward by the Government and the dissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh’s case falls within Calder’s third category of ex post facto violations. “[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [government] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering the substantive ‘formula’ used to calculate the applicable sentencing range.” Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is precisely what the amended Guidelines did here.

And so, Justice Sotomayor argues, the guidelines are binding enough so as to effectively change the sentencing rules midstream:To which the dissenters (led by Justice Thomas) argue, no, wait, a guideline is not a ""law"":To which Justice Sotomayor and the majority responds:Oh, snap. Justice Thomas wrote the Morales decision.

So that's that. Almost. Because I need to flag one more instance, where, yet again, Justice Thomas flies solo, going much further into originalist precedent-destroying than any of his conservative colleagues. See, Justice Thomas would have also held that ""nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post Facto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that prisoners and defendants have about how many days they will spend in prison,"" and hold that so long as the longer sentence was possible under the earlier sentencing regime, it would not violate the Ex Post Facto clause to impose it on the defendant. Everyone who's been interpreting Calder in the subsequent 200+ years, Justice Thomas believes, has been doing it wrong (even though he, himself, did the same thing in Morales in 1995):

Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a defendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not implicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual contemplating the commission of a given offense knows he may be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed range. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he may even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But he does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U. S., at 258 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment) (“Discretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the sentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of the risks that the offender knowingly assumes”). The law provides the defendant with only one assurance: He will be sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by statute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not deprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the concerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was an error to which I succumbed.

As to his undermining his own decision in Morales, Justice Thomas sheepishly drops a footnote:Again: Only Thomas went there. (He also clearly loses points for the wussy use of the passive voice. How about ""As the author of Morales, I erred in failing to apply original meaning""?)

Indeed, Justices Alito and Scalia issued a separate dissent just to make clear to everyone that they wouldn't (yet). In its entirety, it reads:

I agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that retroactive application of amended advisory Guidelines does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause under our “sufficient risk” test. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 509 (1995). I do not have occasion in this case to reconsider that test’s merits or its relation to the original understanding of the Clause.

So Peugh goes to jail (for less time, probably), and Justice Thomas goes his own way. Again."

Yet two days ago Weinstein called the Pentagon demanding that a Christian painting be removed from a dining hall in an Idaho Air Force base, and the Pentagon complied with his demand–in less than one hour.

On Apr. 28, Breitbart News reported that Pentagon brass met with Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation. That was shortly after Weinstein published an article in which he called observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek to impose “a rapacious reign of theocratic terror” in the military through their “putrid theology.”

While he opposes all religion in the military, Weinstein reserves his most caustic language for observant Christians. And the one thing he objects to above all things is proselytizing in the military, which Christians call evangelism.

Regarding evangelism, Weinstein told the Washington Post that, “What is happening aside from sexual assault is spiritual rape. And what the Pentagon needs to understand is that it is sedition and treason. It should be punished.” (Emphases added and brackets omitted.)

Weinstein said service members who evangelize in the military should be court-martialed, and added, “You need a dozen court-martials real quick.” A court martial is a criminal prosecution in the military, which depending on the crime can carry punishments ranging from fines, to expulsion from the military, to imprisonment. In case anyone missed the point, he also said, “We would love to see hundreds of prosecutions.”

It must be noted that the Pentagon says it would not take this drastic step called for by Weinstein. It should also be noted, however, that the Pentagon continues to change its story on what its policy is on evangelism.

Nevertheless, the latest example of Weinstein’s influence with the Obama-Hagel Pentagon came last week, as reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes. In the dining hall of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho there was a painting-style picture of a U.S. Airman with imagery of the cross, above the word “Integrity” and with a reference to Matthew 5:9. (That verse reads, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”)

Weinstein called the Pentagon directly to complain about the picture. Less than one hour later, the picture was permanently removed.

Col. Christopher Short, the base commander, told Fox News the artwork was removed because, “We make reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrate the religious diversity of our Airmen.” It’s an odd statement to say that accommodating religion and celebrating diversity means tearing down Christian artwork.

Weinstein has previously boasted that he has special status with the leadership of the Air Force Academy similar to the “bat signal” from Batman. He explains that:

… he and Superintendent Lt. Gen. Mike Gould devised a code word only they know in case Weinstein needs to reach Gould with concerns about religious liberty on campus. “We have our own bat-signal,” Weinstein said Friday, referring to the beam of light used to summon Batman in the DC Comic series…. Having a means to reach Gould with any concerns is a positive step in the work to make the academy religiously neutral ground, he said. “We had a bad 96-hour period where I felt like we had fallen back to the bad old days,” he said. “Our relationship [now] is stronger than ever.”

Given Weinstein’s published anti-Christian statements, his relationship with top military officials should raise eyebrows.

And it has done so on Capitol Hill. After Breitbart News’ reporting on this relationship, 59 congressmen sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel demanding to know who approved these meetings and what was discussed. A group of 72 congressmen then sent a second letter demanding to know what the Pentagon is doing to protect the First Amendment rights of service members.

Also last week, one of Weinstein’s staff members published a column denigrating Congress’ efforts, and mocking Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) for coauthoring with Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) the letter signed by 59 Members of Congress. Taunting congressional leaders who are probing this situation may provoke lawmakers to amend federal law to clarify and reinforce service members rights regarding sharing their faith.

The Obama-Hagel Pentagon insists that it would never court-martial a Christian for sharing his faith, but fails to explain why it would accept advice from someone aggressively demanding that action. The Pentagon also claims that Weinstein cannot be called a consultant because he’s not paid for his advice and holds no official position. Yet the dictionary defines a consultant as, “a person who gives professional or expert advice.” There is nothing about having an official status or getting a paycheck.

Mikey Weinstein has been meeting with top Pentagon officials during the Obama administration since 2009. He continues to communicate with them at will, and they immediately respond to his demands. He is therefore an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon, with considerable influence.

Not only that, but it’s been more than two weeks since roughly 100 congressmen demanded answers from Hagel, but have not heard a word in response. Yet this anti-Christian extremist brags about how the Pentagon leaps into action when he makes a demand, removing Christian artwork in less than an hour.

Lawmakers are likely to intensify their efforts to find out what’s going on here, and what they can do to stop this assault on Christians in the military.

The Oneida Indians%2C who have been pushing for team to drop Redskins name%2C thanked Obama at meeting

Obama was presented a jersey from a high school that changed from Redskins to Hawkeyes last year

Oneida Indian Nation representative Ray Halbritter, the public face of a campaign against the Washington pro football club's team name, thanked President Barack Obama for speaking out on the issue during a meeting at the White House Tuesday.

Halbritter's comments were met with applause from leaders of a dozen tribes who spoke with the president about a range of economic development issues important to Indian Country, from job creation to increased access to capital to jurisdictional challenges.

Obama said last month in an interview with The Associated Press that if he owned the Washington NFL team he'd think about changing the name.

""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have about these things,"" Obama said then.

Team owner Daniel Snyder has previously said he will never change the team's name. After Obama's comments, Snyder wrote a letter in which he defended the mascot as part of the team's heritage.

Halbritter, who at Tuesday's meeting sat next to the president in the Roosevelt Room, thanked Obama for lending his voice of support, which brought even more attention to the long-simmering issue of Indian team names in sports.

""It was a wonderful opportunity to express our gratitude, which is what I did,"" Halbritter told USA TODAY Sports. ""The president acknowledged it, he nodded, and applause spontaneously broke out around the table.""

Tuesday's meeting was the first of a series of events this week hosted by the White House Council on Native American Affairs to strengthen government-to-government relationships between tribal nations and the U.S. The president is scheduled to host tribal leaders from 566 federally recognized tribes today at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

Halbritter gave White House staff a jersey for the president from Cooperstown (N.Y.) High School, which last year changed its name from Redskins to Hawkeyes. The Oneida Nation gave the school district $10,000 toward the purchase of new uniforms.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/28/california-tax-exempt-boy-scouts/,2013-08-28 00:00:00,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],"California pols could target tax status of Boy Scouts, youth groups over 'discrimination'","California lawmakers are cruising toward a final vote on a bill that could threaten the tax-exempt status of American-as-apple-pie groups — ranging from the Boy Scouts to Little League — if their membership policies are found to be discriminatory.

If passed, the bill, SB 323, would remove an exemption from state taxes for any nonprofit youth group that discriminates on the basis of “gender identity, race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or religious affiliation.” Well-known organizations like Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, and Little League International Baseball and Softball were cited in the bill, which was introduced in February by Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara.

Lawmakers are not accusing groups like Little League and the Girl Scouts of having discriminatory policies. The bill appears to be aimed more at the Boy Scouts, as Lara pushed the legislation on the heels of the controversy surrounding the Boy Scouts' policy to exclude gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people as scouts or adult leaders. The national organization later voted to allow gay youth membership, but maintained its ban on openly gay adult leaders.

Lara told reporters earlier this month that the Boy Scouts' decision was not good enough for him, and continued to push the bill.

Youth groups say they hope they won't be affected. Brian McClintock, a Little League International spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the group already does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, marital status, gender, sexual orientation or disability.

“In order to be an officially chartered Little League, any local organization must adhere to this policy for all players and volunteers,” McClintock wrote in an email.

Joshua Ackley, a Girl Scouts spokesman, echoed McClintock, saying the group values “diversity and inclusiveness” among its 3.2 million youth and adult members.

“While Girl Scouts of the USA does not comment on legislation, we value diversity and inclusiveness, and our membership is representative of our diverse communities,” Ackley wrote. “Girl Scout membership does not discriminate on any basis, including race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity.”

The bill cites more than 20 groups, including the Boy Scouts of America and Little League International Baseball and Softball, as examples of organizations that could be affected by the legislation if passed.

Lara could not be reached for comment early Wednesday.

“Our state values the important role that youth groups play in the empowerment of our next generation; this is demonstrated by rewarding organizations with tax exemptions supported financially by all Californians,” Lara said in a February statement. “SB 323 seeks to end the unfortunate discriminatory and outdated practices by certain youth groups by revoking their tax exemption privilege should they not comply with non-discrimination laws.”

The bill, which passed both the Assembly Tax and Revenue and Judiciary committees earlier this month, could see a final vote as early as this week. In June, the bill received a two-thirds vote in the Senate, the first time an LGBT-themed bill reached such a threshold in the state’s history, according to Equality California.

“California does not tolerate discrimination and we certainly shouldn’t pay for it,” Equality California Executive Director John O’Connor said in a statement. “Organizations that discriminate against a young person or leader because of who they are or who they love should be sent a clear message – discrimination has a real cost!”

Deron Smith, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America, declined to specifically address the legislation in a statement to FoxNews.com.

""The focus of our 23 local Boy Scouts councils across the state of California is to deliver the Scouting program to more than 180,000 youth, many of whom are disadvantaged and at risk,"" the statement read. ""Scouting gives young people the opportunity to develop skills and take responsibility while inspiring a lifetime of character and service."""

[twitter-follow screen_name='EricCNNBelief']

(CNN) –The Obama administration will not label Westboro Baptist Church a hate group, saying it's not the government's practice to apply the designation.

More than 367,000 petitioners had called on the White House to ""Legally recognize Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group."" For months the Westboro petition was the top petition on the White House's ""We The People"" website.

Four related petitions, including one calling for the Internal Revenue Service to revoke Westboro's tax exemption, also garnered more than 300,000 signatures.

A White House official, speaking on background, told CNN that petitions that cross the threshold of 100,000 signatures are reviewed by policy staff and receive a response.

On Tuesday, the White House posted its response to the Westboro petitions.

Officially, the response to the requested hate group designation was ""no comment.""

""As a matter of practice, the federal government doesn't maintain a list of hate groups,"" the White House said.

Instead, labeling hate groups is the job of private groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, the White House said.

But the administration did comment on other aspects of the petitions, agreeing that protesting at military funerals - one of Westboro's favorite practices - is ""reprehensible."" An animated map posted online shows what the White House says is opposition to the church spreading across the country.

""We agree that practices such as protesting at the funerals of men and women who died in service to this country and preventing their families from mourning peacefully are reprehensible - a point that President Obama has made for years,"" the White House said.

In response to Westboro, Congress and Obama enacted a law in 2012 restricting protesters' time at, and proximity to, military funerals. The law followed a 2011 Supreme Court decision upholding Westboro's free speech rights to protest at funerals.

Led by its pastor, Fred Phelps, Westboro says soldiers' deaths are part of God's punishment on the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality.""

Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags.""

Westboro Baptist Church is not affiliated with a broader Baptist denomination. The autonomous church has 50 members, many of whom are members of the Phelps family. The church says they have picketed more than 50,000 events.

A GIF map created by the White House highlights the ZIP codes of the people who signed the anti-Westboro petitions.

The map shows heavy concentration of signers in Kansas and Connecticut, ""two places that have unique insight into the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church,"" the White House said. The church is based in Topeka, Kansas. As for Connecticut, the Obama administration suggests the anti-Westboro animus stems from the church's threats to protest the funerals of students killed in December's Sandy Hook School shooting.

Westboro responded to the petition on social media.

""About to swoon with glee! @ whitehouse @ barackobama telling the world about @ WBCSays preachments!"" they wrote, adding a picture of the president with horns and the title ""AntiChrist Obama.""

On Wednesday, the Court heard arguments in Town of Greece v. Galloway, which Breitbart News explained in detail yesterday. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not allow government to establish a national religion, and the plaintiffs in this case argued that allowing opening prayers does just that.

As Breitbart News explained in our previous report, the Supreme Court upheld this practice–called legislative prayer–in the 1983 case Marsh v. Chambers. Today, the plaintiffs sought to have the Court say that Marsh only permits prayers that have no faith-specific content (such as mentioning the name of Jesus Christ), or that only Congress and state legislatures are permitted to have such prayers, not local government.

The plaintiffs here evidently knew they did not have five votes on the Court to overrule Marsh, so they sought instead for the Court to rule that all governmental bodies need to adopt a policy forbidding prayer-givers from making faith-specific references.

Justice Antonin Scalia spent considerable time discussing the problem with that argument that there are no statements with which all people agree because some are atheists. Justice Samuel Alito proved this point even among those who believe something, by challenging the plaintiffs’ lawyers to specify some prayer with which followers of every religion would agree. Their lawyer could not find one.

The critical swing vote in this case is Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has previously spoken favorably of public prayers but was the decisive vote in 1992 in declaring prayers unconstitutional at public school graduation ceremonies when children are likely present.

Justice Kennedy possibly tipped his hand today when he said the plaintiffs’ proposed rule “involves the state very heavily in the editing and censorship of prayer.” As a rule of thumb, when Justice Kennedy says that your proposal involves “censorship,” that means you lost.

Breitbart News will publish a full report on the argument later today.

Gannett Washington Bureau

Rubio initially backed bill that would give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship

Aide says senator%27s current immigration views acknowledge %22political reality%22

Shift seen as beneficial to Rubio%27s presidential aspirations

WASHINGTON — Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is backing off his push for comprehensive immigration reform, opting instead to pursue a piecemeal approach favored by House Republican leaders.

Rubio was a key player on the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that conceived, wrote and pushed a Senate bill aimed at tightening border security, revamping the nation's visa program and providing a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The bill was approved 68-32 in June, a remarkably decisive outcome in a divided Senate. It has stalled in the House, where GOP leaders oppose the citizenship provision. They would rather address immigration through a series of smaller bills, most dealing with security.

Immigration activists praised Rubio for his courage following the Senate vote. Tea party activists denounced him for backing what they call ""amnesty"" for immigrants in the country illegally and said they were rethinking their support for him if he runs for president in 2016.

Now, Rubio's immigration strategy has abruptly pivoted from a comprehensive approach to the go-slow strategy backed by the House.

In interviews with reporters this week, the son of Cuban-American immigrants said he still supports a comprehensive bill but is being ""realistic"" about what can be achieved given the House's resistance. His spokesman, Alex Conant, confirmed the new tactic.

""Sen. Rubio worked very hard on immigration reform and we successfully passed it in the Senate, but now we're dealing with the political reality of what's achievable in the House,"" he said.

Rubio ""is just trying to make progress on immigration reform, and the best way to make progress is to focus on what we agree on,"" Conant continued. ""We should not waste another opportunity to begin to improve our immigration system, which is what will happen if people stick to an all-or-nothing approach.""

That's not sitting well with immigration activists.

They view the move as a betrayal and an attempt by Rubio to revive his flagging presidential aspirations. Rubio's star has been somewhat eclipsed by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a fellow Latino tea party favorite for the White House who staunchly opposed the Senate's immigration bill.

""I've been working on this for 25 years and there's no question that the only way you fix any one part is to have a comprehensive approach that addresses all the parts,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America's Voice.

Rubio is ""tacking to the right to make himself more electable in places like New Hampshire and Iowa,"" Sharry said. ""This is about personal ambition, not a concern for proper policy.""

Tea party activists aren't impressed either.

Kathy Jones, who chairs the Lee County Patriots in Florida, said she thinks Rubio might be trying to appease the Republican base. She said it won't work.

""There are so many of us who will never cast a vote for him again,"" Jones said. ""Those of us who voted for him voted for him based on what he said he was going to do and what his beliefs were. And he stated too many times — unequivocally — (that he) will never support amnesty for illegals.""

The Senate bill Rubio championed to conservative audiences would spend more than $40 billion to build more fencing along the Southern border and add more than 20,000 border agents. It would revamp the nation's visa program and beef up workplace verification to make sure jobs are held by legal residents. It also would offer immigrants in the country illegally a 13-year citizenship process, provided certain security benchmarks are met.

Under the House approach, the only bills likely to win approval are those related to security, or pro-business measures that would expand the agricultural workforce or increase the number of high-tech visas, Sharry said.

""Many Republicans want to pass pieces of immigration reform but not deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America,"" he said. ""How can you solve the problem of immigration without dealing with a population the size of Ohio?""

Sharry calls Rubio's latest move ""flip-flopping.""

But ""flip-flopping isn't so bad if you're going in the right direction,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, who heads The Family Leader, a socially conservative organization based in Iowa, where the nation's first presidential caucus takes place.

Vander Plaats said conservative voters in Iowa don't like the Senate immigration bill but will give Rubio a full hearing if he decides to run for president.

""If he's still saying at the end of the day the plan we put forward is where I want to go, well, this isn't going to help him a lot then,"" he said. ""If he's saying, 'I've got a change of heart, we need to secure the border, we need to make sure all these things are done before we start looking into the other process' — that would probably help him.""

Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida, said Rubio seems to be practicing pragmatism.

""There's nobody that better represents the difficulties of immigration reform than Marco Rubio,"" she said. "" No matter which way you zig or zag, you're going to run into roadblocks. It all comes down to whether reformers or tea party people can be moved themselves, or are they intransigent. And he's banked on the fact that something is better than nothing."""

Read This And You'll Feel Much Better!,"What I'm about to suggest works. I know it does because I'm well beyond getting angry, dismayed, upset, troubled, or even perplexed by the rapid-fire amalgamation of what is slowly (but surely) turning into a fascistic system.

What helped me get here? Becoming aware of exactly what's happening, and who is behind it. That realization is extremely powerful! It's actually liberating.

Why? Because now that I know the nature of the challenges we are facing, instead of being distracted by decoys, lies, misinformation and smokescreens, I can focus my attention like a laser beam at the real culprits behind the horrendous crimes being committed against the citizenry.

Folks, the political system in the final analysis is a farce... No, don't worry, I'm not going to suggest that people stop exercising their right to vote and engage in the political process. We can't never give up on that front.

But it is essential that we understand at this point, given the circumstances, and again, in the final analysis, the entire system is rigged.

Here's the actual situation: For many reasons (which I'm not going to cover here), the ""system"" here in the U.S., and the U.K., and Greece, and Italy, and Spain, and other countries, has evolved into a plutocratic corporatocracy.

This has brought about a governance ethos based on the shared interests of a ruling elite composed of powerful moneyed/financial/corporatists actors and the political class here in the U.S., and in France, the U.K., Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Germany, and other countries. The latter is paid off by the former.

Everything else is pure noise, distractions, smokescreens, kabuki theater.

Here's the problem: If you think that the Democrats are the good guys and the Republicans are the bad guys, and you base your world view on that premise, then you're going to have the tendency to judge most issues using a partisan or tribal prism with a totally distorted understanding of the actual situation at hand.

Psychologically, that is very harmful because the things that are actually happening are totally incongruous with your flawed understanding of the supposed reasons.

The Democratic party establishment is under the total control of the same forces that are in control of the Republican party establishment.

They are both fucking you over, and are answering to the same masters. There is a difference, of course. You can think of it as a good-cop-bad-cop situation, but both having the same objectives: to serve their corporate paymasters.

The Republican party is like the loud-mouthed thug, overtly fascistic, content with putting a jackboot on your face, pressing it hard. The Democratic party is more subtle, pretending to be your friend, greets you nicely, hugs you, back-slaps you, but when you turn around, it tells the same thugs to work you over, throw you inside the trunk of a car, drive you to a cliff, and push you over it.

They are both working for the same people: and it ain't you.

Why is having this understanding healthy? It's not because now all of the sudden I, or anybody else, can take on the corrupt system. It is because now I have a clear understanding of why the outrageous things I see happening (as we move further and further into fascism) are taking place.

The necessary condition for fixing this situation would be the acknowledgement of this truism (I'm describing here) by millions and millions of people, here in the U.S., and in the U.K., and France, and Spain, and Italy, and other countries under the control of the same nefarious forces.

And thus, at least to me, that's where I spend most of my activist energy on: trying to wake people up to this reality.

Will I (and countless others trying to do the same thing) be successful at it? Nobody can say for sure, but in my heart of hearts I believe it is possible; otherwise I would not waste my time in the effort.

Again, and regardless of how long of a process is going to be before enough people wake up to this simple reality, knowing the true nature of what's going on is indeed therapeutic. And that's why I don't get angry anymore by the dastardly things I see happening, from our institutions. What else would one expect from a government on the take. It's only natural; normal. The system is rigged, and corrupt.

Finally, no amount of petition drives or complaining will ever make any difference. The corrupt ruling class will only relent if they are forced to do so, with overwhelming power from the people.

But one thing at a time... First, we need to wake TFU. The rest will manifest itself.

Let's get to it!"

And you're going, ""No, no, Katt Williams lives next door!""

Now, last month, while no one was taking anyone's guns from anybody, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to reauthorize a program where they can collect data on any American citizen and hold onto it forever. They can look at your e-mails, your texts, your Skypes, and not a peep out the crowd that's always bitching about what the framers intended. In fact, the answer from almost everyone seems to be, ""Oh what the hell, the airport screeners have already seen my ass anyway.""

The Facebook generation, especially, doesn't seem to care that Big Brother knows everything about you — what books you read, what movies you watch, your Match.com account, your other Match.com account when you're feeling a little freaky and wanna meet the sort of woman your regular Match.com account wouldn't approve of.

Call me old school, but I don't want the feds Googling what I'm Googling. It's bad enough when Netflix pries into my private life. ""You watched The Walking Dead and Zombieland. You might also like this interview with John McCain.""

I don't want the government doing that! ""You downloaded this article favoring the legalization of marijuana. You might also like being incarcerated.""

You know, they always say these programs are just to catch terrorists. The next thing you know, they're using them to shut down the pot dispensaries. And that place was right on my way home! Now I gotta go to Valley Village!

Doesn't anyone care that this is the new normal? I guess not, because gun nuts don't care, and neither do liberals. When Bush did warrantless wiretapping, oh, he was wiping his ass with the Constitution. But when Obama does it, oh well, whatever helps Jessica Chastain find bin Laden, we're good with that.

(smattering of audience applause)

Yeah, both parties compete mightily to appear to be the greater champion of our freedoms, but the only thing that still has bipartisan support in Washington is not giving a shit about privacy.

And when you talk to the NRA types, as I like to do down at my local moose lodge, they actually believe that what protects their rights isn't laws, or courts, it's that they have a gun. They think that's what keeps the government from going too far. Without guns, Obama would become an emperor and force everyone to gay marry, but he can't because a guy in Kentucky named Skeeter has a .22.

(audience applause)

Except that, you know, while you guys were buying guns to protect your other guns, sittin' up on the porch there, waitin' for Obama's Negro Army to come confiscate your weapons and go all Django Unchained on your ass — that's when we lost all the stuff in the Bill of Rights, about trials and juries and warrants.

You see, the Redcoats — they never wanted your gun. They wanted your liberty. And that's why the Founding Fathers said you could have the gun, dumbass! And now the only right we have left is the guns, and left nothing left to use the guns to protect! We're like a strip club with a million bouncers and no strippers!"

Their court is guilty of judicial activism.

“If it’s measured in terms of readiness to overturn legislation, this is one of the most activist courts in history,” Justice Ginsburg said in August in an interview with The New York Times. “This court has overturned more legislation, I think, than any other.”

But Justice Ginsburg overstated her case. If judicial activism is defined as the tendency to strike down laws, the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is less activist than any court in the last 60 years.

Nonetheless, Justice Ginsburg’s impression fits with a popular perception of the court. In 2010 in Citizens United, it struck down part of a federal law regulating campaign spending by corporations and unions, overruling two precedents in the bargain. In June, it struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act."

That’s a good thing.","Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and lead counsel in the “Sister Wives” polygamy case.

The decision this month by a federal court striking down the criminalization of polygamy in Utah was met with a mix of rejoicing and rage. What was an emancipating decision for thousands of plural families was denounced as the final descent into a moral abyss by others.

Former senator Rick Santorum was among the social conservatives trying to claim the moral high ground. He tweeted on Sunday: “Some times I hate it when what I predict comes true” — referring to his 2003 claim that legalizing “consensual sex within your home” would lead to the legalization of polygamy and “undermine the fabric of our society.” (On Wednesday, with no apparent sense of self-contradiction, he expressed outrage over the removal of a Nativity scene at a South Carolina military base, tweeting: “Our Constitution protects free exercise of religion. No govt entity/official has the right to limit that.”)

It’s true that the Utah ruling is one of the latest examples of a national trend away from laws that impose a moral code. There is a difference, however, between the demise of morality laws and the demise of morality. This distinction appears to escape social conservatives nostalgic for a time when the government dictated whom you could live with or sleep with. But the rejection of moral codes is no more a rejection of morality than the rejection of speech codes is a rejection of free speech. Our morality laws are falling, and we are a better nation for it.

In the Utah case, I was the lead counsel for the Browns, the polygamous family featured in the TLC reality program “Sister Wives.” They are members of the Apostolic United Brethren Church, and they have one marriage license and three “spiritual” marriages among them. After the first episode of “Sister Wives” aired, state prosecutors threatened to bring charges under a Utah law that made it a crime when a married person “purports to marry another person or cohabits with another person.” The Browns were under investigation for two years and were publicly called felons before they took prosecutors to court in a challenge to the constitutionality of the law.

The case was never about the recognition of multiple marriages or the acceptance of the religious values underlying this plural family. It was about the right of consenting adults to make decisions for themselves and their families. Judge Clark Waddoups, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, ruled that the criminalization of cohabitation clearly violated the due process clause and the free exercise clause of the United States Constitution.

In doing so, he departed from the prevailing precedent: the Supreme Court’s opinion in Reynolds v. United States , which upheld a ban on polygamy in 1879. Waddoups wrote that courts today are “less inclined to allow majoritarian coercion of unpopular or disliked minority groups, especially when blatant racism . . . religious prejudice, or some other constitutionally suspect motivation, can be discovered behind such legislation.”

Indeed, in Reynolds, religious and racial prejudice were vividly on display. The court unleashed a tirade of indignation and condemnation, stating, “Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people.” Just a few years later, the Supreme Court also upheld the criminalization of mixed-race relations in Pace v. Alabama .

The idea that polygamy was a “barbarous practice” and contrary to democratic principles drove the demand in the late 1880s and ’90s that Utah outlaw it as a condition of statehood. And in Mormon Church v. United States (1890), the Supreme Court labeled polygamy as “abhorrent to the sentiments and feelings of the civilized world.”

The stigma attached to polygamy continued to distort legal analysis into this century. As recently as 2006, Utah Justice Ronald Nehring began his opinion in a ruling upholding the criminalization of polygamy by lamenting, “No matter how widely known the natural wonders of Utah may become, no matter the extent that our citizens earn acclaim for their achievements, in the public mind Utah will forever be shackled to the practice of polygamy.” Nehring frankly admitted that this hostility “has been present in my consciousness, and I suspect has been a brooding presence . . . in the minds of my colleagues, from the moment we opened the parties’ briefs.” Rather than overcome that prejudice, Nehring not only yielded to it but warned any Utah judge of the peril of being the first to recognize the rights of polygamists: “I have not been alone in speculating what the consequences might be were the highest court in the State of Utah the first in the nation to proclaim that polygamy enjoys constitutional protection.”

Well, it wasn’t. A federal judge in Utah assumed that burden. Gov. Gary Herbert objected to the court making “decisions on social issues.” (He has not yet announced an appeal.) Waddoups, however, was not dictating a decision on a social issue but rather saying that governments could not impose a single version of morality. He limited prosecution under Utah’s anti-polygamy law to cases of bigamy, where someone acquires more than one marriage license — which is an offense more common to monogamous couples, who care about state recognition, than polygamists, who care about spiritual recognition.

Across the country, the era of morality codes is coming to an inglorious end. This year, the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act barring the federal recognition of same-sex marriage. And this week, the New Mexico Supreme Court and another federal judge in Utah struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in those states — bringing the number to 18 states (plus the District of Columbia) where same-sex couples can marry. Meanwhile, Virginia recently repealed its 1877 cohabitation law and Colorado replealed a criminal adultery law from the 1850s — both relics of a time when states used their criminal codes to force citizens to comply with the religious values of their neighbors.

Most states have wisely turned away from absurd laws criminalizing masturbation and fornication. Obscenity laws have also been curtailed by the Supreme Court in deference to the First Amendment.

Still rightly on the books are laws against bestiality, which involves an obvious lack of consent as well as manifest harm. Likewise, incest bans are based on claims of medical, not moral, harm.

Once any crimes or abuses are stripped away in cases like the Browns’, what remains is religious animus. Yet, polygamy is widely practiced around the world by millions of families and was condoned by every major religion — from Judaism to Christianity to Islam — at one time. While plural families are called polygamists in our popular lexicon, “polygamy” actually refers to a broad array of plural relationships, from polygyny (one husband and multiple wives, like the Browns) to polyandry (a single wife and multiple husbands) to polyamory (couples who reject the exclusivity of sexual relations). The vast majority of these families are based on consenting relations among adults without abusive or criminal histories.

Critics often ignore these other plural relationships (and even polygynists like the Browns) in favor of a stereotype of “compound polygamists,” living in remote walled communities where women appear captive and molestation flourishes. It is Warren Jeffs, not Kody Brown, whom critics want to invoke in debating decriminalization — a sinister figure in a secluded compound where women wear prairie outfits and hairdos from the 19th century.

Obviously, there will always be abusers like Jeffs among polygamists — just as there are abusers among monogamists. However, it is no more persuasive to criminalize all plural relationships because of a small number of abusive individuals than it would be logical to outlaw monogamy based on the convicted spouse- and child-abusers in conventional marriages.

One of the great ironies about the focus on compound polygamists is the circular logic of criminalization. The government first declared polygamists felons and then pointed to their hiding as evidence of their guilt. But decriminalization will allow these families to be plural, open and law-abiding as they reintegrate into society.

In truth, 19th-century Americans were no more moral than we are today. It simply appeared that way with the imposition of official morals, including (as Santorum recalls so fondly) being told whom we could love in our own homes. It is not a single moral voice that is heard today but a chorus of voices. Each speaks to its own values but joins around a common article of faith: the belief that morality is better left to parents than to politicians.

When it was announced four days later after a long holiday weekend, the gay legal establishment responded with open dismay, fearing the risk from a case that could lead to an unfavorable ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court.

With the Supreme Court poised to render a ruling this week that is widely expected to strike a blow against Proposition 8 and perhaps overturn it outright, Chad Griffin, the onetime Los Angeles political consultant and public relations man who dared to bring the lawsuit, has become a major player in Washington, regarded with grudging respect by his former adversaries and hailed as a visionary by his friends.

“No matter what happens in the decision, Chad will be known as a historic figure in the fight for equality because he pushed the envelope,” said Dan Pfeiffer, senior advisor to President Obama and a former Georgetown University roommate of Griffin’s.

“The legal and political people thought Chad was moving too fast, but actually he saw where the country was going and what was possible before anyone else.”

With same-sex marriage legal in 12 states and public opinion solidly in favor, it is easy to forget the pessimism that prevailed among many supporters after Proposition 8 passed in California in November 2008.

At the time the suit was filed, three states allowed same-sex marriage; 44 banned it. Public opinion was hard against it. Influential religious groups, including the Mormon and Roman Catholic churches, had helped lead the opposition. Even President Obama was not in favor.

Prominent people from gay legal groups called Griffin’s suit “risky and premature,” “an attempt to short-circuit the process,” and an effort that would “likely set us all back.”

“There were a number of legal advocates who thought it was too soon to go to the Supreme Court,” said Jon Davidson, legal director at Lambda Legal, the largest gay legal group, which opposed filing the suit. “Most people watching the court thought it was going to be an uphill battle to strike down marriage laws of more than 30 states.”

Griffin was hardly a figure to inspire confidence in the halls of justice. Then 35, he had not worked primarily on gay issues. He had come out as a gay man only eight years earlier. He was not a lawyer, but a consultant in his own firm who specialized in high-profile Hollywood clients. He was an unknown to much of the gay and civil liberties legal establishment.

But Griffin had learned his way around political campaigns at the highest levels. Born in Hope, Ark., the hometown of Bill Clinton, he was barely old enough to vote when he walked into Clinton’s 1992 campaign headquarters in Little Rock and volunteered in the press office.

“He was the kind of intern who would not only do what you asked, he would do something else,” recalled Dee Dee Myers, who became Clinton’s White House press secretary. “As sometimes happens in campaigns, we piled more and more responsibility on him.”

When Clinton moved to the White House, Myers took Griffin with her, with the understanding that in a couple of years he would quit and start college. The 19-year-old became what officials referred to as the youngest presidential aide in history.

At the White House he met Rob Reiner, and after Georgetown, Reiner brought Griffin to Los Angeles to run his charitable foundation and manage a series of political campaigns, including successful ballot initiatives for children’s healthcare and stem cell research. He bought a house in Los Feliz. He was brought in at the last minute to help oppose Proposition 8, but it was too late.

The idea to file the lawsuit was the product of an accidental meeting at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Griffin was having lunch with Reiner, Reiner’s wife and Griffin’s business partner when a former journalist and friend of the Reiners’, Kate Moulene, stopped by and suggested they hire her former brother-in-law, Theodore Olson, to challenge Proposition 8 in court.

Hiring Olson seemed like a radical idea. He had been President George W. Bush’s solicitor general and had represented President Reagan both in the Justice Department and personally. He was a committed member of the conservative movement involved in the legal effort to impeach Clinton. He had argued and won Bush vs. Gore, which resolved the 2000 election, in the Supreme Court.

But as Moulene knew, Olson was committed to individual liberties. From a public relations standpoint, his involvement would be a coup. From a legal standpoint, few people had argued more cases at the high court.

In the months after filing the suit, Griffin was under what one colleague called “a white-hot spotlight.” Some liberals mistrusted Olson’s motives. Not trusting Olson and Griffin to handle the suit by themselves, three groups attempted to intervene, which would have given them a measure of control.

Griffin was outraged. He wrote a letter denouncing the would-be interveners, accusing them of trying to undermine the case, and released it publicly. They expressed shock.

Griffin defended his decision and the letter with an eye to history.

“If you just look through the history of time, there’s always reason to wait,” he said in his Washington office.

“There’s always someone who wants to slow down. At the same time there are real live people who provide that sense of urgency about why we can’t wait. And we had the best lawyers, the right strategy and the right plaintiffs.”

Part of that strategy was to combine Olson with his Democratic opponent in Bush vs. Gore, David Boies. That combination attracted major donors to support the lawsuit.

“Chad had essentially found a way to take two of the most powerful legal minds in the country — who had often been at odds — together, and that was such a seismically different way of approaching this issue,” said producer and director J.J. Abrams, one of the key backers of the lawsuit. “I just thought it spoke to his boldness and his willingness to think out of the box to get what needs to be done done.”

Griffin’s office finishes the story. The renegade who challenged the gay legal establishment is now at its apex. A year ago he was named president of the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign, which calls itself the world’s largest gay rights advocacy group.

The formerly secret surveillance programs help prevent terror, he says

But critics say U.S. programs go too far and should be rolled back

Details on millions of American phone calls. Records of e-mails, texts, video chats and more from overseas. And pulsing beneath it all, a worrying concern there's more to the government's surveillance programs than what's been acknowledged.

All the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs in recent days have put the government on the defensive, set privacy advocates howling for reform and left millions of Americans somewhere in the middle, wondering what the news means to them and what, if anything, they should do about it.

The man at the top says they should just relax.

""Nobody is listening to your telephone calls,"" President Barack Obama said Friday as he tried to reassure Americans who have had to digest a dizzying array of revelations in the past few days. Among them:

-- U.S. intelligence agencies are, in fact, collecting details on just about every telephone call placed each day in the United States, U.S. officials confirmed. And they've been doing it for seven years, a senator added.

-- They're also monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and other providers of popular online services.

-- And they may be scooping up credit card data, as well, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the operations of the National Security Agency.

U.S. officials say the phone-call data isn't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror, and only then on the authority of a judge. And officials say analysts are forbidden from slurping up the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas.

The Wall Street Journal said it wasn't clear whether the credit card monitoring was a continuing program or a one-off, and didn't say what analysts did with the information.

Analysts say such information can be analyzed using powerful computers and sophisticated software to detect personal habits and links among groups of people, and to build detailed dossiers on the activities of everyday people.

The government says it is not doing that, but privacy activists say even the limited amount of data collection U.S. officials have acknowledged poses huge threats.

""The problem is its massive surveillance,"" said author James Bamford, who has written extensively about NSA surveillance programs. ""We went through this problem with the Bush administration, warrantless eavesdropping. It was an outrage that government can turn the surveillance on average citizens without any suspicion whatsoever.""

""And here, this is an enormous increase in that,"" he said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday. ""This is communications that are local. These aren't even international communications at all. These are communications from people speaking to their neighbors, people that are under no suspicion whatsoever.""

The American Civil Liberties Union described the programs as ""beyond Orwellian.""

And the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been fighting the government over surveillance programs for years, is urging a full-scale investigation with an eye toward stopping the surveillance programs for good and reining in U.S. intelligence agencies with new laws and a demand for public oversight.

""The revelations not only confirmed what EFF has long alleged, they went even further and honestly, we're still reeling,"" the privacy organization said Friday on its blog.

Telephone monitoring

The revelations began Wednesday, when a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other analysts said similar orders undoubtedly are in effect for other companies.

The order doesn't allow authorities to listen in on the calls.

National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who denied during a March 12 congressional hearing that the government was engaged in mass data-collection practices involving Americans, blasted the Guardian report, saying it ""omits key information"" regarding ""safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties.""

He said the program operates within the law, respects Americans' privacy and is crucial to preventing attacks. Most of the records are never looked at, and those that are can be reviewed only with judicial approval, he said.

""The collection is broad in scope because more narrow collection would limit our ability to screen for and identify terrorism-related communications. Acquiring this information allows us to make connections related to terrorist activities over time,"" he said.

Clapper said both Congress and courts have reviewed and authorized the law.

But several congressional critics have complained that the government has made significant use of broad interpretations made in secret by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the judicial body charged with overseeing the government's use of the law.

""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Patriot Act co-author Rep. James Sensenbrenner wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, said he was ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.""

Online monitoring

A day after the initial Guardian report on the Verizon court order, the Guardian and the Washington Post published reports alleging the NSA is able to tap into data held by some of the world's biggest online services companies as it hunts for terrorists.

The program, which the newspapers said is called PRISM, reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft, Google and other companies to extract details of customer activities, including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials, The Post reported.

The Post reported PRISM, founded in 2007, has become the leading source of raw material for the NSA.

Clapper did not directly confirm the program's existence but acknowledged that the Post and Guardian stories ""refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.""

That section of the law authorizes intelligence agencies to collect information on non-U.S. residents as part of efforts to gather foreign intelligence.

He said the program cannot be used to target anyone inside the United States or U.S. citizens anywhere in the world and includes ""extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.""

""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,"" Clapper said Thursday.

""The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans,"" he said.

While the Post initially reported that the companies ""knowingly participate"" in the program, it later updated the online version of its story to remove that contention.

In its stead, the newspaper described a classified report indicating that NSA analysts were allowed to send ""content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations.""

AT&T, Verizon and Comcast declined to comment on the report Friday. Time Warner said it was unfamiliar with PRISM.

Microsoft said Thursday that it doesn't participate in any national security data gathering program. Facebook and Google said they do not give government agencies direct access to their servers.

And Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said his company has never heard of the program.

Necessary measures

While controversial to some, the programs also have plenty of backers. Obama noted that Congress has repeatedly endorsed the programs on a bipartisan basis.

Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California liberal, both believe the methods are necessary to prevent terrorism.

""Terrorists will come after us if they can,"" Feinstein said, ""and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us.""

Graham said that as a Verizon customer, ""it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Agency to have my phone number.""

Previous efforts

Similar efforts have floated to the surface for years.

After the 2001 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush's administration authorized the NSA to conduct wireless surveillance of international phone calls that included at least one person believed to be an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist.

The program was later ruled unconstitutional.

Another Bush-era program, the ""total information awareness"" program, would have combined vast government databases into a data-mining effort to look for suspicious patterns revealing potential criminal or terrorist activity. It was official dropped amid intense outcry from civil libertarians.

Also, in 2003, a former AT&T technician made a splash when he alleged that the telecom was routing all Internet traffic into a special NSA-controlled room in San Francisco.

Last year, Bamford wrote in Wired magazine about a huge data center being built for the NSA in Utah. Officials have officially labeled the center as part of the nation's effort to fight cyberattacks, but the Wired article, citing former NSA officials and others, said it was part of a huge surveillance program that would take in and analyze untold amounts of data.

Obama takes heat

The reports have increased scrutiny of Obama's record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism.

Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed, ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency."" But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post on its home page conflated an image of Obama with one of his predecessor, Bush, in a move to criticize the secret surveillance both administrations have been accused of.

A New York Times editorial said ""the administration has now lost all credibility"" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.

Obama said Friday that he entered office skeptical of the programs. But after thoroughly vetting them and adding additional safeguards -- which he did not identify -- Obama said he concluded they were worthwhile.

""My assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks,"" he said. ""And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and without looking at content, that on net it was worth us doing.""

Obama said he welcomed debate on the issue, but said some compromises are going to be necessary, no matter what.

""I think it is important to recognize that you can't have 100% security and then also have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" he said. ""You know, we are going to have to make some choices as a society."""

Jackson speaks with supporters at the Lynchburg Regional Airport terminal on Tuesday. Jackson was there with Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who is running for governor, and attorney general nominee Mark Obenshain. (Jill Nance/Associated Press)

As midnight approached on the eve of the Republican convention in Virginia, party loyalists were tipping beers and listening to country music at a rollicking fete hosted by Pete Snyder, a front-runner for the nomination for lieutenant governor.

Down the hall at the Marriott in Richmond, a minister also running for Virginia’s second-highest office, E.W. Jackson, was lingering at his own party, where a Bible and a cross were displayed at the entrance. The ballroom was largely empty. If the excitement at Snyder’s gathering suggested momentum, the quiet at Jackson’s spelled a looming return to obscurity.

Twenty-four hours later, after delivering a thunderous speech that seized the convention, Jackson was the Republican nominee and the party’s first black candidate for statewide office since 1988.

Jackson’s improbable rise, one that has astonished Republicans far and wide, is the latest of a number of incarnations, including foster child, Marine, Harvard law school graduate and even Democrat. But the minister who is now GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli II’s running mate has long used his booming voice to endear himself to conservatives.

Still, Jackson’s words — sometimes eloquent, sometimes raw, often impassioned — are causing anxiety for many Republicans as the resurfacing of his past statements about homosexuality and abortion have threatened to disrupt the campaign.

Instead of promoting their new ticket, Republicans have answered for Jackson’s once calling gays “perverted” and “sick” and saying Planned Parenthood has been “far more lethal” to blacks “than the KKK.”

“The Republicans I’m talking to are saying, ‘What the hell are they doing in Virginia?’ ” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “Is this, ‘101 ways to lose an election’? You’re coming out of the gate with comments everyone has to explain. You’re wasting a lot of time and energy batting that back when you should be doing other things to get the guy known.”

Although unknown to many Republicans, Jackson in recent years has built a following among the most activist of Virginia’s conservatives, many of whom were delegates at the convention. But Republicans are now concerned, Steele said, that Jackson will turn off the party’s own voters. “You can’t have a situation where Republicans say, ‘You know what? I can’t have this’ and they stay home or vote for the other guy,” he said.

Raynard Jackson, a Republican political consultant who has known Jackson since the 1990s, said the minister’s voice has long been his most potent tool. That was the case at the convention Saturday, when thousands of delegates roared when he shouted: “Get the government off our backs! Off our property! Off our guns!”

But Raynard Jackson also said the minister has to be “more careful in the articulation” of his message. “The message will resonate if he can control his verbiage,” Raynard Jackson said. “The question is: Will he control his verbiage? He has the ability. But will he?”

Over the years, Jackson, 61, has thrust himself into the most divisive of issues, beginning in Boston, where he was a pastor and radio host during the 1980s and ’90s, and later, in Virginia, where he moved in 1998 because “we thought our values would be mainstream.” During the mid-1990s, Ralph Reed’s Christian Coalition hired him as a liaison to minority communities.

All these years later, Jackson seems uninterested in moderating himself. He paused between whirlwind campaign stops this week to tell reporters that he doesn’t have “anything to rephrase or apologize for.”

“I say the things I say because I’m a Christian, not because I hate anybody, but because I have religious values that matter to me,” he said. “Attacking me because I hold to those principles is attacking every churchgoing person, every family that’s living a traditional family life, everybody who believes that we all deserve the right to live.”

Married for more than 40 years, Jackson and his wife, Theodora, an elementary school teacher, have raised three children. In a 2011 federal financial disclosure statement, the minister, who travels in a gold Cadillac, reported an income of about $40,000, including $15,772 from his church. He listed “no reportable asset worth more than $1,000.”

On the campaign trail, the minister has captivated audiences with colorful stories of growing up as a “juvenile delinquent” in Chester, Pa., where he was born Earl Walker Jackson to parents who were splitting up. After he spent years with a foster family, Jackson has recalled, his father, a welder, took custody of him and pulled him away from street life.

“He took me out of that foster home. He sat me down the following day,” Jackson told an audience at a recent candidates’ forum. “He said, ‘Look, every day with me can be a day of heaven on earth. Or every day, I will tear your behind all to pieces. It depends on what you want.’ ”

After a tour with the Marines, Jackson graduated with honors in 1975 from the University of Massachusetts, where he majored in philosophy. Then he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1978. He spent more than 20 years in Boston, practicing law, pastoring at New Cornerstone Exodus Church, serving as a chaplain to the Boston Fire Department, and hosting radio shows, including one called “Earl Jackson Across America.”

At one point, he was a Democrat, and he was elected to the party’s Massachusetts State Committee, where he distinguished himself with his conservative views. “I thought, ‘Wow, here’s a great potential leader,’ ” said James Roosevelt, who is a grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt and who was then and is now legal counsel to the state Democratic organization. “Then I learned of his views, and I thought: ‘What’s he doing? This is not a leader of the Democratic Party.’ ”

Jackson became a Republican in the early 1980s, explaining that Democrats’ embrace of the gay rights movement violated his religious beliefs. In 1989, he joined the opposition to a proposal to ban discrimination against gays and lesbians in Massachusetts. “We intend to blow this bill to smithereens,” he told reporters then. “We intend to defeat this legislation and bury it so deep no one will ever find it again.”

On his radio show, he liked to introduce himself as “the personification of the American Dream and liberals’ worst nightmare.” He told listeners that he was broadcasting from the “eye of Hurricane Kennedy . . . the land of the freebie and the home of the gays.”

Jackson’s views on gays prompted David Scondras, then a Boston City Council member, to oppose a resolution a colleague proposed to honor Jackson, then the Fire Department’s chaplain. “It was bad enough to have someone ranting against gay people, but it struck me as too much to have them being paid by the city,” Scondras said.

Jackson voiced opinions on other sensitive issues. He advocated the release of all juvenile offenders’ records and sympathized with white South Boston residents who opposed the integration of public housing. “I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either,” he told a church filled with cheering white residents.

About that time, Jackson appears to have suffered financial strains, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993, according to court records. In 1995, court records show, he incurred a federal tax lien for $8,539, which was lifted nine years later.

But Jackson’s life as a conservative activist flourished. The Christian Coalition assigned him to help raise money on behalf of churches torched in arson fires in the South, a role that led to his testifying before Congress. The coalition also tapped Jackson to lead its Samaritan Project, an effort to forge relationships between the organization and black communities. In that role, Jackson hosted a conference of pastors in Baltimore in 1997.

“He did a good job for us,” Reed, the organization’s leader at the time, said in a recent interview. “He had credibility and spoke the language of those conservative African Americans.”

Soon, however, Reed left the Christian Coalition, and the organization became less influential. By the end of 1997, the coalition cut off funding to Jackson’s project.

The next year, Jackson and his wife moved to Chesapeake, where he began identifying himself by the title of bishop. By his own telling, he was returning to his “ancestral home.” His great-grandparents had been slaves in Orange County, and his grandfather had lived in Richmond before migrating to Pennsylvania.

In 1998, the Jacksons paid $242,000 for a house in a Chesapeake subdivision of brick and gabled facades. Leigh Cole, their next-door neighbor for the past seven years, described the couple as pleasant, and she said her daughter once tried to sell Girl Scout cookies to Jackson. The minister declined, she said, explaining that he was watching his weight. But he still made a donation.

In Chesapeake, Jackson founded Exodus Faith Ministries, a nondenominational Christian church, which has had at least three headquarters, including a storefront in a strip mall. At one point, the church became embroiled in a dispute with its landlord and was accused of owing more than $6,000 in rent, according to court records. Jackson has since settled the debt. Today, he holds services in a hotel conference room with a seating capacity of 125.

Although a clear picture of his 15 years in Virginia is still emerging, Jackson appears to have maintained a relatively low profile in Chesapeake, at least for his first decade there. In 2000, he started an annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast and impressed guests with his oratorical skills.

William E. “Bill” Ward, Chesapeake’s first black mayor, has attended the breakfasts, and he said Jackson seemed like a “race man, committed to the struggle of African Americans.” Later, Ward said, Jackson’s conservatism became more apparent.

“He began to, I guess, espouse more of the conservative GOP line of thinking,” Ward said. “He seemed . . . not to attack local leaders, but he shied away from the traditional black ministerial groups. He never became very active with them.”

Helena Dobson, president of Chesapeake’s local NAACP chapter, said she has no relationship with Jackson.

In 2008, as Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency, the minister became more politically active, publicly chastising the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama’s former minister who had made racially divisive statements. Over the next couple of years, Jackson distributed news releases with such headlines as “Liberals are the True Racists.” He started a Twitter account, writing at one point: “I love America. I love God. I am black. Obama does not love America & does not love God. His being black is not enough!”

In 2010, a Virginia tea party convention in Richmond invited Jackson to join a roster of speakers that included political consultant Dick Morris and the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

The next year, Jackson ran for the U.S. Senate, raising $135,000, all of which he spent. He finished last in a field of four candidates seeking the Republican nomination, receiving less than 5 percent of the vote.

He then began to campaign for lieutenant governor, raising $140,000, more than a third of which came from Peter Via, a Roanoke financier. When asked about his contributions, Via, reached by phone Thursday, told a reporter, “I have nothing to say” and hung up.

After winning the nomination last weekend, Jackson joined Cuccinelli and state Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (Harrisonburg), the GOP’s nominee for attorney general, on a three-day tour of the state. The frenetic pace seemed to catch up with Jackson, who was coughing and asking for water Tuesday as he stood under a sweltering sun in Winchester.

The small crowd lavished cheers on him, a greeting that dwarfed the reception given to Cuccinelli and Obenshain. “Now, this is a learning curve for me,” Jackson acknowledged.

The next afternoon, five days after vaulting to the center of Virginia’s political stage, he returned home. Answering the door bell late in the afternoon, Jackson told a reporter he was not answering any questions.

Now that the Supreme Court has struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, some of these issues will be wiped away. The ruling makes clear that married gay couples living in states that recognize their unions will immediately gain access to more than 1,000 federal benefits, like Social Security and family leave rights. Less certain is how couples living in the remaining 37 states will fare.

The murkiness exists because federal agencies generally defer to the states to determine a couple’s marital status. Some agencies look to the laws in the state in which a couple now live, for instance, while others look to those in the state in which the couple were married.

“Unless the administration changes its practices and rules — and in a couple of cases, unless the law changes — then couples residing in a nonmarriage-equality state may not be recognized for some federal programs,” said Brian Moulton, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign. “Now that we have an opinion out, we will be anxiously awaiting what the administration will say about this and urging them to ensure that all married couples, regardless of where they live, are fully recognized.”"

At least one chaplain was told that if he engaged in any ministry activity, he would be subjected to disciplinary action.

“In very practical terms it means Sunday Mass won’t be offered,” Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services told me. “If someone has a baptism scheduled, it won’t be celebrated.”

The Archdiocese for the Military Services tells me the military installations impacted are served by non-active-duty priests who were hired as government contractors. As a result of a shortage of active duty Catholic chaplains, the government hires contract priests.

[pullquote]

Broglio said some military bases have forbidden the contract priests from volunteering to celebrate Mass without pay.

“They were told they cannot function because those are contracted services and since there’s no funding they can’t do it – even if they volunteer,” he said.

John Schlageter, general counsel for the archdiocese, said any furloughed priests volunteering their services could face big trouble.

“During the shutdown, it is illegal for them to minister on base and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so,” he said in a written statement.

A well-placed source told me that a furloughed Air Force chaplain was threatened after he offered to forgo pay. The chaplain was told he could not go on base or enter his chapel offices. He was also barred from engaging in any ministry activity.

The source told me the chaplain was told that if he violated those orders he and his supervisor would be subjected to disciplinary action – with the possibility of being fired.

Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, called those developments disturbing.

“Catholic military personnel should not have their religious liberties held hostage by this funding crisis,” Crews told me. “I find it alarming that these priests cannot even volunteer to provide services without threat of arrest.”

The archbishop said a priest at Joint Base Langley-Eustis was banned from officiating at the wedding of a couple he’d been counseling.

“The wedding could be on the base, but the priest can’t do the wedding,” Broglio told me.

A priest at the Naval Amphibious Base in Little Creek, Va., was told he could not celebrate Mass on base because of the government shutdown. So he discovered a way to circumvent the ban.

“He’s having Mass in a local park off base,” the archbishop said.

The archbishop said it doesn’t make any sense to forbid priests from voluntarily ministering to the troops.

“Most of us don’t look to see that we’re going to be paid before we do something,” he said. “They are not being allowed to volunteer even to meet the needs of the faithful.”

Bill Donohue, of the Catholic League, told me he’s not surprised by the decision to furlough Catholic priests.

“In American history there has been no administration more anti-Catholic than the Obama administration,” he said. “For them to deny Catholic men and women the opportunity of the sacraments and to deal with their prayerful vocations is really a stunning statement.”

Donohue chalked it up to meanness.

“This idea of punishing Catholics in the military - denying them their priests - is consistent with the animus this administration has demonstrated,” he said.

It’s not exactly clear who is the final arbiter in the furloughs – but I suspect it’s the same folks who kicked school children out of the White House and elderly veterans out of the World War II Memorial.

“It’s difficult to know who exactly is making these decisions,” the archbishop said. “I’m being told it keeps getting kicked up to a higher level.”

I called the Pentagon but no one returned my calls.

I called the Air Force public affairs office and they told me to reach out to the local bases.

Surely there must be some way to compromise, to let Catholics practice their faith.

I find it odd that the military was able to find enough cash to let their football teams play this weekend – but they can’t scrounge up enough cash for weekend church services.

“It’s a sad contrast when we can let a football game go on but we won’t let a priest go on base and celebrate Mass,” he said.

So in President Obama’s world – college football players are essential but Catholic priests are not."

(Republican attempts to lure black voters),"My latest loud guffaw came while reading ""Conservatives Try to Rewrite Civil Rights History (Again)"" which opened with:



Rand Paul’s unsuccessful speech at Howard University—where he tried, and failed, to paint the Republican Party as the true home for African American voters—didn’t happen in a vacuum. It drew from a heavily revisionist history of American politics, in which the GOP never wavered in its commitment to black rights, and the Democratic Party embraced its role as a haven for segregationists. In this telling of history, black support for Democrats is a function of liberal demagoguery and crude identity politics. If African Americans truly understood their interests, the argument goes, they’d have never left the Republican Party.

The piece went on to explore recent attempts at re-writing racist southern-strategy architect Barry Goldwater's contributions to black folks.

Write-on R's. You will write in vain.

We don't need degrees in political science, or to read right-wing bloggers to know our history. Many of us had Republican grandparents. I know I did, and wrote about it. Black folks talk about politics in barber shops, beauty parlors, sittin' on bar stools, on the bus on the way to work and around the dinner table. We don't form our opinions based on punditry. We deal with the daily reality of walking, eating, sleeping, working, driving, shopping and breathing while black.

Black people are not stupid.

The R's have convinced themselves that the last two national election cycles are some sort of aberration, that just because Democrats had some black guy at the top of the ticket black folks blissed out and will come to our senses once he is no longer the Democrats' standard bearer. They are completely ignoring the fact that black folks have been voting for white Democrats since FDR started luring us away from the R party of old a long time ago.

Sure, they can buy off a few dusky faces to spout their rhetoric. Just see how well choosing Michael Steele worked out for ya. Opportunists come in all colors. Pasting a dark visage on tainted ideology does nothing to mask the stench of rotting food for thought.

Black people are not stupid.

Nor have we been struck blind, deaf and senseless. We hear dog whistling and the dulcet tones of patronizing put-downs quite well, thank you.

We may not all be PhDs, but a degree from the university of the streets serves us well—we have learned the hard way how to survive in a hostile America. We begin learning the day we are born, drink it in with our mother's milk or formula and before we are in the second or third grade we learn daily lessons in blackness.

You have Bell-Curve'd us, and Willie Horton'ed us, and Welfare Queen'ed us, as you stand-your-ground and stop-and-frisk us.

The latest cause for R hand-wringing and lamentation and attempts at re-invention is the much touted poll on black voter turnout, surpassing whites.

Even news stories questioning the data results conclude:

Data-parsing aside, what’s clear is that in the last two presidential elections, blacks and whites turned out at roughly the same rate. Coming less than 50 years after systematic efforts to prevent blacks from voting were banned by the Voting Rights Act, that’s a historic milestone. The Supreme Court is set to rule in June on whether to strike down a key provision of the 1965 law. The news also bolsters the case that the Republican effort to make voting harder for racial minorities—including strict photo ID laws, cutbacks to early voting, and purges of voting rolls—may have backfired, by stoking outrage in the African-American community in particular. “It made the case very clear-cut to people about what was happening,” Marvin Randolph, the NAACP’s vice president for campaigns, told MSNBC.com. “We could say to people: This is a poll tax.” “Politics is a lot like physics,” Randolph added. ”Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.”



Yeah. 'Cause we are not stupid we have a re-action. We've been reacting for many years. From slave rebellions, resistance and revolts, through the tough years of reconstruction into the anti-lynching organizing and civil rights movement, we've fought, pushed-back and died. We are not stupid. Republicans aren't the ""party of Lincoln."" We know where the Dixiecrats fled to. We've watched you eat your own and cast them out when they even approach something resembling reason.

Republican attempts to limit our hard won right to vote just adds fuel to the fire. And they ain't stopping.

Ari Berman in The Nation last week reported on new voter repression legislation proposed and introduced for 2013 :



• Mandating a government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot: Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Washington, Wyoming • Restricting voter registration drives: Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Mexico, Virginia • Banning election-day voter registration: California, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska • Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote: Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia • Purging the voter rolls: Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia • Reducing early voting: Arizona, Indiana, South Carolina, Texas, Wisconsin • Disenfranchising ex-felons: Virginia.



Oh, and by the way: Latinos and Native Americans don't cotton to the nickname Tonto. That may have worked well for the Lone Ranger and his ""sidekick"" Indian buddy who was named ""stupid"" on tee-vee in the 50's, but promoting Marco Rubio as a patently obvious ploy to get a flood of browns to swamp the voting booths for you ain't gonna happen.

As my Puerto Rican husband said yesterday, ""Nosotros no somos estúpidos.""

So we'll be gathered together under the Democratic party big tent, seeking shelter from the acidic rain of the Republican hate-fest for the forseeable future.

The group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says it is taking the extraordinary legal step of going directly to the Supreme Court because the sweeping collection of the phone records of American citizens has created “exceptional circumstances” that only the nation’s highest court can address.

The group, based in Washington, also said it was taking its case to the Supreme Court because it could not challenge the legality of the N.S.A. program at the secret court that approved it, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, and because lower federal courts did not have the authority to review the secret court’s orders.

In its petition, the group said the FISA court had “exceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.”"

There was a time when the NAACP was at the forefront of black empowerment.

For far too long the NAACP has failed to advance anyone.

It%27s time for black Americans to reject the NAACP%27s message of entitlement and victimhood.

CORRECTION:A previous version of this column misstated the timing of the decision to hold the 2013 NAACP convention in Orlando. The decision was made in July 2011, not after Trayvon Martin's death in 2012.

After a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, the NAACP pledged that it ""will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed."" The reaction is characteristic of today's NAACP, a group that deals more in political demagoguery than in advancing the causes relevant to African Americans. The group is a shadow of what it once was.

There was a time when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was at the forefront of the fight for equal rights and black empowerment. As a two-term president of the NAACP branch in Garland, Texas, in the 1980s, I led our efforts to help the black community rise.

We believed that every child deserved a quality education that allowed him or her to become a leader in the community. We fought for the society that espoused the same values championed by Martin Luther King Jr., where our children would be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.

Then I watched as progressives staged a coup to take over the Garland NAACP chapter and many others, including the national organization. Their agenda is angry, calling for every black man, woman, and child to be dependent on the government from cradle to grave – wards of the state, addicted to government handouts, living with a perpetual victim complex.

For far too long the NAACP has failed to advance anyone. Too many black youths are functionally illiterate. About 40 percent of blacks don't graduate from high school. Black unemployment is almost as high as it was during the Great Depression. While the NAACP continues to champion the rhetoric of race baiters, it has nothing to show for the donations taken from those struggling to make ends meet in the black community.

The end of my lifetime membership of the NAACP began the minute I dared to speak out. I was ostracized and punished for declaring that my rights come from God, not the government and that I believed the NAACP stood for the ""advancement of colored people,"" not the ""advancement of colored progressives.""

Progressives in the NAACP called me a ""bad soldier"" for the organization. I refuse to fight for agendas that hold my community down in poverty. Black Americans are only 13.5 percent of the total population, but we represent 34 percent of all welfare recipients. The culture of dependency has our abolitionist forefathers rolling in their graves.

The organization's attempted manipulation of Martin's tragic death for its own gain is just the latest example of a once-great organization gone completely off the rails. The case had nothing to do with ""racial profiling,"" but the cynics at the NAACP saw an opportunity to score political points on a buzzword issue and relentlessly pounced.

It's time for black Americans to reject the NAACP's message of entitlement and victimhood. It's time for members of the black community to educate themselves on the values they won't hear from the NAACP pulpit.

I left the NAACP to travel the country preaching the message of freedom and self-empowerment. In the DNA of every true American is a thirst for liberty. Black people can be free. We just have to leave the government plantation.

http://news.yahoo.com/stores-free-rein-recoup-shoplifting-170838818.html,,[],Stores have free rein to recoup shoplifting losses,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Outside the view of paying customers, people accused of shoplifting at Macy's huge flagship store are escorted by security guards to cells in ""Room 140,"" where they can be held for hours, asked to sign an admission of guilt and pay hundreds in fines, sometimes without any conclusive proof they stole anything.

As shoppers jam stores ahead of the December holidays, claims of racial profiling at department stores in New York have helped expose the wide latitude that laws in at least 27 states give retailers to hold and fine shoplifting suspects, even if a person hasn't yet technically stolen anything, is wrongly accused or criminal charges are dropped.

""You must remember, these people are not police officers; they are store employees,"" said Faruk Usar, the attorney for a 62-year-old Turkish woman who sued Macy's, which some customers say bullied them into paying fines on the spot or harassed them with letters demanding payment. ""When they are detained, they are not yet even in a real jail.""

Industrywide, more than $12 billion is lost to shoplifting each year. The laws, which vary on strictness and fine amounts, allow stores to try to recoup some losses. Under New York's longstanding law, retailers may collect a penalty of five times the cost of the stolen merchandise, up to $500 per item, plus as much as $1,500 if the merchandise isn't in a condition to be sold. A conviction is not necessary to bring a civil claim.

Some customers say stores have harassed them into signing admissions of guilt in order to turn a profit — not just recoup a loss.

Retailers don't divulge how much money they recoup but use it in part to offset security costs, said Barbara Staib, spokeswoman for the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention. The total is a fraction of what they lose, she said.

""We tend to forget that retailers are the victims of crime when it comes to shoplifting,"" she said.

But at least nine customers at the Macy's store immortalized in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" say in lawsuits that the retailer is abusing the law, wrongly targeting minorities and holding customers for hours, years after it settled similar claims brought by the state attorney general by paying a $600,000 fine and changing practices. That agreement expired in 2008.

Story continues

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the new claims against retailers. Last week, New York state stores agreed to post a customer ""bill of rights"" on their websites explicitly prohibiting profiling and unreasonable searches.

Usar's client, Ayla Gursoy, was detained in 2010 after she carried two coats in her arms up several flights of stairs in the flagship store, according to her suit. Store security accused Gursoy, who speaks little English, of trying to steal. She was asked to sign a form admitting guilt and pay a fine. She refused, the police were called and she was arrested.

Gursoy and others say they were held for hours in Room 140, a bare room with two small, barred holding cells with wooden benches within the store.

Elina Kazan, a spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based Macy's, said the company's practices prohibit coercion when recovering fines.

""Our policy of exercising our right to pursue a civil recovery payment is consistent with common practice in the retail industry and within the parameters of the law,"" she said.

Many retailers detain suspected shoplifters, industry experts said, but few have dedicated jail cells and most don't ask for payments on the spot like Macy's.

Most of the accused receive letters in the mail demanding payment from a law firm like the one used by Macy's, Palmer, Reifler & Associates, of Orlando, Fla. That firm also represents Home Depot, Wal-Mart and many other stores and sends out about 115,000 letters per month.

""We are confident in our clients' training processes and procedures for evaluating and investigating theft matters,"" attorney Natt Reifler said.

Letters sent to Gursoy said that if she didn't pay, she would be sued. One said she owed $400; the next said she owed $675 — the increase unexplained.

""We believe the whole purpose of her detention was to get the signature, to get the payments,"" Usar said shortly before his client's suit was settled in court Dec. 4. The terms were not disclosed. Her criminal charge was dismissed after no witness could testify.

In San Leandro, Calif., Jimin Chen accused Home Depot in a federal lawsuit of abusing the laws by shaking down customers to make an extra profit.

He said he was stopped in September by a security guard there who falsely accused him of trying to steal work gloves worth $3.99 that he had taken off the shelves and worn to load lumber into his cart. He said he was detained until he signed an admission of guilt.

Later, he started receiving letters demanding money; $350, then $675. Home Depot disputes the claims and has asked for dismissal.

Lawyers say that retailers rarely actually sue for the money, and they often suggest letter recipients don't bother paying because refusing won't affect their credit.

Generally, industry experts say, the laws allowing retailers to hold and fine suspected shoplifters are applied correctly.

""Retailers do a really good job of identifying where actual theft cases have occurred, and intervening and conducting investigations,"" said Joseph LaRocca, who runs RetaiLPartners, an industry group aimed at building partnerships between retailers and law enforcement. ""There are always exceptions, but by and large, there are few mistakes here.""

The racial profiling allegations started in New York this fall with a different retailer, Barneys New York, after two black customers said they were stopped while buying expensive merchandise. The retailer has said it does not profile, and neither customer was asked to sign a confession or pay a fine.

But the allegations grew to include Macy's. Among those complaining was Rob Brown of the HBO show ""Treme,"" who said he was stopped after buying a $1,300 Movado watch for his mother this summer.

Brown, 29, said he too was taken to Room 140. There, he said in a federal suit filed by attorney Doug Wigdor, others being held were all ""individuals of color."" He was released, he said, when people realized he was a celebrity.

Kazan, of Macy's, said she couldn't comment on pending litigation.
