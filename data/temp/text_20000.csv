You’ve been dumped as San Diego mayor and had to admit, in court, that you’re a serial assailant. But there is life after public humiliation.

Sometimes, however, it’s just a different kind of public humiliation.

Edwin Edwards, the former four-term governor of Louisiana, a legend who used suitcases of cash to pay off his gambling debts and was known as “the Silver Zipper” for his womanizing, is treading yet another path to redemption. Out of federal prison, where the Democrat served more than eight years for fraud, racketeering and extortion, he’s married to a former pen-pal five decades younger who just gave birth to their son.

And he’s about to hit reality TV.

The third Mrs. Edwards will, on the night of Oct. 27, become “The Governor’s Wife,” to the uncertain benefit of A&E viewers. Depending on the perspective, it could be just deserts for a felon, a painful come-down for a man who used to run a state, or simply another “laissez les bons temps rouler” chapter in the 86-year wild ride that is Edwards’ life.

“Unwatchable and unmissable,” John Maginnis, a longtime chronicler of Louisiana politics, cracked about the show, though he could have been talking about Edwards’ long political saga as well.

As karmic payback for Edwards’ real or imagined sins, it’s a doozy. The video preview shows Edwards in prison garb and, separately, being spoon-fed by his wife, Trina. Promotional materials say the show will chronicle Trina’s efforts to “rehabilitate her gold-digger reputation.... Trina is wildly in love with Edwin and constantly turns to him for advice on everything from raising her teenage sons to devising her next harebrained scheme.”

And then there are Edwards’ grown daughters, almost twice Trina’s age, one of whom, Victoria, is described as “a seen-it-all former performer who is never far from her electronic cigarette.”

Not that Edwards, who could not be reached for an interview, has ever shied from out-there behavior. He is a throwback to old Louisiana, replete with characters who eschewed the buttoned-down earnestness of the state’s current leaders.

“He brings back something missing in Louisiana politics: personality,” said Maginnis, noting that an appreciation of Edwards was now safe, inasmuch as his civic debt is paid and he’s not running for anything, so far as anyone knows.

Still, some Louisianans are leery about the upcoming show and its potential to perpetuate stereotypes about the state to a national audience, Maginnis said. “Fun to have around, but not something you want to show the neighbors,” as he put it.

For all the raucous and rakish behavior, there was always an astute political side to Edwards. Even as he tried to beat back near-constant accusations of scandal in terms that he won from the 1970s to the 1990s, he gained swarms of supporters for what he has termed his “serve the needy, not the greedy” political philosophy.

His tax policy, arrayed against oil and gas concerns, created a windfall for the state that helped finance generous social programs. He appointed blacks and women to positions in numbers never before seen in Louisiana, streamlined the government and oversaw the completion of the Superdome.

And he reveled in a reputation that, in his 1991 race for governor against former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, featured bumper stickers imploring Louisianans: “Vote for the crook -- it’s important.”

Almost two decades after he left the governor’s office, the debate that shadowed that campaign still filters through public conversations: is he a criminal to be disdained, or a public servant to be honored? Or both?

The Gambit, a New Orleans weekly, denounced Edwards in a recent column, citing the “embarrassing” specter of the upcoming TV show, with its video inclusion of Edwards holding a sign reading “I’m innocent.”

“Edwin Edwards is many things, but ‘innocent’ is not among them -- and Louisiana is not the same state that elected him four times,” the online column declared. “The wink-and-nod casual corruption that was once accepted as the price of doing business here has receded since Edwards’ day (though it hasn’t totally disappeared).”

Not so fast, countered a commenter.

“A crook, yes, but a crook that put the people first, not like the crooks there now that say the public be damned and you will get what we decide to let you have,” the commenter wrote. “Louisiana at one time had the best politicians money could buy, now we just have politicians that can be bought.”

It recalled an incident Maginnis cited in a 1991 Los Angeles Times story about the epic election battle that featured Edwards, Duke and the then-incumbent, Buddy Roemer.

As Maginnis told writer Richard E. Meyer, Edwards had brought 10,000 believers to their feet on the Fourth of July at a church tabernacle, and Maginnis wanted to know why.

Maginnis asked the Rev. Clarence Bates, who before preaching had served as a bodyguard for another less-than-virtuous governor, Earl Long: “How can any church intent on holiness and morality support a man like Edwin Edwards, who is known to gamble, chase women ... and constantly be under investigation for corruption?”

Bates looked at Maginnis.

“Well,” he said, “he doesn’t drink or smoke.”

(CNN) —

If you listen to the groupthink echo-chamber know-it-alls in Washington, the Republican Party has been decimated, destroyed, discombobulated and utterly distressed to the point of putting a “going out of business” sign out front and closing up shop for good.

Reality says that’s ridiculous.

On the national level, the GOP controls the U.S. House of Representatives while Democrats control the U.S. Senate and the Oval Office.

CNN Roland Martin

But the real power for the Republicans is on the state level, and there they are dominating Democrats.

Republicans control the governor’s mansion in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Folks, that’s 30 out of the 50 states in the nation. The Democrats have governors in 19 states. (Rhode Island’s governor is an independent.)

What about both chambers on the state level? The GOP controls the legislature in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Count ‘em up and that’s 26. The Democrats control 18 legislatures. Five of the remaining six are split between the two chambers and one has a nonpartisan, one-chamber legislature.

So much of the national media attention is always focused on what’s happening in Washington, but that is a common mistake that the political bosses keep making. Every Sunday show on broadcast and cable parades the usual suspects from the U.S. Senate and sometimes a few influential U.S. House members, but it would make far more sense to be talking to governors, key state officials and mayors for a real understanding of what’s happening in America.

The GOP has been doing a lot of soul-searching and head-scratching since Mitt Romney was pummeled by President Barack Obama in November. Republican Party leaders are being told that they must soften their stance on gay and lesbian issues, flip the script on immigration reform, stop dissing women at every turn, and become more “compassionate” – like George W. Bush when he was selling his candidacy in 2000.

On Monday, the Republican National Committee announced its 2012 election postmortem, which called for, among other things, an aggressive new push to reach minorities in the states.

Meanwhile, Democrats are giddy, believing they have found a winning formula for the next generation by turning out young folks, gay and lesbian folks, black voters, Latino voters and lots of women. Sure, that coalition worked well for Obama, but there is no guarantee it will be the key to success for the next Democratic presidential candidate.

So while Democrats salivate at the prospect of winning the White House in 2016, Republicans continue to lay the groundwork for taking over the state houses and gubernatorial mansions, and building a formidable team of next-generation politicians to dominate there and in the White House.

In fact, many Republicans have told me they couldn’t care less about Washington, because legislation with real impact is being proposed and passed in the states. That’s why you’ve seen groups quietly backing initiatives on the state level and bypassing the hot lights and screaming media in Washington.

The real battles on same-sex marriage, abortion, education, spending, labor unions, and, yes, the Affordable Care Act are happening state by state. And Democrats are being caught flat-footed because they ignored the admonition of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean to create a 50-state party, and instead, created a party that cared more about Congress and the White House.

Think about it: Obama won Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Nevada, all states with GOP governors. So clearly voters in those states chose the Republican alternative in statewide elections, but when it came to the presidency, said “No thanks.”

I’m not buying for a second this silly notion that the GOP will have a Damascus Road experience and drastically change. It’s not going to happen. There will be some movement on the national level, but Republican grass-roots organizers are very well aware that the message the GOP is selling statewide is a winning formula.

Trust me, Republicans are concocting other pieces of legislation to bring change on the state level, regardless of what’s happening in Washington.

The political adage “All politics is local” has not changed.

Maybe more of my brothers and sisters in Washington need to get outside the Beltway, hit the road and discover the far more expansive America that is happening outside Washington, Maryland, Virginia, New York and New Jersey. If they do, they’ll find out that the conventional wisdom is pretty much worthless."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/18/ricin-suspect-long-known-for-angry-screeds/,2013-04-18 00:00:00,[],Ricin suspect long known for angry online screeds,"The Mississippi man suspected of sending deadly ricin in letters to President Obama and a senator from his home state is no stranger to local police, who have long viewed him as a paranoid conspiracy theorist prone to violence.

Paul Kevin Curtis, a sometime-Elvis impersonator who appeared in a Mississippi federal court Thursday and denied wrongdoing, has penned numerous rants accusing the government of hounding him. Many of his screeds have ended with the same line his letter to President Obama reportedly did: “I am KC and I approve this message.”

An affidavit released by the Department of Justice quotes Curtis’ letters to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and a judge as saying: ""Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die.""

[pullquote]

Curtis has claimed unknown forces blew up his car, interfered in his personal relationships and rigged Elvis impersonation contests. His rants, which have appeared at ripoffreport.com on his Facebook page seem to stem from 2001, when, as a cleaner hired by a morgue, he claims to have found bags of body parts, including a severed head. After reporting his discovery to authorities, Curtis came to believe he was made a “person of interest where my every move was watched and videotaped.”

On Ripoffreport.com, a forum for people to complain about purported scams, a man who identified himself as Curtis detailed in 2007 how the alleged incident began his spiral.

“3 Years of research lead to countless court battles, cops harassing me weekly, death threats, personal & financial losses, several thefts, my home burned down, car exploded, marriage dissolved & bankruptcy,” he wrote.

Curtis claims he sought help from elected officials, including Wicker, who was his congressman prior to being elected to the Senate in 2007. Wicker told CNN he has met Curtis and believed him to have “mental issues.”

Curtis reportedly wrote that he is on the “hidden front lines of a secret war” on his Facebook page hours before federal agents arrested him at his home in Corrinth Wednesday. He is being held in the Lafayette County Detention Center.

“My mother wants me to SHUT UP. My brothers fear me. My sister hates me. . . . I have lost most of my friends,” he wrote. “I have spent more than $130,000 on legal fees in 13.5 years. . . . They destroyed my marriage, they distracted my career, they stalked, they trolled, they came into my home, took my computers, had me arrested 22 times and guess what? I am still a thorn in the corrupt anals! I will remain here until Jesus Christ decides its time for me to go.”

The letters to Obama and Wicker, which bore Memphis postmarks, have tested positive for ricin. The ones sent to Washington were opened in a remote facility and no one appears to have been harmed by them. The FBI has said there is no indication of a connection between the letters and the Monday bombing in Boston that killed three people and injured more than 170. The letters to Obama and Wicker were postmarked April 8, before the marathon."

Members of Congress called for firing the agency’s acting commissioner, one of the senior officials involved, and President Obama said he would “not tolerate” any such abuse of power by the IRS.

“If you’ve got the IRS operating in anything less than a neutral and nonpartisan way, then that is outrageous; it’s contrary to our traditions. And people have to be held accountable, and it’s got to be fixed,” Obama said at a White House news conference, noting that the IRS’ practices are under investigation. “We’ll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are. But I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it. And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) announced a hearing Friday. “News that the agency admits it targeted American taxpayers based on politics is both astounding and appalling,” he said. “It is almost inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the IRS knew conservative groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the committee’s investigation into this practice.”

Despite calls for firings, neither the president nor members of Congress have legal authority to fire any IRS officials other than the commissioner and general counsel, who are the agency’s two political appointees. Neither of those jobs is currently filled.

Top officials at the IRS didn’t reveal the improper targeting until Friday, when it acknowledged mistakes it said had been made by its Cincinnati office, the main office handling tax-exempt entities — although members of Congress started asking questions about the agency’s handling of tea party organizations as early as 2011.

On Monday, Jay Sekulow, a lawyer representing 27 tea party groups, said IRS queries came not only from Cincinnati but from offices in Washington, D.C., and Laguna Niguel and El Monte, Calif.

Sekulow, a former lawyer for the IRS chief counsel’s office, said the groups would continue to press for answers on who was guiding the review of tea party groups. “Agents can’t do that on their own,” he said.

Some groups were sent detailed questionnaires that asked about their relationships with candidates or public officials, details of their fundraising pitches and their lists of donors.

The controversy centers on “social welfare” organizations set up under section 501(c)4 of the tax code, which can participate in elections as long as politics is not their primary purpose. Unlike political committees, such groups are not required to disclose their donors. Social welfare groups had a limited role in campaigns until 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United case that corporations could spend unlimited sums on elections — a decision that also unleashed a flood of spending by the nonprofit groups.

The IRS staff has the job of determining which groups qualify for tax-exempt status. Lois Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organizations, said the disputed actions were devised as shortcuts by workers dealing with a flood of applications from groups seeking to become tax-exempt social welfare organizations.

The agency has acknowledged that employees in Cincinnati, in reviewing applications for nonprofit status, inappropriately singled out conservative organizations whose applications included the words “tea party” or “patriots” for closer examination.

But at least two top agency officials repeatedly assured members of Congress in 2012 that the IRS was processing applications in a smooth and consistent manner, even though they knew of the problems.

Steven T. Miller, a 20-year veteran of the agency who is the acting IRS commissioner, first learned on May 3, 2012, that the agency had inappropriately singled out groups by name, the IRS told the Los Angeles Times. A month later, Miller made no mention of the matter in a letter to Congress about the issue.

Advertisement

In a June 15, 2012, letter to the chairman of a key House oversight subcommittee, Miller wrote that after an increase in applications for tax-exempt status in 2010, the agency “took steps to coordinate the handling of the cases to ensure consistency.”

Miller, then deputy IRS commissioner, noted that some applications had lingered “for a longer time than expected,” according to the letter obtained by The Times. And he made an allusion to some internal problems, writing that, in early 2012, “issues with respect to these cases were brought to the attention” of top officials who “ensured more timely and consistent handling of the cases.”

Lerner had raised concerns about the criteria used to identify potentially problematic tax-exempt applicants at a June 2011 IRS staff meeting, according to a timeline assembled by the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration.

When Lerner learned that groups with “tea party, “patriots” or “9-12 Project” in their names were selected for further review, she “instructed that the criteria be immediately revised,” according to the timeline, which is part of a report that a Treasury Department spokesman said would be released this week. The “9-12"" designation refers to a conservative movement to restore the national unity felt after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

But nearly a year later, in an April 26, 2012, letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Lerner said the agency was trying “to promote consistent handling” of tax-exempt applications. She also said the applications were judged by IRS agents who used “sound reasoning based on tax law training and his or her own experience.”

In a May 4, 2012, follow-up letter to the committee, Lerner wrote, “To minimize possible variances, the IRS utilizes training and tools to promote quality and consistency in similar cases.”

Advertisement

The IRS did not respond to questions about why the officials had not revealed the improper targeting sooner.

The timeline prepared by the inspector general depicts an agency mired in confusion, hung up on bureaucratic infighting and frozen by what the report calls “a lack of management oversight and guidance.”

Advertisement

The actions in question started about March 1, 2010, when an IRS specialist started pulling applications using keywords like “tea party.” By the time Lerner learned about the practice in June of the next year, employees were also selecting applications that criticized the government or talked about lobbying to “make America a better place to live.”

It was not until May 17, 2012, that the agency adopted its final criteria for review, which focused on organizations with a “significant amount of political campaign intervention.”

Advertisement

By that time, the questionnaires had already gone out and organizations had begun protesting about IRS harassment, drawing the attention of agency higher-ups. In April, a “senior technical advisor” visited Cincinnati and looked over the pending cases, pointing out “troubling questions,” including requests for donor information. On June 4, 2012, the agency drafted a letter assuring groups that any donor information would be destroyed.

Obama told reporters he learned about the issue from news reports Friday after Lerner revealed it during a talk at a conference. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel received a “normal sort of heads-up” about the inspector general’s report the week of April 22.

“We, like everyone else, are awaiting the results,” Carney said.

In a letter delivered to the White House on Thursday, journalists from a variety of media organizations protested limits that often prevent them from taking photos of Obama. The letter questioned why only White House-approved photos were the only ones of certain events allowed to be released.

NBC News chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd raised the issue at a briefing with White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest. Todd compared the restrictions to Vladimir Putin's control over the press in Russia, and later clarified on Twitter:

Folks. I used hyperbole to make a point. Good grief. Listen to entire exchange with @jearnest44 Fact is they are setting a new precedent — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) November 21, 2013

And the press access precedent being set by this WH press office will only be followed in a more rigid way by next POTUS. why we whine — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) November 21, 2013

Politico reported that Earnest argued the administration was using new technologies to increase access to the president, which elicited a groan from the press corps. Reporter April Ryan tweeted during the exchange,

Fight!!!! The mud is slinging in the briefing room. — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) November 21, 2013

Okay a polite fight, but a fight none the less. I love it. Keep up the fight for access. — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) November 21, 2013

Later, WHCA President Steve Thomma challenged Earnest on photo access, and explained the differences between the pictures taken by independent journalists and White House photographers. Earnest replied, ""We don't view the government camera as a substitute in any way"" and acknowledged that the two sides will never agree ""100% of the time about those decisions,"" but that working with the press corps is ""a priority"" for the administration.

Also on Thursday, the American Society of News Editors and the Associated Press Media Editors urged their members to stop using photos and video released by the White House.

""We must accept that we, the press, have been enablers,"" the organization said in a letter. ""We urge those of you in news organizations to immediately refrain from publishing any of the photographs or videos released by the White House, just as you would refuse to run verbatim a press release from them."""

Gov. Brown wants a reversal of a lower court ruling ordering inmate releases

The lower court ruling said the prisons were overcrowded

Gov. Brown says the ruling will force the release of violent felons

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Against growing odds, Gov. Jerry Brown formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court late Friday to intervene once again in California's yearslong battle with federal judges over control of the state's prison system.

The Democratic governor filed his formal appeal asking the justices to overturn a lower court decision requiring the state to reduce its prison population by nearly 10,000 inmates by the end of the year to improve conditions.

The appeal came the same day as the U.S. Justice Department indicated that it may intervene in an ongoing lawsuit over California's treatment of inmates with severe mental illness, and as a lower federal court dumped cold water on the administration's plan to transfer more inmates to private prisons in other states.

Brown filed the appeal just a week after the Supreme Court soundly rejected the state's request to postpone the lower court's requirement that California reduce what once was the nation's largest correctional system to hold no more than 110,000 inmates in its major prisons.

Even if the high court agrees this fall to consider the state's objections, a ruling is unlikely until next year. That would be too late to help California avoid complying with the order.

The administration argues in its appeal that the lower court made up of three federal trampled on the state's right to govern its own corrections system when it directed California to transfer or release thousands of inmates.

The Supreme Court backed the lower court's authority in a 5-4 decision in 2011.

But Brown argues that the judges failed to consider that California already has reduced the prison population by more than 46,000 inmates since 2006, primarily through a 2-year-old state law that is sentencing lower-level criminals to county jails instead of state prisons. The administration says most of the low risk inmates are already gone and that releasing those who remain would endanger the public.

The administration also argues in its 45-page appeal that the judges have not considered evidence showing that prison health care now exceeds constitutional standards after the state invested billions of dollars to improve treatment.

However, a majority of the Supreme Court justices indicated last week that they believe the state is unlikely to succeed in its latest attempt to avoid following the courts' orders. Just three of the nine justices dissented when the court rejected the state's attempt to delay action for months while the high court considers California's appeal.

Meanwhile, the lower court signaled that it may not go along with the administration's new plan, outlined by Corrections Secretary Jeffrey Beard this week, to transfer more inmates to private out-of-state prisons instead of freeing them early to lower the prison population.

Roughly 4,000 more inmates will be given additional good time credits leading to their early release later this year, unless the lower court agrees to let the state rent additional private prison cells and surplus space in local jails as an alternative. The lower court emphasized in a four-page filing on Friday that their current order does not permit the state to send more inmates out of state.

Beard said the state expects to soon seek the court's permission to rent more prison cells as one alternative to early releases.

In a related development Friday, the federal government filed a ""statement of interest"" in an ongoing lawsuit over whether California is violating the rights of severely mentally ill inmates who are kept in solitary confinement for extended periods. U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton of Sacramento has scheduled a hearing in November on the isolation issue.

The U.S. Justice Department noted that earlier this year it determined that extended isolation violated mentally ill inmates' rights in a Pennsylvania prison, where Beard used to head the state corrections department.

The department said it previously had found similar abuses in prisons or jails in Hawaii, Maryland, Tennessee and Wisconsin, though it emphasized that it has not determined if conditions in California similarly violate federal law or the U.S. Constitution."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/sunday-review/has-caucasian-lost-its-meaning.html,2013-07-07 00:00:00,['Shaila Dewan'],Has ‘Caucasian’ Lost Its Meaning?,"There is another reason to use it, said Jennifer L. Hochschild, a professor of government and African-American studies at Harvard. “The court, or some clever clerk, doesn’t really want to use the word white in part because roughly half of Hispanics consider themselves white.” She added, “White turns out to be a much more ambiguous term now than we used to think it was.”

There are a number of terms that refer to various degrees of blackness, both current and out of favor: African-American, mulatto, Negro, colored, octaroon. There are not a lot of options for whites. In Texas, they say Anglo. And there is the pejorative we were so pithily reminded of when a witness in the racially charged George Zimmerman trial said the victim, Trayvon Martin, had called Mr. Zimmerman a “creepy-ass cracker.”

IN the South, I was often asked about my ethnic origins, and I had a ready answer. “My father is from India,” I would recite, phrasing it in such a way as to avoid being mistaken for an American Indian. “And my mom is white.” Almost invariably, if I was speaking to black people, they would nod with understanding. If I was speaking to white people, I would get a puzzled look. “What kind of white?” they would ask. Only when I explained the Norwegian, Scottish and German mix of my ancestry would I get the nod.

I theorized that this was because blacks understood “white” as a category, both historical and contemporary — a coherent group that wielded power and excluded others. Whites, I believed, were less comfortable with that notion.

But Matthew Pratt Guterl, the author of “The Color of Race in America, 1900-1940,” had a different take. “They’re trying to trace your genealogy and figure out what your qualities are,” he said. “They’re looking in your face, they’re looking in the slope of your nose, the shape of your brow. There’s an effort to discern the truth of the matter, because all whitenesses are not equal.” In other words, they weren’t rejecting the category, they were policing its boundaries.

Such racial boundaries have increasingly been called into question in the debate over affirmative action, once regarded as a form of restitution to descendants of slaves, but now complicated by all sorts of questions about who, exactly, is being helped. “What if some of them aren’t poor, what if some of them don’t have American parentage, what if some of them are really stupid?” Ms. Painter, the historian, asked. “There’s all kinds of characteristics that we stuff into race without looking, and then they pop out and we think, ‘I can’t deal with that.’ ”

Doubtless, this society will continue to classify people by race for some time to come. And as we lumber toward justice, some of those classifications remain useful, even separate from other factors like economic class. Caucasian, though? Not so much."

""It's scary,"" said Urbina, 29, who has been in the country illegally since 2001 and sees driving as a necessary risk. ""If they stop us and we get arrested, we could lose everything, you know?""

On Tuesday, Urbina was among many who expressed joy and relief upon learning that Illinois is poised to join a handful of states that offer legal driving privileges to those in the country illegally.

After failing by just two votes in 2007, legislation to provide driver's licenses to illegal immigrants passed the Illinois House by a vote of 65-46. Gov. Pat Quinn's office issued a statement shortly afterward saying he plans to sign the bill, which cleared the state Senate in December.

The vote came after a lengthy debate that reflected the passions over illegal immigration nationwide. Supporters had mounted a monthslong campaign citing the dangers of allowing the estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants of legal age in Illinois to drive without passing tests to show they are qualified — and most likely without automobile insurance.

""Whatever your position on immigrant issues, what we can all agree on is there are millions and millions of undocumented people in this country living with us, working for us, driving for us,"" said state Rep. Edward Acevedo, D-Chicago, who sponsored the measure in the House. ""We have failed because some of these individuals cannot be trained to drive the roads of Illinois.""

Opponents voiced concerns that the licenses could lead to fraud and abuse and had said the measure should require fingerprints from applicants. Backers argued that such a requirement would cost too much money and deter people who are fearful of having their fingerprints recorded in a federal database.

""One has to wonder whether people are going to feel comfortable submitting to fingerprinting knowing that their fingerprints could wind up going to federal immigration authorities if all they're applying for is a driving document,"" said Fred Tsao, policy director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which spearheaded support for the measure.

""All this is good for is driving,"" Tsao said. ""It's not even a valid ID.""

Under the legislation, Temporary Visitor Driver's Licenses, already available for foreigners here legally, would also be available for illegal immigrants, Illinois secretary of state spokesman Dave Druker said. Those licenses, renewable every three years, could not be used for other identification purposes, such as boarding a plane, buying a gun or voting, Druker said.

To be eligible for a license, a person would have to live in Illinois for at least a year, a provision that would require applicants to provide a copy of a lease, utility bills or other proof that they've been in the state.

While cast primarily as a safety issue, the bill's passage quickly took on the political overtones of broader efforts to pass federal immigration reforms in Congress, with advocacy groups on both sides of that debate either celebrating or sounding warning bells.

Within an hour, the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform sent out an email alert that urged constituents nationwide to phone Quinn's office immediately with a list of reasons that it should not be signed into law.

""It all relies on less-than-reliable documentation to establish who they (license applicants) are,"" said FAIR spokesman Ira Mehlman, listing among his agency's concerns a potential for would-be terrorists to get an Illinois license.

""The state of Illinois should not be in the business to make it easier for people to violate federal immigration law,"" Mehlman said.

At an early evening rally in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood attended by about 100 people, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the bill's passage should advance the argument for comprehensive federal immigration reform.

""We have been clear in setting a national pattern,"" said Emanuel, who reflected on his grandfather's passage to Chicago from Eastern Europe. ""This will be noticed around the country.

""This is a great accomplishment to allow people on a very practical basis to take their kids to school, places of worship and get themselves to work,"" the mayor said. ""I want to take this victory, savor what it is and use it as the energy to move and bring comprehensive immigration reform.""

Yuridia Diaz, 29, originally from Mexico, stopped driving three years ago when she was pulled over by police. Fearing deportation, she chooses to take an hourlong bus ride to work instead.

With legal driving imminent, she said ""a weight has been lifted off"" her shoulders.

""Now my dreams are growing,"" said Diaz, who lives in Little Village.

Ashley Moy-Wooten, an organizer at the Southwest Organizing Project, an immigrant advocacy group, said scores of people have phoned her office inquiring about the licenses after the measure cleared the Senate last month.

Martha Estrella, 47, of west suburban Stone Park, is among those eager to apply for a driver's license. About six months ago, she was arrested for driving without one after she got into an accident with, of all vehicles, a police squad car, Estrella said.

Though the infraction only resulted in a fine, it scared Estrella enough to swear off driving until it's legal, she said.

""I've lost a lot of jobs (as a temporary factory worker) because I can't drive,"" said Estrella, who has been in the country illegally for more than 20 years.

Before the accident, ""I had 23 years driving and never had I been arrested,"" including a few years in Washington state, where a state law there allowed her to drive legally.

Now, she said, ""I'm going to start looking for a car.""

March Madness is here, and the competition is getting intense.

And the battle for President Obama's library appears to have boiled down two finalists: Chicago and Hawaii.

Universities and community groups in both places are busy lobbying the president's people for the facility that the contestants see as an economic and cultural boon.

""It is a tough choice, but it's not one that I've made yet,"" Obama told an interviewer last month.

In the meantime, the Associated Press reported:

""In December, top officials from the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught law, traveled to Dallas and met with archivists at The George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University. At the meeting was Susan Sher, first lady Michelle Obama's former chief of staff and longtime friend and now a senior adviser to the University of Chicago's president. ...

""In Honolulu, where the president was born, University of Hawaii officials have visited nearly all the 13 official presidential libraries to talk to officials involved in setting them up. An American studies professor, Robert Perkinson, is leading a statewide effort coordinated by the university, with support from Gov. Neil Abercrombie and other state and federal officials. The state Legislature has passed two resolutions urging Obama to pick Hawaii; one resolution calls it 'a matter of great state pride that President Obama is the first Hawaii-born citizen to hold that high office.' ...

""Advocates for placing the library in Chicago speak of Obama's coming of age as a community organizer there and his service in the Illinois Senate and as the state's U.S. senator. They say a presidential library on the city's South Side could revitalize the community and be a force for economic growth. ...

""The emerging consensus in Honolulu is that the state university is best prepared to house the library. But there's no such sense of agreement in Chicago, where a host of groups are publicly stumping on behalf of other sites on Chicago's South Side, where Michelle Obama grew up, voters first sent Barack Obama to public office and the Obama family has their home."""

(CNN) —

Big banks have found few political friends in recent years. Excoriated by President Barack Obama and progressive Democrats like Elizabeth Warren for their “greedy” policies, rejected by Tea Party conservatives for being too cozy with Washington, and even seemingly scolded by Pope Francis in his Evangelii Gaudium last month, it’s almost as if Wall Street has been sent to the woodshed.

And after the 2012 presidential election, it’s not hard to understand why no one wants to appear too comfortable with the “plutocracy.” Many have argued that Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital pedigree and his comments at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of private equity manager Marc Leder about the “47%” helped tank his campaign. Fate sealed: Romney-the-plutocrat was cooked.

But perhaps the big banks have found an unlikely new ally: Hillary Clinton.

S.E. Cupp

An article in Politico Magazine this week, one that elicited little response from Democrats, recounted Clinton’s recent remarks to Goldman Sachs executives and a few hundred major investors, seemingly to reassure them that she didn’t think the banks were all bad.

According to the story (ironically headlined, “Lament of the Plutocrats”):

“…Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring, according to accounts offered by several attendees, declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish. Striking a soothing note on the global financial crisis, she told the audience, in effect: We all got into this mess together, and we’re all going to have to work together to get out of it. What the bankers heard her to say was just what they would hope for from a prospective presidential candidate: Beating up the finance industry isn’t going to improve the economy – it needs to stop. And indeed Goldman’s Tim O’Neill, who heads the bank’s asset management business, introduced Clinton by saying how courageous she was for speaking at the bank. (Brave, perhaps, but also well-compensated: Clinton’s minimum fee for paid remarks is $200,000).”

It’s hard to imagine how this will square with Obama’s renewed progressive, middle-class agenda for Democrats. According to the White House, raising the minimum wage and lessening income inequality will be major parts of Obama’s 2014 domestic plan – as well as his State of the Union address and budget.

More problematic is how Hillary Clinton’s bighearted rhetoric toward Wall Street will accord with Democrats generally. You don’t have to go to Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts or Bill de Blasio in Manhattan; it isn’t hard to find a Democrat, be they union machinist, single mom, or Wal-Mart cashier, who wants to punish the banks and weaken their influence in politics and everything else we do.

Hardest of all to figure is how this will square with Clinton herself. Since leaving the State Department, she’s made concerted (and some would argue necessary) efforts at rebranding herself as more progressive, speaking on voting rights, women’s issues, and gay rights.

In a recent New Republic piece by Noam Scheiber titled “Hillary’s Nightmare? A Democratic Party that Realizes its Soul Lies with Elizabeth Warren,” the writer describes Clinton’s hard left turn this way: “she recently used the word ‘progressive’ so many times in a single speech it was tempting to describe her condition as ‘severe.’”

Indeed, is Clinton in danger of becoming the next Mitt Romney? Heir(ess) to the throne, the natural front-runner, but out of touch with “the little people,” stuck in the rhetoric – and passé politicking – of the 1990s?

I talked to several Democratic strategists who were incredulous that Clinton cozied up to the bankers, and wondered how long it would take for progressive groups – or Republicans – to jump on it. Her bizarre tryst with Goldman and friends, and her nurturing message to them, doesn’t only put her to the right of progressive superstars like Warren and DeBlasio – and to the right of Obama, and to the right of most Democratic voters – but also to the right of many anti-bank, populist conservatives.

That’s tough – and odd – territory for Hillary Clinton to stake out in the run-up to a presidential election. But will Democrats hold her accountable? Or will she get a pass because she’s (sigh) Hillary? Elizabeth Warren, where are you?

""We do not want drones in town,"" Phillip Steel, the Deer Trail, Colo., resident who drafted the ordinance, told Denver's ABC 7 affiliate. ""They fly in town, they get shot down.""

Steel's proposal, recently submitted to the town board, calls for $25 drone hunting licenses, and outlines ""rules of engagement"" for hunters looking to shoot down the unmanned aerial devices:

The Town of Deer Trail shall issue a reward of $100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the United States federal government.

Steel said that while he's never seen a drone flying in Deer Trail, the ordinance is a ""symbolic"" one.

""Basically, I do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society and I believe we are headed that way,"" he said.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Deer Trail's population was 559 in 2011.

""They'll sell like hot cakes,"" Steel said of the proposed drone licenses. ""It could be a huge moneymaker for the town.""

David Boyd, one of the Deer Field's seven board members, supports the drone ordinance.

""Even if a tiny percentage of people get online (for a) drone license, that's cool,"" Boyd said. That's a lot of money to a small town like us. Could be known for it as well, which probably might be a mixed blessing, but what the heck.""

There's even talk of the town—which claims to be home to ""the world's first rodeo""—hosting the world's first drone hunt. ""A skeet, fun-filled festival,"" town clerk Kim Oldfield said.

The board will consider the drone hunting ordinance on Aug. 6."

* Xibrom drug said to be marketed for unapproved uses

* Settlement announced amid Bausch & Lomb merger talks

By Jonathan Stempel

May 24 (Reuters) - Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc pleaded guilty on Friday to charges it used kickbacks and improper marketing to boost sales of a drug meant to treat eye pain and agreed to pay $33.5 million to settle criminal and civil liability, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

The unit of eye care company Bausch & Lomb pleaded guilty to conspiracy to offer kickbacks to induce physicians to prescribe Xibrom, a drug meant to treat pain after cataract surgery, and conspiracy to promote that drug for unapproved uses, including after Lasik and glaucoma surgeries.

Ista agreed as part of a criminal settlement to a $16.63 million fine and an $1.85 million asset forfeiture. It also agreed to a $15 million civil settlement to resolve allegations that its marketing of Xibrom caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs.

As part of the settlement, Ista will be barred from participating in Medicare and Medicaid, and Bausch & Lomb agreed to strengthen its compliance and ethics procedures.

""The fact that Ista offered doctors illegal inducements - such as a wine tasting, golf outings, and payments to attend what were in essence marketing sessions - makes the company's illegal conduct particularly deserving of the hefty penalty Ista has agreed to pay,"" U.S. Attorney William Hochul in Buffalo, New York said in a statement.

Ista pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo.

Bausch & Lomb, which is based in Rochester, New York, said it was pleased to settle the matter, which involved conduct between January 2006 and March 2011, and that it knew of the government probe well before it purchased Ista.

That purchase closed in June 2012 and Bausch and Lomb plans to wind down the Ista corporate entity by year end.

The civil settlement resolves claims filed under the False Claims Act, which lets private parties known as whistleblowers sue on the U.S. government's behalf and share in recoveries.

Keith Schenker, a whistleblower who had been an Ista sales representative in Brooklyn and Queens counties in New York, will receive $2.5 million of the settlement amount, according to the Justice Department and court papers.

Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc is nearing an agreement to buy Bausch & Lomb from Warburg Pincus LLC for about $9 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. News about that transaction surfaced at about the same time that the settlement was announced.

The criminal case is U.S. v. Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of New York, No. 13-cr-00099. The whistleblower case, which was unsealed on Friday, is U.S. ex rel. Schenker v. Ista Pharmaceuticals in the same court, No. 07-00372."

None of the Republican groups have said their applications were rejected. Progress Texas, another of the organizations, faced the same lines of questioning as the Tea Party groups from the same IRS office that issued letters to the Republican-friendly applicants. A third group, Clean Elections Texas, which supports public funding of campaigns, also received IRS inquiries.

Missing from much coverage is the relevant recent history—the role of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations.

decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations. Congress requires the IRS to review every application for tax-exempt status to weed out organizations that are partisan, political, or that generate private gain. Congress has imposed this requirement on the IRS, and its predecessor agencies, since 1913.

The maelstrom over the revelation that the IRS targeted anti-tax Tea Party groups applying for tax exempt status for scrutiny is showing no signs of slowing down, with Republicans seeing their chance to milk a scandal for political purposes. But while the politics is heating up, some important context is emerging, like the fact that liberal groups were targeted as well , and in fact the only group to have its application denied was a liberal group.The IRS released a statement late Tuesday admitting that it had pooled together the applications of groups that were politically active, and incorrectly used the names of some of the groups—a ""minority"" of them—as the basis for targeting them. Which, David Cay Johnston at the reminds readers is the IRS's job.Those are just two of the salient points Johnston makes to give the critical context behind this scandal. He also points out that the IRS is tasked with the vague and mushy directive to distinguish between groups are ""primarily engaged"" in politics versus those that are primarily engaged in ""social welfare,"" and getting to that distinction is a challenge for an agency deluged by applications post-and which has had its budget slashed by 17 percent per capita in the last decade. The agency processed501(c)(4) applications in 2012.

The other point he makes, which we're not hearing frequently or loudly enough in the response to the kerfuffle, is a real scandal: ""the social welfare tax exemption is being used by existing 501(c)(4) organizations, including some very large ones, to promote partisan political interests—the very activity Congress has explicitly prohibited for a century."" In other words, Karl Rove and Crossroads.

This is a serious issue, one deserving of investigation. But Republicans could be biting off more than they can chew if it causes a bright light to be shone on how politically partisan organizations, like Rove's, are exploiting the law."

""They've paid it in lower wages while serving, they've paid it through their wounds and sacrifices on the battlefield and they're paying it now as they try to recover from those wounds.""

Economists generally agree that projected long-term debt increases stemming largely from the growth in federal health care programs pose a threat to the country's economic competitiveness. Addressing the threat means difficult decisions for lawmakers and pain for many constituents in the decades ahead.

But the veterans groups point out that their members bore the burden of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past month, they've held news conferences on Capitol Hill and raised the issue in meetings with lawmakers and their staffs. They'll be closely watching the unveiling of the president's budget next month to see whether he continues to recommend the change.

Obama and others support changing the benefit calculations to a variation of the Consumer Price Index, a measure called ""chained CPI."" The conventional CPI measures changes in retail prices of a constant marketbasket of goods and services. Chained CPI considers changes in the quantity of goods purchased as well as the prices of those goods. If the price of steak goes up, for example, many consumers will buy more chicken, a cheaper alternative to steak, rather than buying less steak or going without meat.

Supporters argue that chained CPI is a truer indication of inflation because it measures changes in consumer behavior. It also tends to be less than the conventional CPI, which would impact how cost-of-living raises are computed.

Under the current inflation update, monthly disability and pension payments increased 1.7 percent this year. Under chained CPI, those payments would have increased 1.4 percent.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that moving to chained CPI would trim the deficit by nearly $340 billion over the next decade. About two-thirds of the deficit closing would come from less spending and the other third would come from additional revenue because of adjustments that tax brackets would undergo.

Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said she understands why veterans, senior citizens and others have come out against the change, but she believes it's necessary.

""We are in an era where benefits are going to be reduced and revenues are going to rise. There's just no way around that. We're on an unsustainable fiscal course,"" Sawhill said. ""Dealing with it is going to be painful, and the American public has not yet accepted that. As long as every group keeps saying, `I need a carve-out, I need an exception,' this is not going to work.""

Sawhill argued that making changes now will actually make it easier for veterans in the long run.

That's not the way Sen. Bernie Sanders sees it. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs said he recently warned Obama that every veterans group he knows of has come out strongly against changing the benefit calculations for disability benefits and pensions by using chained CPI.

""I don't believe the American people want to see our budget balanced on the backs of disabled veterans. It's especially absurd for the White House, which has been quite generous in terms of funding for the VA,"" said Sanders, I-Vt. ""Why they now want to do this, I just don't understand.

Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate to approve an amendment last week against changing how the cost-of-living increases are calculated, but the vote was largely symbolic. Lawmakers would still have a decision to make if moving to chained CPI were to be included as part of a bargain on taxes and spending.

Sanders' counterpart on the House side, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, appears at least open to the idea of going to chained CPI.

""My first priority is ensuring that America's more than 20 million veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned, but with a national debt fast approaching $17 trillion, Washington's fiscal irresponsibility may threaten the very provision of veterans' benefits,"" Miller said. ""Achieving a balanced budget and reducing our national debt will help us keep the promises America has made tdirector for Veterans of Foreign Wars, acknowledged that veterans would see little change in their income during the first few years of the change. But even a $36 hit over the course of a year is ""huge"" for many of the disabled veterans living on the edge, he said.

The amount lost over time becomes more substantial as the years go by. Sanders said that a veteran with a 100 percent disability rating who begins getting payments at age 30 would see their annual payments trimmed by more than $2,300 a year when they turn 55."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

At Hal’s Bar & Grill here on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, he was recounting how he had recently bought 15 of them for a village in Sierra Leone, where he has been a chief, known as Gondobay Manga II, since 2006.

“Their meat is low in cholesterol, they’re a sturdy animal, they’ve been around since the beginning of time,” said Mr. Washington, who rode his black 21-speed bicycle from his home just down the street. “And they’re delicious.”

If you didn’t know that Mr. Washington was a chief in Sierra Leone, let alone that he’s buying goats for a village there, well, that’s understandable. Since being fired from the ABC series “Grey’s Anatomy” in 2007, after he reportedly used a homophobic slur during an on-set argument, and later repeated the slur backstage at the Golden Globes, this 50-year-old actor and married father of three has kept a low profile, at least in Hollywood circles.

But this year Mr. Washington is making something of a comeback. After spending a good chunk of the past six years off camera, he’s excited to talk about his coming projects, even as his conversation skitters from topics as varied as his recent trip to Rwanda, the globalization of hip-hop and why love and hate are really just two sides of the same coin. He recently starred in the Old West shoot-’em-up “They Die by Dawn,” alongside Michael K. Williams and Rosario Dawson, and plays Chancellor Jaha, leader of the few surviving humans, in the coming CW sci-fi series “The 100.”"

In a departure from the flat, colorful displays of past cards, this year’s features a pop-up White House, with Bo and Sunny walking along the front of their home.

“As we gather around this season, may the warmth and joy of the holidays fill your home,” the card reads, signed by President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, along with paw marks for Sunny and Bo.

The holiday card, a tradition that stretches to the early 20th century, began with the country’s notably hushed president: “Silent Cal” Coolidge.

Despite his steely demeanor, Coolidge was the first president to issue a warm Christmas greeting to the nation, issuing a letter for major newspapers across the country to publish in 1927. True to his nature, Coolidge’s message was terse, but it opened the door for presidents to come.

“Christmas is not a time or a season but a state of mind,” Coolidge wrote. “To cherish peace and good will, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas. If we think of these things, there will be born in us a Savior and over us will shine a star sending its gleam of hope to the world.”

For years afterward, presidential Christmas greetings were distributed among family, friends and White House staff, a trend that’s reflected by the more personal nature of earlier cards. Former first lady Lou Hoover accompanied cards with personal photos and poetry.

The cards eventually became one of the many yearly holiday events the White House takes part in, from the elaborate White House Christmas decorations to eventful holiday tours.

But it wasn’t until President Eisenhower sent his 1953 holiday card to members of Congress, heads of state, ambassadors and beyond that the White House holiday greeting reached a wider audience. By 1967, the White House holiday card was sent out to 2,600 recipients.

That number has since skyrocketed, with more than a million people receiving President George W. Bush’s annual cards.

Take a look through a wide array of White House cards above, stretching from Coolidge’s presidential seal-adorned letter, President Nixon’s minimalist White House silhouette to President Obama’s frequent use of first dog Bo as a holiday subject.

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/deputy-speaker-arrested-suspicion-rape-181755754.html,,[],Nigel Evans Arrested For Rape And Sex Assault,"Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has been released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of the rape and sexual assault of two men.

The Conservative MP, a prominent gay rights campaigner, is expected to respond to the allegations later, in person, in a statement.

Earlier, the 55-year-old posted a message on his Facebook page thanking members of the public for their support.

He wrote: ""thanks for the amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time....""

Mr Evans was arrested on Saturday morning at his constituency home in the village of Pendleton, near Clitheroe, in Lancashire.

The politician was questioned by police over an allegation of raping one man and sexually assaulting another between July 2009 and March 2013.

After several hours in custody in Preston, Mr Evans was released on bail at 10.30pm and asked to return to the police station on June 19.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Speaker John Bercow were informed of the arrest of the popular MP.

Sky News Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""The allegations are one of rape against one man and sexual assault against another man. Both of those men are now in their early 20s.""

He said: ""The offences are said to have been committed at his home in the village of Pendleton near Clitheroe which is in his constituency of Ribble Valley.""

Mr Evans, who comes from Swansea and whose parents ran a newsagents, has been MP for Ribble Valley since 1992.

Politicians and constituents said they were ""shocked"" by the allegations.

Michael Ranson, the chairman of the Ribble Valley Conservative Association, told Sky News: ""He is a very popular MP and a very good constituency MP.

""He's given assistance to a lot of his constituents over many years. Everybody's completely shell-shocked.""

Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Mr Evans, said: ""I was just deeply disturbed and shocked.

""I've known him ever since I've been in Parliament and I came in in 2005. I consider him to be a very good friend.

Story continues

""I know him to be caring, compassionate and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person.""

Mr Evans has held a number of front bench posts for the Conservative Party and was a Parliamentary Private Secretary in John Major's government and his spokesman for Welsh Affairs.

In 2010 he became one of three deputy speakers, earning £102,000-a-year, including his MP's salary.

In December 2010 he came out as gay in an interview with the Mail On Sunday newspaper in which he said that he was ""tired of living a lie"".

Mr Evans, who was vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001, said he had been threatened with exposure by political opponents.

Sky News Chief Political Correspondent Jon Craig said: ""Since then he has become quite a prominent gay rights campaigner.

""He had held, for example, at least one function in the Speaker's apartments on gay rights.

""John Bercow let him use the Speaker's apartment for a function and he has been prominent in that campaign.

""He is a very sociable MP. He is very well known.""

A villager who lives opposite the MP and who did not want to give her name said: ""I am shocked. I like him. He is a good MP and he has done a lot for the Ribble Valley.

""Obviously he is well known in the village and goes to the local pub a lot.""

Another Pendleton resident, who also did not want to give his name, said: ""It's unbelievable, I know him very well. He is an excellent person and I would stand by him 100%.""

A Lancashire Police statement confirmed that a 55-year-old man from Pendleton had been been arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault and that he was being interviewed by officers.

The statement said: ""We take all allegations of a sexual nature extremely seriously and understand how difficult it can be for victims to have the confidence to come forward.

""As a constabulary, we are committed to investigating sexual offences sensitively but robustly recognising the impact that these types of crimes have on victims.

""We would encourage anyone who has experienced sexual abuse, or who has information about it, to have the confidence to report it to us knowing that we will take it seriously, deal with it sensitively and investigate it thoroughly."""

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius']","As Sasha and Malia Obama become young women, a father laments time slipping by","When they vacationed here just before President Obama’s first inauguration, Malia and Sasha were little girls doting on their dad — holding his hand on the beach, taking in a dolphin show and nuzzling up to him at the shave-ice shop.

Now, five Christmases later, the presidential daughters are both nearly as tall as their very tall mother, each developing her own style and leading an increasingly independent life. Although they have watched a basketball game, gone for a hike and hit the beach with their dad, he has spent most afternoons here on the golf course with his buddies while the girls have gone about their business without him.

The Obamas’ annual holiday vacation, at a lush and secluded surf-side retreat in Kailua, has underscored just how much their family dynamic has evolved in the five years since they moved into the White House.

As his girls grow into young women, the president has been increasingly nostalgic in public, lamenting how quickly time has slipped by.

“Those of us who have kids know how fast it goes, because Malia and Sasha, they’re like weeds,” Obama said at a November fundraiser. A couple of weeks later, he admitted he was getting “teary” about it.

“They’re just growing up so fast, and they’ve got a busy life of their own,” Obama told People magazine. “You can project out over the next several years how, between school, sports, social life, their community service, they’re not around as much. So that gets me teary sometimes.”

When the Obamas bounded off Air Force One this month to start their vacation, they were greeted by Hawaii Gov. Neil Aber­crombie (D), an old family friend. In an interview a few days later, Abercrombie was asked what he thought of the Obama girls’ growing older. “The word ‘irony’ comes to mind,” he said.

“Their growing up is so different from his growing up,” Abercrombie said of Obama. “His dad wasn’t there. His mom had real challenges. Then being taken to another country. Then growing up here in the islands with an entirely different context and atmosphere, socially and economically, from where those young girls are growing up in the White House.”

Abercrombie added: “I wonder sometimes if they say to him, ‘You don’t understand,’ like a lot of kids.”

Obama said he lives with “three opinionated, strong, tall women” (make that four, if you count Marian Robinson, his mother-in-law, who lives on the third floor of the White House). But Obama said he is “getting kind of lonely in this big house,” telling reporters at a news conference this year, “Now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me.” This summer, he said he got a new puppy, Sunny, to fill the void left by his increasingly busy daughters.

Malia, 15, is a high school sophomore and tennis player whom her father describes as lawyerly. She has shed her braces and is allowed to date, although the president joked to comedian Steve Harvey that he’s “got men with guns following them around all the time” to scare off any sketchy boyfriends.

Sasha, 12, is a seventh-grader and basketball player who has been called a “budding style icon” by fashion bloggers. Some of her clothing choices have been highlighted in glossy fashion-magazine columns. She drew notice when she sported ’90s-chic Dr. Martens boots at last month’s turkey-pardoning ceremony, and a whimsical unicorn sweater she wore to a recent basketball game with her parents sold out within hours.

The Obama girls are among the youngest children to live in the White House in modern times. The president and first lady have tried to keep their daughters’ lives as normal as possible under the circumstances — the girls must make their own beds, even though their home is staffed by butlers and maids — and they keep the children off-limits to the news media to give them a modicum of privacy.

Although for all their parents’ efforts at creating normalcy, the Obama teens enjoy a range of experiences unimaginable to their peers. They have become friendly with celebrities including Beyoncé and Jay Z. Malia sat in on an Oval Office meeting with her parents and Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani education activist. Both daughters invite their friends over for sleep­overs and pajama parties on the third floor of the White House.

The president and first lady have described in recent interviews a set of rigid rules designed to protect the daughters from negative influences (although the president has said that Malia has been pushing back on her parents’ restrictions lately). The girls are not allowed to watch television on weekdays unless it is school-related. Neither daughter was allowed a cellphone before age 12, and their mother has warned them of the risk of having a bratty moment caught on a smartphone and going viral. Their parents say that Sasha is still too young for social media and that Malia’s screen time on Facebook is limited.

“I still am not a big believer in Facebook for young people — particularly for them, because they’re in the public eye,” Michelle Obama told ABC’s Barbara Walters last month. “Some of it’s stuff they don’t need to see and be a part of.”

Still, it was Malia and Sasha who introduced their parents to other social media. “You know, Instagram and Vine, those are things that I first heard from them,” the president told People.

At times, the Obamas have evoked their daughters to make political points. During an appearance last week on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s radio show to promote the new health-care law, Michelle Obama talked about Sasha’s bout with meningitis when she was 4 months old and how fortunate she was that they had health insurance.

Politically, however, the president may need more than family nostalgia can provide at this point, said Elizabeth Mehren, a journalism professor at Boston University who has written about several first families.

“The president’s image needs more help than ‘Father Knows Best’ can give him,” Mehren said. She added: “The public has other things on its mind now, not the Obama girls’ growth chart.”

Even as their daughters grow more independent — this summer they again went to sleep-away camp — the Obamas are trying to reinforce familiar family rhythms. The president still breaks away from the Oval Office most nights to eat dinner with the girls at 6:30, something they have done since moving to Washington in 2009.

“They have tons of opinions,” Michelle Obama told People. “And it’s a joy to hear them think out loud about life. They’re growing into really interesting individuals.”

Around the dinner table, after the Obamas take turns saying grace and praying to “live long and strong,” most of the family’s conversations are focused on the girls’ days at Sidwell Friends, the Washington prep school they both attend.

“What are they doing? And who’s got what practice? And what birthday party is coming up? And did we get a gift for this person?” Michelle Obama told Vogue this year. The president, she said, is “up on every friend, every party, every relationship.”

The experience of watching his kids grow up has helped make Obama relatable to many Americans, regardless of their politics or station in life.

“It humanizes the president,” said presidential historian Robert Dallek. “He’s a parent — a doting, affectionate father. And it’s really quite typical. He has a very human touch. Suddenly you look up and your children are teenagers and those years go by. It’s a familiar kind of lament.”

(CNN) - Treasury officials were made aware in June 2012 that the IRS inspector general was reviewing the office that handles tax-exempt applications, but a letter from October shows that the inspector general did not highlight the audit as a top concern for the agency.

In a memo dated October 15, 2012, to then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about IRS challenges for 2013, Inspector General J. Russell George noted other problem areas, but made no mention of the investigation taking place at the time of the agency's intense scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Instead, the memo stated that ""while the Exempt Organizations function has greatly improved its timeliness with regard to acknowledging complaints against tax-exempt organizations, referrals were not always controlled or processed timely.""

A spokesperson for the inspector general told CNN this letter was intended to single out what George considered to be the most serious issues for the IRS among all the cases listed in the IG's annual audit, which had already been published.

A spokesperson for the Treasury Department said the current treasury secretary, Jack Lew, and his deputy first learned of the audit’s findings from press reports last week.

The inspector general made headlines Friday when he told the House Ways and Means Committee that he had notified Treasury officials, including Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, as early as June 2012 that he was reviewing the office that handles tax-exempt applications.

CNN has confirmed that notification came in early June.

According to George, he told Treasury that he was conducting a review but did not disclose the nature of the findings. He said the review was prompted by a request from someone he described as a congressional staff member.

""It was not to inform them of the results of the audit, it was to inform them of the fact that we were conducting the audit,"" George later clarified.

A Treasury official, who discussed the matter on the condition of not being identified, told CNN that when Wolin learned of the review he did not discuss it with anyone outside the Treasury Department. The same official said Treasury strongly supports the ""the independent oversight of its three inspectors general, and it does not interfere in ongoing IG audits."" In other words, the political appointees who run Treasury do not take action until such audits are complete.

According to the Treasury official, it wasn't until mid-March of this year that anyone inside the department was informed of the targeting at the office of tax-exempt programs.

That’s when the inspector general discussed a draft audit with one or more staff-level Treasury officials. In April, George first gave Treasury staff a copy of the draft audit and that information was not shared with the treasury secretary or his deputy.

According to officials at both the inspector general and Treasury offices, Lew knew an audit was taking place because George mentioned it during an introductory meeting on March 15, 2013, but he had no window into the results.

Lew was confirmed as Treasury secretary in late February.

The inspector general for the IRS is one of three inspector generals who report to the Treasury and conducts approximately 120 audits per year."

Still, I’ve always had a soft spot for the old coot, but the man who brought us Sarah Palin now may have finally gone too far.

Linking to a provincial post in the Arizona Republic with the headline “The Dodgers are idiots,” the good senator has taken time out from dressing down Vladimir Putin and trying to shut down the government, to rip the Boys in Blue.

In a tweet he said the Dodgers pool-jumping was a “No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats!”

No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats! “The #Dodgers are idiots” https://t.co/KfZZliBFBV— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) September 20, 2013

Funny, I don’t remember him ever going after President Obama so forcibly, but then the Dodgers did jump in the Diamondbacks’ pool. Sometimes people just cross the line and senators have to speak out.

Now I know the good people of Arizona may not have been thrilled with seeing the Dodgers celebrate beating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division Thursday by jumping into that pool beyond the outfield fence, but I’m pretty sure they’ve experienced greater transgressions against their local sporting pride.

You know, like blowing a 9½-game lead on those spoiled brats to now find themselves 10½ back and eliminated. But then the temerity of those immature ballplayers, running out into an empty ballpark after all the Diamondbacks had left the field to jump in the pool and splash around.

It’s a pool. Understand that Phoenix has more than one. It is not a shrine to the Great Cactus God in the Sky or some monument to Jay Bell, or whoever the greatest Diamondback is of all time. It is not holy water. It’s a goofy pool in a ballpark.

Still, McCain – the great maverick -- couldn’t help himself. This train of the indignant had left the Arizona station, and the Senate’s favorite curmudgeon was not about to be left behind. Even though I’m pretty sure he may have something more important to do.

Some in the Valley of the Sun have got themselves in a tizzy over this because they pointed out the Diamondbacks asked the Dodgers if they did clinched while in Phoenix, that once they left the field, not to return.

Right, somebody is going to tell the Dodgers – or any other team – how and where to celebrate winning a title. Sorry, sports – and life – do not work that way. Winners and the spoils.

Some of the other incensed claim the Dodgers were mocking a grand Diamondbacks tradition, because the D-backs frolicked in the pool when they won in 2011. Apparently something happens once in Phoenix and it’s tradition.

The Dodgers jumped in a pool and splashed around and had some fun. I thought it was great. The crowd was gone, the Diamondbacks were gone. It’s not like they were taunting anyone.

Phoenix is actually a huge metropolitan area – sixth largest in the country – but has never seemed so small. Its senator included. He’s the one who looks like he’s stomping his feet and holding his breath There, there, it’ll be all right.

He is right about the Dodgers being well compensated, what with the largest payroll in baseball history. Not so sure about being overpaid, though, since they did win.

And don’t forget boys and girls, the Dodgers open the 2014 season next year against the Diamondbacks in Australia. Alert its parliament. There is some hallowed cricket ground out there. And Sydney has lots of pools."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Updated 10:36 a.m. ET, 12/9/2013

Washington (CNN) - Newt Gingrich is fighting back against conservative critics who attacked the former Speaker of the House and co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire"" for his praise of Nelson Mandela.

After Mandela passed away Thursday, Gingrich posted a statement, praising him as ""one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The right-wing response was overwhelmingly reproachful.

""Such an amazing re-write of history since 1962 and 1990. Newt, I thought you of all people, a historian, would be true to who this guy really was,"" Mike Winkelman posted on Gingrich's Facebook page.

""This clenched-fist, murdering, gorilla warrior does not deserve respect from informed Americans,"" posted Trish Baehr-Schaefer.

There were several others posts, many generating dozens of ""likes,"" and some with language unfit for publication.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, congressional Democrats to commemorate Mandela in South Africa

Gingrich said Monday that people were confusing Mandela's role with the African National Congress and that most of the violence by the ANC happened while Mandela was in prison.

On the other side of the political spectrum, he said on CNN's ""New Day"" that some liberals were going ""overboard in trying to excuse this as an attempt to attack (Ronald) Reagan."" Gingrich noted that Reagan was the one who appointed the first black ambassador to South Africa.

""There's a lot of anger on the right about this opportunity being used inappropriately,"" he said

He added that Mandela was ""deeply committed to a nonviolent approach, until you had a South African dictatorship...which made it impossible to have anything that was purely nonviolent.""

In a statement Saturday, he compared Mandela to the Founding Fathers and the farmers who took up arms at Lexington and Concord in the Revolutionary War. He praised the former South African president for his calls for reconciliation, his Christian faith and his turn from Communism to opening South Africa up to free enterprise.

""I was very surprised by it,"" Gingrich said Sunday CNN's ""State of the Union"" about the backlash.

""Callista posted my statement on her Facebook page and was amazed at some of the intensity, some of whom came back three, four and five times, repeating how angry they were.""

Gingrich has a long history as a Mandela supporter. During the Reagan administration, he was among the many Republicans in Congress who pressured the president to impose sanctions on the apartheid regime.

Fellow conservative Ted Cruz faced a similar backlash this week when he posted a respectful tribute to Mandela that generated angry criticisms. No comment yet from the Texas senator on the reaction of some of his supporters.

The freshman Senator from Texas, however, will be one of two Republicans who join a Congressional delegation to attend a memorial for Mandela in South Africa this week. President Barack Obama and other former presidents are also slated to attend.

""Frankly, without being partisan, I hope the President brings some of the spirit back with him,"" Gingrich said on ""New Day."" ""Maybe he and the Congress can sit down more in the spirit of Mandela and actually listen to each other for a while.""

Editor’s Note: Bryan Monroe is the editor of CNNPolitics.com and lost more than 170 pounds after having gastric bypass surgery in 2006.

(CNN) —

Good move, governor. And you didn’t even let on.

When we chatted briefly at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few weekends ago, you looked very upbeat and energetic. I had no idea that you had undergone Lap-Band stomach surgery to lose weight

And when I wrote that CNN piece about you on February 8 saying you needed to take your doctor’s advice seriously and do whatever you could to drop some pounds, I had no idea you probably had made the decision already and were heading into surgery in eight days.

Bryan Monroe/CNN New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with Bryan Monroe at the White House Correspondents Dinner on April 27.

Congratulations!

Now some are saying that your decision to make such a drastic move to drop what could be at least 100 pounds was motivated by your desire to run for president in 2016. Being 5-foot-11 and weighing at least 300 to 350 pounds at 50 might not be conducive to occupying the Oval Office as 45th president of the United States.

But we know better.

You told the New York Post that you did this first for your family, for your kids. Those are the same factors that led to my decision seven years ago. They also motivated men like NBC’s Al Roker, Jets coach Rex Ryan and former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to do the same thing – and it had nothing to do with political aspirations.

“It’s so much more important than that,” you told the Post.

We’ll leave that to history to decide.

Still, you knew that being morbidly obese (yes, that’s how you describe people who are 100 pounds or more over their ideal body weight) would be something that would ultimately kill you, probably as a relatively young man.

You don’t see a lot of 80-year-old obese people, do you?

And, at 50, with four wonderful children, you have a lot to live for and a lot of life ahead of you. Then there’s a possible future in Washington.

For a public person, a governor, these decisions are terribly personal. You had to consider the risks of doing nothing or having a fairly aggressive surgery like gastric bypass – or doing something a little less aggressive like the Lap-Band, also called the adjustable laparoscopic banding system.

In that procedure, doctors put a silicone tube, which is like a big rubber band, around the top of your stomach, restricting the amount of food you can take in. They fill that tube with saline, squeezing the size of the entry into the stomach even more so you can eat even less. They can also adjust the band to allow for more food.

This can result in the loss of at least 100 pounds within the first year to 18 months, but it does carry some risks. Some say you’ve already dropped 40 to 50 pounds, which would be typical eight to 10 weeks after the procedure.

But there will be haters.

Some will say that your lifestyle of excess over the years led you to this point, and that it’s lazy to go under the knife to resolve such a dramatic problem rather than bear down, hit the treadmill and do it the hard way.

Others will question why you decided to do the Lap-Band procedure rather than the permanent Roux-en-Y gastic bypass. Some people have had to remove the bands because they caused painful irritation and scar tissue in their stomachs. I had the Roux-en-Y procedure, which can be initially more dangerous but is often recommended for those who require dramatic weight loss in a shorter period of time.

And then there will be those who said you did all this just because you want to be president in 2016. A fat president wasn’t even a good look for William Howard Taft back in 1909.

Some or all that may be true, but really, governor, we know there’s a lot more to the story.

You did this to live.

You did this because 50 is just too young to drop dead of a heart attack, diabetes or a stroke.

You did this for your health. Not to mention that it would be kind of sad to get out-hustled in Iowa or New Hampshire or Florida by Hillary Clinton simply because you needed to stop and catch your breath on the campaign bus.

But most important, you did this so you would be around for your kids, your wife, your family, your state and your country.

And I say, more power to ya…

Looking like a winner!

President Obama, sick and tired of constantly being that 'adult in the room' and constantly giving things up to bullies and getting little to nothing in return, has turned a corner in his presidency. He's done with winning niceness points with schoolmarms and Miss Manners types. Now he's ready to kick some goddamn ass and by god he's doing it. Fuck being an adult in a room. Its time to be a politician in Washington.

Rightly, both morally and politically, President Obama has fixed himself in position and isn't moving or bending. He offers nothing. He commends nobody for doing their ordinary jobs. Republicans are surprised by his sudden burst of strength. So much so, they are backtracking, divided, and negotiating with themselves. Big business is scared. The GOP establishment is confused. Ted Cruz and the nutcase fringe that started all this have no idea how this ends. The one thing Republicans know is that they want out of this mess, in a way that isn't completely humiliating.

Let me be clear (as the President would say): The result will be humiliating. Republicans shutdown the government to stop ObamaCare. ObamaCare isn't stopped. They failed and that will be apparent just as soon as this ends. President Obama can bank this victory plus a few others: a divided, beaten GOP; a rump Speaker headed towards oblivion; and a perfect foil for the next six months, newly minted GOP leader Ted Cruz.

So, to finish this in a flourish, here is all President Obama needs to do next:

1. Throw the GOP a life jacket riddled with Smallpox.

No budget negotiations at all, but a minor concession would be appropriate. Something that includes a bit of a poison pill. My idea would be small corporate tax cut. They don't pay any taxes now anyway, so cutting them wouldn't cost us anything. But more importantly, it allows us to say that the GOP brought us to the brink of the default and shut down the government all on behalf of Big Corporations and Wall Street. That should be enough to allow a stupid face saving, piss off the Tea Party nutcases into turning on their own leadership, and get Big Business to keep some of their cash on the sidelines for a while.

2. Frame the reopening of the government and approval of the debt increase for the 2014 elections.

The last thing President Obama should do is give the kind of ridiculous speech he gave at the end of the 2011 mess. He was absolutely right to clear the decks among his senior staff after that fiasco. Instead, he should make it clear that this kind of governing can only be resolved by the American people next year. That only they can put a stop to this foolishness by throwing Republicans out. Repeat what he said the other day in Maryland: this is going to keep happening until the American people get rid of Republicans. He should offer absolutely no praise for Boehner or any of the Republicans who help re-open government. Instead, they should be told in no uncertain terms that the 2014 election begins NOW and their behavior is whats on the ballot.

Finally, I want to commend Washington Democrats and the White House for finally acting like a majority party that has the right to rule. When the Republican Party is down, you don't offer them the hand of the Good Samaratan. Instead, you see them lying in the gutter, you go ahead and kick them in the teeth and stomp repeatedly on their sternum. Then throw them a wet towelette and tell em 'Now clean yourself up.'"

Sainsbury's says it welcomes the debate about etiquette sparked by one of its checkout workers refusing to serve a customer who was talking on her phone.

In a letter seen by the BBC, it says it is ""pleased the story is leading to a wider debate on politeness"".

The incident happened at a branch in Crayford, south-east London.

Sainsbury's apologised to customer Jo Clarke and offered her a £10 voucher, but many observers have said it should have backed its worker.

Those adding their voice to the debate include Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said on his weekly Thursday radio phone-in that he had ""sneaking sympathy"" with the checkout worker, although he also understood why Sainsbury's had to apologise to its customer.

However, Sainsbury's is privately offering the worker involved its full support.

The company said in the letter setting out its policy: ""It is clear this story has touched a nerve as the weight of comment shows.

""However, we are also pleased that this specific story is leading to a wider debate on politeness.""

'Never wrong'

The Sainsbury's worker told Ms Clarke that it was company policy not to serve people who were occupied with their mobile phones, but that was denied at the time by the company.

But Sainsbury's said in its letter that it hoped ""the discussion this has created leads us all to think twice before reaching for our mobile phones and to recognise the great job the many thousands of sales assistants working across retail do"".

A number of retail experts said the company's original stance had been wrong.

One of them, Bryan Roberts, from the marketing experts Kantar, said: ""A lot of retailers are really annoyed with Sainsbury's over this. The customer is not always right - the customer is often wrong.""

The expression ""the customer is always right"" is generally attributed to the retail pioneer, Harry Selfridge, whose choice of site for his department store put Oxford Street on the map as a prime retail site.

He pressed it on customers and staff as a counterpoint to the legal term in common use at the time of ""buyer beware"", and not necessarily to put the customer solely in the driving seat.

Perhaps, to be assured of excellent service, shoppers should head for those companies employing the motto adopted by the founder of the Ritz: ""The customer is never wrong.""

Despite the apology and the voucher from Sainsbury's, Ms Clarke has said she will be transferring her custom to a nearby branch of the rival supermarket Waitrose."

Dionne Jr.: Religion challenges left and right,"Whenever I write sympathetically about religion, I get bombarded by tweets and notes from readers who normally agree with me but cannot abide by the idea that religious belief should be seen as intellectually serious.

And because I have written favorably about Pope Francis, I get more than my share of angry comments about the Catholic pedophilia scandal, which continues to haunt the church and troubles even its most loyal members.

Getting lambasted doesn’t bother me. On the contrary, citizens talking back to the purveyors of opinion is a glorious aspect of free speech. But my correspondents underscore the existence of a strong anti-religious current within a segment of the liberal community that is both an important political fact and a potential problem for progressives.

Here’s the challenge: Americans who are left-of-center are far more religiously diverse than their opponents on the conservative side. When it comes to matters of faith, liberals and Democrats have a far more complicated task of coalition management — although religion also raises some serious difficulties for the right.

Consider the findings of a survey (in which I was involved) released last month by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution. Using the answers to a wide variety of questions, we created a scale that broke our respondents into four groups: Religious conservatives, moderates, progressives and the nonreligious.

Overall, we found that 28 percent of Americans could be classified as religious conservatives, 38 percent as religious moderates and 19 percent as religious progressives. An additional 15 percent were nonreligious.

Among supporters of the two parties, Republicans were far more cohesive. The analysis found that 56 percent of Republicans were religious conservatives and 33 percent were religious moderates. Only 5 percent were religious progressives and just 6 percent were nonreligious.

Democrats, by contrast, were all over our analytical map: 28 percent were religious progressives, 13 percent were religious conservatives, 42 percent were religious moderates and 17 percent were nonreligious.

Among self-identified political liberals, the proportion of nonreligious — essentially, the folks sending me those messages — was even larger: 31 percent of liberals were nonreligious, 33 percent were religious progressives, 30 percent were religious moderates and 6 percent were religious conservatives.

Two things are thus true simultaneously: Nonreligious Americans are a very important part of the liberal constituency, yet the majority of liberals have ties to religion. The survey found that African Americans, who are deeply loyal to most liberal causes (and to the Democratic Party), are among the most religious people in the country. For liberalism to thrive, there needs to be acceptance and, even better, some respect across the boundaries of belief and nonbelief.

Yet if liberals face obstacles when it comes to faith, conservatives have problems of their own. The most serious? The religious conservatism that is such an important component of the right and the Republican Party is deeply unattractive to the rising generation of voters. In addition, many, across age groups, who are quite conservative in their theological views are rather progressive when it comes to economics, especially on issues such as raising the minimum wage.

The generation gap on religious commitment is stark. In the Silent Generation (Americans 68 and older), 47 percent are religious conservatives, while only 12 percent are religious progressives and 10 percent are nonbelievers. These figures are reversed for Millennials (Americans 33 and under), only 17 percent of whom are religious conservatives, while 23 percent are religious progressives and nearly as many, 22 percent, are nonreligious. (The remainder in both groups were moderates.)

These trends should disturb conservatives looking to the future, but they should also give pause to religious leaders. The association of religion, and particularly Christianity, with conservatism appears to be turning off substantial numbers of young Americans from faith.

On the other hand, a concern for social justice not only unites large numbers of believers across conservative-progressive lines but also appeals deeply to the more skeptical young. This is one reason Pope Francis’s eloquent emphasis on lifting up the poor, so visible during his recent trip to Brazil, could make him a transformational leader.

Conservatives need to pay attention to the power of justice and compassion. Otherwise, they will find their cause undercut, even within their religious base, by a refusal to grapple with the economic system’s unfairness. As for progressives, they would be foolish to push away religious allies who are instructed by scripture of the Almighty’s ambition to “loose the bonds of injustice” and “let the oppressed go free.”

Cardinals desperately short on quality blocking

Rams may need to rely on youth movement

San Francisco has ammo to be active in trade market%2C but cap is tight

Seattle defense may need some attention

A snapshot of each team's roster and considerations heading into free agency, which officially begins March 12 at 4 p.m. ET:

ARIZONA CARDINALS

Prominent free agents: CB Michael Adams, T D'Anthony Batiste, ILB Stewart Bradley (released), WR Early Doucet (released), OLB Quentin Groves, QB Brian Hoyer (restricted), S Rashad Johnson, ILB Paris Lenon, G Rich Ohrnberger, S James Sanders, RB/KR La'Rod Stephens-Howling, CB Greg Toler, RB Chris ""Beanie"" Wells (released), SS Adrian Wilson (released).

Issues: They're in excellent shape at wideout, otherwise the Cards are playing with anything but a full deck on offense. Reinforcing what may have been the league's worst line would theoretically improve the running game and give Kevin Kolb enough time to be an effective (and healthy) passer. The running game has been anything but reliable, hence Wells' release, and Ryan Williams will very likely have to ward off a challenger to start in 2013. New coach Bruce Arians is also sure to take a long look at the quarterbacks in the draft. The defense has the pieces to dominate but must adjust without departed coordinator Ray Horton and needs the offense to keep it on the sideline longer.

Our advice: It's actually not all doom and gloom on the O-line; tackle Levi Brown missed all of 2012 with a torn triceps, and underrated center Lyle Sendlein will be back from a knee injury. But the Cardinals haven't had a standout left tackle since Luis Sharpe moved with the team from St. Louis to Phoenix in 1988. If money can be freed, it would really be a boon to Arians' program — and potentially a franchise rookie quarterback, if not Kolb — to import a talent like Jake Long or Sebastian Vollmer. After that, add some young blood, let the chips fall where they may and re-assess the group in 2014. Defensively, Johnson seems ready for a bigger role and has earned a modest raise, but little tinkering is required.

ST. LOUIS RAMS

Prominent free agents: WR Danny Amendola, QB Kellen Clemens, S Craig Dahl, CB Bradley Fletcher, WR Brandon Gibson, LB/ST Mario Haggan, DE William Hayes, T Wayne Hunter (released), RB Steven Jackson, LB Rocky McIntosh, S Quintin Mikell (released), T Barry Richardson, WR Steve Smith, OL Rob Turner, OL Chris Williams, WR Titus Young (waived).

Issues: With Jackson, Gibson and Amendola all apparently on the way out, St. Louis will lose three of its four most productive players in terms of yards from scrimmage in 2012. Equally notable, Richardson and Turner were both 16-game starters last year. On defense, the Rams have a nice mix of young talent and players in their prime but could use help at tackle and safety, and there are myriad veteran options available at both spots.

Our advice: This franchise took a big step forward under new coach Jeff Fisher and GM Les Snead in Year 1. Armed with two more first-round picks in April's draft, there's no reason to go wild in free agency now — and St. Louis isn't really in position to do so, though Jackson's decision to void his contract does allow for possibilities. It seems like a no-brainer that Snead will pick a blocker early. We'd re-sign Turner, who's versatile and shouldn't cost much, and draft a replacement for Richardson. The young wideouts and backs already on the roster will have every opportunity to prove themselves. But a veteran player might help, perhaps receiver Braylon Edwards, a big body and good blocker who is familiar with offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. Given their pair of first rounders, it is worth noting the Rams are best positioned to make a run at restricted free agent wideout Victor Cruz, who will cost any potential suitor a Round 1 pick as compensation to pry him away from the New York Giants.

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS

Prominent free agents: K David Akers (released), G Leonard Davis, KR/WR Ted Ginn, FS Dashon Goldson, DL Ricky Jean-Francois, WR Randy Moss, NT Isaac Sopoaga, TE Delanie Walker.

Issues: Pffft. They're likely to have up to 15 draft picks once compensatories are allotted. Wideouts Mario Manningham and Kyle Williams, running back Kendall Hunter and linebacker Parys Haralson will return from injured reserve. Colin Kaepernick will be a year better. They've already spun off former starting quarterback Alex Smith and acquired tough-guy wideout Anquan Boldin in the trade market. The roster's already loaded, so a tight cap is of little concern. You won't find a team that wouldn't love to have these ""issues.""

Our advice: They need a new backup to fill Smith's spot, and Jim Harbaugh pupil Josh Johnson might be the perfect guy. He spent time on the roster last summer, won't hurt the cap and has a skill set that could make him a fairly capable facsimile of Kaepernick over time. Akers must also be replaced, but it will be a buyer's market for kickers. With Williams recovered, Ginn can go. Finding common ground with undervalued Walker would be very nice given the versatility he brings to the offense. A choice will probably have to be made between Sopoaga and Jean-Francois, and the decision to let Goldson walk has seemingly been made despite Harbaugh's recently stated belief that the all-pro deserved to be rewarded. Lastly, there's the Darrelle Revis question. The Niners have the ammunition to trade for the New York Jets all-pro corner and, if healthy, he'd certainly solidify a pass defense that was dissected throughout the playoffs. GM Trent Baalke would have to adjust the payroll to accommodate Revis, but don't you do that for the guy who could be the missing piece to a Super Bowl puzzle?

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS

Prominent free agents: DT Alan Branch, DL Jason Jones, CB Marcus Trufant, K Steven Hauschka, OLB Leroy Hill, K Ryan Longwell, OL Frank Omiyale.

Issues: Like the division rival 49ers, not many warts here. It's especially nice when your stud starting quarterback makes nary a blip on your cap, something Russell Wilson shares in common with Kaepernick. The defense will need repairs up front, especially after top pass rusher Chris Clemons tore up his knee in the playoffs.

Our advice: With slot man extraordinaire and part-time tailback Percy Harvin now in the fold, this offense appears more than formidable. The Harvin acquisition also saves GM John Schneider the hassle of pursuing Mike Wallace or Greg Jennings with megabucks offers. It's more imperative to get a stand-in/complement for Clemons anyway, and Seattle has already kicked the tires on John Abraham. Dwight Freeney and Osi Umenyiora also seem like natural fits. We'd get one of them for a year or two. Branch wants to return and Jones played well, too, but there are outside targets to mull if they depart. A dog like Richard Seymour would be great on the D-line, or an under-the-rader youngster like Desmond Bryant could also work. It's time to move on from troubled Hill, who won't be difficult to replace. If Hauschka doesn't come back, Seattle could upgrade with David Akers, Lawrence Tynes or Phil Dawson, kickers who are proven in bad weather. Aside from the veteran pass rushers, the draft can address many of these areas, though Schneider may also have to mine it for a nickelback and O-line depth..

""Late Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry was taken by ambulance to Nantucket Cottage Hospital, accompanied by her husband, Secretary of State John Kerry,"" John Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement. ""Once doctors had stabilized her condition, she was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, again accompanied by the Secretary. The family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has received and aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask for privacy at this time.""

Heinz Kerry was admitted into the emergency room at Nantucket Cottage Hospital after 3:30 p.m. Sunday, hospital spokesman Noah Brown said

Heinz Kerry arrived at the facility in critical condition, and remained that way early Sunday evening, although doctors had stabilized her, Brown said.

Brown said he could not immediately release any more details about the patient's condition or her illness.

Nantucket Police Lt. Jerry Adams said a call requesting medical aid was received just after 3:30 p.m. for a home on Hulbert Avenue, and an ambulance was dispatched. Online records show the property is connected to Heinz Kerry's family.

Heinz Kerry is the widow of former U.S. Senator John Heinz, heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune. She married John Kerry in 1995.

Doctors treated her for breast cancer in December 2009.

She previously has said she found in late September that year that she had cancer in her left breast after having her annual mammogram.

A month later, she underwent lumpectomies on both breasts at a Washington hospital after doctors also discovered what they thought was a benign growth on her right breast.

That diagnosis was initially confirmed in postoperative pathology, but two other doctors later found it to be malignant.

In November 2009, Heinz Kerry had another pair of lumpectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital.

John Kerry has been at the Nantucket home since returning from nearly two-week around-the-world diplomatic trip to the Mideast and Southeast Asia in the pre-dawn hours of July 3.

Before his wife's medical problem, he had planned to return to Washington on Monday and then co-host with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew high-level strategic and economic talks with senior Chinese officials on Wednesday and Thursday.

Kerry had also spoken of his desire to make his sixth trip to Israel as secretary starting at the end of the week. State Department officials said Kerry's schedule is now influx pending developments with his wife's health.

Actual improvements to Senate rules are coming out of this. We didn't get the big ones we were looking for—the real talking filibuster and flipping the burden—but we are not coming away empty-handed. It's now going to be easier to confirm judicial nominees, harder to kill legislation just by wasting time, there will be fewer points in the legislative process for hostage taking, and secret holds are gone forever.

We got Mitch McConnell to cave under duress. We got Mitch McConnell to agree to these changes because he was afraid that otherwise we would get even more. In other words, we got Senate Republicans to cave. That almost never happens on anything, but we just pulled it off. That is just hugely impressive.

We helped trigger the construction of a huge new advocacy coalition. We only got #2 to happen because there are now two coalitions (see here and here) advocating for real filibuster reform. This is pretty amazing, given that back in 2010 the first ""coalition"" meeting on filibuster reform consisted entirely of myself, David Waldman, and Darcy Burner. In short, while it wasn't long ago that filibuster reform was just bathrobe-wearing, Cheetos-munching, DFH blogger silliness, now it's the mainstream center-left position.

We are getting stronger. When we attempted filibuster reform two years ago, all we got was a ""gentleman's agreement"" between Reid and McConnell that accomplished exactly nothing. That's because two years ago we weren't powerful enough to scare McConnell into agreeing even to watered down reform. Now we are, and momentum is on our side.

The Daily Kos community played a foundational role in every step of this process. In the earliest days, we were the incubators of the idea that there should even be filibuster reform. Later on, we were instrumental in helping determine what specific reforms were needed, and also in bringing progressive groups together to push for these reforms. The rest of the way, as both a widely read blog and a grassroots activist community, we were essential in making sure filibuster reform was noticed by the public, the media and elected officials.

In short, we made change happen from scratch—how awesome is that? Further, every two years we will get another chance to build on these accomplishments, and the momentum for additional reform is unquestionably on our side.

I hope all 211,000 of you who took part in this fight feel excited and proud today, because in addition to being grateful to each and every one of you, that is exactly how I feel. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

Abortion bill requires abortions only in surgical centers%2C bans abortions after 20 weeks

House clears bill two weeks after Senate failed to meet deadline amid filibuster

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas House has approved new abortion limits in a second special session, less than two weeks after Senate Republicans failed to finish work on the bill amid a filibuster and raucous protests.

A final vote could be held as early as Friday in the Senate, where the measure died as the first special session expired. The House voted mostly along party lines Wednesday on what has become signature GOP legislation.

Lawmakers spent more than 10 hours debating it Tuesday, and Republicans rejected every attempt to amend the bill. Throngs of protesters were missing for Wednesday's mostly procedural vote after days of protests by supporters and opponents.

The bill requires doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, only allow abortions in surgical centers and ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Democrats and women's rights activists have protested the bill for weeks. The measure failed to win enough support during the regular session, then died in the first special session due to a 13-hour filibuster by state Sen. Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat.

Republican leaders, including Gov. Rick Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, are intent on passing it quickly through the Republican-controlled Legislature in a second special session. Democrats can do little but slow the bill down, attract as much attention as possible and lay the groundwork for a federal lawsuit to block it once it becomes law.

Davis' successful filibuster put the Texas bill in the spotlight of the national abortion debate. On Monday night, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee spoke to abortion rights opponents. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced a statewide bus tour Tuesday morning, dubbed Stand With Texas Women.

""It seems like every time women looked up from doing their laundry of helping children with their homework, the Texas Legislature is right there taking aim at them again,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""Over the past few years, more than 50 women's health centers have been shut down.""

Women from both parties who support abortion rights introduced a series of amendments to water down House Bill 2, hanging coat hangers on the front podium to symbolize illegal abortions, which they say will become more common if the law is enacted. Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, called for an exception to the 20-week ban in cases of rape and incest, but Laubenberg rejected the proposal.

An anti-abortion voting record is critical to winning Republican primaries in Texas. Texas Alliance for Life, a Christian group that maintains a scorecard on lawmakers, sent out messages on Twitter opposing each amendment, signaling how lawmakers should vote for a high score.

Supporters of the restrictions insist that they will improve the health care women receive by placing more stringent conditions on abortions. Laubenberg told the House on Tuesday that her bill would ensure that women get high-quality treatment while protecting ""babies"" after 20 weeks of gestation.

""What we're talking about today truly is about the health and safety of a woman who would undergo an abortion, but also, I want to point out, we are talking about an unborn child,"" she said.

Federal courts have ruled that states can regulate abortions but not to the extent to make them impossible to obtain. That hasn't stopped Republican-led legislatures in Texas and several other states from passing laws in recent years that test the legal limits.

Opponents of the Texas restrictions say they would effectively ban abortion in much of the nation's second most-populous state by causing the closure of 37 of its 42 abortion clinics.

Houston Rep. Sarah Davis, the only Republican opposed to the law, warned that the bill as written is unconstitutional and she offered an amendment to make it less stringent.

""I believe the bill as drafted will be a de facto ban on abortion,"" she said. ""No one wants to see abortions, it's a terrible way to end a pregnancy, but it is a constitutionally protected right.""

They also say the Texas restrictions and those passed by other states conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established that a woman has the right to get an abortion until her fetus could viably survive outside of the womb, which is generally at 22 to 24 weeks of the pregnancy.

It's unclear if the Texas restrictions could survive a court challenge. Federal courts have suspended aspects of the bill passed by other states. On Monday, a federal judge blocked enforcement of a Wisconsin abortion law requiring admitting privileges.

The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology oppose the bill, calling it unnecessary.

The Texas Department of Public Safety has more than doubled the number of troopers at the Capitol due to the rallies and marathon hearings, said Sen. Kevin Eltife, a Tyler Republican who oversees the Senate Administration Committee. He declined to reveal the exact number of troopers or how much the boost in security cost.

Lawmakers told the DPS they wanted plenty of troopers on the ground no matter the expense, he added."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/09/Senate-Hasnt-Sent-Immigration-Bill-to-House,2013-08-09 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Senate Hasn't Sent Immigration Bill to House,"At a White House press conference Friday afternoon, President Obama said he was “absolutely certain” the Senate amnesty bill would pass the House if it were brought to the floor for a vote. Obama said the Republican leadership should put the bill up for a vote. The problem is, the House doesn’t have the bill. The Senate still has not delivered its bill to the House for consideration.

In the days after the Senate passed its bill, House Ways and Means Chairman David Camp pointed out that the bill is unconstitutional, in its construction. The Senate bill raises revenue by creating new taxes and fees. According to the Constitution, however, legislation that raises revenue can only be introduced first in the House.

This creates a real dilemma for Senate backers of the bill. As my colleague Matt Boyle explained at the time:

When such a revenue-raising bill comes out of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, currently Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), can use a procedure called a “blue slip resolution” to automatically kill it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. Stockman has been promising to attempt to kill the Senate’s bill that way and, as such, Reid has refused to send it to the House, thereby protecting the bill from being “blue slipped.” The term “blue slip,” Stockman’s office noted in a release, comes from the blue color of the paper on which a resolution is printed that returns a Senate bill back to the Senate in these situations.

This is why supporters of the Senate bill are so eager to conference with the House. They need even a simple piece of legislation on immigration to get around the constitutional problem. Conferees could strip out all the language of the House bill and substitute the Senate provisions, and the resulting bill would be constitutional.

GOP Leadership isn’t blocking the House from voting on the Senate bill. The drafters of the original Senate bill are the ones blocking the House."

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visit site of immigration fast

Other administration officials have previously visited

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visited Friday with a group of protesters who are fasting in an effort to pressure Congress to pass an immigration bill.

The Obamas praised organizers Eliseo Medina and Dae Joong Yoon and thanked ""all of the fasters for their sacrifice and dedication, and told them that the country is behind them on immigration reform,"" according to a White House statement.

Obama's comments were inaudible to a pool of reporters.

The president said ""it is not a question of whether immigration reform will pass, but how soon,"" according to a White House statement. ""He said that the only thing standing in the way is politics, and it is the commitment to change from advocates like these brave fasters that will help pressure the House to finally act.""

The Obamas spoke for about a half-hour with ""individuals taking part in Fast for Families on the National Mall and offer their support for those who are fasting on behalf of immigration reform,"" according to an earlier White House statement.

The Democratic-run Senate passed an immigration bill earlier this year. The Republican-run House has not taken up the issue. Some Republicans object to a proposed pathway to citizenship for people who are already in the United States illegally, calling it amnesty for lawbreakers.

Rudy Lopez, who has been fasting for nine days, said demonstrators appreciated the president's visit.

""He shared his support and his commitment to keep pushing this (immigration bill) forward,"" said Lopez, a senior organizer with a group called the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. ""He also expressed his concern for our physical health.""

Lopez said he is doing fine, and ""we have good medical care.""

Vice President Biden has previously visited the site of the immigration fast, as have other top administration officials.

Earlier this week, Mrs. Obama tweeted out her support, saying: ""As families begin to gather for Thanksgiving, I'm thinking of the brave #Fast4Families immigration reform advocates. We're with you. -mo.""

At an immigration speech Friday in San Francisco, Obama said, ""Right now, I'm seeing brave advocates who have been fasting for two weeks in the shadow of the Capitol, sacrificing themselves in an effort to get Congress to act.""

The White House said that, in addition to Biden, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Cecilia Muñoz and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett have also visited the Fast for Families site in recent weeks.

Said the statement: ""Since Nov. 12, immigration activists comprising Fast for Families have abstained from all food except water and are calling for the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to take up action on comprehensive immigration reform."""

On Tuesday night, North Carolina state legislators attempted to push through a measure that would drastically restrict abortion in the state by attaching it onto a bill meant to ban Sharia law, a move that drew fire from pro-choice activists.



Maddow drew attention to another development going down in the state: the counties whose voting practices were protected by the federal government until the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act may soon be subject to big changes.

""The Voting Rights Act had stopped Republicans from going ahead with voter I.D. before,"" she said. ""Now they're going ahead with that,"" Maddow continued, ""but even beyond voter I.D., which they say they want to prevent voter fraud, they say they're planning to end same-day voter registration in North Carolina and they're planning to end early voting in the state of North Carolina and they're planning to end Sunday voting in North Carolina.

Revolutionary, high-speed multihulls made with futuristic technology were devised to appeal to a new generation and make the sport more exciting to watch, both from the shore and on TV. The Cup is often described as the ""Formula 1"" of sailing but organisers want it to be more like Nascar, with similar thrills and spills.

However, Simpson's death has brought renewed questions about the new designs amid continuing concerns over safety. BBC Sport looks at the issues.

The boats

Traditionally, the America's Cup has been sailed in sleek, single-hulled yachts with deep keels, competing head-to-head. But the slow, tactical nature of the racing was perhaps more for the sailing purist than any wider audience.

""The past America's Cups have been like watching paint dry,"" said Jimmy Spithill, skipper for defending champions Oracle.

The new breed of radical catamarans, called AC72s, were brought in by US software billionaire Larry Ellison and four-time America's Cup-winning skipper Russell Coutts after their Oracle team won the last Cup in 2010.

AC72 specifications Length: 22m (72.2ft)

Beam: 14m (45.9ft)

Weight: 5,900kg (13,000lbs)

Maximum draught: 4.4m (14ft)

Mast height: 40m (131ft)

Wing area: 260 sq m

Jib area: 80 sq m

Gennaker area: 320 sq m

Top speed: 45 knots

Crew: 11+1 guest

The twin-hulled carbon-fibre giants - unique but designed within certain parameters - are 72ft long with a mast 131ft high and solid ""wing sails"" to improve speed and stability. The wing enables the boats to race in anything from five to 30 knots, maximising the chances of racing on any given day - essential for TV.

Recent developments have seen ""foils"", which lift the hulls out of the water to make them go even faster, sometimes more than twice the speed of the wind and up to 45 knots (50mph).

In the America's Cup World Series - events held around the world in the build-up to the Cup - crews raced in AC45s, vessels similar to the Cup version but smaller to enable the sailors to practise while the 72s were being built. The nature of these boats means supreme fitness is at a premium among the sailors.

But the cutting-edge design brings with it a host of unknown factors.

""These America's Cup boats are new, they're very high powered and the loads on them are huge,"" said British Olympic sailing team chief Stephen Park.

""That brings with it the excitement they were looking for in the America's Cup but these boats are untrodden waters for sailing. There are a lot of unknowns and things being tested.""

Safety

To put Simpson's death in context, it is only the second death of an America's Cup sailor during training after Spain's Martin Wizner was killed when he was hit by a piece of broken equipment in 1999. No-one has died in an America's Cup race since its inception around the Isle of Wight in 1851.

quote I lost my closest friend of over 25 years, the friendliest, kindest man I have ever met. I cannot believe he is no longer with us

But the capsize of Artemis is the second major incident involving an AC72. Last October, the Oracle team flipped their boat, destroying the wing. No-one was hurt, but it added to concerns that the new design could, in some circumstances, be too powerful to control. Artemis also reported structural damage to its front beam last year.

Catamarans are inherently stable, despite having no keel, but when the wind causes them to lean and sail on one hull it is the skill of the sailors that keeps them from tipping. With the size, speed and power of these yachts, a split-second delay can take them past the point of no return.

In certain manoeuvres, the downwind hull can get buried in the water, causing the yacht to ""pitchpole"" or flip end-over-end.

""The harder you push the accelerator, the faster you go, but there's a chance you hit the wall,"" said Spithill recently.

With only two months to go before the action is set to begin, sailors and designers are still learning the nuances of the beasts. And while the Artemis accident occurred in unexceptional conditions - 18-20 knots of wind and flat seas - July and August in San Francisco will see bigger breezes.

Paul Cayard, Artemis chief and tactician, recently predicted a repeat of Oracle's capsize.

""It would be a miracle if we get through the summer without it happening to somebody [else],"" he said. ""We're going to start pushing harder, we are going to race and those type of boats - catamarans - tip over.""

For safety, sailors wear helmets, life vests and body armour and carry knives to cut themselves free from fallen rigging. They also receive regular training in underwater survival and wear small oxygen bottles in case of being trapped. Divers and doctors follow in support boats.

It is not clear yet what caused Artemis to flip and break up or what exactly happened to Simpson.

The format

The event is scheduled to begin with the Louis Vuitton Cup, the head-to-head challengers' series from 4 July-30 August. The winner of this will go on to race holders Oracle for the America's Cup, a best-of-17 race series from 7-21 September.

Schedule 4 July-4 Aug: Louis Vuitton Cup round robin

6-14 August: Louis Vuitton Cup semi-finals

17-30 August: LV Cup best-of-13 final

7-21 September: America's Cup best-of-17 final v Oracle

Originally, Coutts envisaged 14 challengers, but only three - Sweden's Artemis, Emirates Team New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa - plus Oracle have made it this far. Most dropped out because of soaring costs, thought to be about $100m per campaign. Others disagreed with the concept.

British businessman Sir Keith Mills withdrew his Team Origin when he first saw the plans for the AC72s, forcing Simpson, Iain Percy and Ben Ainslie to pursue their America's Cup ambitions with overseas outfits. Percy, Simpson's Olympic partner, is sailing team boss with Artemis, while four-time Olympic champion Ainslie is racing for Oracle before launching his own team BAR for the next Cup.

""Based on the specs I saw in 2010, I was very concerned and I expressed my concerns,"" said Mills. ""But the Americans were determined to go ahead with this type of sailing, which I fundamentally disagreed with.""

Organisers boast the 34th America's Cup will be the most accessible to on-shore spectators in the event's history. The compact course will be close to the shore, inside the Golden Gate Bridge, and between Alcatraz Island and the waterfront district near Fisherman's Wharf.

The TV coverage will be similarly revolutionary, with sailors wearing microphones, onboard cameras and real-time on-screen graphics to provide an instant and understandable view of the boats' positions on the racetrack.

The future

With the investigations still under way, the future is unclear.

Options range from safety tweaks, to delaying the start of the Louis Vuitton Cup, to the nuclear option of cancelling the whole thing. Luna Rossa boss Patrizio Bertelli is reportedly conferring with his team over whether to continue their campaign.

2007: Alinghi defends the Cup in Valencia

2010: US team Oracle wins a controversial edition with a wing-sailed trimaran

2013: British Olympian Andrew Simpson dies in training in San Francisco

Scrapping the 2013 Cup would cause a huge knock-on effect in terms of cost, jobs, logistics and the reputations of Ellison and Coutts, but America's Cup Event Authority chief executive Stephen Barclay admits nothing is out of the question.

""Nothing is off the table,"" he said. ""We need to know what happened.

""After a tragedy like this, there will be a full and careful evaluation and we will be ready to act on any of the lessons learned.""

If the Cup does go ahead, Artemis has a second AC72 which could be in action next month. Oracle also has a back-up boat, but Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa do not.

The winners of the America's Cup get to choose the boats, format and venue for the next event, and it seems likely the AC72 will be scrapped.

On the other hand, another America's Cup organising official said the AC72 represents progress in sailing.

""It's what these guys want to do,"" said regatta director Iain Murray. ""They want to take sailing to the next level and these boats are part of that platform."""

Wolf Blitzer Asks Tornado Survivor If She Thanked the Lord; Tells Him She’s an Atheist There was a moment of levity in Oklahoma Tuesday when CNN host Wolf Blitzer, concluding an interview with a woman named Rebecca and her 19-month-old son Anders who survived the devastating tornado, asked her if she thanked the Lord for a decision that saved her life. “I’m actually an atheist,” she replied, laughing. She added she wouldn’t blame other people for thanking the Lord, though. Rebecca left the house with Anders before it was destroyed by the tornado. She returned after it hit to see her husband Brian searching the remains of the home for her and their son, leading to a tearful reunion.

Update: Thanks to CS in AZ (among others) for pointing out the most irritating part of the exchange--Blitzer doesn't just make the off-hand ""You've gotta thank the lord, right?"" comment (which could be chalked up to one of those inane phrases that most of us say every day to random people we encounter, ala ""have a nice day""); when she failed to respond, he insisted on following it up with the more intrusive and insistent ""DO YOU thank him?""

I was half expecting him to keep going: ""DO ya? Huh? Do ya thank him? Huh? Huh? C'mon, do ya? Whatzamatter with you?""

Because perish the thought that she might not thank the lord for this bountiful gift that he's given to her entire community. Or, that is, the community that doesn't exist anymore..."

“It’s going to happen,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leading conservative voice in the House. “It’s not the end of the world.”

For weeks, President Obama has barnstormed the country, warning of the dire consequences of the cuts to military readiness, educators, air travel and first responders even as the White House acknowledges that some of the disruptions will take weeks to emerge.

The reverse side has gone unmentioned: Some of the most liberal members of Congress see the cuts as a rare opportunity to whittle down Pentagon spending. The poor are already shielded from the worst of the cuts, and the process could take pressure off the Democratic Party, at least in the short run, to tamper with Social Security and Medicare."

"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-newton-parent-trigger-weigand-20130603,0,7865288.column",2013-06-02 23:00:57,['Jim Newton Is The Former Editor At Large Of The Los Angeles Times.'],Newton: In a hurry to pull the ‘parent trigger’,"What’s happening at Weigand Avenue Elementary School in Watts is undeniably divisive and stressful. A slim majority of parents there, fed up with the lack of progress toward a satisfactory education for their children, signed petitions and exercised their right under California law to oust the principal.

It hardly needs saying that the principal, Irma Cobian, did not much appreciate the campaign. She sees it as the work of politically motivated interlopers and disaffected parents — “a personal vendetta met a political movement,” as she told me.

The parents behind the effort don’t view it that way. They contend that they’ve pushed for improvement, only to be met with brusque indifference. Meanwhile, test scores at the school have dropped, adding to the alarm. Just a few years ago, Weigand was on a slow but upward march — its API score rose from 643 to 717 over two years. Since Cobian’s arrival, those numbers have turned south, and the score for last year was down to 689.

By the numbers, Weigand is one of the worst-performing schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and that’s saying something. These parents describe their work as one of necessity, the requirement that they do what they can for their children.

Advertisement

So which is it? Is Weigand’s division the result of impetuous parents and outside forces, or an expression of principled disagreement over the future of the school? Is the fight over bureaucratic inertia or competing visions?

I would submit that although the dispute contains elements of all of those, it’s really about something else: The fight at Weigand is a contest between school authorities who believe change can only be accomplished over time against parents who have no time to waste. In that, it is emblematic of a fundamental collision that is playing out across California.

Take Cobian’s turnaround plan for the school. It’s full of ideas and principles, methods of engaging parents and determination to push teachers. But none of it is quick. Indeed, the ideas guiding the proposal are known as the “Six Principles for Gradual Improvement,” and the first of those states: “Expect improvement to be continual, gradual and incremental.”

Cobian is proud of that plan, and even some of the parents who are unhappy with her like many aspects of it. It relies heavily on fundamentals and stresses the importance of imparting knowledge, values and communication skills to the students.

Where it’s frustrating, though, is in the patience it demands. And it’s easy to understand why. Imagine being the parent of a second-grade student at the school. For the last several years, that student would have been enrolled in a struggling school that showed signs of getting worse. And the administration’s answer to that is a program for slow improvement. Will it come in time for that second-grader to get any benefit? No parent could be expected to be patient in the face of that record or that program.

None of that is a hypothetical to Llury Garcia. Her daughter is in second grade and has received considerable praise from her teachers. But Garcia worries. “They tell me she’s doing great, but I see something different,” she told me last week. Garcia is concerned about her little girl’s spelling, her mastery of reading. All parents worry, but Weigand’s record reinforces those concerns.

Moreover, Garcia is not alone. Parents of more than half of the school’s students signed a petition demanding Cobian’s firing. Under California’s “parent trigger” law, that was all it took to force that outcome, so Cobian will soon be out of work. Some of the school’s teachers are outraged, and some parents are dismayed. Cobian blames Parent Revolution, a community organizing group that helps parents band together to transform schools using the parent trigger law. Even the name of the group offends Cobian: “It’s a revolution. It’s bloody. There’s violence.”

Cobian would prefer a gentler system, an approach to reform that is less divisive, less confrontational. The trouble with that is that too many educators and administrators have tolerated failure for too long. They have allowed too many students — the vast majority of whom are poor — to complete their educations without being able to read or write or master the skills of a modern culture.

When school officials ask for more time, parents whose patience has been tested for too long are unwilling to give it. They will seize the authority they have in order to protect what they care about most: their children. Who can blame them?

As the controversy at Weigand reminds us, education reform may be painstaking, but childhood is fleeting.

The representatives -- all Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco -- sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown urging him to sign the bill if it reaches his desk.

The bill, known as the Trust Act, “establishes a bright line standard between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement” and would “continue California’s proud tradition of being a leader on smart and sensible policies,” the letter says.

The representatives said unnecessary deportations have “reduced the willingness of immigrant and non-immigrant crime victims and witnesses to cooperate with local law enforcement, and consequently has diminished public safety.”

Among the letter’s signatories are Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Mike Honda both of San Jose, and recently departed members of the state Legislature now in Washington such as Reps. Alan Lowenthal of Long Beach, Jared Huffman of San Rafael and Julia Brownley of Westlake Village.

The bill (AB 4), authored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), would limit local law enforcement’s role in working with federal authorities to begin deportation proceedings.

California congressional representatives had urged Brown to sign a previous version of the legislation last year, but the governor vetoed it over concerns it was too broad. It has since been amended to expand the types of crimes and misdemeanors that could trigger the deportation process.

The bill is now awaiting a vote on the Senate floor.

"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-beard-prison-hunger-strike-20130806,0,636927.story",2013-08-06 07:00:00,[],From the Archives: Hunger strike in California prisons is a gang power play,"A few hundred inmates are continuing to take part in a hunger strike in California prisons. Some prisoners claim this strike is about living conditions in the Security Housing Units, commonly called SHUs, which house some of the most dangerous inmates in California. Don’t be fooled. Many of those participating in the hunger strike are under extreme pressure to do so from violent prison gangs, which called the strike in an attempt to restore their ability to terrorize fellow prisoners, prison staff and communities throughout California.

I am concerned about the toll this hunger strike is taking on my staff, the inmates and their families. I am uneasy about what some inmates are telling my staff. Many say they want to resume eating but are afraid of the retaliation they will suffer at the hands of other inmates acting on orders from their gang leaders. In one prison, an inmate was assaulted because he refused to share his food with striking inmates. He suffered facial fractures and had to be hospitalized for several days.

For decades, California has had the most violent and sophisticated prison gangs in the nation. When gang violence exploded during the 1970s and 1980s, and crime rates around the state rose to record highs, state prisons felt the impact. Between 1970 and 1973, 11 employees of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation were slain by inmates, and many others were brutally assaulted.

After this turbulent and violent time, and in response to the growing threat of gangs, the corrections department created SHUs to safely house gang members and their associates while minimizing their influence on other prisoners. Restricting the gangs’ communication has limited their ability to engage in organized criminal activity and has saved lives both inside and outside prison walls.

There are SHUs at four prisons in California. At three of them — in Tehachapi, Corcoran and Folsom — there are outdoor-facing windows in the cells that allow for direct sunlight. At Pelican Bay, all SHU cells have skylights. In all of the facilities, inmates in the SHU have radios and color TVs with access to channels such as ESPN. They have weekly access to a law library and daily exercise time. Many have cellmates; they can earn degrees; they can send and receive letters; and their family and friends can visit them every weekend. SHU inmates receive the same meals and portions as general population inmates. This is not “solitary confinement,” in that prisoners can have visitors and, in many cases, interaction with other inmates.

Even so, we remain committed to improving our facilities and policies. The department has brought in outside experts to evaluate our gang-management strategies. Based on their recommendations, we implemented a new comprehensive gang-management strategy last fall.

The new strategy places an emphasis on documented gang-related behavior, something hunger strike leaders asked for in 2011. It also features enhanced due process, along with a step-down program aimed at inmates who want out of the SHU but don’t want out of their gangs. We no longer commit people to indeterminate placements in SHUs, in which the terms have no end dates. And we are committed to providing less-restrictive housing and more privileges for inmates who demonstrate their willingness to refrain from gang behavior.

Also, as part of the reforms implemented last year, we are conducting case-by-case reviews of inmates who had been previously given indeterminate terms in SHUs. To date, we have completed 399 reviews, and about 62% of those whose cases have been reviewed have been transferred, or are about to be transferred back into the general prison population. An additional 30% were placed in various phases of the step-down program, receiving more privileges and rehabilitative services.

The corrections department has done everything it committed to do following the hunger strike in 2011. Several months after that strike, California’s Office of the Inspector General, which is responsible for independent oversight of the department, issued a report confirming the department’s good-faith efforts.

So what is this really about? Some of the men who participated in the last hunger strike have since dropped out of the gangs for religious or personal reasons, and they said it best in recently filed court declarations. “Honestly, we did not care about human rights,” one inmate said about the 2011 hunger strike. “The objective was to get into the general population, or mainline, and start running our street regiments again.” Another described the hunger strike this way: “We knew we could tap big time support through this tactic, but we weren’t trying to improve the conditions in the SHU; we were trying to get out of the SHU to further our gang agenda on the mainline.”

It’s no different this time. The inmates calling the shots are leaders in four of the most violent and influential prison gangs in California: the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia and the Black Guerrilla Family. We’re talking about convicted murderers who are putting lives at risk to advance their own agenda of violence.

The leaders of these four gangs are directly responsible for at least five ruthless murders, 35 violent assaults, including stabbings, and they have racked up more than two dozen violations for possession of weapons and other contraband.

Brutal killers should not be glorified. This hunger strike is dangerous, disruptive and needs to end.

In trying to fill the three vacancies on the 11-member United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at once, Mr. Obama will be adopting a more aggressive nomination strategy. He will effectively be daring Republicans to find specific ground to filibuster all the nominees.

White House officials declined to say who Mr. Obama’s choices will be ahead of an announcement that could come this week, but leading contenders for the spots appear to include Cornelia T. L. Pillard, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center; David C. Frederick, who often represents consumers and investors at the Supreme Court; and Patricia Ann Millett, a veteran appeals lawyer in Washington. All three are experienced lawyers who would be unlikely to generate controversy individually.

Costing just around $140 million a few years ago, federal spending on the subsidy has exploded to $2.2 billion.

Created in 1984, under President Reagan, the program is funded by a tax on regular phone service. The program was intended to cover the high capital costs of running telephone lines to remote, rural areas. In 2008, however, the program was expanded, through bureaucratic rule-making, to include cell phones. Today, a number of companies offer “free” cell phones and cell phone service plans to low-income people on welfare or food stamps.

The program seems riddled with waste, however. The FCC recently admitted that an audit found almost 300,000 individuals with more than one subsidized phone. The Agency also testified to Congress that the top 5 companies offering phones and service couldn’t verify the eligibility of 41% of the recipients of the free phones.

The history of this program should caution those embracing a new phone subsidy contained in the “Gang of 8” immigration bill unveiled last week. The program, dubbed “MarcoPhones” by some commentators, would provide grants to people living within 100 miles of the border who “lack cellular service” to purchase satellite phones.

The proposal originated in legislation introduced by Sens. McCain and Kyl in 2011, in response to the murder of a rancher who lived in an area with weak cellular coverage. That proposal had very general eligibility criteria, but restricted funding to just $3 million over 2 years. The “Gang of 8” proposal, however, keeps the broad eligibility criteria, but removes any funding restriction.

The original federal program to provide telephone service to residents in rural areas was well-intentioned. Establishing a dedicated funding mechanism, however, enabled the program to continue long after its goal was achieved. The FCC is considering expanding the program even beyond cell phones to also subsidize broadband internet connections.

Government programs, left on their own, will always expand. The “MarcoPhone” program in the immigration bill is a test case. Applying very broad eligibility criteria with no funding restriction is a recipe for potential fraud and waste. It is a very small part of a large bill, but it could have very real long-term fiscal consequences.

The rule issued Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the time illegal immigrants are separated from their U.S. families while seeking legal status, officials said.

Beginning March 4, illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that time apart from an American spouse, child or parent would create “extreme hardship” can apply for a visa without leaving the United States. Once approved, applicants would be required to leave briefly in order to return to their native country and pick up their visa.

Sources said that the administration might expand the changes to include relatives of lawful permanent residents.

The change, first proposed in April, is the latest move by the administration to use executive powers to revise immigration procedures without Congress passing a law. In August, the Obama administration began a program to halt the deportation of young people brought to the U.S. unlawfully as children.

“This is a continuation of usurping Congress’ control over immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that supports tighter controls on immigration. “This waiver rule is a small piece of this broader effort to go around Congress.”

The new procedures could reduce a family’s time apart to one week in some cases, officials said. In recent years, a few relatives of U.S. citizens have been killed in violence in foreign countries while waiting for their applications to be resolved, a process that could take a year or longer.

“It’s going to be a better future for me,” said Analy Olivas, 21, of Claremont, who crossed the border illegally from Mexico with her family when she was 8 and eventually married a U.S. citizen. She didn’t think she could bear to be separated from her 4-year-old son, Naythan, for an extended period, adding: “If I kept on going through the process, I was going to have to leave the country. I wasn’t ready for it.”

“The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wait times will be “drastically reduced,” Mayorkas said.

The immigration agency does not provide applicants with a specific definition of “extreme hardship,” despite requests from legal aid organizations to clarify the phrase. The agency “looks at the totality of the applicant’s circumstances and any supporting evidence,” according to the final rule posted in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Immigration officials said they had no plans to add staff to process what could be a large number of new hardship-waiver applications. The agency received 24,780 such applications between September 2011 and October 2012.

Until now, officials said, many immigrants who might have sought legal status have not pursued a hardship waiver of strict U.S. immigration laws out of fear they would be rejected and stuck outside the country.

Someone who has overstayed a visa for more than six months is barred from reentering the U.S. for three years; those who overstay more than a year are barred for 10 years.

Many Mexicans applying for a visa must report to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, one of Mexico’s most violent cities. Fearful applicants often spend weeks in hiding while waiting for appointments with consular officials. U.S.-born spouses also must travel to Juarez for interviews to determine whether marriages are valid.

The wait proved too long for Luis Luna, who was born in Mexico but crossed illegally into Southern California last year. He married his U.S.-born high school sweetheart, but became desperate as weeks in Juarez turned to months. He was bullied by thugs, harassed by cops and witnessed several fatal shootings.

“The days were so long,” said Luna, who rented a $70-per-month room for several months while waiting for his visa to be processed. Luna, penniless and fearful, finally tried to reenter the U.S. by falsely claiming American citizenship with a Washington state driver’s license. His application was eventually rejected. He is now back in California.

The possibility of having to leave the country for Juarez long kept Andrea from applying for U.S. residency, even though she is married to an American citizen and her 4-year-old daughter is also a citizen. The 30-year-old, who lives in Orange, asked not to be further identified because she is in the country illegally.

“I’d rather have a wife without papers than a dead wife,” Andrea said her husband often told her.

Those whose hardship waiver applications were denied in the past will be eligible to apply again under the new rule, officials said. Family members who have been in deportation proceedings that were suspended will also qualify. But someone who has been deported before, or is facing a final deportation order, is not eligible.

Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman hailed the end of what he called a “totally crazy system.”

“It’s going to keep families together who otherwise would have to go out of the country and sometimes wait over a year, separated,” Shusterman said.

Jessica Dominguez, an immigration attorney whose clients are mostly from Mexico and Central America, said Latinos in Southern California were celebrating the change.

“This is going to affect thousands of families,” Dominguez said.

The Senate has provided a bipartisan bill, and the House is working on reform. The key issues are border security and a legal pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million who are here illegally.

The political reasons for the House to negotiate a deal are many. A recent Gallup poll showed that 87% of Americans support comprehensive reform that includes a pathway to citizenship. Moreover, growing numbers of Latino voters in key states turned out in historic numbers for Obama in last year’s election, which strongly suggests that, in the long run, Republicans need to address this constituency or continue to lose votes.

However, Speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican’s point man in the House, doesn’t have the luxury of operating in the long term. The conservative bloc of House Republicans is digging in against reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, and with what promises to be a bloody spending fight with Democrats looming, the speaker needs to strengthen his position with his conference.

It’s no wonder the speaker has instructed his committee chairmen to send up smaller, incremental bills for consideration, with a final decision on the path forward to come this fall.

Regardless of what Boehner and the committee chairmen come up with, most of the millions of unauthorized immigrants here now will almost surely stay because it is expensive and time-consuming to deport them. The immigration enforcement system is currently funded to deport roughly 400,000 immigrants a year, funding that’s unlikely to increase in difficult budgetary times, and it can take years to get many cases in front of immigration judges.

In part for those reasons, the Department of Homeland Security does not treat all deportations equally. In recent years, the agency has expanded its use of prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement, focusing on recent border crossings and public safety threats. Today, deportations of immigrants with strong connections to the U.S. are unlikely.

Indeed, prosecutorial discretion is a guiding principle of this administration’s immigration enforcement policy. With it, the administration has moved immigration enforcement from an ad hoc system in which individuals are removed indiscriminately to one that prioritizes criminals, recent border crossers and fugitives. In 2012, 96% of all removals were based on these priorities. Opponents of the policy call it amnesty, but with limited resources, it’s obvious why an agency charged with protecting the homeland is focusing its deportation efforts on national security and public safety.

For Obama, expanding prosecutorial discretion in deportations has been good policy and politics. It might just be the trump card he needs to bring House Republicans to the negotiating table.

Last summer, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which established the first program in which a subset of those here illegally could come forward and register with the government. If you were brought here as a child, are currently in school or the military and have no criminal record, you can get protection from deportation and you can petition for work authorization.

This program, aimed at so-called Dreamers, triggered a wave of enthusiasm in the Latino community, and many political analysts believe it helped the president weather 50% disapproval ratings last summer and win a historic 75% of the Latino vote in November. Nearly 520,000 people have received relief under this program since it was announced.

Now the president should turn again to this playbook and expand the program to other sympathetic categories of immigrants, such as those with a longtime presence in the United States or those with U.S.-citizen family members. The legal parameters and operational protocols have been established, and because this program, like the original Deferred Action program, would be funded from immigrants’ fees, it would not require a congressional appropriation. An expanded Deferred Action program could be up and running within weeks.

Of course, those committed to defeating reform would trot out the tired criticism that the president doesn’t enforce the laws on the books. They conveniently forget that both parties share the blame for the current system, and they ignore the record-low estimates of border crossing attempts and the record-high number of deportations. (A recent Pew Hispanic Center analysis found net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero in recent years.) Nothing the administration does would change their minds.

It is a near-certainty that expansion of prosecutorial discretion will occur if the House defeats all reform efforts or the House and Senate can’t reach an agreement. Perhaps the president can force negotiations by reminding critics that, in the absence of real reform, a president — any party’s president — still has to govern. For Boehner and the House GOP, the alternative to negotiating would be expanding “amnesty” without any of the security and business enhancements that the Republicans want and the nation desperately needs.

If the president acts boldly, he might be able to wrest a bill from Congress that could establish his legacy and, more important, secure the real immigration policy changes this country needs.

Wal-Mart has attracted controversy for decades: Its supporters laud its low prices and market efficiencies, while its opponents charge that the company exploits workers, destroys local economies and pollutes the environment. Now, despite warnings from the retailer that it would reconsider its plans to open three stores in Washington, the D.C. Council has passed a living-wage bill that would require Wal-Mart to pay its workers here at least $12.50 per hour. Let’s examine a few of these impressions about the world’s largest retailer.

1. Only lower-income people shop at Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart sells lots of cheap stuff, so it’s no surprise that low- and middle-income shoppers are the store’s most regular customers. However, wealthier people are among the more than 60 percent of Americans who shop at Wal-Mart each month. A 2005 Pew Research Center survey found that more than three-quarters of respondents from households earning more than $75,000 a year thought Wal-Mart was a good place to shop, and nearly 80 percent of them had shopped at Wal-Mart in the previous year. Of customers in this income group, 38 percent described themselves as regular Wal-Mart shoppers.

2. Critics just want to unionize Wal-Mart workers.

Most of the efforts to improve working conditions and compensation at Wal-Mart are led by union-funded groups that have been branded as allies of Big Labor seeking only to line their pockets with more union dues. But practically, none of these efforts has focused on formally unionizing Wal-Mart’s unorganized domestic workforce.

Instead, as early as 2005, groups such as Walmart Watch and Wake Up Walmart waged a largely successful campaign focusing not on Wal-Mart workers’ union status but on their compensation and benefits. A year after Walmart Watch was founded, the retail giant lowered premiums on its health insurance policies and allowed part-time workers to obtain medical coverage for their children. The newer group Our Walmart has coordinated recent worker strikes in a similar attempt to put pressure on the retailer in the court of public opinion, but still explicitly says that it does not intend to represent Wal-Mart workers in formal negotiations with their employer.

3. Wal-Mart is great for low-income Americans.

Low-income shoppers need low prices because the manufacturing jobs with living wages that might have sustained them in earlier generations have been moved to sweatshops overseas, leaving poorly paid service jobs in their wake. Wal-Mart’s low-income customers thus have more in common with foreign workers than they may realize: Both are caught in a global economy that has discounted their labor in the name of cheap consumption.

Prioritizing consumption (what we pay for goods) over production (what workers earn for making goods) means that even low-income families whose economic futures have been jeopardized by the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs can see Wal-Mart as a savior, not a villain. Yet the retail giant’s genius lies in camouflaging its exploitation in terms that frame its relentless cost-cutting as a kind of benevolence. For example, the company in 2006 declared itself “a lifeline” for millions of Americans facing harsh and uncertain economic times, adding that “perhaps more than any single company in America, Walmart is providing the opportunity for a better life for poor and working families.” Still, even if Wal-Mart’s low prices help low-income Americans make ends meet at the cash register, the low wages offered by Wal-Mart (and other comparable retail service jobs) do little to help low-income families shoulder the burden of other rising costs, such as health care and housing.

4. Wal-Mart is bad for the environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly sued Wal-Mart for faulty stormwater management and illegally dumping hazardous chemicals and pesticides at its retail sites, among other offenses. As recently as May, for instance, Wal-Mart agreed to pay nearly $82 million in fines for violating environmental regulations in California and Missouri.

But the truth about the chain’s environmental record is more complex, simply because Wal-Mart has unmatched power to promote change on the consumption end. The company is good at lowering prices, and it turns out that many forms of conservation are also good business. When something helps the bottom line — be it developing more fuel-efficient trucks or demanding that suppliers develop lighter, low-waste packaging — conservation measures are a no-brainer. Moreover, consumer blocs seeking environmentally friendly products can create changes that ripple throughout the food and grocery industry, given Wal-Mart’s unparalleled market clout. When the retailer announced in 2008 that its store brand of milk would come from cows not treated with synthetic hormones, it credited consumer demand. The intense environmental scrutiny on Wal-Mart has also led the company to pursue additional sustainability measures. Wal-Mart’s most recent Global Responsibility Report notes that its stores and distribution centers drew more than one-fifth of their electricity from renewable sources.

5. Washington’s living-wage bill shows that communities can stand up to Wal-Mart.

It’s true that living-wage ordinances like the one the D.C. Council passed recently can potentially boost wages for the employees of large retailers. But such legislation is frequently defeated or vetoed, or struck down in federal court. For example, in 2006, Chicago’s city council passed a measure similar to D.C.’s that required big-box retailers to pay well above minimum wage, and to spend additional money on benefits. Less than two months after it passed, Mayor Richard Daley vetoed it, citing the promise of economic development that Wal-Mart could offer some of Chicago’s poorest neighborhoods.

Similarly, the Maryland Senate approved legislation in 2005 that required large employers to spend a set portion of their payroll on health benefits or contribute to state Medicaid coffers. (Although not mentioned by name, Wal-Mart was effectively the bill’s only target.) Then-Gov. Bob Ehrlich promptly vetoed the measure — and even after the state Senate overturned his veto, the legislation was found illegal in federal courts.

As Wal-Mart attempts to open stores in urban areas, challenging the world’s largest retailer requires more than legislation. New York City, for instance, has successfully resisted company’s attempts to enter Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn. Not only have city council members been opposed to the retailer’s advances, they’ve been supported by relatively strong displays of union clout signaling that a long, protracted battle awaits. Local governments are probably more effective in keeping out Wal-Mart than they are in garnering concessions on wages and benefits.

The Caller analysis of White House visitor logs showed former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman visited the White House at least 157 times under the Obama administration.

Even Attorney General Eric Holder, one of Obama's closest allies, visited only 62 times according to the records.

The records may not reflect every single visit, as some officials do not have to sign in every time they come to the White House.

But they could lend weight to concerns voiced by lawmakers at a hearing last week about the frequency of Shulman's White House contact. During the time period when the IRS was singling out Tea Party and other groups for extra vetting -- as they applied for tax-exempt status -- Shulman visited the White House 118 times.

Asked to explain the visits, Shulman gave lawmakers a list of possible reasons.

""The Easter Egg roll with my kids ... questions about the administratibility of tax policy ... our budget, us helping the Department of Education streamline application processes for financial aid,"" he said.

According to the Caller analysis, no other top official logged more than 100 visits.

The official with the next-highest number of visits -- close to 90 -- was Rebecca Blank, former deputy secretary and now acting secretary of the Commerce Department. Next in line was Thomas Perez, a top Justice Department official who has since been nominated to lead the Labor Department.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner each logged fewer than 50 visits.

Former IRS officials have testified that the scrutiny of conservative groups, while inappropriate, was not politically motivated."

1.) You basically have to be willing to devote your life to journalism if you want to break in. Treat it like it's medical school or law school.

2.) When interviewing for a job, tell the editor how you love to report. How your passion is gathering information. Do not mention how you want to be a writer, use the word ""prose,"" or that deep down you have a sinking suspicion you are the next Norman Mailer.

3.) Be prepared to do a lot of things for free. This sucks, and it's unfair, and it gives rich kids an edge. But it's also the reality.

4.) When writing for a mass audience, put a fact in every sentence.

5.) Also, keep the stories simple and to the point, at least at first.

6.) You should have a blog and be following journalists you like on Twitter.

7.) If there's a publication you want to work for or write for, cold call the editors and/or email them. This can work.

8) By the second sentence of a pitch, the entirety of the story should be explained. (In other words, if you can't come up with a rough headline for your story idea, it's going to be a challenge to get it published.)

9) Mainly you really have to love writing and reporting. Like it's more important to you than anything else in your life--family, friends, social life, whatever.

10) Learn to embrace rejection as part of the gig. Keep writing/pitching/reading."

Here's an excerpt from an August 6 report in the Arizona Republic (http://www.azcentral.com/...):



Obama foes at one point sang, ""Bye-Bye Black Sheep,"" a derogatory reference to the president's skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!""

Bye-Bye black sheep? I think those wingnuts got their nursery rhymes mixed up. I believe they were referencing the line that goes ""Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?"" Perhaps they meant to chant ""Bye-bye black bird?"" Those are the words to a song that's been around for decades. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the fans at the University of Kentucky's home basketball games would sing, ""Bye-Bye, Blackbird"" when a black player on the opposing team fouled out. It's a damned shame those tools in Phoenix were so dumb and hateful they couldn't even get their racist chants straight.

And please note the language in the sign held by Ms. Bartram. Sounds pretty racist and anti-Muslim doesn't it? But check out this quote from her later in the story:



“Obama is ruining American values. He is ruining the Constitution. He needs to go back to where he came from because obviously, he is a liar,” she said. “I am not racist. I am part Indian. Obama’s half Black, half White.”

A liar who needs to go back where he came from? Ruining the Constitution? ""I am not a racist,"" she said. I guess in her narrow mind, nobody who is part Indian can be full racist and that you can't practice racism against the President because he's half white. Sadly, this ignorant young woman is only 17. Some say America's future is in good hands, but I'm not so sure. One can only hope.

And finally, there was this tidbit from the Republic's story:



Judy Burris said that she blames Obama for racism in America reaching heights not seen since the 1960s Civil-Rights Era. “We have gone back so many years,” she said. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

Say what? She hates President Obama and blames him for American racism?! That's is such the Republican way: Blaming others for the evil and hatred you cultivate and perpetrate. Sad.

It's reprehensible that an American President has to endure the disrespect and hate that Barack Obama sees daily. I don't know for sure, but I don't think people in South Africa dissed Nelson Mandela this much when he became that formerly Apartheid nation's first black President in 1994.

You'd like to think that if for no other reason than the office he holds, the President of the United States of America would be immune from such repugnant racist attacks, but he's not. In fact, this bold ignorance makes it clear to me why some refer to our country as ""AmeriKKKa.""

I want to believe we're better than that, but when bigots openly taunt our President with racist epithets and freely give their names for attribution with those vile statements like those in the Arizona Republic I just don't know. Our nation is still very much a racist nation. Sigh."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/07/barney-frank-wants-another-crack-at-congress/,2013-01-07 00:00:00,['Barnini Chakraborty'],Barney Frank crafts return to Congress -- days after retiring,"Barney Frank just can't seem to stay away from Congress.

One day after retiring as a 16-term Democratic representative from Massachusetts, Frank announced that he had asked Gov. Deval Patrick to send him back to D.C. – this time as in interim senator to fill the seat of Sen. John Kerry, who was nominated for secretary of state.

That doesn’t mean the colorful congressman will get the gig, though. Patrick says that while Frank would make a “great” interim senator, it’s not a done deal and that he hasn't made his final decision yet.

Asked by reporters if he would have preferred Frank keep his conversation with him private, the governor started laughing.

“Does it matter in the case of Congressman Frank what I would have preferred?” Patrick asked.

State law requires the governor appoint a temporary successor if and when Kerry is confirmed by the Senate. A special election would then be held between 145 to 160 days after the appointment. The interim senator would only serve a few months but that’s all the time Frank says he’ll need to get what he wants done.

“A few weeks ago, I said I wasn’t interested,” Frank said in a statement. “It was kind of like you’re about to graduate, and they said, ‘You gotta go to summer school.’ But (the fiscal cliff deal) now means that February, March and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history.”

Frank helped lead a regulatory crackdown after the financial crisis and scored a huge legislative victory with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The law, which was passed in part to respond to the crisis with the markets, has reshaped the financial landscape of the country. Frank has also been an outspoken advocate for affordable housing and has championed for consumer rights.

In the next few months, Republicans and Democrats will be going head-to-head in a series of fiscal fights. The new Congress will face three major issues before late March: the debt ceiling debate in late February, massive across-the-board federal spending cuts known as sequestration by March 1 and the need to pass a budget bill by March 27. Frank’s presence could help the Obama administration during those negotiations.

Frank also has spoken out against former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel after it became clear he would be Obama's pick for defense secretary -- raising the question of whether Frank might want to log a vote against Hagel from the Senate. Frank, though, scaled back his opposition Monday. Frank told The Boston Globe he “was hoping the president wouldn’t nominate him” but said he would look past anti-gay comments Hagel made in the late ‘90s.

Frank was the first openly gay elected official to serve as a U.S. representative and has pushed hard to advance gay rights.

“As much as I regret what Hagel said, and resent what he said, the question now is going to be Afghanistan and scaling back the military. In terms of the policy stuff, if he would be rejected (by the Senate), it would be a setback for those things,” Frank said.

If Frank is tapped, he will be working on a tight timetable. Typically, interim senators aren’t remembered for their lasting contributions. Three recent short-term senators, Ted Kaufman of Delaware, Roland Burris of Illinois, and Paul Kirk of Massachusetts, stayed barely long enough to get their members pins. Kirk, though, had the politically important duty of voting for the Affordable Care Act for the Democrats.

Kaufman, 73, was picked to fill Vice President Biden's vacant Senate seat in 2009 and in an interview he said that at his age, the interim Senate appointment was more about serving out the term than effecting any great political change.

And then there was Burris. He was tapped by former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for Obama's former seat, a decision that fueled allegations that the governor had tried to get favors in exchange for the appointment. Burris decided not to run for the seat.

Golden in the fading light, the den was overflowing with stacks of videotapes, dusty transcripts, books and photographs.

“This used to be a really serene guest room with nothing in it, and now this is all Ann,” said Ms. Taylor, a veteran actress, referring to Ann W. Richards, the former governor of Texas. “All Ann. These papers are about Ann. These boxes are all full of Ann videos. These are speeches, pre- and post-governor. These are Larry King transcripts.

“I’m not sure what this is.” She paused before yet another pile, the raw material for what became her first play (and turned this guest room into an office). “Oh. Those are my transcripts of speeches that I have no written text for.” She sighed. “I can no longer organize it. I’m past that point.”

As she would be the first to admit, the 70-year-old Ms. Taylor is obsessed with Richards, a woman she met only once, when the gossip columnist Liz Smith insisted that the actress join them for lunch in 2004 at Le Cirque. She has spent the better part of four years studying every aspect of Richards’s life, interviewing her friends, her staff members and her four children, reviewing 150 hours of filmed appearances, listening to tapes of speech-writing sessions and absorbing the off-color candor and bawdy humor that made Richards anything but your average politician — a personality as suited for the stage as for “Meet the Press.”"

The folly of secession, c1861, Currier & Ives

Like the die-hards of the racist South a century and a half ago, who would destroy the union before giving up their slaves, so would these people burn down the place, sink the ship.

At least let’s name this for what it is, sabotage of the democratic process. Secession by another means. And let’s be clear about where such reckless ambition leads. As surely as night must follow day, the alternative to democracy is worse.

It was Newt Gingrich who twenty years ago spearheaded the right-wing’s virulent crusade against the norms of democratic government. As Speaker of the House he twice brought about shutdowns of the federal government once, believe it or not, because he felt snubbed after riding on Air Force One with President Clinton and had to leave by the backdoor. It was also Newt Gingrich, speaker Gingrich, who was caught lying to congressional investigators looking into charges of his ethical wrongdoing. His colleagues voted overwhelmingly, 395 to 28, to reprimand him. Pressure from his own party then prompted him to resign. Yet even after his flame out, even after his recent bizarre race for the presidency bankrolled with money from admiring oligarchs, even after new allegations about his secret fundraising for right-wing candidates, Gingrich remains the darling of a fawning amnesic media.



In his recent essay, "" On the Sabotage of Democracy "" Bill Moyers, who I often think of as the conscience of America, calls out the forces who are trying to demolish democracy, and likens this shut-down to the time this nation was torn asunder by the Civil War.He is blunt in conclusion.In the essay he calls out the lies told by Rep. Steve King, Fox and Friends, Rush Limbaugh, and hones in on Newt Gingrich, reminding us:Thank you Bill Moyers.

I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what’s going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.

What’s going to happen now? We’ve already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect Lavabit as an American company.

This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.

Sincerely,

Ladar Levison

Ontario Superior Court Justice Charles Hackland rendered a decision nearly a year ago ordering Ford to abdicate in light of his violation of the Toronto Municipal Conflict of Interest Act and related actions that followed.

“I declare the seat of the respondent, Robert Ford, on Toronto City Council, vacant,” Hackland concluded in a Nov. 26, 2012 decision that garnered much press in Toronto, but has been little cited in the U.S.

According to court papers published in the Toronto Star, the story centers upon a lawsuit filed by Paul Magder, a Toronto voter, related to an August 25, 2010 report by the city’s Integrity Commissioner, in which she found Ford, “used the City of Toronto logo, his status as a City Councillor, and City of Toronto resources to solicit funds for a private football foundation he created in his name.""

Specifically, lobbyists, clients of lobbyists and a corporation that does work for the city donated $3,150 to the Rob Ford Football Foundation. In the report, the Integrity Commissioner recommended the City Council order Ford pay the money back.

More On This... Toronto Mayor Ford once left debate early to coach football — then reportedly had buses pulled off route to shuttle team

The City Council initially approved the report the same day it was filed. But it then reconsidered the matter and held a fateful second vote.

Council Speaker Sandra Bussin asked Ford prior to the vote, according to Hackland’s decision, “This matter deals with an issue regarding your conduct. Do you intend to declare a conflict? You are voting? Okay.”

Ford then voted against his having to make restitution, but the matter carried the council, anyway. Ford not only never paid the money back to the donors, but he also ignored letters the integrity commissioner sent him on Aug. 31, 2010, Sept. 15, 2010, May 10, 2011, June 7, 2011 and July 4, 2011 reminding him to do so.

The Council revisited it all on Feb. 7, 2012, at which time Ford said, “To ask that I pay it out of my own pocket personally, there is just, there is no sense to this. The money is gone; the money has been spent on football equipment.”

After Ford’s explanation, the council took up a motion to nix its earlier order he repay the money. Again, Ford voted on the measure, even though he had financial interest in its result. The motion carried 22-to-12 in his favor.

Magder then filed suit.

Ford – in foreshadowing a pattern re-emerging in 2013 – told the court that not only was the donation so small as to be unworthy of discussion, but he had run afoul of the city conflict of interest regulations accidentally.

Hackland didn’t buy any of it, and wrote in his decision, “In view of the (Ford’s) leadership role in ensuring integrity in municipal government, it is difficult to accept an error in judgment (defense) based essentially on a stubborn sense of entitlement (concerning his football foundation) and a dismissive and confrontational attitude to the Integrity Commissioner and the Code of Conduct.” He then ordered him removed from office.

But Ford lived to fight another day, taking the matter up with an appellate court. Then – and in January – the court ruled in Ford’s favor, not so much saying he was justified in any of his actions, but that the City Council had overstepped its jurisdiction in voting to force him to repay the $3,150. Since the vote should never have occurred, the appellate court ruled the fact that Ford had voted on the motion didn’t matter.

“The court let Rob Ford off on a technicality,” Clayton Ruby, the lawyer who filed the case for Magder, reportedly said after the decision, while Ford, for his part, addressed the media and referred to it all as, “very humbling.”

Today, the White House Vistor’s Office sent out an email to interested parties that announces the suspension of all White House Tours due to the sequester cuts.

ATTN Interested Parties, Due to staffing reductions resulting from sequestration, we regret to inform you that White House Tours will be canceled effective Saturday, March 9, 2013 until further notice. Unfortunately, we will not be able to reschedule affected tours. We very much regret having to take this action, particularly during the popular Spring touring season. For updates regarding this situation, please contact the White House Visitors Office 24 Hour Hotline at (202) XXX-XXXX. Sincerely, White House Visitors Office

Congressman Gohmert is a history enthusiast who frequently gives extended tours of the capitol in the evenings to his constituents. Many tourists come to D.C. this time of year on vacation, specifically to visit the Cherry Blossoms, projected to bloom at the end of the month. These tourists will not be able to take a tour of the White House, and if they scheduled a tour, the tour is cancelled.

The rules committee in the House is currently deciding whether or not they will allow amendments to be included in the CR. If they decide to allow amendments, Gohmert will attach his amendment.

Gohmert’s amendment reads: None of the funds made available by a division of this Act may be used to transport the President to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.

According to ObamaGolfCounter.com, the president has played 115 rounds of golf since taking office. Townhall’s Heather Ginsberg estimates that 341 furloughed jobs could have been saved had the money not been spent of golf trips."

Washington (CNN) – Vice President Joe Biden honored firefighters and public safety officers Thursday evening, telling them “you are always, always there.”

Biden, who formerly served as chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus while in the Senate, also took a moment to tease the friendly crowd about his presidential ambitions, joking that the press “likes to point out that I ran for president twice but I never made it.”

“I want you to know that in 2004, I made it,” Biden said. “I’m a president emeritus of the Delaware Volunteer Fire Association. So I have made it to the presidency.”

The vice president also touted a forthcoming initiative from the Obama administration aimed at improving access to federal funding for families of fallen public safety officers.

“Families of fallen public safety officers have had to wait much, much, much too long for federal benefits that all of us at that table and me have fought so hard to make sure existed,” Biden said.

“That’s why I’m proud to tell you that on Monday – I don’t want to steal his thunder – but a guy’s been working around the clock to fix this. The Attorney General of the United States will have an announcement to make fixing that problem, finally,” Biden said.

Among the many groups of public safety officers to whom Biden gave personalized shout outs were the first responders who battled the deadly blaze caused by a fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.

“When the call went out, volunteers went out. ... They suited up and they headed out, put on their equipment and they jumped. They jumped into the fray,” Biden said.

“Even then, some of the fire trucks ablaze, even then in the midst of the chaos, they held their ground. They contained the blaze within three hours. They never quit. They never quit. They never quit.”

Nine of those volunteer first responders were killed by the blast."

Bush,"DALLAS -- President Obama is in the heart of George W. Bush country to pay tribute to the former president he describes as “concerned about all people in America, not just those who voted Republican.”

Obama kicked off his Texas visit at a fundraiser where he urged wealthy donors to help elect Democrats for the good of the country, but Obama was complimentary of his Republican predecessor as he prepared to attend the opening of the Bush presidential library on Thursday.

“One of the things I will insist upon is, whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people,” Obama told the donors late Wednesday.

That’s far cry from Obama’s past pronouncements about Bush, whom he has blamed for everything from running a “dumb” war in Iraq to crashing the economy. In his first term, Obama routinely began the story of his administration by enumerating the problems he inherited from Bush.

The passage of time has softened the criticism. As White House Press Secretary Jay Carney puts it, “there’s a special bond between those who have served their country from the Oval Office. There’s no job like it.”

Obama takes on one of the tougher parts of that job later in the day, when he speaks at a memorial service for people killed and injured in last week’s deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas.

First Lady Michelle Obama will join him as he speaks with families of victims, a somber duty Obama performed this winter after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and again last week after the Boston Marathon bombing.

In his fifth year in office, Obama speaks more gently of the man who did that job just before him. Speaking to fellow Democrats on Wednesday night, Obama said that the Democratic Party “doesn’t always get it right.”

Their feelings of concern for the country are not “unique to Democrats.”

Bush shares their concerns, he said, adding, “I think that’s true about him and I think that’s true about most of us.”

http://news.yahoo.com/transportation-secretary-leave-administration-143315594.html,,[],Transportation secretary to leave administration,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the only Republican still in President Barack Obama's first-term Cabinet, said Tuesday he plans to leave the administration. His move continues an exodus that will give Obama's team a new look in his second term.

The 67-year-old LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, pushed for greater safety on the highways and in the air.

He led the Transportation Department throughout Obama's first term and helped steer a campaign to curb distracted driving, promote high-speed rail and repair roads and bridges. Under his watch, the department demanded tougher fuel efficiency requirements for automakers and took steps to address airline pilot fatigue.

Obama thanked LaHood in a statement, saying they were ""drawn together by a shared belief that those of us in public service owe an allegiance not to party or faction, but to the people we were elected to represent. And Ray has never wavered in that belief.""

LaHood said in an interview with The Associated Press that he told Obama a week after the November election that he needed to move on but said he was still ""conflicted"" by his decision because he liked working for Obama and considered it the ""best job I've ever had in public service.""

He said he plans to remain at the department until his successor is confirmed by the Senate, which he expected in about two months. The only other Republican who was in Obama's first-term Cabinet was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who stepped aside and was replaced by Democrat Leon Panetta earlier.

LaHood said he would not run for public office in his home state of Illinois and said he did not have any specific plans.

""I have had a good run. I'm one of these people who believe that you should go out while they're applauding,"" he said. LaHood said he was content to watch from the sidelines as his oldest son, Darin, serves in the Illinois state senate.

Obama is remaking his Cabinet at the beginning of his second term with the departures of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Panetta and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. In addition to LaHood, the heads of the Interior and Labor departments also have announced their resignations in recent weeks.

Story continues

The Transportation Department has carried a bipartisan imprint in recent years and been the place for a president to ask a member of the opposing party to serve. Former Rep. Norman Mineta, a California Democrat, served as Transportation secretary during the administration of President George W. Bush. Obama has nominated former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican, to serve as defense secretary to succeed Panetta.

Possible replacements for LaHood include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has pushed for increased rail service in Los Angeles and served as chairman of last year's Democratic National Convention, and Debbie Hersman, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. The name of former Rep. Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, who led the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has also been mentioned.

LaHood, 67, served seven terms in Congress representing a central Illinois district that includes his hometown of Peoria, Ill., and overlapped with Obama in the state's delegation during the last four years of his career.

At the department, LaHood provided a bipartisan voice during the first term, helping implement billions of dollars in transportation projects from the 2009 economic stimulus bill and promoting the plan to wary Republicans. The department pushed forward thousands of infrastructure projects to improve roads and bridges and LaHood worked with Congress last year to pass an overhaul of highway and transit programs that gives states more flexibility in how they spend federal money.

He tackled a number of regulations that had been mired in gridlock. LaHood worked with auto makers and environmentalists to develop tougher fuel efficiency standards for new cars, with the goal of providing environmental benefits and reducing fuel consumption.

Guarding against airline pilot fatigue, the Federal Aviation Administration set new rules under LaHood's watch that would limit the maximum time a pilot can be scheduled on duty and place limits on scheduled flying time and hours for pilots flying overnight. The action was prompted by a deadly plane crash near Buffalo, N.Y., that raised concerns about pilot fatigue.

LaHood also has taken on major transportation companies during his tenure, slapping Toyota Motor Co. with record fines for delaying safety recalls and failing to promptly report problems to federal regulators.

He recently ordered United Airlines to ground its Boeing 787 Dreamliner following mishaps with the aircraft's batteries. The FAA is investigating the cause of the problems to the Dreamliner, which uses lithium ion batteries and is the world's first airliner whose structure is made mostly from lightweight composite materials.

Perhaps LaHood's most passionate work has involved distracted driving, which he has called a ""national epidemic."" He has launched a national media campaign to end texting and cellphone use by drivers, an awareness campaign that has drawn comparisons to efforts to promote seat belt use more than a generation ago.

The grandfather of 10, LaHood has often emphasized the toll that deaths and injuries from distracted driving can inflict on families.

""Safety will be something that people will remember us for in all modes of transportation,"" LaHood said.

Lois Lerner, the head of the exempt organizations division of the IRS, won’t answer questions about what she knew about the improper screening — or why she didn’t disclose it to Congress, according to a letter from her defense lawyer, William W. Taylor III. Lerner was scheduled to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.

“She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,” said a letter by Taylor to committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista). The letter, sent Monday, was obtained Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times.

DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS report

Taylor, a criminal defense attorney from the Washington firm Zuckerman Spaeder, said that the Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation, and that the House committee has asked Lerner to explain why she provided “false or misleading information” to the committee four times last year.

Since Lerner won’t answer questions, Taylor asked that she be excused from appearing, saying that would “have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her.” There was no immediate word whether the committee will grant her request.

According to an inspector general’s report, Lerner found out in June 2011 that some staff in the nonprofits division in Cincinnati had used terms such as “Tea Party” and “Patriots” to select some applications for additional screening of their political activities. She ordered changes.

But neither Lerner nor anyone else at the IRS told Congress, even after repeated queries from several committees, including the House Oversight panel, about whether some groups had been singled out unfairly.

The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.

Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”

The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years,” including:

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance, grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy, regulatory, and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure, policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building. OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation, feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects. These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg, South Africa. The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100,000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. In 2014, OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference. The conference will bring investors, developers, and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.

Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies."

And even though the music acts are A-list, the schedule is actually a modest one for the president -- this year’s inauguration features fewer official balls than any president since Eisenhower.

Assange's conference call with reporters offered the clearest indication yet that Snowden's fate is bound up with the assistance he receives from WikiLeaks, the noted transparency organization that came to its greatest fame three years ago when it released a massive cache of documents from Army Pfc. Bradley Manning.

Assange said that WikiLeaks paid for Snowden's flight from Hong Kong to Russia on Sunday and that ""there was no advanced communication with Russian officials prior to his departure from Hong Kong.""

Claims that Snowden has been debriefed by Russian intelligence agencies are false, Assange said.

In general, Assange struck a mysterious tone that left open many questions about when Snowden and WikiLeaks first made contact and what Snowden's status might be now.

""In relation to the travel out of Hong Kong, that is a fascinating story that I'm sure will one day be told -- but today is not the day,"" Assange said.

According to WikiLeaks, Snowden has applied for asylum in both Iceland and Ecuador, and possibly other countries. Assange himself has been holed up for the past year in the London embassy of Ecuador, which has offered him asylum; he is wanted for questioning on allegations of sexual assault in Sweden and has said he also fears extradition to the U.S. in relation to the ongoing Manning case. Snowden appears to be attempting a somewhat similar maneuver to avoid U.S. prosecution, with stops along the way in Hong Kong, which is a part of China, and Russia. Assange said Snowden traveled from Hong Kong with a refugee document provided by the Ecuadorian government.

Asked if there was any disconnect between the human rights records of countries like China and Russia and the transparency for which Snowden has said he is fighting, Assange said no.

""I simply don't see the irony,"" Assange said. ""Mr. Snowden has revealed information about mass, unlawful spying which has affected every single one of us. The U.S. administration has issued a series of bellicose, unilateral threats against him and against others who are attempting to support his rights. That is a very serious situation, and any country which assists in upholding his rights must be applauded for doing so."""
http://news.yahoo.com/irs-replaces-official-tea-party-controversy-223044834.html,,[],IRS replaces official in tea party controversy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Moving quickly to stem a raging controversy, the new acting head of the Internal Revenue Service started cleaning house Thursday by replacing the supervisor who oversaw agents involved in targeting tea party groups.

A day after she refused to answer questions at a congressional hearing, Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave, according to congressional sources.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said Lerner was asked to resign but refused, so she was placed on leave. An IRS spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on Lerner's status because it was a private personnel matter.

Danny Werfel, the agency's new acting commissioner, told IRS employees in an email that he had selected a new acting head of the division, staying within the IRS to find new leadership.

Ken Corbin, a 27-year IRS veteran, will be the new acting director of the agency's exempt organizations division. Corbin currently is a deputy director in the wage and investment division, where he oversees 17,000 workers responsible for processing 172 million individual and business tax returns, Werfel said.

Werfel's email Thursday made no mention of Lerner. But congressional aides who were briefed on the matter confirmed that Lerner was placed on paid administrative leave. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because a personnel matter was involved.

""From all accounts so far, the IRS acting commissioner was on solid ground to ask for her resignation,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly. The agency needs to move on to fix the conditions that led to the targeting debacle. She shouldn't be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers' dime.""

Lerner's lawyer, William W. Taylor III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Lerner is the IRS official who first publicly disclosed on May 10 that IRS agents had been targeting tea party and other conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. At the time she apologized on behalf of the IRS, but it wasn't enough to stop a firestorm of criticism from the White House and Congress.

Story continues

If Lerner, a career civil servant, is dismissed she would become the third IRS official to lose their job in the scandal. Last week, President Barack Obama forced acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to resign, replacing him with Werfel, a former White House budget official who started at the IRS on Wednesday.

Also last week, Joseph Grant, one of Miller's top deputies, announced plans to retire June 3, according to an internal IRS memo. Grant had just been named commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups. Grant had been the acting head of the division since 2010.

Lerner provided one of the most electric moments since the controversy erupted when she unwaveringly — but briefly — defended herself before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she told the committee, reading from a written statement. ""I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.""

Then, she refused to answer lawmakers' questions, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination. A few minutes later, she was excused. As she boarded an elevator, several of the men who escorted her briefly jostled with TV camera operators who were trying to film her.

Lerner learned in June 2011 that agents were singling out groups with ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriots"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, according to a report by the agency's inspector general. Lerner ordered agents to scrap the criteria immediately, but later they evolved to include groups that promoted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

It finally stopped in May 2012, when top agency officials say they found out and ordered agents to adopt appropriate criteria for determining whether tax-exempt groups were overly political.

Former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told two congressional committees this week that he first learned in the spring of 2012 that conservative groups had been improperly singled out for additional scrutiny. However, after learning that the practice had stopped and that the inspector general was investigating, Shulman said he didn't tell anyone in the Treasury Department or the White House about it. The IRS is part of the Treasury Department.

Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left office in November, when his five-year term expired.

On Thursday, the two leaders of the Senate Investigations subcommittee accused Lerner of misleading committee staff just a few days before it she made the controversy public.

Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., and the top Republican member, Arizona Sen. John McCain, called on the IRS to immediately suspend Lois Lerner from her job as director of the IRS division that handles applications for tax-exempt status.

On April 30, committee staff interviewed Lerner and seven of her colleagues for six hours, the senators said in a letter to Werfel.

""That interview covered, among other topics, how the IRS determines which groups to review, what actions are taken in connection with the IRS reviews, and how the laws and regulations are used to examine those groups,"" the senators wrote. ""Ms. Lerner failed to disclose the internal controversy.""

Lerner, 62, is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001. In her brief appearance Wednesday, she expressed pride in her 34-year career in federal government, which has included work at the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission. AT the IRS, she oversaw 900 workers and a budget approaching $100 million.

Corbin, the new acting director of exempt organizations, began his IRS career in Atlanta in 1986, Werfel said.

""Ken is a proven leader during challenging times. He has strong management experience inside the IRS handling a wide range of processing issues and compliance topics as well as taxpayer service areas,"" Werfel said. ""Combined with his track record of leading large work groups, these skills make him an ideal choice to help lead the Exempt Organizations area through this difficult period.""

Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, praised the selection of Corbin.

""In naming Ken Corbin as acting director to replace Lois Lerner, the administration has taken a strong step to address serious mistakes made by the IRS Exempt Organization Division,"" Levin said. ""This and further corrective action are vital in restoring the confidence of the American people.""

The president, who has spent the first four years navigating Washington as much as shaping it, used his platform on Monday to announce that his next four years will be marked by a more assertive approach. The speech wasn't devoid of the classic, Obama-esque ideal that the country itself, and the two political parties in particular, must come together for the common good. But the appeal he made wasn’t so much to the good nature of each individual lawmaker as it was to the need to confront the severity of the issues at hand.

The president talked about protecting entitlement programs upon which the elderly and the most vulnerable in society depend.

“They do not make us a nation of takers,” he declared, in a clear rebuke to the conservative House Republicans that have been his bête noire. “They free us to take the risks that make this country great.

But Obama also gave a nod to items further down on the conventional list of top priorities: climate change and election reform included.

The underlying theme was altogether consistent: it is time for the country's reasonable majority to wrest back the agenda.

For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.

What the administration now confronts is the issue of legacy. The accomplishments of the first term have given Obama an already exalted status among his base. But inside the White House, there is a tangible sense of hope (and, perhaps, a bit of trepidation) about what’s to come. Immigration reform, the ending of the war in Afghanistan, the protection of gay rights, the passage of gun laws, the execution of health care and banking reform, and the revamping of the tax code and social safety net are all on the docket. The means of addressing them is the great unknown.

What Monday’s speech did, more than anything else, is provide a window into those means. This isn’t the same Obama who, upon coming into office amid an economic crisis, called for an end to the politics of division. It was a more jaded, ostensibly realistic Obama, demanding that divided politics no longer be used as an excuse for inaction and promising to not accept such a cynical status quo.

What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:



“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”



Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.

The president’s supporters and even casual defenders will, undoubtedly, cheer this second inaugural address in a way that they never fully did the first -- a lofty, historic but somewhat unmemorable speech. His critics will take it as affirmation of a liberal agenda that they’ve often warned is coming once the burdens of reelection are gone.

Those reactions are predictable and, ultimately, disposable. What matters more is the extent to which the president acts upon the vision he outlined. The second inaugural address showcased an unapologetic president. Time will tell if Monday was just a few lines in a speech or a new, dedicated mindset for the nation's leader."

Previously', ""He Served As The Post'S Washington Nationals Beat Writer To""]",Nationals vs. Pirates: Ryan Zimmerman steal keys Washington’s 5-4 victory,"Ryan Zimmerman lingered a few feet off second base, his left leg throbbing, studying Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Tony Watson. He knew exactly how long it took Watson to deliver a pitch, and he knew it would allow him to do something he never had previously done.

Hours earlier, Manager Davey Johnson had gathered the Washington Nationals for a rare team meeting. He bounced between themes, but more than anything Johnson wanted his players to stop pressing and have fun. Now, with the score tied in the eighth inning, Zimmerman would try to steal third base.

Zimmerman spearheaded an unlikely double steal and lifted the Nationals to a 5-4 victory at PNC Park. After Zimmerman’s dash, Tyler Moore’s redemptive sacrifice fly ensured the Nationals wouldn’t hang a fifth loss on ace Stephen Strasburg, who allowed four runs in seven strong innings.

Afterward, loud, electronic music pulsed in the clubhouse. Zimmerman walked in from the trainer’s room, an ice pack strapped to his left shin testifying how he had reached base. Players hunched at a table and stared at monitors showing their at-bats. Johnson strolled toward the food room.

“Meeting of the year,” shortstop Ian Desmond said. “That’s how you win Manager of the Year.”

Before batting practice, Johnson summoned the Nationals for the first time this year. “It was probably more for me, so I feel like I’m doing something,” Johnson said. They had fallen to 15-15 on Friday night with a 14-strikeout performance, pressing against expectations. Johnson, 70, addressed the problems — a meager offense, trying too hard – with his deft touch.

“I wouldn’t call it a meeting,” Moore said. “He just kind of talked to us a little bit. He’s always got something good to say. Just to don’t press. We know we have a good team, but sometimes when you get in trouble, you press. Just go out there and go have fun and compete.”

The Nationals stranded 11 men in scoring position, but they scored more than three runs for the first time in a week and drew a season-high six walks. They trailed, 4-2, entering the sixth inning, but Wilson Ramos’s two-run, bases loaded single tied it.

Strasburg, despite a 3.13 ERA starting the day, took the mound under more scrutiny than usual. After his last start, when he allowed the Braves two runs and four walks over six innings, Johnson caused alarm by saying Strasburg felt “tightness” in his right forearm.

Saturday, he mixed excellence and inconsistency. He struck out eight, allowed five hits and walked one. The erratic delivery and command of his fastball seemed to persist. Strasburg dominated at times, flashing a change-up in the high-80s that could start over the edge of the plate and dart several inches out of the zone. But he lacked precision with his fastball, which hummed between 93 and 97 mph. He hit two batters with his fastball, and he also fired two heaters into the center of the strike zone, which Starling Marte and Clint Barmes turned into two-run home runs.

“I was happy,” Strasburg said. “In the past, if I gave up that many runs I feel like I would have had 100 pitches after the sixth.”

In the ninth, Zimmerman ended a seven-pitch at-bat by taking Watson’s 86-mph slider in the shin. He collapsed in a heap, then hobbled to first base and watched Adam LaRoche rip a line-drive single into right.

After LaRoche’s single, Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle visited Watson. During the timeout, Zimmerman and LaRoche conferenced with third base coach Trent Jewett. After Jewett asked Zimmerman if he was okay, he reminded Zimmerman he had the green light if he could get a good jump.

Zimmerman had stolen 30 bases in 1,006 career games before Saturday afternoon. He had not even tried to steal third since his rookie season. But Nationals advance scouts had timed Watson’s delivery to the plate at a glacial 1.8 seconds.

“We know what guys people like me actually have a chance to steal bases on,” Zimmerman said.

As Hurdle trundled back to the home dugout, Zimmerman rubbed his leg. “He was playing that up,” Johnson said, grinning.

“It was kind of a blessing in disguise that it looked like he was one in deep pain,” Jewett said. “Had it been [Denard] Span, there would have been a lot more attention paid to him. But we got a guy limping.”

As Watson took the sign on 1-1, he gave Zimmerman an obligatory peek. Infielders strayed from second base. Zimmerman took another step. Watson kicked his front leg. Zimmerman bolted, and LaRoche followed behind.

Martin popped out of his crouch, cocked his arm and held the ball. LaRoche scooted to second.

“I would have thought those were the last two guys who were going to steal,” Moore said.

Now, Moore had another chance to swing the game. In both the sixth and seventh innings, Moore had come to bat with the bases loaded and struck out. After one at-bat, Zimmerman found him in the dugout and told him, “He made a perfect pitch. It’s gonna happen.”

Facing a 1-2 count, Moore told himself to cut down on his swing. “But I was trying to do that in the other at-bats, too,” he said. He fought off a 94-mph sinker. Watson tried another, and Moore lofted it the other way, into the right field corner.

Travis Snider’s strong throw forced Zimmerman to slide, but he beat it with time to spare. As Zimmerman walked into the dugout, only Dan Haren and a few coaches greeted him. The rest of the team gravitated toward the guy who rebounded from two crucial strikeouts.

“T-Mo’s been great,” Zimmerman said. “Talk about a kid who anywhere else would probably get 400, 500, 600 at-bats. He comes here and does everything we ask and more, and he’s always ready to play.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Washington (CNN) – The third episode of the History Channel's miniseries “The Bible” was supposed to be remembered for the brutality of Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar, the strength of Daniel in the lion’s den, and the birth of Jesus Christ.

But after viewers claimed there was a striking resemblance between Satan’s human form and President Barack Obama, that probably won't be the case.

Buzz on Twitter quickly grew. According to Topsy.com on Monday, there were an estimated 20,000 tweets containing the words “Obama” and “Satan” since the 9:00 p.m. ET hour on Sunday, the hour in which Satan appears in the two-hour show.

In a statement, miniseries producer Mark Burnett called claims there was a resemblance ""utter nonsense.""

Burnett said the actor who played Satan, Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, ""is a highly acclaimed Moroccan actor. He has previously played parts in several Biblical epics - including Satanic characters long before Barack Obama was elected as our President.""

Ouazanni has had roles in two biblical TV movies - ""Jeremiah"" and ""The Ten Commandments.""

Executive producer of the miniseries Roma Downey, Burnett's wife, added, ""Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our President, who is a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of The Bible.""

Satan appears during the miniseries’ retelling of the Temptation of Christ, when Jesus fasted for 40 days in the Judean Desert. Satan tests Jesus’ faith, asking him to make bread out of stone and jump from a cliff, but he refuses each temptation and returns to the Sea of Galilee to begin his ministry.

In the desert, Satan is draped in a long, black, hooded robe and with a slight silver tint to his face.

Both Downey and Burnett supported Obama's first campaign for president in 2008, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Downey gave $5,000 to the Obama Victory Fund and $2,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2008. Burnett also donated to Obama's first campaign - $2,300 in 2007.

Neither gave money to Obama's 2012 campaign.

While the show was airing, tweets poured in noting the resemblance.

After three episodes, the show has scored strong ratings. Its first episode drew 13.1 million viewers, ratings that trumped CBS’s “60 Minutes” and AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” The second episode drew 10.8 million viewers.

Ratings for the third installment in the five-week miniseries have not been released.

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

The project has been a three-and-a-half year process for The History Channel and for Burnett and Downey. Burnett - who is better known as a king of reality television, with “Survivor,” “The Voice” and “The Apprentice” all under his name - told CNN earlier this month that this project was “personal.”

“It was time for an updating, adding fresh visual life to a sacred text,” Burnett said.

Both Downey and Burnett were raised Catholic, Burnett in England and Downey in Ireland. They still regularly attend Mass in Los Angeles. Growing up, both watched the classic biblical films that the Hollywood of yesteryear churned out, like “The Ten Commandments” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”

To film their Bible series, the duo set off for the southern tip of Morocco with a crew of around 400 people.

Burnett and Downey consulted a wide range of pastors and academics, including a major evangelical leader and a Catholic cardinal.

Their advisory panel consisted of many people from varied backgrounds familiar with sharing the stories of the Bible, rather than a who’s who of biblical academics.

Joel Osteen, a popular television preacher and pastor of the 30,000-member Lakewood church in Houston, was among those consulted. Osteen and Burnett are friends and were developing a television series together that went on the back burner during the production of this series. Osteen even took his family to Morocco during some of the filming.

While the History Channel owns the exclusive North American rights to the project, Burnett and Downey own the rights to global distribution and theatrical airings, which are in the works. The project also has a book tie-in, games and apps.

The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on, despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.

Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.

Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011, IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”

A Saturday report by the Associated Press, citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report, found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”

On Friday, the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information, Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”

“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech,” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”

In the release, Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”

Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”

First, she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs, how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics, and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”

Second, she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.”

Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application? Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?

Martin provided a website for conservatives to use to submit any stories of abuse, available here."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

They’ve been out of work since last week and were promised back pay once a budget is passed and the government reopens.

But for many rank-and-file employees who live paycheck to paycheck, the shutdown is proving to be a massive financial headache. Some say their savings have been wiped out after a three-year pay freeze and a previous round of furloughs during the summer.

The nation’s ideological battle over healthcare and spending is hitting these workers in the pocketbook. They’re falling behind on rent, car payments, credit-card debt and other bills.

“I am in survival mode,” said Timothy Maimone, a furloughed quality assurance specialist for the Department of Defense. “I am barely squeaking by right now.”

The 51-year-old Mission Viejo resident said he earns just enough to cover the mortgage on his house, pay bills and take care of his 7-year-old son. But the first government shutdown in nearly two decades has him stressed and angry about money.

A single dad with no savings, he’s prioritizing bills in case the shutdown goes on for weeks. He’s already missed his monthly credit card payment and is late on the mortgage. He’s stopped paying the trash bill and only shelled out the minimum to keep the water on. And he’s holding off on buying clothes for his son, Salvatore.

Workers like Maimone have been told their last paycheck from working before the shutdown could arrive soon. Even then, they’ll get paid only for the days they worked and not the furloughed days that will be settled up later. There won’t be another check until the government reopens.

The pain is also spreading to the private sector as many companies with government contracts begin sending workers home.

Aerospace Corp., based in El Segundo, furloughed about 2,000 workers. San Francisco engineering company URS Corp. has about 3,000 employees on furlough.

The furloughs are costing the economy at least $160 million per workday, according to market research firm IHS Inc. If the shutdown continues beyond three or four weeks, economic growth could be cut in half in the last quarter of the year, Moody’s Analytics said.

The federal government had about 2.15 million people, excluding postal workers unaffected by the shutdown, on its payroll in August, according to the government. California alone has about 243,000 federal employees.

“They are middle-class Americans,” said Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal workers. “They are frightened about what this means to their families. Many are the sole supporters of their families.”

Kelley’s union represents workers from 31 federal agencies and departments such as the Treasury and Homeland Security. She said about 40% of the union’s members take home a salary less than $50,000 a year.

“There are tens of thousands of workers who don’t have backup plans or a support system,” she said.

Even those who do have savings are counting their pennies.

Malcolm Gettmann, 59, and his wife have both been furloughed from their jobs at the Internal Revenue Service in San Diego. Like many other furloughed workers, the pair have filed for unemployment benefits and are scrambling to tighten their belts.

The couple, who have some savings, said they don’t plan to make big purchases any time soon. Instead, Gettmann said, they now meticulously plan meals and buy only those groceries that are on sale. There is just enough to cover their $1,600 mortgage payment and expenses until the third week of November.

He’s not at all impressed by a House bill passed Saturday that guarantees back pay to workers once the shutdown ends.

That pay is only approved “when the Senate passes it and the president signs it,” noted Gettmann, who also serves as the Treasury union’s chapter president for San Diego and Imperial counties. “Meanwhile, the mortgage is still due, the car payments are still due, everything is still due.”

However, government workers might be getting some relief on their bills.

Major banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. and PNC Bank say they’re working with customers individually. Others, such as TD Bank, are offering no-interest payday loans.

On its website, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it was ready to help on “financial challenges that might arise — much like we worked with our customers through Hurricane Sandy and tornadoes in Oklahoma.”

Many credit unions have gone even further to help.

Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the U.S., is expediting approval on raising credit card limits and letting members withdraw from certificates of deposit without penalties. Financial services firm USAA is offering payment deferrals and refunding some fees on credit cards and other services.

Pacific Marine Credit Union in Oceanside, Calif., plans to post payrolls for all affected members with direct deposit Oct. 15. If the government doesn’t come through, the payments will come out of the union’s own cash reserves, said Brad Smith, the vice president of strategic development. Depending on how much is left in the coffers, the union will consider making another payment two weeks later if the shutdown continues.

“We want to provide that peace of mind,” Smith said.

Smith, who worked at another California credit union during the 26-day shutdown in 1995 and 1996, said workers are suffering more this time around.

“There was a much different environment during the Clinton era. Back then it was unprecedented,” he said. “Now the government has a track record with furloughs and the sequester. It seems like every time you turn around they want to run off the edge of a cliff.”

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, questioned whether that DOJ decision was ""politically motivated.""

The original allegation was one of several in a letter from J. Russell George, the inspector general who oversees the IRS, to Grassley. For the first time, George revealed claims that IRS officials targeted political candidates for audits, and that, separately, donor or candidate tax information was improperly accessed or disclosed.

To date, the IRS scandal has focused mainly on the agency's practice of targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny as they applied for nonprofit status.

And for the first time, the letter also raised questions about the Justice Department's role in allegations of IRS misconduct.

More On This...

In one case, George said in his letter, ""we presented evidence of a willful unauthorized access to the Department of Justice, but the case was declined for prosecution.""

Grassley has since written a letter to Holder asking for details on who made the decision not to prosecute and why.

In a written statement, he questioned whether the Justice Department had an ulterior motive in not pursuing the case.

""The IRS is required to act with neutrality and professionalism, not political bias,"" he said. ""The Justice Department should answer completely and not hide behind taxpayer confidentiality laws to avoid accountability for its decision not to prosecute a violation of taxpayer confidentiality laws.""

He continued: ""The public needs to know whether the decision not to prosecute these violations was politically motivated and whether the individuals responsible were held accountable in any other way.""

Reached for comment, a Justice Department spokesman said: ""We have received the letter and are reviewing it.""

The letter from the inspector general did not say which political candidates or donors may have been affected. He confirmed only that the alleged incidents happened since 2006. This would have spanned the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

In the case of the unauthorized access or disclosures, George said his office initially found eight cases, but determined four of them were not supported by evidence. In three of the remaining cases, his office found that ""unauthorized access or disclosure"" happened but was ""inadvertent.""

In the fourth case, though, his office found evidence that the access was ""willful.""

George also confirmed two cases ""involving allegations that the IRS targeted for audit candidates for public office."" He said his office is still reviewing those allegations.

It's unclear who was affected by these incidents. Grassley originally asked the inspector general for information following a news report on Republican donors stepping forward to claim they had been audited by the IRS."

It’s that time of year when crazy people jump into icy cold waters. Some do it for charity, and some do it just because they’re crazy. In Reston on Saturday, the sixth annual “Freezin for a Reason Virginia Polar Dip” will occur at Lake Anne, to raise money for Camp Sunshine, a retreat for seriously ill children and their families.

A similar “Polar Plunge Winter Festival” is scheduled Saturday in Virginia Beach to benefit Special Olympics, and Triangle resident Steve Costa is participating for the second straight year. Except this year he won’t be in Virginia Beach. He is in Bagram, Afghanistan, where he manages the heavily armored MRAP vehicle program, and he is going to take the plunge with 10 to 20 other “volunteers” (his quotes) in a small pool he bought online and had shipped to Bagram.

“We are filling the pool tomorrow morning,” Costa told me in an e-mail Wednesday, “and posting a guard with the night shift for ice breaking duties!” Bagram has not had a shortage of snow this winter, as one of Costa’s photos shows, and it is forecast to be in the 30s with “either snow or rain” on Saturday.

Good times. Totally not crazy. For more on Costa and how you can help, or dive in yourself, read after the jump.

When he’s in Virginia, Costa is the Marine Corps program manager for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) vehicle program. He also is a Special Olympics coach in Stafford County. Every year, the Stafford team, called “Area 11,” participates in the Polar Plunge in Virginia Beach, and Costa said Area 11 has raised the most donations in each of the last four years..

“I knew I was deploying to Afghanistan in October,” Costa wrote, ”so I made a promise to the kids that I would honor the plunge this year by plunging in the ‘Stan.”

Last year was Costa’s first plunge, and he said his costume featured the “Braveheart” battle theme, with the blue facepaint. (Not sure William Wallace had any words painted across his chest, but you never know.)

“I was a little naive,” Costa said. “I actually didn’t do my investigative work, as I assumed it was only going to be Area 11 plunging. There were over 10,000 plungers — it was awesome.”

I asked Costa why anyone would do this in Afghanistan in February. He said that one of his co-plungers is also from Virginia, Curtis Dunn.

”I would love to say that I am a motivational leader and these folks will follow me anywhere,” Costa replied. “But truth be told, these folks are real heroes sacrificing their time away from their families and loved ones to support our war fighters and they just know a good cause when they see it. Plus, I truly believe that it will take the ‘edge’ off for at least an hour — and that hour means a lot in this place.”

And if you want to try this yourself, but need a month to get ready, Special Olympics is having another one of these on March 2 in Dumfries, at Tim’s Rivershore Restaurant and Crabhouse. Around here, it could be 70 degrees that day, or it could be 10. Good luck."
http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/10/16/Senate-Debt-Deal-Includes-Provision-Taking-Away-Congress-Power-To-Increase-Debt-Ceiling,2013-10-16 00:00:00,['Kerry Picket'],Senate Debt Deal Weakens Congress on Debt Ceiling,"Capitol Hill talk regarding the Senate deal apparently includes a provision that would take away the Congress’ power to increase the debt ceiling. According to Politico, it looks like the buzz appears to be true.:

The plan includes a proposal offered by McConnell in the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that allows Congress to disapprove of the debt ceiling increase, which means lawmakers will formally vote on whether to reject a debt ceiling increase until Feb. 7. Obama can veto that legislation if it passes. If Congress fails as expected to gather a two-thirds majority to override the veto, the debt ceiling would be raised.

National Journal reported last week:

Whether it’s four weeks from now or in one year, there’d be even less reason to put faith in a last-minute deal next time the U.S. is up against the debt limit.

There’s only one foolproof way to avoid a future crisis: Fundamentally change the way the debt ceiling works.

This approach isn’t all that radical. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proposed a reform in January that would change the debt-ceiling mechanism so that Congress would vote to disapprove of an increase, as opposed to approving one. Such a change would limit debt-ceiling negotiations to a veto-proof majority, while still leaving Congress with some power.

The most interesting part of this proposal? It was originally floated in 2011 by Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell. The potential for a bipartisan deal here that fixes the debt-limit problem is real. Sen. Boxer continues to advocate for the change. Right now though, Harry Reid’s office says the senator is not considering any disapproval mechanism. But that could change as this process moves on.

Such a plan would be obviously good for Democrats, as they can get the immediate gratification of not having to risk default in order to fully implement the Affordable Care Act. But it’d be good for Republicans too, who could not only avoid the stigma of blame for a default, but also presumably reap the ruling-party rewards in future Congresses and presidencies. It would also put an immediate political target on President Obama, and Democrats by association, for being the sole entity responsible for raising the debt limit by over a trillion dollars. That opportunity has got to sound pretty good to Republicans ahead of 2014."

This is classic mainstream media tactical deflection. In order to take the spotlight off Hillary not reading the cables (which is why Paul criticized her) from our Libyan consulate requesting more security, Moran wants to make Paul the issue.

You see, Paul’s question and statement of fact doesn’t matter, because Paul’s resume is more important.

This is how the media turns an inconvenient narrative away from its own (a Democrat) and then trains its fire on whomever dares to politically damage one of its own. Libya has been a non-stop exercise in this kind of media behavior. Four Americans die under Obama’s watch, Romney dares say something, and the media makes him the story for 10 days; not the terrorist attack, the lack of security, or the subsequent administration cover up.

Remember all the hand-wringing we saw from the elite media when someone with no foreign policy experience ran for president in 2008?

Yeah, me neither.

Man alive, what an era the Democrats live in! No accountability, the watchdogs always have your back; and like magic, lies are turned into truth.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court refuses to block legal immigrant’s deportation,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to block the deportation of a Chicago woman and thousands of other immigrants who before 2010 were not warned by their lawyers when they pleaded guilty to serious crimes and were targeted for removal.

The decision highlights the stark consequences for noncitizens of having a criminal record. The law calls for mandatory deportation for immigrants, including lawful residents, who have an “aggravated felony” on their record. The term can describe a variety of state and federal offenses.

Immigration lawyers say tens of thousands of immigrants, many of them lawful permanent residents, plead guilty each year to crimes that may lead to deportation. In many instances, they were not warned of the consequences of such a plea.

Three years ago, the high court extended relief to some immigrants when it ruled that they could seek a new trial if their lawyers had failed to warn them of the dire consequences of a guilty plea.

But in a 7-2 ruling Wednesday, the justices refused to apply the ruling retroactively to cases of immigrants who had unwittingly pleaded guilty before 2010.

The ruling came in the case of Roselva Chaidez, a Chicago woman who was born in Mexico. She has been a lawful permanent resident since 1977 and has three children and two grandchildren, all of whom are U.S. citizens.

In 2003, she agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud for what the government said was her minor role in an insurance fraud. Her son and several others staged an auto accident, and Chaidez received $1,200 from an insurance company for a claim of an injury that was false.

She was sentenced to probation and was required to help repay $22,000, the total amount of the insurance fraud. She completed her sentence and had paid her restitution by 2004.

Advertisement

When she later applied for naturalization, she denied having been convicted of a crime. Only then did she learn that pleading guilty to mail fraud involving more than $10,000 meant that she was subject to deportation.

Chaidez filed a court petition in 2009 seeking to have her conviction overturned on the grounds that her lawyer failed to warn her of the consequences of her guilty plea. She could have argued that because she obtained only $1,200, her crime did not meet the $10,000 threshold for what the law deems an “aggravated felony.” Her new lawyer pointed to the high court’s ruling in Padilla vs. Kentucky, which held that a lawyer had a constitutional duty to warn immigrants when they faced deportation for a guilty plea.

Advertisement

In Chicago, U.S. District Judge Joan Gottschall ruled for Chaidez and set aside her conviction. But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed in a 2-1 decision and said the Chicago woman could not take advantage of the high court’s new ruling to challenge her old conviction.

Ruling in Chaidez vs. United States, the Supreme Court agreed with the appeals court and said its 2010 decision could not be applied retroactively to upset old plea deals.

Justice Elena Kagan said that the 2010 ruling amounted to a major change in the law, and the court has not applied such changes retroactively to old cases. “Defendants whose convictions became final prior to Padilla therefore cannot benefit from its holding,” she said.

The ruling marked a rare split between President Obama’s two appointees. While Kagan spoke for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Sotomayor argued that the 2010 decision simply made clear that lawyers had a duty to advise their clients on the law. “Today’s decision deprives defendants of the fundamental protection” that goes with having a competent lawyer, she said.

The Chicago lawyer who represented Chaidez in her appeal, Gerardo Gutierrez, said, “Obviously, we are disappointed. This will have an immediate, adverse impact on a lot of immigrant families.”

Charles Roth, counsel for the National Immigrant Justice Center, said, “It is now in the hands of the Obama administration and Congress to keep this family together, as well as hundreds of others who at least deserve consideration of whether a run-in with the law enforcement more than a decade ago outweighs the good they have since contributed to our society.”

Applauding the ruling, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California said the court acted to “limit the damage caused by the discovery of new rules of laws” so as not to reopen tens of thousands of settled cases.

http://news.yahoo.com/judges-sue-social-security-over-case-quotas-075047792.html,,[],Judges sue Social Security over case 'quotas',"Graphic shows annual disability applications

WASHINGTON (AP) — Judges struggling to handle a surge of disability cases sometimes award benefits they might otherwise deny in order to clear cases faster so they can meet quotas imposed by the Social Security Administration, according to a lawsuit filed by the union representing the agency's administrative law judges.

The Social Security Administration says judges should decide 500 to 700 disability cases a year. The agency calls the standard a productivity goal, but the lawsuit claims it is an illegal quota that requires judges to decide an average of more than two cases a workday.

The lawsuit says the requirement violates judges' independence, denies due process rights to applicants and further strains the finances of a disability program that is projected to run out of money in 2016.

Once the trust fund that supports the disability program runs dry, the system will only collect enough money in payroll taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Congress could redirect money from the retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, too.

""Case quotas prevent judges from devoting necessary time to the most complex cases, resulting in waste and abuse,"" said a statement by Randall Frye, president of the Association of Administrative Law Judges and a judge in Charlotte, N.C.

""Many administrative law judges find themselves pressured to grant more claims than they otherwise would because a decision awarding benefits is less complex and time-consuming than a decision which denies benefits,"" the statement said.

The lawsuit was filed by the union Thursday in federal court in Chicago. It names the agency and Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin as defendants. Colvin took over in February after Commissioner Michael Astrue's six-year term expired.

The union scheduled a news conference in Washington on Friday to announce the lawsuit.

An agency spokesman declined to comment. In an interview, Astrue disputed the union's claims.

Story continues

""What's really happening here is that the judges' union doesn't want accountability of its members and it's been trying to sell this story to the media and to the Congress and to the agency for a very long time,"" Astrue said. ""And no one's buying it because it's not true, and no federal judge is going to buy this story, either.""

""There are a very small number of malcontents who want to litigate or put political pressure on the agency rather than do their work,"" Astrue said.

The union represents 1,400 administrative law judges. Its lawsuit describes a disability system in crisis.

About 3.2 million people applied for disability benefits last year, a 25 percent increase from a decade before. Claims have increased in part because of aging baby boomers. As people get older, they become more prone to disabilities.

Disability claims also typically increase when the economy sours. Some people who manage to work despite their disabilities get laid off and apply for benefits, while others apply out of economic desperation.

When people apply for Social Security disability benefits, their cases are initially reviewed by state offices, which reject about two-thirds of claims. If your claim is rejected, you can appeal to an administrative law judge. But the hearing process takes an average of 373 days — a little more than a year — according to agency statistics.

Astrue said the average processing time for a hearing peaked at 542 days shortly after he took over the agency. He said public outcry over the backlog led him to adopt productivity standards in 2007, which helped reduce the wait time.

The hearing process, which is closed to the public, is different from a civil lawsuit or a criminal trial. There is no lawyer for the government. Instead, judges are expected to be impartial decision-makers while protecting the interest of taxpayers and ensuring that applicants get fair hearings. Most applicants have legal representation by the time their claim results in a hearing, the lawsuit says.

The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees Social Security, has been looking into ways to improve the disability system.

""Under the law, ALJs have judicial independence, which seems to mean they can operate with little or no accountability,"" said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. ""Those who appeal their denied claim for disability benefits should not have to wait months, much less years, for a decision because some ALJs don't want to handle their fair share of cases. Nor is it right that some ALJs simply rubber-stamp most of their cases.""

The lawsuit says judges are expected to meet their quotas, regardless of how complicated their cases are, even though many case files exceed 500 pages. Judges have been disciplined for missing the quota, including receiving formal reprimands and facing removal proceedings, according to the lawsuit.

""The pressure exerted on ALJs by the quota is reflected in the substance of their rulings,"" the lawsuit says. ""Some ALJs respond by tending to grant more claims. For other ALJs, the quota impedes their ability to render carefully reasoned, impartial decisions based on a fully developed factual record.""

Frye's statement said: ""The cost of such decision-making adds up. When a judge finds in favor of a claimant, the average lifetime disability payment exceeds $300,000 per individual.""

Astrue countered that approval rates actually dropped since he adopted the performance standards. In 2011, the approval rate was about 35 percent, down from 46 percent a decade before.

Nearly 11 million disabled workers, spouses and children get Social Security disability benefits. That's up from 7.6 million a decade ago. The average monthly benefit for a disabled worker is $1,130.

In 2011, Social Security disability paid about $129 billion in benefits.

In what seems to be yet another bitterly ironic attempt by God to teach noisy religious fundamentalists what-for, the church has thus become the epicenter of a small but worrisome outbreak that has so far infected 10 and resulted in the Department of State Health Services issuing an alert spanning North Texas.

That has megachurch pastors doing a bit of fancy dancin', with Pastor Terri Pearson (Copeland's daughter) walking back their leader's anti-vaccination stance to explain to the congregation that no, God does not really want your children to contract a potentially dangerous disease that vaccinations have all but licked because duh.



""There are a lot of people that think the Bible -- we talk about walking by faith -- it leaves out things such as, I don't know, people just get strange. But when you read the Old Testament, you find that it is full of precautionary measures, and it is full of the law. Why did the Jewish people, why did they not die out during the plague? Because the Bible told them how to be clean, told them how to disinfect, told them there was something contagious. And the interesting thing of it, it wasn't a medical doctor per se who took care of those things, it was the priesthood….""

See there? Even back in the before-times, people were smart enough to know that if you could do a very simple thing in order to Not Die, you probably ought to do that thing and not just trust that all of God's various plagues and viruses had built-in piety detectors that would run away when they got a taste of the likes of religious you.

Helpfully, the church now states that it was an unclean outsider that brought this evil into their midst, which is a bit of a cop-out:



Eagle Mountain International Church, about 50 miles northwest of Dallas, released a statement Tuesday that said a visitor attended a service who had been overseas and was exposed to measles. “Therefore the congregation, staff at Kenneth Copeland Ministries and the daycare center on the property were exposed through that contact,” the statement said.

Which is, of course, how epidemics work. Somebody goes somewhere and brings back a something that none of the other somebodies have an immunity to, infecting them all and allowing the something to spread ever-further. By vaccinating yourself and your children, you are not only making sure your family does not get the disease in question, you are also making sure that your family is not a disease-riddled pus vector oozing easily preventable plague onto all the other people in your community, causing you to be scorned as an ""outsider"" and the state department of health to issue up bulletins specifically naming you and your community as the disease-riddled pus vectors in question and warning your fellow human beings to wash their hands a lot if they have to come in contact with you.

And that, children, is why the church run by an anti-vaccination crank is now holding free vaccination clinics in apparent contradiction to the beliefs of said crank. Curiously, there doesn't seem to be any word from Copeland himself; barring other evidence we can only assume that the rest of the church leadership locked him in a nice, sturdy cupboard for a while?

But the real target of this particular pitch was none other than Karl Rove himself, the “architect” of George W. Bush’s two White House wins, accused in the ad of trying to “crush the Tea Party movement.”

And he was depicted as a Nazi.

Newsweek John Avlon

Photoshopped into the uniformed visage of vicious SS commandant Heinrich Himmler, no less – the architect of the Holocaust.

It’s hard to imagine a more offensive piece of political e-mail.

Not surprisingly, within hours, the e-mail was retracted and apologies offered all around. It was a terrible case of mistaken identity, an inexplicable bit of human error, the Tea Party Patriots said through a high-priced PR agent when called by Politico’s Ken Vogel, who broke the story. The Virginia-based political fundraising firm, Active Engagement, promptly fell on its sword, which is the decent thing to do when you’ve been paid $1.5 million and screw up this definitively.

The tea party’s impulse to attack Rove personally – so deeply felt that putting an SS uniform on him seemed like a good idea to somebody in the chain of command – is a sign of just how bitter this GOP civil war is becoming.

Rove’s alleged sin is the formation of a group dedicated to nominating electable congressional candidates for the GOP. It seems that some folks in “the establishment” don’t like losing Senate races every year because the partisan primary system keeps kicking up extreme candidates who are beloved by the hyperpartisan base but can’t win in a general election.

Cases in point: Senate candidates Sharron Angle, Ken Buck and Christine (“I am not a witch”) O’Donnell in 2010; the no-abortion-even-in-cases-of-rape duo Richard Mourdock and Todd Aiken in 2012. If those five tea party favorites hadn’t imploded in spectacular fashion, Republicans could be in control of the Senate right now.

So Rove & Co. are backing more centrist Republican candidates who they think have a chance.

Borger: Obama can’t kick his legacy down the road

The midterms are 18 months away, but the fault lines are already forming. Two states – Georgia and Iowa – appear primed to put forward the next Angle and Aiken in the form of two right-wing congressmen: Paul Broun and Steve King.

It turns out that Broun has a bit of a Nazi-calling problem himself. Days after Barack Obama’s first election in 2008, Broun was first out of the gate on this ugly front, comparing the president-elect to Hitler.

In his apology, Broun tortuously explained that “I’m just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may – may not, I hope not – but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism.” In recent years, Broun has become best known for proclaiming evolution and the big-bang theory “lies from the pit of hell” and asserting his belief that the Earth is 9,000 years old. Despite these and many other slips into the fringe, Broun was uncontested in his most recent election and serves on the House Science Committee. If he is the GOP nominee, Democrats could have a chance at winning the Georgia Senate seat for the first time since Max Cleland.

Likewise, Iowa congressman Steve King is the proud father of a steady stream of hyperpartisan howlers, beginning in the 2008 election, when he predicted that if Obama were elected, “The radical Islamists, the al Qaeda … would be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11, because they would declare victory in this war on terror.” When the McCain campaign sensibly disavowed his statements, King pushed back and said terrorists would view Obama as their “savior” and “That’s why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him.” Tell that to Osama bin Laden.

In recent years, King has been the lone “no” vote on a congressional resolution apologizing for the use of slaves in building the U.S. Capitol, supported deporting “anchor babies” and, yes, defended Akin’s campaign comments by saying he hadn’t heard of any young woman getting pregnant from rape or incest. You see pretty quickly where this campaign is likely to go in a swing state that voted for Obama twice.

LZ Granderson: Rubio missed the year of the woman

Nonetheless, Broun has thrown his hat in the ring, and polls show King a favorite among rank-and-file conservatives in Iowa. Hence Rove’s group, getting ready to do some reverse RINO-hunting of its own with a spinoff of the Crossroads super PAC. It’s called “The Conservative Victory Project.”

I appreciate how tea party groups might howl when the outside money is directed against them, but a taste of your own medicine is sometimes morally clarifying.

In a larger sense, this family feud is fascinating for several reasons. It represents a realization by Rove – the father of the “red state vs. blue state,” “play to the base” strategy – that there is such a thing as too extreme. Some of the forces that the Republican establishment encouraged when its self-righteous hate was directed against Obama have found that venom can be directed at them. In this same vein, House Speaker John Boehner has found that 50 or so tea party radicals are his biggest problem in governing; they are quick to undercut him and eager to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United State. Golem always turns on its creator.

In the end, the Republican Party does need to reform. It needs to rebuild the big tent and reach out beyond its base. It needs to stop coddling the angry and unhinged in its ranks. And it needs to become more philosophically consistent when it comes to advancing individual freedom as well as fiscal responsibility.

Count me with Karl Rove and Co. – in at least this one case. The Tea Party Patriots’ misfired e-mail was an ugly tell, a reminder that angry conservative populist passions can transform into a mob mentality. Extremes are always ultimately their own side’s worst enemy.

“We reject the government’s efforts to criminalize the pursuit of investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a Federal judge as a ‘co-conspirator’ in a crime,” Ailes wrote. “The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time.

Dear colleagues,

The recent news about the FBI’s seizure of the phone and email records of Fox News employees, including James Rosen, calls into question whether the federal government is meeting its constitutional obligation to preserve and protect a free press in the United States. We reject the government’s efforts to criminalize the pursuit of investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a Federal judge as a “co-conspirator” in a crime. I know how concerned you are because so many of you have asked me: why should the government make me afraid to use a work phone or email account to gather news or even call a friend or family member? Well, they shouldn’t have done it. The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

I am proud of your tireless effort to report the news over the last 17 years. I stand with you, I support you and I thank you for your reporting with courageous optimism. Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime. Even this memo of support will cause some to demonize us and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to waver. We will not waver.

As Fox News employees, we sometimes are forced to stand alone, but even then when we know we are reporting what is true and what is right, we stand proud and fearless. Thank you for your hard work and all your efforts.

Sincerely,

Roger Ailes

The bodies of Christopher MacKenzie and Kevin Woyjeck will be transported to the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, where they will be met by family and firefighters wishing to pay respects.

“There are various traditions associated with the fire service. One of them is when they lose someone in the line of duty, everybody gathers around,” said Carroll Wills, communications director for the California Fire Foundation.

The plane, a National Guard C-130, is expected to land at 1 p.m. The event is open to the public.

Hearses will transport the remains of the two men from the base.

Cal Fire and the United States Forest Service will escort MacKenzie, 30, by way of a procession to a mortuary in his hometown of Hemet, according to a Cal Fire news release. MacKenzie is the son of retired Cal Fire Capt. Mike MacKenzie.

A memorial service in his honor will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Ramona Bowl Ampitheater in Hemet.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department will escort Woyjeck, 21, to Long Beach, Wills said. Woyjeck’s father, Capt. Joe Woyjeck, serves with the department.

A memorial service for Woyjeck is being planned in Long Beach for July 19, said Inspector Anthony Akins, public information officer for the L.A. County Fire Department.

The families of MacKenzie and Woyjeck requested their sons be transported back as soon as possible, Wills said.

Three others on the team also hailed from California.

Sean Misner, 26, will be transported by ground later this week, Wills said.

Grant McKee, 21, and Robert Caldwell, 23, will be buried in Arizona, according to Wills, but a private memorial for the cousins will be held July 20 in Newport Beach.

The arrangements and compositions by living or 20th-century Russian and American Orthodox composers included on the lineup here — like Benedict Sheehan’s “Thrice-Holy” (2012) — had nothing in the way of harmonic twists or other contemporary markers to distinguish them from the traditional pieces on the program.

The polyphonic selections proved to be the highlights, in particular an arrangement by Sergius Trubachov of “Gladsome Light,” a type of chant that originated in the Valaam Monastery in northwestern Russia and blends features of Byzantine and Znamenny genres. The female, then male voices blended beautifully, quiet and reserved before swelling to a more sumptuous sound.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court seems unlikely to uphold frequent-flier’s suit,"WASHINGTON — Rabbi S. Binyomin Ginsberg of Minneapolis admits being both a frequent flier and a frequent complainer. He flew on Northwest Airlines about 75 times a year, domestically and internationally, earning enough miles to qualify for “Platinum Elite” status.

But he also complained a lot — about two dozen times in seven months, the airline says — demanding compensation for delays, lost bags and losing seats on overbooked flights that Northwest said the rabbi had reserved “with the purpose of being bumped.”

After Northwest terminated Ginsberg’s platinum status for “abusing” its frequent-flier program, the rabbi sued. “I had hundreds of thousands of miles, and I wanted them back,” he said, standing on the steps of the Supreme Court on Tuesday, where his case was heard.

But based on justices’ questions and comments, the court appeared reluctant to grant U.S. travelers any expanded rights to sue airlines, pointing to a 1978 deregulation law that airlines use to shield themselves against lawsuits from customers over routes, rates and services.

Advertisement

The “whole point” of the deregulation act was to protect airlines from state lawsuits, said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “We’re dealing with airlines that go to a lot of different states,” he said.

Ginsberg’s attorney contended that Northwest, which merged with Delta Airlines in 2010, broke its contractual promise with the rabbi. But justices noted that the fine print of the frequent-flier program said a decision to cancel a member’s account was left to the airline’s “sole judgment.”

At the heart of Northwest Inc. vs. Ginsberg is how to balance consumer protections for travelers with the Airline Deregulation Act, which Congress passed to insulate airlines from burdensome state lawsuits in an effort to increase competition and lower fares. That law has often frustrated airline customers, who find few legal options to challenge carriers in court over lost luggage or canceled flights.

The Supreme Court relied on that law to throw out a 1995 claim against American Airlines for making it harder for frequent fliers to earn free tickets. Frequent-flier awards are “related to” tickets prices, the justices ruled. But their opinion left the door slightly open for future claims from fliers if they could show that the airline had broken a promise in its contracts.

Ginsberg had sued in California, and a San Diego federal judge dismissed his claim prior to a trial, citing the deregulation act. But last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals revived it and said the rabbi could sue the airline for violating the general duty to act in “good faith” and engage in “fair dealing.”

An attorney for the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen, which agreed to represent the rabbi, argued that Ginsberg was a loyal flier and that the airline should be required to honor the deal it made with him. Courts should be able to “give effect to the bargain that the parties entered into based on their reasonable expectations,” said Adina Rosenbaum, a Washington lawyer.

Tuesday’s argument offered only a few glimmers of hope for Ginsberg.

Justice Elena Kagan said she understood the frequent-flier program as offering a deal. “I always thought the way these agreements worked … was that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket,” she said. “It wasn’t a gift.... It was because I did something. I flew a certain number of miles. So there was an exchange with value on both sides.”

Advertisement

“Well, I suppose you could conceive of it that way,” said former U.S. Solicitor Gen. Paul D. Clement, representing Northwest. But he argued that the frequent-flier program was “basically a premium that’s offered by the company to reward your loyalty.”

Clement argued that the court should close the door to lawsuits like Ginsberg’s because they would allow judges and juries to decide whether the airlines acted fairly. “You can’t run a national — let alone international — airline if every one of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off or taking out an abusive customer is going to be second-guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards of ordinary decency and morality.”

What about travelers who feel cheated? Clement said they could file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation. He also said the free market would work to keep the airlines in check. “Airlines do not have an interest in getting rid of their most lucrative and loyal customers,” he said.

A decision is not expected for several months.

He was 76.

Gardner died Friday at his Tacoma home, said family spokesman Ron Dotzauer.

The millionaire heir to the Weyerhaeuser timber fortune served as the state’s 19th governor from 1985 to 1993 following terms as Pierce County executive, state senator and business school dean.

Since then, he had worked as a U.S. trade ambassador in Geneva, in youth sports and for a variety of philanthropic works. But his biggest political effort in later years was his successful “Death with Dignity” campaign in 2008 that led to the passage of the controversial law that mirrored one in place in Oregon since 1997.

Washington state had rejected a similar assisted-suicide initiative in 1991. But after a contentious campaign, in which Gardner contributed $470,000 of his own money toward the $4.9 million raised to support the measure, nearly 58% of voters approved the new law.

The law allows terminally ill adults with six months or less left to live to request a legal dose of medication from their doctors.

Gardner knew that he wouldn’t qualify to use the law because his Parkinson’s disease was incurable, not fatal. But his worsening condition made him a right-to-die advocate.

“There’s more people who would like to have control over their final days than those who don’t,” Gardner told the Associated Press at the time.

Since the Washington law took effect in March 2009, more than 250 people have used it to obtain lethal doses of medication.

A 2009 documentary about his crusade, “The Last Campaign of Governor Booth Gardner,” was nominated for an Academy Award.

As governor, Gardner pushed for standards-based education reform, issued an executive order banning discrimination against gay and lesbian state workers, banned smoking in state workplaces and appointed the first minority to the state Supreme Court. He also oversaw the 1987 launch of the state’s Basic Health Care program for the poor.

William Booth Gardner was born Aug. 21, 1936, in Tacoma to a socialite mother, Evelyn Booth, and Bresson “Brick” Gardner. His father was an alcoholic who was cruel to his son, according to Booth Gardner’s biographer.

After his parents divorced when he was 4, his mother married Norton Clapp, a wealthy former president of Weyerhaeuser who helped build the Space Needle for the 1962 World’s Fair.

FOR THE RECORD:

An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave Norton Clapp’s first name as Morton.



Early in life, Gardner endured tragedy. His mother and 13-year-old sister were killed in a plane crash in 1951, an event he later said “had a greater effect on me than anything else in my life.” It also left him with an inheritance that made him a millionaire.

In 1966 his father fell to his death from a ninth-floor Honolulu hotel room balcony.

Clapp remained a presence in Gardner’s life, and though he was a Republican, made significant donations to Gardner’s gubernatorial runs.

Gardner earned bachelor’s and law degrees from the University of Washington and a master’s in business administration from Harvard University.

While abroad in 1995 he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. In 2000, he launched the Booth Gardner Parkinson’s Care Center, a clinic in Kirkland, Wash.

Twice divorced, Gardner is survived by two children from his first marriage, his son Doug and daughter, Gail; and grandchildren.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum at her alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

President Obama is expected to join the Bushes, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter for the library’s dedication Thursday.

Laura Bush, who was involved in the library’s design of Texas limestone and pecan, said she hopes visitors are touched by the 9/11 display, which includes a twisted steel beam from Tower 2 of the World Trade Center.

“I think people will be very moved by the 9/11 exhibit and I think that’s important because we still live with the effect of 9/11, both our security issues that we have and of course the loss that we still live with,” she said while answering questions in a garden outside the museum that mimics the White House Rose Garden design, substituting plants native to Texas.

“George walked a family through recently and realized that the children that were on the tour with them weren’t alive on Sept. 11 and so they had no direct memory of it like all of us do,” Bush continued. “Of course I remember where I was and who I was with—I was with Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Judd Gregg in the capital.”

Bush said the exhibit also reminded her of “meeting the families and going to that memorial service in that field in Shanksville. I remember the families that came to the White House more than once. I think some will be at the opening of the library.”

“I also remember how united we were as a country. And I think that’s an important lesson for us. We should be united. There’s more that unites us than divides us and we need to be reminded of that.”

She noted that the exhibit opens with photos of the couple’s Texas ranch and examples of the Bush agenda pre-9/11: tax cuts, faith-based initiatives, no child left behind, their first state dinner with Mexico: “And then you turn the corner and see the big beam from the World Trade Center.”

“Even in the way we tried to lay out the museum, you can see the way our lives changed and the lives of everyone in this country changed after Sept. 11,” she said.

She also noted how designers re-created the Bush White House situation room as the Decision Points Theater, an interactive exhibit that forces visitors to decide how they would have handled four crises: the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the troop surge, Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis. In the Katrina portion, images stream of people trapped atop homes and in rising water as newscasters warn of chaos in the streets.

“The idea was to show people what it’s like to have to make decisions quickly with the press hounding you,” Bush said. “I think people will find it interesting to relive those decisions.”

She said it was not difficult to part with her ball gowns for the exhibit. (“You know George is not wild about black tie.”) She said she particularly enjoyed the museum’s replica of her husband’s Oval Office, which longtime Bush advisor Karen Hughes said Wednesday was so life-like “I felt like I was going to work.”

The library also includes exhibits on the global war on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq featuring Saddam Hussein’s 9-millimeter pistol, seized during his capture. Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, said the former president enjoyed the museum and thinks his decisions have stood the test of time.

“He based his decisions on principles, he tried to make the best decisions he could, and I think he is at peace with that,” Hadley said at the library Wednesday.

Joshua Bolten, Bush’s chief of staff, was also at the library Wednesday, and praised library designers who “made the wise decision to take the difficulties of the Bush administration and face them head on: the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, Katrina, the financial crisis.” There’s even an exhibit with video of Bush, Al Gore and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris detailing the tumultuous 2000 election and Florida recount.

“So many difficult things happened during that presidency,” Bolten said, and although the library won’t boost Bush’s popularity among retractors, he said, “It will help people see the legacy through a more objective lens.”

Elsewhere in Dallas on Wednesday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-- both possible presidential contenders in 2016 -- were scheduled to speak before the library’s dedication.

Starting Monday, that's the law.

July 1 marks the start of the fiscal year, which means hundreds of new state laws go into effect. Many of the laws focus on topics that are part of a national debate like gun control, abortion rights drone surveillance and Internet privacy. On a lighter note, some of Monday’s laws affect smaller-scale changes, such as ordering edible landscaping to be grown around the Statehouse in Maine or finally being able to play the lottery in Wyoming.

Colorado’s gun legislation in effect today is similar to the kind of comprehensive gun control reform President Barack Obama’s administration is trying to pass on a national level.

Just shy of a year after the deadly movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., where James Holmes killed 12 people and injured 58 during the midnight premier of The Dark Knight Rises, Colorado passed one of the most progressive gun reform laws in the country. Starting Monday, the state now requires background checks for both private and online gun sales. It also banned high-capacity ammunition magazines like the one Holmes used.

Despite major mass shootings like Aurora and December’s school massacre that left 20 children and 7 adults dead in Newtown, Conn., 18 states actually passed loosened gun laws that also take effect Monday. In Kansas, individuals can carry guns into more public buildings. Most notably, school employees can now carry concealed handguns.

State legislators in many states are looking to crack down on abortion limits. About 13 states passed stricter abortion laws after state legislators proposed more than 300 bills aimed at limiting abortions in 2012, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. North Dakota passed the strictest abortion law in the country, which takes effect in August, banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

Currently, Texas legislators are battling over a bill that would restrict abortions in the state after 20 weeks. Texas Gov. Rick Perry convened a special legislative session to push the abortion bill through despite state Sen. Wendy Davis’ historic 11-hour filibuster June 25. The session starts July 1 and can last up to 30 days, making it unlikely Texas Democrats will be able to block the bill.

Legislators in eight states passed laws that protect employees’ social media accounts. Individuals no longer have to provide their social media passwords to their employers.

U.S. legislators continue to enact stricter laws involving mobile devices in moving vehicles. Hawaii and West Virginia drivers are now part of the growing number of states that ban the use of handheld devices while driving. Some states banned texting while driving or enacted more stringent punishments for those who try to multitask by texting and driving.

States are also looking to take advantage of mobile devices as four states can now use their smart phone to show proof of car insurance.

Over the past year, Americans learned through leaked top-secret documents about heightened drone surveillance. Six states, including Idaho and Virginia, passed stricter drone laws that take effect Monday. Virginia’s ban prevents authorities from using drones for the next two years.

Other notable laws include:

Washington state lawmakers are stripping the state’s books of sexist language. As of Monday, words that include men will become more gender neutral. For example, “his” will appear as “his or her” and college “freshmen” will become “first-year students.”

Kentucky lifted a longstanding Prohibition-era law that banned the sale of alcohol while the polls were still open. Now, Blue Grass State residents can enjoy a drink on election day.

New Jersey has a checkered past with its relationship with tanning, as the cast of Jersey Shore is famous for its orangey glow. It is one of dozens of states that passed stricter tanning laws to keep minors away from the fake sun. Spray tans for Jersey’s youth are also banned as of July 1.

Wyoming residents can finally take part in the lottery, leaving only a few states that do not offer the big prize drawing.

USA TODAY

So where was Lincoln, exactly?

Where in Gettysburg, exactly, did Lincoln actually deliver his Gettysburg Address on Nov. 19, 1863? A prominent, 1912 monument to the speech by the entrance of the town's National Cemetery leads casual observers to believe it happened there. But look closely: A nearby, vintage plaque says the speech occurred 300 yards away on the spot of another cemetery monument (to fallen soldiers). Except . . . that's not right, either, modern research has found. The true spot, according to research backed by the National Park Service, lies along the crest of a hill just outside the gates of the cemetery, on the grounds of an older, private cemetery.

Lincoln wasn't the keynote speaker

The dignitary who spoke before Lincoln, Edward Everett, delivered what was scheduled as the main speech of the day. The former Massachusetts governor and onetime Secretary of State took two hours navigating its 13,607 words.

The speech was really, really short

Lincoln's speech, a mere 271 words if you use the version that's attributed to Lincoln, took only two minutes. The New York Times reported of the Gettysburg Address: ""It was delivered (or rather read from a sheet of paper which the speaker held in his hand) in a very deliberate manner, with strong emphasis, and with a most business-like air.""

The Gettysburg Address was ridiculed at first

One of the world's best-remembered speeches, it includes the line, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here."" Ridiculed at first in some prominent quarters -- The Chicago Times, for one, citing ""silly, flat and dish-watery utterances"" -- the address is now regarded as one of the finest speeches ever given. In 1963 Martin Luther King Jr., kicking off his ""I Have a Dream"" speech before a crowd of 250,000 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, noted Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation took effect ""five score years ago."" The phrase of course invoked the address whose words were etched into the interior of the monument just a few steps behind the civil rights icon.

Different versions of the speech exist

There are five manuscripts of the speech, and the most widely quoted one is the oldest. The earliest versions were given to his two secretaries, John George Nicholay and John Hay. You can find them at the Library of Congress' web site, myloc.gov."

The state Department of Finance estimates that by the middle of this year, whites and Latinos will each represent about 39% of California population, with Latinos reaching a plurality soon after that.

Officials expect that by 2060, Latinos will make up 48% of the state’s population, compared with 30% for whites. Asians will make up 13% of the population, and blacks 4%.

As the white baby boomer population moves into retirement, Latinos and Asians will play an even bigger role in the state’s labor force, according to the state report.

In 2030, there will be 9.6 million Latinos in the prime working ages of 25 to 64; there will be 7.2 million whites and 3.1 million Asians, the report said. By 2060, there will be 12.1 million Latinos in that working group, compared to 7.4 million whites and 3.2 million Asians.

Experts said these shifts will bring fundamental changes to the demographics of the workplace, as many baby boomers — the majority of whom are white — retire.

“This should serve as a wake-up call and appreciate how the older generation needs the younger generation,” said USC demography and urban planning professor Dowell Myers.

The more educated and prosperous this younger generation is, the more they can contribute to California’s tax base as the baby boomers’ contributions decrease, Myers said.

“Without the babies born to those immigrant mothers, we would really be in deep trouble,” he added.

Myers and others said the projections underscore the importance of education in helping the future workforce be as productive as possible.

The report also predicted a significant age gap among different ethnic groups.

By 2030, there will be 7.2 million Latinos younger than 25 compared to 2.2 million who will be 65 or older. By comparison, 4.1 million of the white population will be 65 or older and 3.8 million will be younger than 25.

The rise of California’s Latino population has been apparent for decades. And news that Latinos will surpass whites in total population has been predicted for some time.

“The projections are a continuation that have been observed for the last 20 years,” said James Allen, professor emeritus at Cal State Northridge.

The report also included some new growth projections for the state.

California’s population will reach nearly 52.7 million by 2060, crossing the 50-million threshold by 2049, the study found.

The population in Los Angeles County will increase by 1.7 million by 2060, an 18% increase from 2010.

The county’s population of whites and blacks will decrease by 25% and 17%, respectively, from 2010 to 2060. The Asian population will increase by 27% and the Latino population will get a 43% boost.

In Orange County, the state projects a 10% population increase by 2060. Ventura County should see a 25% population increase during the same period, officials said.

Rural Imperial County could see its population double by 2060.

""We're hopeful that all of this portends a bigger improvement to the immigration system,"" said Lisa Koop, a managing attorney with the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center.

Several thousand people in the Chicago area stand to benefit from the new rule, which makes it easier for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens to apply for permanent residency by allowing them to sign up for a ""provisional unlawful presence waiver"" while still in this country.

Such waivers can be granted to people who have overstayed their visas or entered the U.S. illegally if they can prove that their families would suffer extreme hardship if they weren't allowed to stay in the country.

The waivers do not guarantee permanent residency status, but without one, illegal immigrants can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years or more.

The policy shift, which takes effect March 4, does away with a requirement that applicants return to their homeland to apply for the waiver. The process can take as long as a year, forcing even those who eventually get a waiver to endure long separations from their families, Obama administration officials said Wednesday.

With no guarantees that their waiver applications would be approved, many immigrants here illegally chose to remain in the shadows rather than be forced to leave their family during the application process, said Fred Tsao, policy director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

At the National Immigrant Justice Center, attorneys are preparing for an influx of cases after the policy goes into effect, Koop said.

Many clients who appear to be eligible for a waiver delayed their application after the new rule was proposed in April, she said.

The new rule still will require applicants to return to their native countries for an interview at a U.S. Consulate after a waiver is approved, Obama administration officials said.

Because an approved waiver application often means a successful immigration application, Koop said, the new rule allows applicants to hedge the risks they take in formally declaring their illegal status.

""If you have this waiver approved and then go down and have your visa interview, unless something else arises at that visa interview, there is a pretty high likelihood that your case will go through pretty smoothly at that point,"" she said.

Simultaneous nominations mark administration%27s more aggressive judicial strategy

For Obama%27s nominations to succeed%2C he must overcome Republican opposition

When George W. Bush left office%2C nearly six in 10 federal judges were GOP nominees

WASHINGTON — President Obama's simultaneous nominations of three judges to fill the nation's most powerful appellate court signals a new chapter in a political battle that's been raging for more than a quarter century.

It has taken Obama well into his fifth year in office to bring the federal judiciary essentially back to even: There are nearly as many judges nominated by Democratic presidents as there are Republican nominees on the bench.

Now the president is poised to make his mark on the federal district and appeals courts in much the same way Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush did — something even his liberal allies lament he has failed to do since 2009.

""This is the first signal that the Obama administration is getting serious or is stepping up its game when it comes to judicial nominations,"" said Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor and conservative legal commentator. ""It has been fair to say that Obama did not make lower-court nominees a priority up until now.""

But for Obama to succeed, he must overcome Republican opposition that has grown more defiant over the years, since Democrats first began blocking Reagan nominees in the late 1980s.

Both sides cite statistics for every stage of the process to make their case: vacancies, nominations, delays, filibusters, confirmations and judicial caseloads. ""The longer you go with these things, the more statistics there are to throw around,"" said Arthur Hellman, a University of Pittsburgh law professor.

What's clear is the partisan trend. When George W. Bush left office, nearly six in 10 federal judges were Republican nominees. Now the GOP edge is 51%-49%; Obama has 3½ years remaining to tilt the courts his way.

""We're clearly at a tipping point in the federal courts, which is why the Republicans are putting up such a fight,"" said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. ""For many years, the Republicans have had an ideological edge in the courts, particularly in some key circuits. Since President Obama's election, that edge is slowly but surely being eroded.""

Still, liberal and conservative advocacy groups agree that recent GOP presidents have taken more of an active interest in turning the federal courts in their direction. ""The Republicans nominate and appoint more conservative people than Democrats nominate and appoint liberal people,"" says University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.

What's less clear is which presidents have been treated more unfairly by their opponents during the Senate confirmation process. That has become a blizzard of data, as the White House cites longer delays for Obama's nominees and Republicans complain about longer appeals-court filibusters under Bush than President Clinton.

Obama's nominations Tuesday of Georgetown law professor Nina Pillard, appellate litigator Patricia Millett and federal District Judge Robert Wilkins focused attention on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that serves as a frequent springboard to the Supreme Court.

The appeals court reviews administration regulations and executive orders and handles controversial issues ranging from the environment to national security — often, in recent years, to the chagrin of the White House.

It has been the scene of bitter nomination battles in the past. Both Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan were blocked, though Roberts eventually won confirmation. Democrats blocked two Bush nominees, Miguel Estrada and Peter Keisler. Republicans blocked Obama's first nominee, Caitlin Halligan of New York, before confirming Sri Srinivasan last month.

The three new nominations, unveiled Tuesday in a grand Rose Garden ceremony befitting a Supreme Court nominee, opened up another statistical battle. The White House argued it simply was seeking to fill three vacancies on the 11-seat court, now operating with eight active judges and six retired ""senior"" judges.

""Imagine if a third of the seats on the highest court — the Supreme Court — were empty,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""We would rightly consider that a judicial crisis.""

Republicans called it an effort to ""pack"" a court that has fewer pending cases per judge than all but two of the 11 other circuit courts, and far fewer filed cases per three-judge panel than any appeals court. By contrast, 33 other district and appellate courts across the nation have caseload problems that qualify as ""judicial emergencies"" by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

""The question (is) whether this circuit court, which is apparently less busy than all but one circuit court in the nation, needs to have a full complement of judges,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.

The Judicial Conference of the United States, headed by Chief Justice Roberts, wants them filled — along with the D.C. Circuit. That's where Obama has decided to make his fight.

""He's playing for the long term here,"" Hellman said. ""He sees his legacy as being decided to some substantial extent by the D.C. Circuit."""

(CNN) —

More new judges. Faster appointments to top government jobs. Revised regulations and rules reflecting government policy.

Those are the practical impacts from the nuclear option Senate Democrats approved to end filibusters of most presidential nominations and appointments.

Obama supports Senate’s nuclear option to end some filibusters

The politics of the move are messy, with majority Democrats saying it was needed to end unprecedented obstruction by minority Republicans, and Republicans contending it was a power grab.

Both sides are right, at least in part. Here are five things that will change because of the move:

1. Easing Senate gridlock

First and foremost, eliminating the ability of senators to block most nominations means the majority party – in this case Democrats – can hold votes and approve presidential nominations and appointments more quickly.

Before the rule change, minority senators could mount a filibuster that required 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome. With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority, the filibuster served as an effective minority veto.

Once a rare maneuver of specific opposition, the filibuster has become routine, especially since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.

According to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who spearheaded Thursday’s nuclear option rule change, there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in Senate history, with about half of them occurring during the Obama administration.

In the Senate’s first move after the 52-48 vote Thursday to change the rules, it ended a filibuster against one of Obama’s three nominees for a key federal appeals court in Washington who had been blocked by Republicans.

The altered filibuster rules also will apply when the day comes that Republicans hold the Senate majority, a fact emphasized by GOP leaders who decried the change.

“This changes everything,” veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters Thursday. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: “They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.”

What is the nuclear option?

2. More new judges

Obama and Democrats have complained for months that Republicans prevented the President from filling three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s second most important judicial body behind the Supreme Court because it handles many major government-related cases.

The D.C. appeals court became the focal point of the filibuster issue, with Republicans blocking the three Obama nominees to prevent a more liberal-leaning majority on the panel that now has eight judges –four considered conservative and four considered more liberal. GOP leaders argue the court caseload doesn’t require any more judges on the panel.

Now, the three Obama nominees – Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Cornelia Pillard – are likely to get Senate approval to join the D.C. court in coming weeks or months. Upcoming cases the court could consider include challenges to tougher EPA limits on carbon emissions and other regulatory issues.

The Senate rule change specifically exempted Supreme Court nominations, meaning they still can be filibustered, though some Republicans argue that no such distinction exists.

If Reid “changes the rules for some judicial nominees, he is effectively changing them for all judicial nominees, including the Supreme Court,” conservative GOP Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said. “Apparently the other side wants to change the rules while still preserving the ability to block a Republican President’s ability to replace a liberal Supreme Court Justice with an originalist.”

Both sides have been guilty of political hijinks over judicial nominees in the past.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Republicans who held the Senate majority in 2005 threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of Bush’s judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.

Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time, saying on the Senate floor that “in the long run, it is not a good result for either party.”

Asked about Obama’s past stance compared with his support Thursday for Reid’s move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees as the reason for needing to get the Senate working again.

“The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,” Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today, and that many of the President’s nominees have bipartisan support but can’t get an up-or-down Senate vote.

Grassley, however, noted that almost half of the 93 judicial vacancies today lack a nominee by the President.

3. Executive branch appointments

When Obama nominated Chuck Hagel as his defense secretary, the choice seemed safe from major Republican opposition in the Senate because Hagel himself was a former Republican senator.

However, the bitter partisan divide of Washington brought a GOP filibuster that initially prevented a final vote – the first time in history that a defense secretary nominee had been blocked.

“What seems to be happening, and this has been growing over time, is the Republican minority in the Senate seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything,” Obama complained at the time.

The rule change means that Obama and future presidents will be able to fill Cabinet posts and agency leadership positions more freely so long as their party controls the Senate.

However, if divided government means the president is of a different party than the Senate majority, look for even more obstruction of such appointments in the future.

4. Rules and regulations

A major target of Republican political attacks now is Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and despised by the political right.

In her job, Sebelius oversees the setting of regulations and rules under the Affordable Care Act, just like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy is considering regulations on greenhouse gas emissions opposed by Republicans.

That’s what agency and department heads do, and the ending of minority filibusters against a president’s nomination will mean faster implementation of an administration’s policies.

By essentially lubricating the nomination process, the rule change increases the chances of more “Ping Pong politics” in the future, with each new administration undoing regulations and policies of predecessors under the opposite party.

Man who coined the term ‘nuclear option’ regrets ever pursuing it

5. Thorny politics

The Senate rules change applies only to appointments and nominations, not legislation. While some Democrats call for a similar move to apply to proposed laws, such a step remains highly unlikely.

However, Republicans warn that the rule change will harm the political relationships between senators of different parties that can lead to bipartisan agreements and cooperation on drafting and passing laws.

“There’s still quite a bit of legislation that goes through the United States Senate, and it’s done on the basis of people’s agreement and work with one another across the aisle,” McCain told CNN on Thursday. “There are going to be difficulties from time to time where cooperation was probably the case in the past and will not be now.”

With the Republican-controlled House already an opposition bulwark against Obama and Democrats, the President needs the Senate to have any chance to push forward his agenda.

What remains unclear is how much the nuclear option will stiffen Senate Republican resolve to join their generally more hardcore House conservative colleagues in efforts to repeal or dismantle Obamacare, prevent immigration reform and other policy stances.

“We’re not going to shut down the Senate,” McCain said, then adding that “we’re going to focus on trying to repair ObamaCare, which is plaguing the lives of millions of Americans.”

There is a lot to learn from this mistake for the entire organization. We have rebuilt CBS News in a way that has dramatically improved our reporting abilities. Ironically 60 Minutes, which has been a model for those changes, fell short by broadcasting a now discredited account of an important story, and did not take full advantage of the reporting abilities of CBS News that might have prevented it from happening.

As a result, I have asked Lara Logan, who has distinguished herself and has put herself in harm’s way many times in the course of covering stories for us, to take a leave of absence, which she has agreed to do. I have asked the same of producer Max McClellan, who also has a distinguished career at CBS News.

As Executive Producer, I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything, but this deception got through and it shouldn’t have.

When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger. We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again.

There is a lot of pride at CBS News. Every broadcast is working hard to live up to the high standard set at CBS News for excellence in reporting. This was a regrettable mistake. But there are many fine professionals at 60 Minutes who produce some of the very best of broadcast journalism, covering the important and interesting stories of our times, and they will continue to do so each and every Sunday.

Executive Producer, 60 Minutes



SUMMARY OF FINDINGS



My review found that the Benghazi story aired by 60 Minutes on October 27 was deficient in several respects:



--From the start, Lara Logan and her producing team were looking for a different angle to the story of the Benghazi attack. They believed they found it in the story of Dylan Davies, written under the pseudonym, “Morgan Jones”. It purported to be the first western eyewitness account of the attack. But Logan’s report went to air without 60 Minutes knowing what Davies had told the FBI and the State Department about his own activities and location on the night of the attack.

--The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired. But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.



--Members of the 60 Minutes reporting team conducted interviews with Davies and other individuals in his book, including the doctor who received and treated Ambassador Stevens at the Benghazi hospital. They went to Davies’ employer Blue Mountain, the State Department, the FBI (which had interviewed Davies), and other government agencies to ask about their investigations into the attack. Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.

--Davies told 60 Minutes that he had lied to his own employer that night about his location, telling Blue Mountain that he was staying at his villa, as his superior ordered him to do, but telling 60 Minutes that he then defied that order and went to the compound. This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.

--After the story aired, the Washington Post reported the existence of a so-called “incident report” that had been prepared by Davies for Blue Mountain in which he reportedly said he spent most of the night at his villa, and had not gone to the hospital or the mission compound. Reached by phone, Davies told the 60 Minutes team that he had not written the incident report, disavowed any knowledge of it, and insisted that the account he gave 60 Minutes was word for word what he had told the FBI. Based on that information and the strong conviction expressed by the team about their story, Jeff Fager defended the story and the reporting to the press.

--On November 7, the New York Times informed Fager that the FBI’s version of Davies’ story differed from what he had told 60 Minutes. Within hours, CBS News was able to confirm that in the FBI’s account of their interview, Davies was not at the hospital or the mission compound the night of the attack. 60 Minutes announced that a correction would be made, that the broadcast had been misled, and that it was a mistake to include Davies in the story. Later a State Department source also told CBS News that Davies had stayed at his villa that night and had not witnessed the attack.

--Questions have been raised about the recent pictures from the compound which were displayed at the end of the report, including a picture of Ambassador Stevens’ schedule for the day after the attack. Video taken by the producer-cameraman whom the 60 Minutes team sent to the Benghazi compound last month clearly shows that the pictures of the Technical Operations Center were authentic, including the picture of the schedule in the debris.

--Questions have also been raised about the role of Al Qaeda in the attack since Logan declared in the report that Al Qaeda fighters had carried it out. Al Qaeda’s role is the subject of much disagreement and debate. While Logan had multiple sources and good reasons to have confidence in them, her assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.

--In October of 2012, one month before starting work on the Benghazi story, Logan made a speech in which she took a strong public position arguing that the US Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda, and urging actions that the US should take in response to the Benghazi attack. From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story.

--The book, written by Davies and a co-author, was published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, part of the CBS Corporation. 60 Minutes erred in not disclosing that connection in the segment.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/09/Mike-Lee-Tea-Party-heading-to-Philadelphia-from-Boston-taking-government-over-to-shape-America-s-future,2013-11-09 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Exclusive — Mike Lee Lays Out Road Forward for Tea Party in Iowa,"In a speech Saturday evening to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition at the group’s 13th annual fall banquet in Des Moines, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) argued that now is the time for the Tea Party movement to take its next steps, take control of American government, and frame America’s future with a focus on conservative and liberty-minded principles.

Lee compared the movement’s next stages to those of the American revolution, noting how the earliest stages of revolution began in Boston with the Boston Tea Party, where a band of protesters dumped British tea in the Boston Harbor as a sign of disapproval of the high taxes the British had levied on them. That eventually turned into the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia after Americans fought and won their independence from the British.

“In order to chart our course forward, join me on a journey back,” Lee said in the speech, according to an advance copy provided to Breitbart News. “Back to a time when the people of this continent were just as frustrated with their oppressive government as all of us here tonight are with the Federal government today.”

Lee noted that in 1773, “a group of Americans had had it with the King George establishment which was too big, too expensive and too intrusive in their lives.”

“What would become known as the Boston Tea Party became a clarion cry against the kind of government the colonists did not want,” Lee said. “It turned out to be a pretty important party and a very big deal. But had they stopped at just protesting against the kind of government they didn’t want the Boston Tea Party would not have been even a footnote in history. It would have been just one more vain protest against an oppressive federal establishment.”

Lee explained how the Founding Fathers of America “pressed forward from Boston” and continued their protest and “began a journey toward the kind of government they did want” instead of just protesting a government they disliked.

“It took them 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where in 1787 they created, in the Constitution, the kind of government they did want,” Lee said. “Boston to Philadelphia. That is a good model for us to follow today.”

Lee argued that the Tea Party movement and conservatives must always fight against “bad government,” but that the movement must also find a way forward to fight for the right kind of government. “While we must always challenge and fight against bad government we must also be found promoting and pursing the policy path toward the kind of federal government we do want and the people deserve,” Lee said. “Unfortunately with this administration we have, of necessity, had a lot of Boston battles – from fiscal cliffs and attacks on our 2nd amendment rights to sequester and of course, Obamacare.”

“So let me be clear – we will never back down from a Boston moment – and we will never stop rallying the American people to fight those battles,” he explained. “But it is just as important to keep our eyes in the direction of Philadelphia and the principles and policies which will lead us ultimately to the kind of government we do want.”

According to Des Moines Register, Lee was in Iowa to rally conservatives for the next phases of the battle ahead. He is not running for president–“absolutely not” he answered when asked by the Iowa paper if he would consider a White House bid. Instead, what Lee is doing is becoming the intellectual leader of the conservatives in the U.S. Senate.

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), the conservatives with whom Lee usually keeps company, are each potential presidential candidates in 2016. Lee is not, and that puts him in a unique position to focus on accomplishing building the conservative movement and a future message for the Republican Party.

In the past few weeks, Lee has developed a new agenda for the GOP focused on populism. Matt Continetti noted in the Weekly Standard that Lee argued that in a recent speech delivered to the Heritage Foundation, “Candidates need policy ideas that address the concerns of ordinary voters–and they have to campaign, and win, on those ideas.”

Lee’s goal, as he said in the Iowa speech on Saturday, is to help the GOP and the conservative movement develop a platform from which to win the hearts and minds of voters, and more importantly, get the country back on the track to prosperity.

“To deserve victory, conservatives have to do more than pick a fight,” Lee said. “We have to win a debate. And to do that, we need more than just guts. We need an agenda.”

“It is a long march from Boston to Philadelphia,” he added. “And make no mistake – there are more Boston battles ahead and ‘we the people’ must always be ready to stand up and speak out against the kind of government we do not want. Bad government and bad policy must always be hit, and stopped, head on. Likewise, we must always have the vision of Philadelphia before us – a vision and an agenda for the type of government and they kind of country we do want.”

This has been Lee’s plan since he was elected in 2010, and he is executing it step by step. In 2010, in his election night victory speech, Lee also made the argument that the Tea Party movement needs to travel from Boston to Philadelphia."

A terrific ad, if you ask me. And, yes, I'm biased.

The plan was for the ad to run during President Obama's Tuesday appearance as Jay Leno's guest on the Tonight Show. Garofoli writes:



“After a careful review,” a station spokesman said, “it was determined that this ad violates our guidelines. We have communicated that to the advertiser.” Declining to air an ad rarely happens. (A TV station turning down money? C’mon, now.) Here’s where the ad may have run into trouble, according to NBC‘s advertising guidelines, it was seen as an attack of a personal nature. Quipped someone close to the ad team: “Did we hurt the pipeline’s feelings?” No, more like it was directed at TransCanada CEO Russ Girling.

General Standard for Acceptance:

We do not make judgments on an advertiser’s opinions, and we accept issue advertisements that express divergent points of view. We do, however, reserve the right to require substantiation of factual claims made by an advertiser. Advertisements generally will be accepted if there is a basis for the claims and such claims fall within the bounds of reasonable debate. Unacceptable Content:

An advertisement may be rejected if its content, or other content referenced in the ad or otherwise disseminated by the advertiser, is grossly offensive (e.g., on racial, religious or ethnic grounds). An advertisement may also be rejected if: (1) it is merely an attack of a personal nature, a direct attack on an individual business or a comment on a private dispute; or (2) it contains violent or otherwise graphic or potentially offensive content that is deemed incompatible with a network’s viewing environment or general standards; or (3) its content or style of production is otherwise deemed inconsistent with a network’s viewing environment or general standards, as determined by a network in its sole discretion. An acceptance may be subject to limitations regarding time period and type of programming

The guidelines:Lots of wiggle room there to reject just about anything the powers-that-be want to reject. Those powers-that-be include, of course, the fossil-fuel industry with its hefty advertising budget. The industry ads, of course, are all daffodils and tra-la-la-la, never anything offensive in them at all, nuh uh.

Please join Daily Kos and the Natural Resources Defense Council in urging President Obama to keep his promise and reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline."

After threatening to change the rules several times this year, the Democratic majority pulled the trigger on the so-called nuclear option after a series of procedural maneuvers that played out before a packed chamber. It would allow a president’s nominees, except for seats on the Supreme Court, to be confirmed by a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold that had become the norm.

Fifty-two senators voted in favor of the changes, with 48 voting in opposition.

Just three Democrats — red-state Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, as well as veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan — opposed the move.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) argued that the change was needed in the face of unprecedented Republican obstruction of nominees, which prevented the president from fulfilling his constitutional duty to fill vacancies in the courts, as well as in his administration.

More broadly, he argued that the Senate threatened to become “obsolete” if it did not act to end gridlock.

“The gridlock has consequences,” he said in opening the debate. “It’s not only bad for President Obama, bad for this body, the United States Senate, it’s bad for our country.”

Reid acknowledged that neither party’s hands were “clean” in the fight. When Democrats were in the minority nearly two decades ago, they fiercely resisted a Republican attempt to make the same rule change Democrats implemented Thursday.

But times had changed, he argued.

“Can anyone say that the Senate is working now?” he asked. “I don’t think so.”

Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to change the subject from the problematic rollout of Obama’s healthcare law.

“It doesn’t distract people from Obamacare, it reminds them of Obamacare,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, following Reid at the lectern. “It only reinforces the narrative of a party that is willing to do and say just about anything to get its way.”

Republicans also argued that Democrats were “breaking the rules to change the rules,” by using a simple majority vote rather than a two-thirds vote, as Senate rules state. Democrats believe they are on firm footing, however, since the Constitution allows the Senate to make or change its own rules at any time.

The unprecedented action injected unusual drama into the historic Senate chamber. At one point Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), arguably the body’s leading centrist, could be seen pleading with Reid to pull back from his threat.

In the short term, the Democrats’ action paves the way for the confirmation of Obama’s three pending appointments to the important D.C. Circuit court, beginning with Patricia Millett, whose nomination was the vehicle for Thursday’s action. Democrats could also apply the rule change to other executive nominations that have been blocked, like Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.), Obama’s pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

The long-term consequences are less clear. The Democrats’ move amounts to a gamble that Republicans will not regain both the White House and control of the Senate by 2016. If they did, the GOP would likely abide by the same new rules to confirm nominees opposed by Democrats.

Looming more immediately is a possible vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court that would occur during Obama’s final years in office. Democrats’ decision to exempt high court appointments from the rules change might nonetheless give Republicans additional motivation to block whomever he chooses.

I don't know how many people they arrested today. I saw two men arrested with their school aged children following close behind. Some people were arrested more than once. Through this all we sang.

I cried because my friends were unjustly arrested and some of them were hurt. I cried because I've worked really hard lately and I'm tired and going to the Capitol is what I do on my days off.

They're all horrible, disgusting people. I actually like Wall Street people, with whom I also familiar, more than I like Beltway people. At least with Wall Streeters the motivations are clear. Spend some time around both groups and you'll agree.

But when I read this piece by quintessential beltway insiders Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei attempt at self-reporting, the level bile building up in my throat couldn't be kept down by my morning coffee. Just listen to them:



Talk about incestuous: A top Obama official cashes in with a top corporation with the help of a top Washington fixer and gets top-shelf treatment from one of Washington’s top journalists (who also happens to be the co-byline on this piece.)

Haddad may regret it, too. Leibovich asked a lot of questions about how the former TV producer courts the powerful. He focused on Haddad’s relentless promotion and fundraising for CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), founded by Susan Axelrod, the wife of David Axelrod. Leibovich portrays this as a blatant effort to curry favor – a bald execution of the theory that you build connections to the powerful by finding out what interests the people around them. David Axelrod is distressed by the expected portrayal and told us: “Tammy has been a great friend to Susan and me, and I think very sincere about it. She has never asked me for anything in return.” Haddad did not give Leibovich a formal interview but the two recently had a clear-the-air lunch at The Jefferson hotel. Leibovich seemed suspicious of Haddad’s presence on Air Force One when Jon Meacham of Newsweek, then one of her clients, had an interview with President Obama. But Haddad has told friends it’s perfectly normal to accompany clients to interviews she has helped arrange. She declined to comment. For what it’s worth, Haddad is a friend who has thrown parties for us. Come to think of it, she has thrown parties for virtually every other person and cause we know.

Yes, its so awful you want to throw your tablet at some ""strategist"" right? Well hold on to it because it gets much, much worse:This doesn't deserve analysis. This deserves nothing but the purest forms of hateful insults.

These people are the problem in our nations Capitol. Washington has come to be dominated by an elite class of tightly connected social-climbing nihilists. They promote inertia, because inertia is their gravy train. Their kids go to the right private schools, their salaries paid by an ever growing list of people who move effortlessly between government, the press, and corporate employment justified by their expensive connections made in college, thanks to their parents...who are also people just like them.

If you decide you want to be civic minded and run for office, you too will run into these people. They'll be sent to you by a party campaign committee. Then, if you can get successfully trained by handlers (same people) to say the right things, they'll use their connections to get you interviews with the media, who are also the same people. Then you can spend many hours of your day calling donors, who also have staffs of people who know your people. Then you'll use the money you raise to pay other people, who are also friends of theirs, to run your campaign. And if you win, those people will introduce you to other people who will run your office. And those people will make sure you meet other people so that you get the right assignments, so that those can people can then tell other people that they have influence over you. Because they do. And if you do this for two or three terms in office, you'll cycle through a bunch of people like these whom you will see far more than any of your constituents. Then one day, you'll look up at a committee hearing, reading a statement prepared by your people, telling you what to say and how to vote. And you will have totally forgotten why you decided to come there in the first place, having accomplished little to nothing, while watching all your people get rich in the process. And then you will retire and decide its time to get yours. You will become your people.

This is why all of them make me want to vomit.

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.']",Obama highlights common ground with Pope Francis,"WASHINGTON — When a White House speechwriter turned in a draft of a major speech on economic policy this month, President Obama sent it back with an unusual instruction: Add a reference to the pope.

The final version of the speech quoted directly from Pope Francis’ recent letter to the faithful: “How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses 2 points?” he said.

The citation marked a notable development in Obama’s complex and sometimes confrontational relationship with the Roman Catholic Church: After several years of high-profile clashes with U.S. bishops, Obama is seizing the chance to highlight common ground with the bishop of Rome.

Quoting the pope isn’t likely to yield direct electoral dividends for Obama’s party — the once-vaunted “Catholic vote” largely disappeared long ago. But in a string of effusive praise, the president has made clear he sees the pope as a like-minded thinker and potentially useful ally in a crucial battle of ideas, particularly on the importance of shrinking the gulf between rich and poor, a subject Obama has pushed repeatedly but with limited success.

White House officials described the president’s praise of the pope as merely a happy coincidence with no political motives. Obama, who has never spoken to Francis, simply found the pontiff’s recent statements impressive, they said.

“It’s something that is very much on the president’s mind,” said Cecilia Muñoz, chief domestic policy advisor to the president. “And, happily for us, it’s something that’s also on the pope’s mind.”

Some Catholic leaders see a mixed blessing. The Rev. Larry Snyder, president of Catholic Charities USA, said he was pleased to see Obama, like so many others, praise the pope’s message.

He noted that the language of the president’s speeches had long echoed some Catholic social teachings and that the church and the White House had found common ground on several issues, including immigration reform and support for social service programs. White House officials emphasized that same point. But Snyder expressed wariness about thrusting Francis’ words into the political fray.

“The danger I see in it is that the pope is not a politician,” Snyder said. “When the pope speaks, there’s a consistent teaching. And the danger would be other people pick and choose, ‘I like this, but I don’t like that.’”

American presidents and politicians have a long history of doing just that. A host of Democrats have clashed with the bishops over abortion. President Reagan worked in tandem with Pope John Paul II to loosen the Soviet Union’s hold on Eastern Europe but paid little heed to U.S. bishops’ opposition to his nuclear buildup.

President George W. Bush borrowed the phrase “culture of life,” made famous by John Paul II, to discuss his antiabortion stance, without noting the pope’s teaching against the death penalty, which Bush carried out several times as governor of Texas.

Obama’s interest in the pope’s message on economic justice surfaced in early October during a television interview. In response to a question from CNBC’s John Harwood, the president said he had “been hugely impressed with the pope’s pronouncements” and Francis’ “incredible sense of empathy to the least of these, to the poor.” White House officials said aides had not prepped Obama in advance on the pope’s writings.

This month, Obama went further, saying in an interview on MSNBC that Francis was showing himself to be an “extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”

Aides, who would describe White House discussions only on condition of anonymity, said Obama had talked about the pope with members of his inner circle, which includes Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, a Catholic whose brother Kevin is a priest and former high-ranking official in the archdiocese in St. Paul, Minn.

The president, the aides said, has read the ample news coverage of the pope’s activities, including reports on Francis’ apostolic exhortation on economic justice, which was his first major writing since he became head of the church in March.

Obama, a Christian who attended a Congregationalist church before coming to Washington and now occasionally attends an Episcopal church near the White House, has shown interest in Catholic thinkers and teaching before.

His push for universal access to healthcare won support from some Catholic groups that was crucial to its passage. But the healthcare law has also been at the center of a long-running and difficult fight with the church.

U.S. bishops have criticized the White House for the provision in the law that requires employers — including some Catholic institutions, although not churches — to offer health insurance that covers birth control.

Although the rule exempts religiously affiliated institutions from paying directly for birth-control coverage, several religious groups argue it still violates their religious freedom. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear one challenge to that aspect of the law, which takes effect in January.

The rift has created “major problems” in the White House’s relationship with the church, said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The law’s distinction between churches, which are exempt, and other institutions such as schools and hospitals creates a “two-tier” church, diminishing the status of the groups that carry out the mission Francis has been emphasizing, she said.

“President Obama and many others quote Pope Francis these days based on the pope’s concern for the poor. This concern is a core component of our religion and we should not have to compromise it to continue to serve the common good,” she said.

Some observers have noted possible personal parallels between the superstar pope and the onetime superstar politician. One is riding a tide of goodwill generated by the sort of promise of hope and change that has ebbed for the other.

“I think world leaders are impressed by someone who got into office and immediately avoided the trappings of that office,” said Michael Peppard, who teaches about politics and the papacy at Fordham University.

“People who are in power are in awe of that and have a lot of respect for that. I think Obama probably wants to tap into some of the energy, and tap into some of it for his own message.”

To others, Obama’s interest in the pope exemplifies the way some liberals, cheered by Francis’ new focus, have expressed their hope for a church that puts less emphasis on issues like abortion or gay rights and more on immigration, welfare or poverty programs.

Obama is the “preeminent example of a liberal falling in love with Francis,” said Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame.

Of course, even praise for the pope’s economic liberalism comes with caveats. The day after Obama praised the pope in his speech, he made clear in the MSNBC interview that he didn’t share all of Francis’ critique of capitalist culture.

“We live in a market economy that is the greatest generator of wealth in history. We’re risk takers. We’re entrepreneurs. And we’re rugged individualists,” Obama said.

Said Moss: “It must be amazing for him to have the opportunity to say, ‘I’m a little more right wing than Pope Francis.’”

In California, overhaul advocates in caravans from around the state descended on the Bakersfield office of the No. 3 Republican in the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy. In Colorado, they marched in the streets. Religious leaders told GOP lawmakers stories of families torn apart by deportation. Business executives made the case in economic terms. One group even lobbied Donald Trump.

To a degree, it worked: Several Republican lawmakers have recently tipped to their side, which advocates say is building momentum.

But privately, both backers of revamping the nation’s immigration laws and top Republicans say 500 or so events did little to alter internal House GOP dynamics. The prospects for significant action when Congress returns Monday appear increasingly dim.

With just nine legislative days planned in the House in September, GOP lawmakers are expected to focus on whether to authorize a strike against Syria and then turn to the battle over the federal budget, which is likely to consume their schedule.

House Republicans remain deeply divided on immigration, and they see little urgent need to resolve it. Some have even begun to talk about pushing the debate well into next year so the primary elections will be behind them before any vote.

At an immigration forum last month in Arizona, Republican Sen. John McCain, a chief architect of the sweeping Senate-passed immigration bill, urged his party to tackle the issue this fall.

“It will be a very critical time in the life or death of this legislation,” McCain said. “It’s very important that we try and act before the end of this year, as we move into next year and an election season.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) may make room for a floor debate on several Republican-backed immigration bills in October or November. But his Republican majority remains torn over the centerpiece of any compromise with Democrats — a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.

The lack of interest in immigration legislation was apparent on a recent House GOP conference call. Not a single Republican lawmaker raised the issue; they focused instead on ways to undo President Obama’s healthcare law as part of the upcoming fiscal showdown, according to aides familiar with the private talk.

“A lot of these members aren’t feeling any pressure on immigration,” said one of the top GOP aides in the House, who asked for anonymity to discuss the situation. “Nothing has happened to provide any momentum toward getting something enacted.”

That suggests how hard it will be to shift the GOP’s long-standing opposition to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Republican leaders say they believe a course correction is necessary to improve the party’s standing with Latino and other minority voters. But many rank-and-file Republicans remain wary.

A number of Republican lawmakers represent primarily conservative, white districts, and are just now learning about the complex and politically charged topic.

“They’re finding their voice,” said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate with America’s Voice. “Will those Republicans who want to get reform done, who want to change the GOP — can they get to yes?”

A delay poses political problems for Republicans, leaving the party still struggling to achieve its stated goal of attracting Latino voters, many of whom view an overhaul of immigration rules as crucial.

“Time is not their friend,” Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said of Republicans. The union has many Latino members and is pushing for immigration law changes.

Medina said Boehner risked taking the GOP in the direction of former California Gov. Pete Wilson, who won reelection in 1994 on a tough anti-illegal-immigration platform but left the state GOP deeply wounded.

“The price of doing nothing is not always nothing,” Medina said. “We will be marching to the polls with a report card in hand and a message: If they want us to vote for them, they have to vote for us first.”

Boehner has complicated matters by promising to consider only legislation that is supported by a majority of his GOP conference. That high hurdle means it is possible that no bills will come to the floor.

Even a relatively popular bipartisan measure to beef up border security from Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) could run into resistance. Some Republicans have vowed to block any immigration bill in the House.

At the same time, the ability of the unusually broad coalition of advocates to outnumber the scant opposition this summer shows how much attitudes have changed. The last attempt to overhaul immigration laws, in 2007, withered in the face of an intense backlash. But advocates have prepared for the long haul.

“I think it looks better than any time I’ve seen it for a while,” said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the free-market Cato Institute.

At a recent town hall meeting in a fire station in Greer, S.C., Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Republican first elected in 2010, surveyed his constituents and learned they were skeptical of government’s ability to fix the problem. Many also do not view it as urgent. But they do think conservatives should offer solutions.

“What I’m hearing people say is, ‘Look, Gowdy, we might eventually want to have that conversation with you, but we just don’t trust the front part.’ And I get that,” he said. “So that’s where we are.”

Jodean Elliot-Blakeslee, a 69-year-old physician from Boise, has been missing since Sept. 21, when she and friend Amelia Linkert did not return from a camping trip. The body of Linkert, 63, was found four days later, but Blakeslee remains missing. Park officials asked for and received a waiver to keep 10 highly-trained rangers on hand for the search, in addition to a three-person skeleton crew, although none know if they will be paid.

[pullquote]

“The shutdown has certainly complicated things, and we’re all on non-pay status at this point,” Ted Stout, chief of interpretation and education at the monument, told FoxNews.com. “There’s a lot of questions as to how this all works, questions as to whether or not we’ll be paid … It’s another complicating factor.”

Despite uncertainty from Washington, Stout's boss, Craters of the Moon National Monument & Preserve Superintendent Dan Buckley, told FoxNews.com his team insisted on continuing the search, which is now focused on an area of the park known as Derelict Lava Flow.

""I’m proud of them for stepping up and saying we need to continue the search,” Buckley said. “We’re working closely with the family and we’d love to see this thing come to closure — today if we could.”

On Monday, relatives of Blakeslee called on experienced hikers to join the search in central and eastern Idaho, where rugged topography and unpredictable weather can make conditions difficult.

“We realize the chance of Dr. Jo surviving in temperatures that have dipped below freezing are slim,” the statement read. “However, we are not ruling out the outside chance that she has found shelter in a cave or under vegetation. Either way, we are committed to bringing her home and are actively recruiting volunteers with backcountry experience to keep the search going.”

Due to the treacherous terrain, relatives asked that volunteers be able to hike up to 12 miles and climb at least 1,000 feet on rocky slopes.

Teresa Hampton, a friend of Elliott-Blakeslee, told the Idaho Statesman that she received a few calls early Tuesday from volunteers seeking to join the search effort.

“The government shutdown does put another wrinkle into this situation,” Hampton told the newspaper. “It’s another challenge, but it’s not one that can’t be overcome.”

Meanwhile, the search in remote Washington state for Kristopher Zitzewitz, missing in the Gofford Pinchot National Forest, has been suspended pending further information that could aid the effort.

Skamania County Undersheriff Dave Cox told FoxNews.com that in national forests inside the state, the local county sheriff has lead jurisdiction in such searches. Cox said his department sometimes gets specialized help from U.S. Forest Service crews though it has not in the current cases.

“Even though the Forest Service is shut down, we are able to continue,” Cox said. “The federal government shutdown has not hampered the ability of the Skamania County Sheriff’s Office to perform search operations as we normally would.”

Zitzewitz, of Portland, Ore., was last seen in the Big Lava Bed in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwestern Washington. He and a friend, Caleb Richie, were looking for caves in the area when they became separated on Saturday. Richie made it out safely.

Anothher hiker missing in a separate case, Alejandrea Wilson, was found by the Skamania County Sheriff's Department in waist-deep snow but alive earlier this week. Wilson was hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, a path from Mexico to Canada that cuts through seven national forests or parks."

http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/suit-offers-a-peek-at-the-practice-of-padding-a-legal-bill/,2013-03-25 00:00:00,['Peter Lattman'],Suit Offers a Peek at the Practice of Inflating a Legal Bill,"Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times

They were lawyers at the world’s largest law firm, trading casual e-mails about a client’s case. One made a sarcastic joke about how the bill was running way over budget. Another described a colleague’s approach to the assignment as “churn that bill, baby!”

The e-mails, which emerged in a court filing late last week, provide a window into the thorny issue of law firm billing. The documents are likely to reinforce a perception held by many corporate clients — and the public — that law firms inflate bills by performing superfluous tasks and overstaffing assignments.

The internal correspondence of the law firm, DLA Piper, was disclosed in a fee dispute between the law firm and Adam H. Victor, an energy industry executive. After DLA Piper sued Mr. Victor for $675,000 in unpaid legal bills, Mr. Victor filed a counterclaim, accusing the law firm of a “sweeping practice of overbilling.”

Mr. Victor’s feud with DLA Piper began after he retained the firm in April 2010 to prepare a bankruptcy filing for one of his companies. A month after the filing, a lawyer at the firm warned colleagues that the businessman’s bill was mounting.

“I hear we are already 200k over our estimate — that’s Team DLA Piper!” wrote Erich P. Eisenegger, a lawyer at the firm.

Another DLA Piper lawyer, Christopher Thomson, replied, noting that a third colleague, Vincent J. Roldan, had been enlisted to work on the matter.

“Now Vince has random people working full time on random research projects in standard ‘churn that bill, baby!’ mode,” Mr. Thomson wrote. “That bill shall know no limits.”

A DLA Piper spokesman said the firm did not comment on pending litigation.

Legal ethics scholars said that it was highly unusual to find documentary evidence of possible churning — the creation of unnecessary work to drive up a client’s bill.

Stephen Gillers, who teaches professional responsibility at New York University Law School, called the e-mails a troubling example of lawyers’ flip attitudes toward a client’s escalating fees. And he noted that they had come to light at a time when corporations are increasingly rejecting the billable hour standard and becoming vigilant about controlling skyrocketing legal expenses.

William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law who specializes in billing ethics, said that the DLA Piper e-mails appeared to support what several of his studies had shown: that churning, while not endemic, is an insidious problem in the legal profession.

In a survey of about 250 lawyers that Professor Ross conducted in 2007, more than half acknowledged that the prospect of billing extra time influenced their decision to perform pointless assignments, such as doing excessive legal research or extraneous document review. There is also the issue of “featherbedding,” he said, or throwing armies of bodies at every problem.

“Lawyers sometimes conflate their own financial interests with the interests of the client who pays the bills,” Professor Ross said. “Of course, most lawyers are ethical, but the billable hour creates perverse incentives.”

The three DLA Piper lawyers who wrote the e-mails have since left the firm. Mr. Eisenegger and Mr. Roldan, who now work for other law firms, did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Thomson, now a government lawyer, declined to comment. Their departures had nothing to do with the Victor case, according to people briefed on the matter.

The fee dispute centers on DLA Piper’s representation of Mr. Victor in a Chapter 11 filing for one of his holdings, Project Orange Associates, the operator of a power plant in Syracuse that provided steam to Syracuse University. Mr. Victor, the chief executive of TransGas Development Systems, which is based in New York, said that his fight over the Project Orange bill was the culmination of a relationship that had deteriorated over the last decade as DLA Piper undertook a breathtaking expansion.

He said that when he first started working with DLA Piper in the late 1990s, the firm was a modest size and went by the name Piper Rudnick. Mr. Victor had a point person at the firm, Nicolai J. Sarad, a partner in the energy industry practice.

But as DLA Piper grew, Mr. Sarad began spending less time on his assignments, Mr. Victor said. Mr. Sarad did not respond to a request for comment.

Through acquisitions, joint ventures and the aggressive hiring of partners from other firms, DLA Piper has grown into a global monolith of 4,200 lawyers in more than 30 countries, making it the world’s largest firm by lawyer count. Last year, it posted revenue of $2.25 billion, according to The American Lawyer magazine.

“As the firm got bigger, there were all of these lawyers who I didn’t know suddenly showing up on my bills,” Mr. Victor said.

He said he was particularly irked by the routine practice of DLA Piper partners farming out assignments to the firm’s junior lawyers. He complained that this resulted in higher bills and often subpar work.

Internal DLA Piper e-mails from the Project Orange bankruptcy appear to corroborate that criticism. Lawyers on the case openly discussed the inefficient use of junior lawyers, who are known as associates. Mr. Thomson, a DLA Piper lawyer, wrote that although the firm had reduced the amount of a bill for Mr. Victor, he expected his fees to escalate.

“DLA seems to love to lowball the bills and with the number of bodies being thrown at this thing it’s going to stay stupidly high and with the absurd litigation P.O.A. has been in for years it does have lots of wrinkles,” Mr. Thomson wrote.

Later, Mr. Thomson complained that DLA Piper associates were taking too long to complete assignments. “It took all of them four days to write those motions while I did cash collateral and talked to the client and learned the facts,” Mr. Thomson wrote. “Perhaps if we paid more money we’d have skilled associates.”

The e-mails were included in the 250,000 pages of documents that were turned over to Mr. Victor by DLA Piper as part of pretrial discovery in the case. Mr. Victor said that the e-mails confirmed his worst suspicions.

His lawyer, Larry Hutcher at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, amended the countersuit last week to include a fraud claim and a request for $22.5 million in punitive damages, a number representing 1 percent of DLA Piper’s reported revenue last year.

“For the past decade, I have fought with DLA to reduce their legal bills,” Mr. Victor said. “And now I’m going to keep on fighting.”"

Originally the product of a merger between several Louisville newspapers in 1868, the newspaper has been the largest print outlet in the city for well over a century. But of late, the newspaper has undergone severe economic problems, with owner Gannett Company laying off 51 employees in 2008 and 44 more in 2009.

Part of that is the newspaper’s dramatic shift to the left over the past few years. Since the election in November, the newspaper’s editorial board has called for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to resign as Senate Minority Leader and accused McConnell of being the target of “national ridicule,” and run comics depicting McConnell consigned to the flames of hell; it has suggested that Senate Republicans “smacked down the disabled of this country and the world.”

In the latest symptom of that circulation-killing shift left, the newspaper is laying off longtime columnist John David Dyche, a Harvard Law grad and area lawyer who has been writing the token conservative column on the paper since 2003.

Why are they laying Dyche off? Dyche proposed a column to the newspaper suggesting fixes for their editorial woes, including:

“balanced opinion pages” rather than “stridently liberal”;

disclosing editors’ and reporters’ politics – “Journalists believe that they, unlike mere mortals, can transcend their personal opinions to be basically fair and objective in presenting the news. Perhaps, but readers should be the ones to judge”;

open meetings about editorial decisions – “Let the public see how and by whom decisions are made as to what to cover, who should cover it, and what headlines, photographs, and placement it receives.”

The editorial board did not take such suggestions kindly, and rejected the column outright. They told Dyche that the column was not within the purview of his mandate as a conservative columnists. Editorial Director Pam Platt left Dyche a message:

Hi, John David, it’s Pam Platt at the Courier-Journal and I’m just calling to let you know that I’m not going to run your column tomorrow. To me it goes sort of off of what your column is supposed to be. My understanding is a conservative take on issues of the day and that’s not what this is. So, anyway, thanks a lot and I’ll talk to you soon.

Dyche responded by email:

[T]he submitted column is very much about “a conservative take on the issues of the day.” One of those issues is liberal media bias. Another such issue is the survival of old line newspapers in a changing media marketplace. Conservatives think there is liberal media bias and that old line newspapers would fare better in the marketplace if they made changes of the sort I propose. Indeed, your refusal to run this column vividly illustrates the very issues about which I write!

Dyche added, “If there is no change of mind on the paper’s part we should probably end my decade-old relationship with the paper.” Platt quickly wrote back, “I do want to thank you for the pieces you did on the opinion pages for the past 10 years, and I wish you the very best in your life and your work.”

That’s how the left handles calls for balance. By destroying the only semblance of balance they have left.

Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), wrapping up a Wednesday meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown, mentioned his disappointment that the measure was stalled. He thought the governor was wary of it, because the bill’s author, Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), planned to shelve it.

Brown seemed surprised.

“Send me the bill,” the senator recalled the governor saying. “I’ll sign it.”

Later that day, De León huddled with a fellow champion of immigrant rights, Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens). Immigrant advocates and their allies in the Legislature had spent more than a decade pushing this issue, and they didn’t want to miss an opportunity while they had a governor on their side.

So, Lara, said, “we did a little covert operation.”

In an unusual gambit, the senators quietly decided to move the driver’s license bill forward — with or without Alejo. The strategy worked, and the measure cleared the Legislature late Thursday

The wrangling over the bill provided a glimpse of the fast-moving and unpredictable gamesmanship that characterizes the closing days and hours of the legislative session.

Lawmakers passed scores of bills in recent days, approving measures to raise the minimum wage, require overtime pay for domestic workers and tighten restrictions on assault rifles. They even found time to name a span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after one of their own, the colorful and controversial Willie Brown, a former Assembly leader.

But little this year sparked as much drama as the driver’s license bill. Lara called it “a political soap opera.”

Advertisement

Part of the issue was concern from labor groups, who worried the measure wasn’t strong enough. In particular, they were hesitant that licenses issued to immigrants in the country illegally would be marked differently — the prefix before the license number would say “DP” instead of “DL.”

Brown insisted the change was required by federal law, even securing written guidance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make his case.

“There was such disagreement with stakeholders about what’s the right language, what’s the best way to make sure this license is in compliance with federal law, that’s where I was willing to hold off,” Alejo said in an interview on Friday.

But the senators, buoyed by De León’s conversation with the governor, moved forward anyway.

Advertisement

“The people can’t wait for lawyers and activists to debate the esoteric, abstract virtues of a pure license,” De León said in an interview. “People in my community want and need driver licenses now, not tomorrow.”

Alejo, who said Wednesday that he would table the bill, said he didn’t know the senators planned to revive the it a vote.

“That surprised a lot of people,” Alejo said. “It surprised me.”

The Senate passed the measure 28-8, with two Republicans voting in favor. Former Sen. Gil Cedillo, who pushed the issue over and over while he served in the Legislature, helped rally support for the measure from a distance even as he mourned the death of his father earlier in the week.

Alejo changed course and agreed to present the bill, AB 60, in the Assembly, where it passed 55-21 at about 9:30 Thursday night, winning the support of two Republicans in that house.

De León, Lara and Alejo posed for celebratory photos and posted them on Twitter.

During his 2010 campaign for governor, Brown opposed driver’s licenses for Californians in the country illegally, for governor, saying he hoped the federal government would enact comprehensive changes to the country’s immigration system. But he told reporters Friday that he had changed his mind after watching “foot dragging” in Congress.

“I think they need a good push, and that’s what I think this driver’s license bill does,” the governor said. “It says California recognizes these human beings are very important to our communities, to our economy — and hopefully the people in Washington will get the message.”

Brown signed a bill last year granting licenses to young undocumented immigrants who qualify for President Obama’s temporary work-permit program.

The Legislature completed work on several other bills in the waning hours of the session Thursday night:

Advertisement

— They voted to loosen some environmental regulations. SB 743 by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) would make it easier to develop mixed-use and commercial projects in areas accessible by mass transit. The bill is expected to help the construction of a new arena for the Sacramento Kings basketball team.

— AB 128, by Assemblyman Steven Bradford (D-Gardena), would increase the authority of officers at the Los Angeles World Airports, allowing them to remove unsafe vehicles from the street and seize explosive and incendiary devices. The measure is in route to the governor’s desk.

Advertisement

— Lawmakers approved AB 1186, by Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla (D-Concord), which would require that the state develop safety measures for young people who compete in pankration, a limited version of mixed martial arts.

— Amid all the other business, the Legislature named part of the Bay Bridge after Willie Brown. Sen. Alex Padilla (D- Pacoima) joked that he could tell his colleagues stories about Brown ruthlessly wielding power in the Capitol, but they were “not appropriate” to repeat on the Senate floor. The bill does not require the signature of the governor, who objected to it.

Editor’s Note: For more on this story, watch Sanjay Gupta, MD, Saturday at 4:30 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 a.m. ET.

(CNN) —

Theo Visser was thirsty. He got up from his seat during the half-time break in a soccer match to purchase a drink from the concession stand.

“There she was, standing behind the bar,” he recounts, 58 years later. “It was love at first sight.” Theo asked the young woman out to a movie – and the rest, they say, is history.

It’s quite a shame, then, that Corrie Visser doesn’t remember any of this. Or if she does, she can’t say so. Corrie is one of 152 residents at Hogewey, a cutting-edge elder care facility on the outskirts of Weesp, the Netherlands, just minutes from downtown Amsterdam.

’Dementia Village’ - as it has become known – is a place where residents can live a seemingly normal life, but in reality are being watched all the time. Caretakers staff the restaurant, grocery store, hair salon and theater – although the residents don’t always realize they are carers – and are also watching in the residents’ living quarters.

Residents are allowed to roam freely around the courtyard-like grounds with its landscaped trees, fountains and benches – but they can’t leave the premises.

Their two-story dormitory-style homes form a perimeter wall for the village, meaning there is no way a resident can accidentally wander out.

And if they do approach the one exit door, a staffer will politely suggest the door is locked and propose another route.

Elderly Germans try to avoid care homes

Placing an aging family member here is far less expensive than round-the-clock, in-home care. It also takes an enormous amount of stress off family members who don’t have ample time or proper training to care for their loved ones.

Corrie has received a diagnosis of severe dementia, meaning she requires attention and support 24 hours a day. That clinical indication is necessary to gain admittance into Hogewey.

The burden of caring for Corrie eventually became unmanageable for Theo and his daughters, so together, they made the decision to place her here.

He says: “It’s perfect. I wouldn’t know a better place for her. It’s 100% good.”

Nearly every day of the week, Theo drives 15 kilometers (10 miles) each way to spend a few hours with his 80-year-old wife.

“I do it for myself,” he says. “I need it for myself. She (still) recognizes everyone… so it’s important I be here every day.”

Although they can’t chat with each other, Theo and Corrie will often sit for hours, holding hands and lovingly look into each other’s eyes. Every so often, Corrie offers a smile, a laugh, a squeeze of the hand. At least part of her memory, it seems, is still intact, though she can’t verbalize much these days.

Like other residents of Hogewey, Corrie may not know exactly where she is, but she always feels right at home. That’s precisely the idea.

For Yvonne van Amerongen, one of Hogewey’s founders, the need to create the small village was deeply personal.

“It was the moment my mother called me and told me my father had passed away suddenly,” she recalls. “Nothing was wrong with him. He just had a heart attack and he died. One of the first things I thought was, ‘Thank God he never had to be in a nursing home.’ That’s crazy that I have to think that! I’m in the management of a nursing home and I don’t want my father to come here.”

Five things CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned at the center

Van Amerongen sat down with her colleagues in November 1992 to discuss how they could transform the typical nursing home into more worthwhile living.

They created a 1.5 hectare (four-acre) complex, completed in 2009, that is home to 23 housing units and seven different “lifestyle themes,” such as crafts, culture, religious and urban.

Art lovers get paintings on the walls and music is always playing while the religious get more conservative décor and Christian crosses on the walls.

The simple goal: provide the most normal possible life, reminiscent of each individual’s formative years.

From the furnishing of her unit to the decorations and the type of food served, Corrie is led to believe that nothing in her life has changed. It’s this sense of normalcy that they strive for day in and day out at Hogewey.

Study finds loneliness linked to dementia

In some ways, this is similar to the manufactured reality depicted in the movie “The Truman Show,” where a man played by Jim Carrey discovers his entire life is actually a TV program. Everything he thinks is real is in fact a mirage, created by television producers for the viewing public’s entertainment.

Van Amerongen dismisses any accusations that she and her staff are duping their residents. “We have a real society here,” she says. “I don’t think people feel fooled. They feel fooled if we just tell them a story that’s not true and they know it. We’re not telling stories.”

But telling stories is exactly what some of the residents do, all day long, including Corrie’s housemate, Jo Verhoef. Like all of Hogewey’s residents, Jo’s dementia is rapidly progressing. Her “loop” is getting shorter; the conversations she carries and the questions she asks are becoming more repetitive in a shorter amount of time.

“Do you know Steve Matthew?” she asks, multiple times over the course of an hour. Of course, no one does, but each time she seems surprised that we haven’t met. *

Steve may be a relic of Jo’s past, a distant, foggy memory of a baseball player she says lived with her for a short time when she was younger. Or, he may be a figment of her imagination. Sadly, we’ll never know.

Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind

Worldwide, 35.6 million people have dementia, according to the World Health Organization, with 7.7 million new cases being diagnosed every year. At that rate, the number of people with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. This will be an additional burden for governments already struggling to contain the runaway costs of health care.

In Holland, everyone pays into the state health care system during their working years, with the money then disbursed to pay for later-in-life expenses - and that means living in Hogewey does not cost any more than a traditional nursing home.

Could this innovative model work in other countries? Health care industry leaders in Germany, England, Switzerland and Japan are all beginning to take notice. At Hogewey, says van Amerongen, “We have Dutch design, Dutch cultures, Dutch lifestyles, but the concept is to value the person, the individual… to support them to live their life as usual, and you can do that anywhere.”

On a physical level, residents at Hogewey require fewer medications; they eat better, and yes, they live longer. On a mental level, they also seem to have more joy. It’s a difficult thing to measure, but that is the most important thing here at Hogewey.

So could this work in other parts of the world? That’s the next question.

* After reading this story the real Steve Matthew (not Matthews) contacted CNN to confirm he does indeed exist and this part of Jo’s memory is accurate. He says he still visits her every three weeks and that she became his ‘artificial mother’ while he was in Holland playing baseball.

We have also corrected the spelling of his name in this story."

State tax revenues come from some unusual sources

A sliced bagel is taxed in New York%2C but not an unsliced one

In Connecticut%2C adult diapers are tax-free%3B children%27s diapers are taxed

If you buy a bagel in New York, prepare to pay a bit more to have it sliced.

New York imposes an 8 cent tax to all ""altered"" bagels, whether it is sliced, toasted or served with a ""schmear"" of cream cheese or butter.

""Cut bagels cross the line and become a prepared meal or food sold for on-premises consumption, which is taxable,"" explains Carla Yrjanson, vice president of tax research and content for Thomson Reuters. ""Uncut bagels are typically sold for home consumption and would meet the definition of a (tax) exempt food in New York.""

Tax revenue for states often stems from unusual laws in an effort to clearly define what goods or services can be taxed. Such taxes allow states to bring in extra revenue without raising taxes across the board, said Barbara Weltman, author of J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2013.

Among some of the more unusual:

Maine: Although it is one of the country's smallest states, Maine produces the nation's biggest blueberry output. The state collects $1.50 per 100 pounds of blueberries sold.

Utah: Businesses that hire nude or partially nude workers pay an extra 10% tax for all services sold. The tax, passed in 2004, targeted erotic dancing clubs and escort services, with the revenue allocated toward treatment services for sex offenders and funding for investigation of Internet crimes against children.

Kansas: There is an amusement tax for a ride in a tethered (attached to the ground) hot air balloon. Unattached balloon rides, however, qualify as transportation and are tax-exempt.

California: The state imposes a 33% tax on fruit bought from vending machines. It is cheaper, and perhaps healthier, to stick to the fruit aisle in the grocery store.

Arkansas: A 6% tax is charged for tattoos, body piercings and electrolysis.

Alabama: The state stacks on a 10 cent tax for all 54-or-less-card decks of playing cards sold. Nevada, on the other hand, dishes out a free deck for each tax return filed.

Illinois: It charges a 5% tax on candy, on top of the state's 1.0% food tax. The 5% tax exempts candy containing flour as a means of differentiating candy from food, says Susan Hofer, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Revenue. The tax was implemented in 2009, bringing in an additional $35-$41 million in revenue, she added.

Colorado: The state taxes retailers of food, meals or beverages a tax on""nonessential"" food-related items, including napkins and bibs, utensils and straws. Paper cups and disposable containers are considered essential and are not taxed.

West Virginia: It imposes taxes on glow-worms, trick noisemakers and sparklers... a tax damper on a sparkling celebration.

Maryland: It charges homeowners and businesses a sewage tax, or ""flush tax,"" of $2.50 a month.

Connecticut : Adult diapers go untaxed. Children's diapers, on the other hand, are taxed.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded to criticism of an email she sent describing her brother David, who counts on Social Security for income, saying ""not everyone has a sister who can help.""

The email, which was sent on Wednesday, was a response to President Barack Obama's plan to cut Social Security benefits. Warren said she was ""shocked to hear"" of Obama's plan before describing how her brother David lives on the $13,200 per year he receives in Social Security benefits.

A reporter from Boston's FOX 25 questioned Warren on the email, asking the senator why she didn't help her brother.

""I do help him. This is a question about how much,"" Warren said. ""He was worked for 40 years and paid into this system and that's all the money he has to live on. And there are literally millions of people around the country for whom that is the case.""

Warren also emphasized that the email was not just about her brother, but about all Americans who rely on Social Security benefits to get by.

""Let's be clear about this. Not everyone has a sister who can help,"" Warren said. ""This is about people who work all their lives and all they've got at the end is their social security.""

Warren's not the only one to criticize Obama's plan, which involves a measure of inflation known as the chained Consumer Price Index, or chained CPI. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Obama ""owns"" chained CPI, and Grover Norquist, leader of Americans for Tax Reform, called it ""a Taxpayer Protection Pledge violation."""

He Previously Covered State', 'National Politics', 'Including The Presidential Campaign.', 'David Zahniser Covers Los Angeles City Hall For The Los Angeles Times.']",Mayor Eric Garcetti faces early test over proposed DWP deal,"Less than a month after taking office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is facing a major test of his power: A union leader who ran a brutal campaign against him in the May election is trying to line up City Council support for a new salary agreement for Department of Water and Power workers.

The high-stakes political drama has been building for weeks in private conversations and closed-door meetings at City Hall. It has prompted Garcetti to risk an early and potentially ugly public fight with a powerful critic, DWP union leader Brian D’Arcy.

The proposed labor agreement also raises the possibility of a struggle between Garcetti and Council President Herb Wesson, who has been pushing for a quick deal with the DWP union, Local 18 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The ultimate terms of the contract will affect future rates that Los Angeles businesses and nearly 4 million residents pay for water and power.

On Thursday evening, Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb declined to confirm the deal’s terms, but denounced it. “It’s not good enough. Period,” he said. “Mayor Garcetti was elected with a clear mandate to bring real reform to the DWP, and that includes pensions, healthcare and salaries.”

Under the deal, outlined in a memo obtained by The Times, more than 8,200 DWP employees would forgo a scheduled raise of 2% to 4% that is supposed to take effect Oct. 1. They would also get no raises the following two years. In 2016, they would get a pay hike of up to 4%.

The proposed agreement also includes reduced retirement benefits for newly hired employees. They would be required to contribute 3% of their salary toward health coverage after they retire — up from zero for current employees. Talks on the deal began months ago, when Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was still in office. The memo, written by City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana and DWP General Manager Ron Nichols, says the deal would save the public $6 billion over 30 years. Wesson and D’Arcy both declined to comment Thursday.

The deal includes a settlement of a 2010 lawsuit filed against the city by union representatives on the DWP’s pension board. The suit alleges that the city improperly forced the utility to absorb at least $183 million in retirement costs when it shifted hundreds of workers onto the DWP payroll to help balance the general government budget that pays for police and other basic services.

On Tuesday, Garcetti, Wesson and the rest of the city’s labor negotiating committee held a private meeting at City Hall on both the lawsuit and the proposed DWP contract. Immediately afterward, union leader D’Arcy and Santana attended a closed-door, courthouse settlement conference on the lawsuit with a judge.

Garcetti’s spokesman said late Thursday that the city should continue fighting the case. “The lawsuit is without merit and is not a factor in the mayor’s decision-making,” Robb said.

In his campaign, Garcetti vowed to stand up for ratepayers and be an independent check on the DWP union. The labor group and its affiliates spent $2 million portraying Garcetti as “living large” at taxpayer expense, and promoting his opponent, Wendy Greuel. A central thrust of Garcetti’s campaign was that his rival would reward the DWP union by burdening ratepayers with rich labor contracts.

The union’s current contract expires in the fall of 2014. On Friday, Garcetti, Wesson and the three other members on the city’s Executive Employee Relations Committee are scheduled to meet privately to discuss the new contract proposal.

In remarks to reporters Wednesday, Garcetti stressed pay and benefit costs for the city workforce must be controlled.

“While we’ve backed away from the cliff, the cliff isn’t out of sight,” he said. “And it’s going to be very important to me that we hold down those raises, pensions and healthcare costs that in the past have driven expenses in this city. I said that during the campaign. I will continue to do that at the negotiating table as mayor.”

A close ally of the DWP union, who declined to be identified by name because of the sensitivity of the labor talks, said the proposal on the table serves the city’s interests. “It’s the best deal they’ve cut with any union so far,” he said. “This is a good deal for the city.”

Partial transcript via Fox News:

ED HENRY: Can you give us an update on the sequester because yesterday, the Customs and Border Protection (INAUDIBLE) said that they’re actually postponing furloughs and overtime cuts for border patrol agents. I thought in February, when Secretary Napolitano came out here with you, she told us it was dire, these border patrol agents were going to be furloughed and that we were going to be less safe because of that.

JAY CARNEY: Well, I think both are true. What is — what is a fact is that when you’re dealing with these kinds of across-the-board forced budget cuts in the middle of the fiscal year and you’re having to make all sorts of adjustments to account for them and to reduce your expenditures accordingly, you know, it’s a moving picture. And you know, what — and that can be on the plus side where furloughs may take place a little later or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate.

Watch the video to see how heated it got. More proof Henry is a great reporter.

Though they are more than capable of going overboard at times, the media-at-large does a very good job of vetting and holding Republicans accountable. What Ed Henry just did used to happen practically every day to the White House press secretary between the years of 2001 and 2009. Moreover, there were frequent gang tackles where members of the White House press corps would coordinate to ensure a question got answered.

I didn’t hear anyone jumping in to help Henry, did you?

And these lapdogs wonder why Obama treats them like one-night stands.

The NCAA%27s vice president of enforcement is leaving in the wake of an external review

Miami president Donna Shalala issues a strong statement on the NCAA%27s conduct

Still%2C the submission of a Notice of Allegations to Miami is imminent

The future of the NCAA's case against Miami isn't the only thing in question in the wake of an external review that revealed misconduct by investigators.

NCAA president Mark Emmert, who confirmed to USA TODAY Sports the departure by March 1 of Julie Roe Lach, vice president of enforcement, called the results of the review ""an embarrassment."" Although Emmert said ""tainted information"" had been removed from the investigative record and indicated the case would move forward, Miami president Donna Shalala pushed back.

In a strongly worded statement that appeared to be an attempt to grab the high ground, Shalala said the misconduct ""taints the entire process"" and called for the NCAA to wrap up the process with no penalties beyond those already self-imposed by the school.

""We have been wronged in this investigation,"" Shalala said.

For more than two years, the NCAA has been investigating allegations of rule violations made by former booster Nevin Shapiro, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for running a $930 million Ponzi scheme. Miami instituted a bowl ban in each of the last two football seasons and reduced scholarships.

And regardless of what happens next to Miami, surely others are asking if they have been wronged, too – Emmert said the misconduct ""failed our membership"" – and what the NCAA will to do make it right.

Is the problem systemic? Have other cases been similarly tainted? According to the review by attorney Ken Wainstein of the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, enforcement staff members secured the services of attorney Maria Elena Perez to glean information from depositions in Shapiro's bankruptcy proceedings. The report found the actions did not violate NCAA bylaws or enforcement staff policies, but found former investigator Ameen Najjar disregarded advice of the NCAA legal counsel, which told them not to use Perez to depose witnesses.

Najjar and Roe Lach did not return phone calls Monday. In an interview Monday with USA TODAY Sports, Emmert characterized Najjar's actions as ""a novel approach,"" adding that enforcement staff members ""knew that something like this had never been done before.""

""We need to be careful not to generalize beyond the data,"" Emmert added. ""We've got a decision here where some very bad judgment and very bad decisions were made, but that doesn't taint the entire enforcement process or the individuals involved in it.""

Shalala would disagree.

Although Emmert repeatedly declined to discuss Roe Lach's departure – except to confirm it – the review found she exercised ""insufficient oversight"" of Najjar's actions. The review absolved other NCAA officials, including chief operating officer Jim Isch and Emmert, of blame. Isch approved paying Perez, but the review concluded ""he was addressing only the fiscal issue and not any legal/prudential concerns."" According to the report, Emmert didn't learn of the investigators' conduct until last fall.

As a result, only the head of enforcement rolled.

""The actions that we're taking today are clearly consistent with principles of holding people accountable for their behavior,"" Emmert said in a teleconference. ""I'm not going to comment on any personnel actions, but again if the (NCAA's) executive committee believes that some disciplinary action toward me needs to be taken, then I'm sure they will.""

The external review was limited to the Miami investigation. Emmert said part of the charge for attorney Jonathan Duncan, who has been appointed interim head of enforcement, will be to conduct a broad review of the enforcement process. But according to Emmert, there are no plans to review other pending or recently completed cases for possible malfeasance.

""As we go forward through all of this, we need to have very clear protocols to make sure evidence has been gathered appropriately and that we have confidence in that process,"" Emmert told USA TODAY Sports. ""Up until this moment, I think everyone would say that has been the case.""

The Miami case will apparently go forward. A person familiar with the NCAA enforcement staff's activities said the Notice of Allegations has been prepared and is ""ready"" for delivery. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

According to the external review, information derived from the bankruptcy depositions – including information gleaned from 13 full interviews and portions of 12 more – was removed from the Miami investigative record. But in her statement, Shalala said Miami pledged full cooperation when the investigation began in September 2010 – ""than two and a half years ago"" – and added:

""The University of Miami has lived up to those promises, but sadly the NCAA has not lived up to their own core principles. The lengthy and already flawed investigation has demonstrated a disappointing pattern of unprofessional and unethical behavior.""

The question is if the pattern goes beyond Miami. And regardless of the answer, the current perception is not positive.

Last month during a session at the NCAA Convention, ""public and membership distrust of the NCAA's ability to police itself"" was cited as a reason for the existence of the temporary Enforcement Working Group. In the external review, Wainstein found the action by the enforcement staff members had the potential appearance of ""an inappropriate manipulation of the bankruptcy process."" But as telling, he said they did not sufficiently consider ""whether it was consistent with the NCAA membership's understanding about the limits"" of the investigators' power.

Several other recent high-profile cases have been controversial, as well. The NCAA drew criticism from school administrators and outsiders alike for its handling last summer of Penn State for the Jerry Sandusky scandal – punishment that was unprecedented in severity and process – but that didn't involve the enforcement staff. Former USC assistant coach Todd McNair has filed suit against the NCAA for its actions in the investigation of former rule violations involving star Reggie Bush. Last fall the NCAA fired investigator Abigail Grantstein after her boyfriend was overheard providing information related to the eligibility case of freshman UCLA basketball player Shabazz Muhammad.

Emmert said he was committed to do what he could to ""improve the level of confidence that people have in the way enforcement is conducted,"" and added:

""Perfection is not the goal here – but confidence certainly is."""

Obama then shifted to who was responsible, pointing a joking finger at ""American Idol"" star Jessica Sanchez.

""I have to say I think I know the culprit -- where is Jessica Sanchez?,"" he said. ""Jessica -- it wasn’t Jessica. It was her aunt. Where is she? Auntie, right there. Look at this.""

Obama kept the wave of laughter going, shifting to his standing with First Lady Michelle Obama.

""I just want everybody to witness,"" Obama joked. ""So I do not want to be in trouble with Michelle. That's why I'm calling you out right in front of everybody.""

On a more serious note, the Associated Press adds that Obama threaded immigration into the mix, where he lauded Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for their service in building and defending the United States.

But Gates says Control-Alt-Delete was a ""mistake""

The designer credited with the shortcut has deflected responsibility

Gates made comments at a recent Harvard University event

If you pressed Control-Alt-Delete to log on before reading this, Bill Gates says he's sorry.

The Microsoft founder says the triple-key login should have been made easier, à la Apple's Macs, but that a designer insisted on the more complicated step.

""We could have had a single button. But the guy who did the IBM keyboard design didn't want to give us our single button,"" Gates said Saturday during a question-and-answer session to launch a Harvard University fund-raising campaign. His comments have gained attention since a video of his Harvard Q&A was posted on YouTube on Tuesday.

Smiling, Gates tried to follow through on the thought, noting it was a basic security feature. But he eventually surrendered to common sense.

""And so we had ... we programmed at a low level that you had to ... it was a mistake,"" he said, throwing up his hands to laughter and applause from the crowd.

Gates defended innovation on the earliest Microsoft software though.

""We did some clever stuff,"" he said. ""We were able to experiment with a lot of stuff, but more on the software side than the hardware.""

Long the first interface step for PC users, Control-Alt-Delete still exists in Windows 8 as a way of either locking the computer or accessing the control panel. While the system defaults to a log-in screen, users may tweak their settings to return to the old way of logging on to Windows.

Sometimes informally called the ""three-fingered salute,"" the login required users to use both hands and was intended to avoid accidental keystrokes from rebooting a computer.

Engineer David Bradley, a designer on early IBM computers, said he invented the combination as a shortcut during development.

""I originally intended for it to be what we would now call an Easter egg -- just something we were using in development and it wouldn't be available elsewhere,"" Bradley said while appearing on a 2011 panel that included Gates. ""But then (software publishers) found out about it. They were trying to figure out how to tell somebody to start up one of their programs, and they had the answer. Just put the diskette in, hit Control-Alt-Delete, and by magic your program starts.""

He then tried to deflect what he perhaps wryly called ""credit"" for its continued use.

""It was like a five-minute job in doing it. I didn't realize that I was going to create a cultural icon when I did it,"" he said ""... I may have invented it, but I think Bill made it famous.""

A tight-lipped Gates appears to force a smile i n a video of the panel but does not respond.

Gates attended Harvard until he left during his junior year to start Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. While at Harvard, he lived down the hall from current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates received an honorary degree in 2007.

Gates remains Microsoft's chairman although he stopped full-time work at the company in 2008.

During Saturday's session, Gates reflected on a variety of topics, from the philanthropy he's made his life's work since stepping back from an active role at Microsoft to his company's relationship with Apple in the early days.

That included helping keep what would become Microsoft's fiercest rival afloat in the 1990s when it was foundering.

""In the Apple II era, we were kind of friendly competitors,"" he said. ""We actually put more people on the Mac than Apple had.""

When co-founder Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, ""he sort of says, 'I want this, this and this and I'll give you this, this and this.' ... We did the deal in three days,"" Gates said.

That included buying a 6% share of Apple, which lawyers convinced Gates that Microsoft shouldn't keep for antitrust reasons.

""It would have been nice if we had,"" he said."

The conservative host went on to discuss that the reason why amnesty is essential to the liberal agenda is because abortion has, since Roe v. Wade in 1973, wiped out millions of potential taxpayers. The Democrat Party, Limbaugh said, has turned to amnesty as a means to ensure a “permanent underclass” in order to continue its image as the party of big government entitlements.

Limbaugh said:

Folks, let me tell you the way Washington thinks, in many ways, but this is one way they think. They need money. The US government needs money. We are hopelessly in debt. The tax increases that are coming are already over the top. Washington knows, much of official Washington knows that they’ve gone beyond the point here, taxation, because the impact on economic growth and productivity and creativity has now been stifled. I mean, the tax rates are such that real creation of wealth, real opportunity for prosperity is diminishing left and right. They’ve got to come up with money. And they know this: If you use the popularly accepted figure of 1.3 million abortions a year, go back to Roe vs. Wade 1973, 52 million taxpayers haven’t been born, is the way Washington looks at it. They don’t look at it morally. They don’t look at it in any kind of cultural way or any kind of cultural impact. They just say we’re 52 million people short. We have 52 million fewer people paying taxes. We gotta replace ’em. Hello amnesty. The Democrat Party needs a permanent underclass in order to keep themselves alive as Santa Claus, to keep winning elections and stay in power.

“I think that the number of abortions themselves…culturally, in terms of the sanctity of life, how that’s crumbled, I think it’s almost at the root of everything,” Limbaugh went on to say. “And if it’s not at the root of everything, it’s clearly had a profound impact on our culture, our society, and our politics, I think in ways that people don’t even stop to consider.”

Limbaugh discussed the fact that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to answer the Weekly Standard‘s question on Thursday about the morality of late-term abortion.

“And, by the way, that’s it, she wasn’t gonna talk any more about it because she is a devout Catholic,” Limbaugh said. “She has six kids, and it isn’t about politics, and she’s not gonna discuss it anymore, she said, because the interviewer was taking it in the direction of politics, and abortion isn’t politics. Abortion is sacred ground, she said. It is the sacrament of liberalism, is what it is.”"

Two decisions on race illustrate court%27s methodical move to right

Business interests won big in recent term%2C as did libertarians

It%27s the Roberts Court%2C but Anthony Kennedy holds the key

WASHINGTON — Same-sex marriage won the biggest headlines on the last day of the Supreme Court's term, but the two days that preceded it provided the story line.

First came the court's seemingly minimalist decision on college affirmative action programs. After more than eight months of incubation, the ruling kicked the case back to lower federal courts with instructions to scrutinize more closely the University of Texas' system of racial preferences.

Both sides claimed victory, but perhaps only those opposed to affirmative action should have been happy. For the very next day, the court followed a similarly minimalist decision on voting rights issued in 2009 with its successor: a ruling that drove a stake through the heart of the nation's most cherished civil rights legislation.

Taken together, the two race-based cases illustrate the increasingly clear pattern of the court under Chief Justice John Roberts. Its tenuous conservative majority doesn't always act quickly, but it does act eventually — and it doesn't mind uprooting a few precedents or statutes along the way. What happened to the Voting Rights Act this term could happen to affirmative action programs in the future.

""Roberts recognizes that sometimes the best strategy for moving the law is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, rather than a touchdown bomb,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. ""In a lot of the cases this term, you see the court moving slowly but surely to the right.""

Not always: The court's 5-4 decision striking down the key section of the Defense of Marriage Act was in many ways the ideological opposite of the voting rights ruling.

What tied the two together was a deference to states' rights — but not to Congress, which passed DOMA in 1996 and reauthorized the Voting Rights Act a decade later, both with overwhelming majorities.

""This continues to be a very confident court,"" says Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush who has argued 69 cases before the justices, including seven during the term that concluded Wednesday. ""They're not particularly inclined to be overly deferential.""

With one exception, apparently: In most of the business cases that came before the court this term, corporations won and consumers lost. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious in 14 of 17 cases in which it took a position — a testament to the court's conservative tilt since Associate Justice Samuel Alito replaced Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006.

That pattern can be seen in cases involving class action litigation, which the court frowns upon, and mandatory arbitration, which it tends to like.

""The statistics bear out that this term and every term of the Roberts court has been more pro-business than the average Supreme Court over the last 50 years,"" says Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration who appears frequently at the lectern.

The court also displayed a libertarian streak and a willingness to clamp down on what it sees as the government's expansive use of federal power, says Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank that emerged with a winning percentage similar to the Chamber of Commerce's.

By contrast, the Department of Justice, which represents the Obama administration before the court, was on the winning side less than 40% of the time.

The court is dominated by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, who takes a skeptical view of government power and is sympathetic to individual rights. He alone among the nine justices was in the majority on the Defense of Marriage Act, the Voting Rights Act and the affirmative action case.

""Anthony Kennedy is a swing justice who swings against legislation,"" says Akhil Reed Amar, a constitutional scholar at Yale University. ""He basically trusts judges and is skeptical of legislators, including Congress.""

Kennedy's vote proved critical in nearly all the cases decided by 5-4 majorities, and there were plenty — nearly 30% of the court's 77 cases. Among them were rulings that police can collect DNA from people arrested but not convicted of serious crimes, as well as two workplace discrimination cases won by employers over employees.

On the other hand, nearly 50% were decided unanimously, including some of the term's most important cases. The justices ruled 9-0 that human genes cannot be patented and corporations cannot be held liable for international human rights violations with no direct link to the United States.

Perhaps it was the bevy of controversial cases, but the justices spent most of the term trying to get a word in edgewise, much to the chagrin of the attorneys standing before them. They asked an average of about 117 questions, or nearly two per minute, during oral arguments, according to meticulous statistics kept by Scotusblog.com — a cacophony that Roberts said has forced him at times to ""act like an umpire.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the most frequent questioner, while Justice Clarence Thomas, by custom, asked none at all. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the angriest conservative dissents, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did so for the court's liberals. Alito and Justice Elena Kagan asked perhaps the most incisive questions of the term.

The bravest justice was Stephen Breyer, who broke his shoulder in a biking accident in late April but didn't miss a beat on the bench.

It was Roberts who kept the court on its even keel, inching it to the right without appearing to do so — at least not to the general public. Polls continue to show that liberals are slightly more satisfied with the court's actions than conservatives.

""He understands public relations,"" says Caroline Fredrickson, executive director of the liberal American Constitution Society. ""The idea that the public is left with a court that's maybe not as conservative as it might be portrayed by the liberal media is probably exactly what he wants.""

Obama%27s efforts to get support for action in Syria at the G20 conference came to nothing.

Polls show Americans are against a military strike.

If I were George W. Bush or Mitt Romney%2C I%27d be sorely tempted to laugh.

Remember that dumb cowboy George W. Bush, who alienated all our allies and dragged us into wars of choice in the Mideast? And remember that goofball Mitt Romney, whom Joe Biden a year ago accused of wanting to go to war in Syria?

Both of them must be having a big laugh over the way things are going for Obama now. When I wrote last week on our bumbling Syria diplomacy, it seemed that things couldn't possibly go further downhill. Boy, was I wrong.

Last week, it seemed our only ally was France. But now the French are having second thoughts. Obama's efforts to get support at the G20 conference came to nothing. Even the pope is undercutting him.

Meanwhile, at home, polls show Americans are against a strike, and Obama is facing double-digit defections among Democrats in the Senate. The outlook for passage in the House, meanwhile, looks so bad that a resolution to authorize war may not even make it to a vote. If it's sure to fail, why force members -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- to go on record? You can bet they don't appreciate Obama putting them in this position. The Pentagon isn't happy, and even The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, a reliable Obama supporter, calls his policy ""dumb.""

Some critics are even comparing the collapse of American influence under Obama to the end of the Soviet Union. Well, that may be an exaggeration -- but Obama promised a ""fundamental transformation,"" after all.

At least Hollywood is still behind the president -- or, anyway, is mostly keeping quiet about its opposition because, as old-line Hollywood liberal Ed Asner reports, they ""don't want to feel anti-black."" So it's come to this -- while George W. Bush was savaged for ""bombing brown people,"" now if you're against bombing brown people you're ""anti-black.""

As I said, if I were George W. Bush or Romney, I'd be sorely tempted to laugh, because Obama's chickens are coming home to roost. Obama was elected after he and his party sowed distrust of U.S. military endeavors, mocked ""intelligence estimates"" about ""weapons of mass destruction,"" and suggested that anything the United States did in the region was probably somehow a scheme to benefit oil companies. Now Obama and his administration are shocked to find that when they go on about intelligence estimates and weapons of mass destruction, people don't take them seriously.

Likewise, Obama has repeatedly shown his disdain for Congress and his willingness to act without congressional approval in all sorts of areas, from ObamaCare implementation to gun control. So it's not surprising that members of Congress seem to be a bit . . . distant now that Obama suddenly wants them to bail him out of his unfortunate ""red line"" remark.

But I'd bet that Bush and Romney aren't actually laughing. That's because they're both serious men who understand international politics and who care for the future of the country. They no doubt understand that, as fun as it is to watch a political opponent twist in the wind due to his own ineptitude, the price will ultimately be paid not by Obama, but by the people of America.

Our diplomacy is a joke, our president is a laughing stock, our enemies are emboldened, and we've still got over three years of this to go. Nothing funny there at all, alas.

Michelle Obama welcomed the 2013 holidays into the White House on Wednesday with military families, hot cider, hand-decorated cookies, a 300-pound gingerbread White House and an extremely friendly new family pet.

Sunny, the 1-year-old Portuguese water dog the Obamas got over the summer, bounded into a State Dining Room full of children dressed in sparkly shoes and lacy dresses and headed right for little Ashtyn Gardner, 2, from Mobile, Ala. All of a sudden the blond girl with ringlet curls, whose parents are both in the Navy, was down on the rug.

“Are you okay?” said a concerned Obama, mom-in-chief, tugging back on Sunny’s leash. But there was no need for damage control. Before Ashtyn could answer, she was back on her feet and Sunny was licking her face. All seemed well again, and the kids from military families could get back to frosting cookies and making paper poinsettia flowers with the first lady, crafty projects that have become a part of the Obama holiday traditions.

In this, the Obamas’ fifth holiday season at the White House, the customs of Christmas past were observed with a few twists. First, the preview was a party for military families, as it has been in the past. The theme this year for the White House holidays is “Gather Around: Stories of the Season,” described as telling tales of the country’s history and displaying decorations that reflect it. There are art displays and Christmas trees made of repurposed books. (The 450 books used in the decorations will be donated to a local school’s book drive after the holiday season.) Many ornaments are recycled and reused. This year’s additions included wooden frames holding silhouettes of landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Golden Gate Bridge. The Blue Room tree, an 181 / 2 -foot Douglas fir known as the official White House Christmas Tree, was laden with holiday greeting cards on which children living on military bases shared their favorite holiday traditions.

The colors of the ornaments and decorations on the 24 Christmas trees that line the public tour route are subdued, with lots of chocolate browns, pale blues and golds. Not only is there a gingerbread house, complete with chocolate versions of Bo — the Obamas’ first Portuguese water dog — and Sunny, but it is sitting on more than 1,200 Springerle cookies made into a custom-made hearth. The hearth is framed by sugar paste re-creations of the tiles commissioned for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s fireplace, to evoke memories of his “fireside chats.” According to Bill Yosses, the White House executive pastry chef, this is the first year the gingerbread house has running water — a carpenter rigged up a functioning replica of the North Lawn fountain, to which blue food coloring was added.

Eighty-three volunteers worked for five days to decorate the White House. Donna Perry, a lawyer from Louisville, Ky., said it was her first time as a volunteer. She was decorating the tree in the Blue Room when the president stopped by and was hugged by some excited volunteers who got glitter on his lapel.

At the start of the event, Michelle Obama addressed the military families in a gray-and-white dress and pearls. “Now, over the course of this season, about 70,000 people will come to see our holiday decorations. Not bad,” she said. “And I can’t imagine a better group of people than all of you to be our first guests.” (About 13,000 of those 70,000 people will be attending official White House receptions and parties.)

Obama mentioned that while many families will be reading classics to their kids by the fire, some military personnel will be doing it a different way.

“I’m thinking about the thousands of men and women in uniform serving abroad who wake up in the middle of the night in some remote part of the world to read a special holiday story to their children over Skype,” she said, calling it “new ways to make the season bright.”

Before taking the children to make crafts with White House florists, bakers and pastry chefs, Obama warned parents, “I’m going to take your kids . . . and we’re going to do some decorating.” She added, “I guarantee you we will not lose them, but I can’t guarantee you they will come back clean.”

She worked hard, though, to keep their party clothes from getting trashed. When she saw a little girl at the cookie-decorating table drop some gooey stuff on her outfit, Obama did what all moms would do. She whipped out a dish towel with a little water on it and tried to rub the goop out of the girl’s glittery sweater."

Jay Carney, the occasionally charming spokesman for the newly charming president, began his daily media briefing Monday with a smile, a sunny disposition and a bit of percussion on the lectern. Bum-ba-da-bum-bum, he drummed with his hands.

“Happy Monday!” began Carney, wearing a festive yellow tie and striking a casual pose. “Good afternoon. Thanks for being here for your White House briefing. Spring is here early.”

But it was not long before the White House press secretary was back in his winter of discontent. The first questioner, the Associated Press’s Jim Kuhnhenn, asked Carney to square President Obama’s “charm offensive” with his decision to speak this week to the highly partisan Organizing for Action group.

“I think you’re misrepresenting the group,” Carney informed Kuhnhenn.

NPR’s Mara Liasson asked him a question about Obama’s yet-to-be-released budget. “Mara, the way you phrase that question, you know, makes me think that you’re still working on a typewriter or something,” Carney told the 57-year-old radio correspondent.

He further informed ABC News’s Ann Compton that she had a mistaken understanding of the president’s meetings this week with lawmakers. And when CBS’s Bill Plante pressed him on when Obama would release a budget (it was supposed to have been done last month), Carney leaned forward to argue.

“I challenge virtually every premise of your question,” he told Plante. “I don’t know what your question is here,” he said when Plante tried to ask it in a different way.

“Bill, how long have you been covering Washington?” Carney asked the 75-year-old newsman when he persisted in inquiring about the tardiness of the budget. “Has there ever been a presidential budget that was enacted, word for word, into law?”

NBC’s Chuck Todd broke in, telling Carney that a president never waits until after the House and the Senate introduce budgets to introduce his own.

“Well, I disagree with that,” Carney snapped.

This might be called putting the “offense” in charm offensive.

Here’s the early line from The Fix’s Chris Cillizza on the 2016 candidates, in no particular order. So, dear readers, if it’s not too early for you, here goes: Wait 1 second to continue.

It was a caution to those swept away by the notion that an entirely new and amiable Obama White House has suddenly emerged: Charm is hard.

The offensive began last week, when Obama took a dozen Republican senators to the Jefferson Hotel for a meal of blue crab risotto, lobster Thermidor, sea bass and the like. Next, he invited House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan to the White House for some more sea bass, accompanied by vegetable soup. This week, Obama is expected to pay three visits to Capitol Hill — a feat that ordinarily would take him months.

At the same time, White House reporters say they’ve noticed a softening in Obama advisers’ tone since Bob Woodward’s public spat with White House official Gene Sperling. The phone calls and e-mails from the president’s aides have become less confrontational and less vulgar, they say.

The charm offensive — both toward lawmakers and reporters — is a welcome development. Republicans who have been the targets of Obama’s attention report sincerity and warm feelings.

But the meals and the House (and Senate) calls don’t necessarily mean things will change in the capital. Obama may have had a nice lunch with Ryan last week, but on Monday, Carney blasted Ryan’s Medicare proposal anew. “This debate was had over the previous year and a half, and I think the American people were categorically opposed to the approach that says that we should voucherize Medicare,” he said.

Carney also vigorously defended Obama’s decision to speak to Organizing for Action, a group of former Obama staffers and donors using his reelection campaign’s infrastructure to pressure Republicans to support his agenda.

“I’m wondering whether there’s potentially a mixed message there,” the AP’s Kuhnhenn said to Carney, “because last week, OFA sent out an e-mail calling Republicans obstructionists, blaming them for the sequester, saying if only they had voted for closing tax loopholes, the public wouldn’t be in this jam.”

Carney smiled, charmingly. “Republicans made a choice,” he said. “The sequester is here, it’s being implemented as a result of the choice made on Capitol Hill by Republicans,” he added.

As for cooperating with Republicans, Carney argued that Obama’s agenda “is inherently bipartisan” — and that it was up to Republicans to sign on. “There’s nothing partisan about deficit reduction,” he said. “There’s nothing partisan about comprehensive immigration reform. . . . I would argue that there’s nothing partisan about common-sense solutions to reduce gun violence in America.”

If these claims weren’t strange enough, the moment was made more absurd by the ringing of a Japanese cameraman’s cellphone, which broadcast a loud message in Japanese that competed with Carney’s voice.

But while unsatisfied marrieds browse the site looking to hookup, the man behind the site -- creator Noel Biderman -- has been happily married for nearly 10 years. HuffPost Divorce spoke to Noel and his wife, Amanda -- who's featured on the company's new billboard campaign -- in separate phone conversations to discuss the secret to their relationship success, how Amanda reacted when Noel initially told her about his idea for the site, and why Noel believes cheating actually saves marriages.

Amanda, how did you react when Noel first told you about his plan to create an infidelity dating site? Were you supportive? Resistant?

Amanda: Originally, I wanted to make sure it wasn’t an emotional or personal issue...an emotional or physical thing that he was grappling with. Once I understood that it was a sound business [idea], that there was a market he felt was under-serviced, I was totally behind him.

Noel: We weren’t even married at the time, so she easily could have said, “I think there’s something flawed with this human being.” Instead, she saw the passion in which I wanted to pursue this and she wanted to match that passion. I knew I had a true partner.

Noel, you've said that your website saves marriage and that an affair can serve as a ""marriage preservation device."" Can you talk a little more about that?

Noel: I definitely believe that. For me, I’m a married man now -- 10 years later, two children later, a really good economic success later, and with an extended family I love, I would be a fool if I said sex was the most important thing in my marriage –- it’s not. [But] it's important to me, I’m not a priest and I didn’t sign up for a life of celibacy. If I woke up today in some kind of sexless marriage like so many Americans do, I would be genuinely upset by that. I would try to change it with my partner, but if I couldn’t change it, I don’t know if I would just walk out the door. I believe the social science, I’ve seen it firsthand, how children raised in single-parent households have more trouble with drugs and alcohol, have fewer educational opportunities, and get in trouble with the law. I don’t want to do that to my family and I certainly don’t want to do that because everything else I have going for me is great. I like my lifestyle, so why would I give it all up because the number five or six thing on my list -– my sex life -– is not where it should be?

So yes, if my brother came to me and said I can't take it anymore, I'm either leaving or I'm having an affair, I would encourage him to have an affair first.

Amanda, would you stay in a marriage where you knew your husband was being unfaithful for the sake of keeping your family together?

Amanda: I wouldn’t just walk into divorce. But, I mean, I also wouldn’t deal with a relationship where I knew there were interpersonal relations going on without me. We definitely differ on that point. I get that some people are doing this to fulfill a need and to make themselves more fulfilled and happier. I’m not here to judge those people. Personally, that’s not how I live my life. That’s not how I live my life and how I define my relationship and what I would accept moving forward.

Has running a site like AshleyMadison informed how you behave in your own marriage in any way?

Noel: Ironically, I talk about infidelity more than any man on the planet, so hopefully I can navigate a monogamous relationship more successfully than a lot of people. But even then, I don’t know if I can, but I’m going to try.

Monogamy is a man-made notion –- it’s not in our DNA. It’s not what we’re engineered for. We might think it’s a noble cause and something worth pursuing, but anything against our DNA is something we’re going to struggle with... I’ve seen study after study showing that the longer a couple is together, the more their sex life diminishes. I’ve yet to see any one where it says, “Twenty years later, those two are still hot and heavy” -– it just doesn’t play out that way. We’re working against something... So it's with that knowledge base that I keep coming back to my own marriage in a different way. While we don’t have an open marriage in a sexual sense, we have a very open marriage in the sense that we can challenge and ask a lot of things of one another because we understand how important our marriage is and how often it can become turbulent.

My wife and I have a very honest relationship with each other -- blunt almost. I think getting things off our chests is the approach we took, knowing that it won’t always go our way but at least it’s out there for the other partner to deal with. That’s kind of suited us. We’re very passionate and when things are great, we ride really high. We also have our moments, but we definitely don’t sleep on the issue –- and I think that’s the secret to our success today.

Amanda: I think we’re lucky that his role as CEO of Ashley Madison has helped us understand the pitfalls more than anybody else. I also walked into this marriage open-eyed about the realities of relationships because my parents divorced when I was relatively young. I’ve had to deal with the aftermath of that and it wasn’t a nice divorce... I’m 38 years old and I’m still dealing with aftermath of that. I just always wanted to have a relationship where I never ended it in divorce."

* Reid ""disappointed"" with lack of Republican budget offers

* Republicans: Obama tax demands a ""sticking point""

By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he was ""disappointed"" with budget talks between Republican senators and the White House, saying President Barack Obama has offered concessions while Republicans refuse to budge.

The discussions have been the only significant channel for communications between the White House and congressional Republicans on the budget in recent weeks as the government faces a possible shutdown if a deal can't be reached by Sept. 30.

Thus far the group, led loosely by Georgia Republican moderate Johnny Isakson and numbering as high as 25, has mainly tried to persuade White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and other top officials that the budget solutions should be designed to tame deficits over a 30-year period, rather than the traditional 10-year budget window used by Congress.

The Republican senators say this would require deeper cuts to expensive federal benefits programs for the elderly, which grow exponentially in the 2020s and 2030s as the massive Baby Boom generation retires in force.

Reid complained that the Republican group had not offered any specific proposals and wasn't working with Senate Democrats to replace automatic ""sequester"" spending cuts or resolve other budget differences.

""I've been disappointed with the meetings the Republicans have had with the president. The last one, as I understand it, was yesterday,"" Reid told reporters on Tuesday.

""All they talk about is, Mr President, what are you going to do?"" Reid said. ""He's already done things a number of people in my caucus, they're not wild about. But he's put forward his proposal. The Republicans refuse to come up with anything in writing.""

Obama has offered Republicans a change in the way cost-of-living increases are calculated, using a less-generous measure of inflation, but has demanded additional tax increases on the wealthy. Many Democrats have balked at the proposal because it would effectively reduce Social Security payments to seniors in future years.

TAX REVENUE ROADBLOCK

McDonough and other members of Obama's economic team are continuing to meet with the Republican group, which also includes Senators Kelly Ayotte, John Hoeven, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, John McCain and Tom Coburn, a senior administration official said.

The official said the talks would continue, despite not yielding any results so far. To date the Republican senators have not offered specific proposals and have not agreed to put revenues on the table.

""Obviously the challenge is that the administration wants $583 billion in higher taxes and that just doesn't work for us,"" said Hoeven, of North Dakota. ""Revenues should come through economic growth, not higher taxes. That's the stumbling block.""

He said, however, that Obama's cost-of-living proposal shows there is room for agreement in some areas to reform benefit programs known as entitlements.

A more immediate problem for Congress, however, will be reconciling deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans over spending on discretionary programs ranging from education to the military, and replacing the across-the-board sequester cuts with savings elsewhere.

If these issues can't be resolved before the end of September, the government faces a strong risk of shutting down over lack of funding as the new fiscal year gets underway on Oct. 1.

Time is already running short, as Congress starts a five-week recess on Friday, and has scheduled only nine legislative days in September.

Reid said Democrats were ready to negotiate any size fiscal agreement - ""a big deal, a middle-sized deal, any kind of a deal. But you can't do it unless Republicans agree.""

On Wednesday, Obama will come to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in both the House and Senate to discuss his plans for tax reform, job growth and budget issues."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Trump has deleted some of the Twitter tirade he posted following President Barack Obama's re-election and added new critiques of NBC's Brian Williams. Trump began tweeting before the election was called that it was a total sham and a travesty. After news outlets projected that Obama won the election, Trump tweeted, Well, back to the drawing board! He posted more than 10 angry tweets, declaring our nation is a once great nation divided and the world is laughing at us. He encouraged a revolution in this country.(AP Photo/David J.

Jon Karl, the network's chief White House correspondent, interviewed Trump in Ames, Iowa on Saturday night. He asked Trump whether he ""could be taken seriously as a presidential candidate"" and to respond to criticism that his talk of running is merely a ""publicity stunt."" Trump said that he is considering running.

On Sunday, Media Matters blasted ABC News' decision to host Trump on the program. ""Trump is unlikely to be an actual candidate in this election or any other, and never has been- why would ABC News allow itself to be used for yet another round of promotional appearances for a charlatan?"" the organization wrote.

Other viewers also balked at the interview. The Huffington Post's Sam Stein tweeted:

Before the interview aired, he said that the prospect of a Trump candidacy had some people ""raising their eyebrows"" or ""rolling their eyes.""

Trump was the butt of many jokes during the 2012 campaign, as he repeatedly teased his potential candidacy (he eventually endorsed Mitt Romney) and alleged that President Obama was not born in the United States. In one particularly ridiculous stunt, he offered Obama $5 million if the president released his college transcript and passport records."

An article from the radical website DreamActivist.org will give you a quick lesson on how to lie about your status. It’s all part of the aggressive pro-illegal immigration ‘Dreamer movement’ that is leading the fight for “comprehensive” immigration reform, with a boost from President Barack Obama and many in Congress.

The “Dreamers” are illegal immigrants who were brought into the country by their parents. They’ve become the darlings of the media, garnering both positive press and an executive order by President Obama in 2012, offering them legal status if they met certain requirements and paid a $465 fee. Even that controversial end-run around Congress, however, wasn’t enough for the Dream activists as they pursued an agenda that rejects the idea of borders and deportation entirely.

The theatrical direct-actions of the Dreamers have intensified in recent months, including the ‘Dream 9’ activists who went to Mexico and then came back into the United States using an asylum claim. The avowed and proud illegal immigrants have used in-your-face social justice tactics for years, however, showing a dedication and a long-term view that opponents of amnesty would do well to note.

The Dreamer movement has been pushing the edge of the envelope in both their goals and tactics. They are gaining ground. The ACLU recently called Dreamers ‘the face of immigration reform movement’ and wrote:

But as important as their stories have been to the immigration reform movement, we can’t lose sight of the critical organizing DREAMers have been engaged in for years, pushing not only for the DREAM Act, but also for creating an environment where voices as disparate as Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) can vote “Yes” to move sweeping immigration reform legislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

So, what sort of enviroment have they created? An example of the Dreamers long-term animosity towards any enforcement of immigration laws is a 2009 article on the DreamActivist.org site entitled Particulars and Universals #3: Tips on How to Lie Successfully.

The anonymous author of the article doesn’t see a problem with the fact that illegal immigrants are violating the law. The problem is they aren’t good at lying.

…many undocumented youths conceal their immigration status when faced with potentially awkward questions, but the problem is that they absolutely suck at it. When faced with an instance in which they have to lie, they come up with a myriad of half-hearted excuses that they think up on the spot.



In order to help solve the “problem” of bad lying, the Dream Activist site gives a few tips on lying more effectively. Tip #1 is ‘Think up a lie beforehand’, while Tip #3 is ‘Be consistent.’

Create lies that are close to the truth and easy to keep track of. Think up lies that you know you can be absolutely consistent about. Write them down in a notepad if you must.

The article also suggests that illegal immigrants can ‘pretend that you’re an international student who has been taking public education in the U.S. since elementary school.’

The article stresses ‘this post is for tips on how to lie only to your friends and acquaintances’ and suggests never lying to officials ‘in writing’ but also says:

I’d like to take a moment here and stress that not lying does not mean having to reveal the truth. You have the right to remain silent. In fact, do not confess that you’re undocumented if you’re approached by immigration officials; know your rights.

The author also says “I know that it’s a bit corruptive to give young people tips on how to lie well” but they justify it immediately by saying that illegal immigrants understandably want to lie so they don’t ‘feel very dispirited.’

The Dream Activist site was co-founded by Peruvian Maria Marroquin, self-indentifed Fijian law school graduate Prerna Lal, and Iranian gay activist Mohammad Abdollahi. The site says it ‘would not be possible’ without the help of people like Lizbeth Mateo, one of the ‘Dream 9’ Activists previously profiled by Breitbart News for her claim to have been employed by a Washignton D.C. based community organizing group."

http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/09/pf/taxes/irs-budget-cuts/index.html,2013-04-09 00:00:00,['Jennifer Liberto'],Budget cuts cause long wait times on IRS help line,"Budget cuts at the Internal Revenue Service are causing long lines for the poor and elderly seeking free tax preparation advice, lengthier hold times for IRS help line calls and delays in tax refunds for identify theft victims.

With a hiring freeze preventing the IRS from replacing workers who retire or leave for other jobs, existing staffers say they're feeling the pressure of lack of manpower, according to the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents federal employees at the tax collection agency.

The IRS has lost 10,000 employees to attrition in just the past two years, or over 9% of its total workforce.

""We are doing as best we can with a staff of 14 that used to be a staff of 32,"" said one IRS employee about working conditions in a survey conducted by the union.

In an effort to prevent additional budget cuts from wreaking havoc during the height of the tax filing season, the IRS pushed back employee furloughs until the summer, after the April 15 deadline for filing tax returns.

Forced cuts have already begun to take root at dozens of other federal agencies, triggered on March 1 by $85 billion in automatic government spending cuts. Tens of thousands of defense workers have lost jobs and federal public defenders have already started to take unpaid time off at home.

Federal furloughs a non-event? Not so fast

The IRS has been trimming costs in preparation for the forced budget cuts, just like other agencies. That's meant that staff levels have dwindled at the 389 Taxpayer Assistance Centers nationwide. Typically, these centers offer tax and retirement counseling for the elderly and help the poor prepare their returns for free.

The National Taxpayer Advocate estimated that these centers will serve about 5.4 million people by this year's tax filing deadline, down from 6.4 million in 2011, according to a report.

IRS workers told the union that taxpayers are lining up outside the centers ""beginning in the pre-dawn hours"" before the assistance centers open, according to the union survey.

""A lot of people are still depending on face-to-face assistance, and if they can't get that assistance, it causes errors in the returns and delays in the refunds,"" union president Colleen Kelley said.

Budget cuts and lack of staff have increased wait times for those seeking IRS help by phone to 18 minutes on average this tax season. That's up from 13 minutes in 2011, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate's report.

The likelihood that a caller would get a live IRS employee on the phone for tax questions also fell, according to the report. This year only 63% of taxpayers who call the IRS are expected to successfully get help, down from 70% of callers in 2011. More taxpayers just hang up in frustration, the report found.

Identity theft victims are among the worst hit -- having to wait six months to a year if they're seeking tax refunds, the union said.

The situation could only get worse. Currently, IRS employees are facing between five and seven days of unpaid time off, with the first furlough possibly kicking in around Memorial Day, May 27.

The agency has also been cutting costs for travel, training, facilities and supplies, according to a February memo from IRS acting Commissioner Steven Miller.

""The employees are doing an incredible job, given what they're up against -- there's only so many of them and so many hours in a day,"" Kelley said.

The survey was produced from an analysis of thousands of written responses by IRS employees who wrote essays explaining how budget cuts were affecting taxpayer services, said union spokeswoman Dina Long.

A request for comment from Treasury Department was not returned."

Bush on Thursday dedicated the library, museum and policy center that bear his name.

“Oh, happy day,” Bush told the crowd of about 8,000 in the bright Texas sunshine at the campus of Southern Methodist University, home of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. He recited his administration’s successes, especially in rallying the nation after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

“I dedicate this library with an unshakable faith in the future of our country,” Bush said, noting that he had “the honor of a lifetime to lead a country as brave and as noble as the United States. Whatever challenges come before us, I will always believe our nation’s best days lie ahead. God bless.”

QUIZ: George W. Bush’s presidency

By the end of his comments, Bush had wiped away a few tears.

Earlier, President Obama praised Bush.

“Mr. President for your service, for your courage for your sense of humor and most of all for your love of country,” Obama said to Bush, “thank you very much.”

Laura Bush greeted President Obama and his wife, Michelle, and the former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and their spouses, and her father-in-law and mother-in-law.

For George W. Bush, now 66, the dedication of the 23-acre complex, housing the presidential library, museum and policy institute, is a coming-out party of sorts as the former chief executive has stayed in the background in recent years.

Also in attendance will be NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and former heads of state including former Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain, Ehud Olmert of Israel and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy as well as Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar.

Former Bush chiefs of staff Andrew Card and Joshua Bolten arrived in the predawn hours after spending the night at a gathering of former White House staff at the Katy Trail Ice House.

Card called the celebration “a phenomenal reunion” that “generates a flood of fantastic memories.”

The president and First Lady Michelle Obama arrived in Dallas on Wednesday.

“I have a terrific relationship with a number of our successors,” Bolten said. “While we have different ideologies, we’ve been in their shoes and we wish them well.”

Card added, “We are truly empathetic for the burden they carry. Too many people look at the presidency as a partisan seat, and it’s not. It’s a burden, and we know from seeing it up close what a lonely and highly personal burden it can be, making a decision and carrying the consequences.”

Card and Bolten called Bush a “courageous leader” who stood by his decisions and said they hoped that, through the museum, the public would get a better understanding of the challenges he faced.

“I hope people come away with a recognition that this wasn’t a president who chased popularity,” Bolten said, although Bush has fared better in the polls of late.

More than 8,000 are expected to attend the dedication of the $250-million facility, the 13th presidential library operated by the National Archives. The building houses 43,000 artifacts, 70 million pages of paper records and 200 million emails, the largest digital archive of any presidential library.

Tickets will be $16 when it opens to the public May 1.

Connie and Alan Herbert, who also attended the library groundbreaking, traveled to Dallas from Chicago to attend the event.

“I am a huge George W. Bush fan,” said Connie Herbert, adding that the library “is not about him, it’s about his presidency.”

Alan Herbert, who retired from running a medical device company, said the event may increase Bush’s popularity.

“Polls show it already has increased. I think most people admire the fact that he hasn’t criticized Obama -- he’s taking the high road,” Herbert said.

The couple said they were also excited to see other dignitaries.

“It’s not often you get to see all five presidents,” he said, noting the event highlights the civility of American politics in which “there’s a higher calling -- they come together at times like this.”

Protesters were expected on the periphery of the dedication Thursday, but were not visible from the library. Many of those filing onto campus were longtime Bush fans, including Texans sporting gold “W” lapel pins.

“He served the people of Texas well,” said Rick Witherspoon of Dallas, who works in the food industry and brought his wife, Evelyn, to honor both George and former First Lady Laura Bush.

“His whole family is dedicated to public service,” Witherspoon said, “The United States is very lucky to have people of their caliber.”

With a voice vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved legislation Wednesday that could result in the firing of some federal employees who owe taxes and block job candidates in the same fix.

Democrats objected to the bill, saying it unfairly and unnecessarily focuses on federal workers and also could be counterproductive.

“This legislation simply seeks to demonize federal employees rather than ensure their compliance with tax obligations,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee. “By requiring agencies to fire employees for not paying their taxes on time, the measure actually undermines the ability of the government to collect the unpaid taxes. It is much more difficult to recoup delinquent taxes from someone who is unemployed.”

With bipartisan support, the committee also approved legislation that would require tax compliance for federal contracting companies.

“The very least an individual on the federal payroll can do is pay their taxes,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chief sponsor of the bills. “If you are thumbing your nose up at the American taxpayer by not paying your taxes, you should be fired or not awarded a federal contract.”

Those with “seriously delinquent tax debt” would not be eligible to be federal employees, under the legislation. Just 3.62 percent of federal civilian employees were tax-delinquent in 2011, which is far better than the rate for the general public, according to Internal Revenue Service data. The legislation, however, would not apply to all federal employees who are delinquent, only those with a federal tax lien.

The IRS said that liens generally are placed against about 12 percent of those who are delinquent. That means less than 0.4 percent of federal employees could be fired, under the legislation. Further, the bill exempts certain tax debt, including that being paid off under a payment agreement or when there is taxpayer hardship.

“If someone is trying to do the right thing,” Chaffetz said, “of course, we want them to continue to be employed.” Citing the IRS, he said that seriously delinquent federal employees owe more than $1 billion.

“I hope that number [of delinquent employees] gets driven down to zero,” he said in an interview. “The intention is not to fire people, but to motivate them.”

Rather than motivating compliance, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) suggested that the legislation could make it more difficult for the debtors to pay. “If they [federal employees] are fired,” she said, “we lose the ability to collect on the debt.” Speier co-sponsored the bill on tax-delinquent contractors.

D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) complained that the employee legislation holds “federal employees up for special targeting.”

That targeting is unnecessary, Cummings said, because “under current law and regulations, agencies can take disciplinary action against employees for failing to meet their tax obligations, ranging from counseling to outright removal. I don’t see how the exemplary compliance rate among federal employees justifies the adoption of a new law that would apply only to federal employees.”

Union rally

About the same time the House committee was meeting in the Rayburn House Office Building, members of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and other unionists rallied outside the Labor Department against sweeping budget cuts knows as the sequester.

More than a million federal workers face unpaid furlough days because of the cuts.

“Who should be furloughed?” shouted Alex Bastani, president of AFGE Local 12 at Labor.

“Congress,” came the crowd’s reply.

“When should they be furloughed?”

“Now.”

The Labor Department rally was one of more than 100 the union said were organized across the country to protest cuts that would lead to reduced government service. The sequester, Bastani said, affects “not just federal employees. It affects the community.”

“We’re not just a bunch of bureaucrats sitting around,"" he added. “We do real work that affects real people.”

The D.C. rally drew international attention. Video journalists from Japanese and French news organizations were on the scene.

Meanwhile, the AFGE is temporarily homeless.

Its national headquarters in downtown Washington has been closed since Monday because of a fire that left its building without electricity.

“We’re telecommuting for the week,” said Brian J. DeWyngaert, an AFGE official at the rally.

At some point, John Boehner is going to have to step up and actually lead his caucus.

House Republicans held a big closed-door meeting Wednesday to discuss what they were going to do about immigration reform. And since while the meeting was closed-door, they apparently all came out and started dishing to every reporter in sight, we know quite a lot about what was said. The bottom line was a given: House Republicans don't like brown people, they don't like immigration, they don't like President Obama, they would like insane amounts of border security. Beyond that, well, they're in disarray.

As much as Republicans emerged from the meeting railing against an Obama administration that they say ""cannot be trusted to deliver on its promises to secure the border and enforce laws as part of a single, massive bill like the one passed by the Senate,"" there are also clear signs that many Republicans still know they're going to be in electoral trouble if they don't do something significant on immigration:



“I think the majority of Republicans want to get something done,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador of Idaho, adding that he thinks the majority of the conference stands behind perhaps not a pathway to citizenship but at least a pathway to legalization that would grant status to so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who opposes any immigration overhaul, described the party’s split over a citizenship or legalization pathway as about “fifty-fifty.”

Lawmakers are also still divided on whether it’s even necessary to pass immigration reform in the 113th Congress. Though the Senate passage creates some sense of urgency for the House to act, many Republicans don’t believe that action is crucial. As it is, the new school of thought is that no action on a House immigration measure would happen until after the August recess.

But given the conflict between those who know the party's future will be endangered by inaction and those who want to take punitive action against immigrants, Republicans seem inclined to kick the can down the road:Because when you're in this much disarray, delay has to look good. The question then is how the passing time will wear on John Boehner"

Editor’s Note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.

(CNN) —

“The stupidity is simply staggering,” Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, told Roll Call. He was referring to the political miscalculation of anti-abortion forces in the House Judiciary Committee who insisted this week on reviving the culture wars, years behind us, still again, with yet another proposed abortion bill.

This bill, championed by Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks, sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. “I’ll be very frank: I discouraged our leadership from bringing this to a vote on the floor,” Dent said.

My e-mail box was flooded with headlines that began “This again?” and “This … is the GOP’s idea of outreach to women? Really?” and “He said what?” The latter referred to a remark by Franks, chairman of the committee, that “incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,” as a justification for the bill ignoring rape and incest victims.

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were apparently willing to allow the time when an abortion is legal to be reduced by one month. They sought to add exceptions for rape, incest and the woman’s health – all of which were rejected by Republicans on the panel.

But it appears the House Republican leaders, recognizing a train wreck, added the language to the bill anyway to avoid an embarrassing defeat. The bill will also include an exception for a medical emergency in which the woman might die. This new altered version goes before the Rules Committee on Monday. There are, by the way, 22 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. All men. Not a single woman.

It’s hard to avoid inflammatory remarks when discussing rape. And the line between inflammatory and insulting is thin. It’s also porous. So if Franks thought he had to address the issue of rape, he should have done so judiciously.

His remark says to women impregnated by rape: You don’t count. There aren’t enough of you to matter. That’s not just insensitive; it’s immoral.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, first pounced on the statement’s factual inaccuracy. “I just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low,” she said. “There’s no scientific basis for that.”

Then Lofgren, one of five women among the Democratic minority on the committee, added, “And the idea that the Republican men on this committee can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous.”

It might be that Franks’ argument, such as it is, echoed a comment by Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin, who claimed during his Senate campaign last fall that women’s bodies have a built-in mechanism to prevent impregnation from “a legitimate rape.” Aiken’s candidacy went into a tailspin from that misinformed remark, and never recovered.

Fact checkers have pointed to studies that indicate Franks’ claim is as suspect as Akin’s. One study by St. Lawrence University found that pregnancies resulting from rape were higher than from other instances.

Franks later walked back his low-pregnancy-from-rape argument, saying he was not claiming it was harder to get pregnant from rape. Franks apparently based his claim on there being fewer pregnancies from rape than from consensual intercourse. Even so, that’s a “Duh, do the math” excuse.

GOP aides now say Rep. Marsha Blackburn will be managing Franks’ anti-abortion bill. Given her record – “no” votes on major equality or women-protection legislation and “yea” for issues like ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood – that’s hardly an improvement.

And it misses the point. It’s not the who, it’s the what – the argument itself does not stand.

During the Judiciary debate, Franks said, “When you make that exception, there’s usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours. And in this case that’s impossible. … And that’s what completely negates and vitiates the purpose for such an amendment.”

So, Franks’ argument then became a technical one, that if a rape wasn’t reported, a decision after 20 weeks to abort was made too late. But why is it too late? Does psychological trauma have a timetable? Each case of rape that produces a pregnancy is as individual as the woman who was raped. And the ordeal – psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual – is not term-limited.

The issue of abortion raises real and poignant moral questions. Franks made many remarks that show his obvious, deeply felt, conviction that abortions after 20 weeks are wrong.

But majorities in Congress and of Americans, also with deep conviction, came to a different conclusion: They feel compelled to support exceptions for rape, incest and health.

Franks’ outrageous comment and the viewpoints of other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee illustrate that when one party becomes so narrowly composed that it represents a particular religious culture, we’re headed to what people in other countries face when a ruling party begins making laws from religious theology, without regard to a democratic, secular society – thus excluding other religious viewpoints and dismissing those who suffer as too few to matter.

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) coordinating which way members of the “Gang of Eight” who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee would vote on immigration bill amendments, Breitbart News has learned.

“Do our Republicans have a pass on this one if they want?” the microphone caught Schumer saying.

The hot mic remarks came during the Judiciary Committee markup on Monday, when Schumer was talking to his staff while senators were voting on an amendment that would prevent illegal immigrants from gaining access to public benefits, specifically the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

The amendment, offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), would have barred illegal immigrants from accessing tax credits like the EITC under the bill until they received green cards or citizenship years from now.

The amendment failed along party lines. For one of the first times ever, though, Gang of Eight members Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) joined their Republican colleagues in voting for the amendment. All the Democrats voted against it.

The National Journal recently reported that the Gang of Eight members have coordinated in secret to keep amendments that would strengthen the bill from passing. Sessions expressed outrage at that report, saying that “[o]ne of the things that most upsets the American people about Washington is drafting a bill with special interests in secret and jamming it across the finish line in a way that minimizes public involvement and input. Despite touting their legislation as ‘the toughest border enforcement in history,’ the Gang of Eight bill failed to live up to every major promise of its sponsors–including the promise of enforcement first–resulting in a bill that is even weaker than the rejected 2007 plan. This legislation needs improvement and openness.”

because the depiction — as a joke, of course — of a woman on a date with a cartoon pig might encourage bestiality, while you're also demanding that Skittles remove this ad

where a woman kisses a walrus because it may — yes, you guessed it — encourage bestiality, you have to ask yourself this: Aren't you thinking a little too much about bestiality?

I mean, seriously, if I'm the depraved Hollywood liberal, how come when I see these ads, I don't think, ""Oh, bestiality, you forbidden fruit, how you tempt me!"" Not even a little. But, you, wholesome Christian do-gooder, see this and think, ""Please, Jesus, give me the strength to not fuck my cat!"" (wild audience applause)

Now, I only bring this up because the Christian pressure group responsible for protesting these ads is called One Million Moms, and they are an example of a much larger problem we need to deal with, a problem I call shit-kicker inflation. Which is the phenomenon of all things conservative being portrayed as way bigger than they really are.

To wit, I looked up One Million Moms on Twitter, and the number of followers they have is 2,258. That's how many my Aunt Marjorie has, and she's got one post, and it says, ""Is this thing working?""

And Million Moms are not alone in pretending they're not alone. The Catholic League is another group constantly in the news because they also love to get freaked out about nonsense that would make even Pat Robertson go, ""Oh, for Christ's sakes, relax!"" But just as there aren't a million moms in One Million Moms, there is no league in the Catholic League. It's one guy with a fax machine.

Now, a recent study found that politicians in both parties consistently thought that their constituents were much more conservative than they actually were. And that's because there's a relatively small group of very shrill people devoted to — and succeeding at — convincing us that this is a much more conservative and religious nation than it is. (audience applause)

Americans, for example, don't hate socialism. They just can't define it. Even though it's kind of right in the name ""Social Security"". Kinda right in the name. Which even Tea Partiers do not want to cut.

Same thing with Obamacare. As an idea, it's unpopular. But ask voters about the elements in it, they're all very popular. It's like saying, ""I hate pizza! I love tomato sauce and melted cheese on dough, but pizza? I hate that shit.""

Same with guns! We found out this week that gun ownership is actually down in this country. Way down. And yet the NRA, with just four million members, has a stranglehold on the gun policies in a nation of 300 million.

This misreading of where the public really is explains why at this moment, a cross-section of Republican politicians are at CPAC delivering a simple message to the right-wingers who keep losing them elections. And that message is: ""Whatever you do, don't change."" Among the featured speakers at CPAC this year include Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum, Wayne LaPierre, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin — a virtual Who's Who of What The Fuck. (audience cheering and applause)

And look, the convention is still going on, so I won't presume to know everything that's going to be said at this open mic from hell, but.... Oh, screw it! Yes, I do know. I know exactly what'll be said, because it's exactly what they always say. They will get up, one after another, and say that they speak for the vast majority of real Americans who hate socialism and own guns and feel their values are under attack.

Except they don't speak for the vast majority of Americans, or a majority at all. (audience applause) They're just so loud they haven't noticed that America has moved on without them. They're like a nasty, old man still bitching about the kids who keep hitting the ball into his yard, even though those kids have grown up and moved away. And he's still the senior senator from Arizona. (audience cheering)"

It differed from phone to phone, but sometime between late Monday and early Tuesday many mobile phones across Southern California received an Amber Alert related to two missing children in San Diego.

James Lee DiMaggio is suspected of killing Christina Anderson, 44, of Lakeside and kidnapping one or both of her children: Hannah Anderson, 16, and Ethan Anderson, 8.

Amber Alert Q&A: Why it happens, how to turn it off

Christina Anderson’s body was found Sunday night in the burning rubble of a house in the rural community of Boulevard in eastern San Diego County, authorities said.

The two children were likely abducted about 5 p.m. on Saturday, authorities said.

Amber Alerts sent out overnight described the vehicle DiMaggio is believed to be traveling in: a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. Authorities believe he may be making his way north to Canada.

Some cellphones received only a text message, others buzzed and beeped. Some people got more than one alert.

It’s all thanks to the Wireless Emergency Alert program, a cellphone version of the Emergency Alert System that gives you the high-pitched test tone on your television.

Cellphone owners receive messages automatically, based on their proximity to the emergency, not based on their phone number.

“If you’re from Texas and that’s where your phone number is based and you’re traveling in California at the time of the Amber Alert, you’ll receive the text message about the Amber Alert in California on your Texas-based phone,” said CHP spokeswoman Fran Clader.

The messages go out over a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast and aren’t affected by regular cellphone traffic that might disrupt calls and text messages during times of heavy usage, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which has teamed with the government in the program.

The signal is transmitted simultaneously to all mobile devices within the range of cell towers in the affected area. There are no texting charges. The system does not track phones’ whereabouts.

The system is a second-generation Amber Alert and replaces the Wireless Amber Alert program that sent text alerts only to cellphone users who subscribed to the service. The new system began Jan. 1 and requires cellphone customers to opt out to stop receiving alerts.

Hannah Anderson is described as 5-foot-7, 115 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes, a belly button ring, nose stud and pierced ears.

Ethan Anderson is described as 4-foot-11, 65 pounds with sandy blond hair.

DiMaggio is described as 5-foot-9, 150 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the homicide detail at (858) 974-2321 or (858) 565-5200, or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477.

The Amber Alert program was created in 1996 in honor of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman, who was abducted and murdered near her home in Arlington, Texas.

To opt-out of the emergency alerts, change your phone’s message or alert message settings. They’re automatically included on phones that receive the alerts.

Pollak'],"Debate Commission Co-Chair: Yeah, Candy Crowley Was a 'Mistake'","In a lecture to conservatives at the Las Vegas Country Club, Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, admitted that the selection of CNN’s Candy Crowley to moderate the second presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney in October 2012 had been a “mistake.”

Crowley stirred controversy by intervening in the town hall-style debate to support Obama’s contention that he had referred to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi as a terrorist attack the day after it had occurred. In fact, as Crowley herself later admitted, Obama had not done so, referring only to “acts of terror” in general. In a CBS interview taped the same day, Obama declined to refer to the attack as a terrorist act, and subsequently supported a false story about a protest over an anti-Islamic video that never took place.

After Crowley backed up the president, some members of the audience burst into applause, in violation of the rules. The effect was not lost on the audience, which scored the debate as an Obama win–nor was it lost on Romney, who was sufficiently chastened that he refused to bring up the Benghazi issue again in the third presidential debate, even though that debate was specifically focused on foreign policy and national security.

Though it was likely not the only factor, or even the major factor, in Romney’s defeat, Crowley’s error slowed the new momentum that Romney had enjoyed since defeating Obama soundly in the first presidential debate. Her intervention also reinforced the media lack of interest in pursuing the Benghazi issue with the president.

Fahrenkopf, a stalwart Republican, co-chairs the Commission on Presidential Debates with Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Politico’s Dylan Byers reports that the executive director of the Commission, Janet Brown, has refused to comment on Fahrenkopf’s remarks."

The singer was joined by the United States Marine Band.

Clarkson's performance came with its own backstory. In December 2011, Clarkson endorsed Republican Ron Paul, citing his ""refreshing"" small-government views. The singer -- who describes herself as ""a Republican at heart"" -- then said she would vote for Obama ""again"" after he announced his support for gay marriage.

The ""American Idol"" alum counts Sen. Chuck Schumer among her Washington fans. Schumer, the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, praised the singer in an appearance on HuffPost Live.

""I felt very good about myself, because I listened to her and I said, 'I really like her,' and then only later did I learn she had won 'American Idol,'"" Schumer said. ""So I was very glad that my tastes were the same as most of America's.""

On Monday, Schumer responded to Clarkson's performance with just one word: ""Wow!"" Here's what Clarkson had to say for herself:

Wow ....I was incredibly nervous and cold ha! I just wanna officially thank President Obama for opening for me haha! Just kidding :) — Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) January 21, 2013



A host of other musicians and singers were spotted at events surrounding the actual inauguration. Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder and Usher were among those who scored inauguration weekend gigs.

One of the President's favorite genres was celebrated at the Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball, where rappers 2 Chainz and MC Lyte and singer John Legend were honored at the Sunday night event.

Their speeches were far better received than an impromptu one by rapper Lupe Fiasco, who was reportedly pulled from the stage after an anti-Obama rant of sorts at the StartUp RockOn concert.

Four years ago, Aretha Franklin sang ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" and The United States Navy Band ""Sea Chanters"" chorus performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Barack and Michelle Obama famously danced to Beyonce's cover of Etta James' ""At Last"" at an inaugural ball.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Thomas E. Mann is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. They are the authors of “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism.”

Our political system was not designed to be efficient, but it wasn’t supposed to be self-destructive, either. After a near-default on the public debt and a “fiscal cliff” that threatened a new recession, we are facing another man-made crisis: the sequester, across-the-board cuts in discretionary domestic and defense spending that began Friday and will extend over a decade. Let’s separate fact from fiction about the sequester and its impact.

1. Blame Obama — the sequester was his White House’s idea.

Identifying the origins of the sequester has become a major Washington fight. Bob Woodward weighed in recently with a Washington Post op-ed making the case that the idea began in the White House. He’s right in a narrow sense, mainly because he focuses on the middle of the 2011 negotiations between Obama and Republican lawmakers. If you look before and after, a different picture emerges.

In our view, what happened is quite straightforward: In 2011, House Republican leaders used their new majority to force their priorities on the Democratically controlled Senate and the president by holding the debt limit hostage to demands for deep and immediate spending cuts. After negotiations between Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner failed (Eric Cantor recently took credit for scuttling a deal), the parties at the eleventh hour settled on a two-part solution: immediate discretionary spending caps that would result in cuts of almost $1 trillion over 10 years and the creation of a “supercommittee” tasked with reducing the 2012-2021 deficit by another $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. If the supercommittee didn’t broker a deal, automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over the next decade — the sequester — would go into effect. The sequester was designed to be so potentially destructive that the supercommittee would surely reach a deal to avert it.

The sequester’s origins can’t be blamed on one person — or one party. Republicans insisted on a trigger for automatic cuts; Jack Lew, then the White House budget director, suggested the specifics, modeled after a sequester-like mechanism Congress used in the 1980s, but with automatic tax increases added. Republicans rejected the latter but, at the time, took credit for the rest. Obama took the deal to get a debt-ceiling increase. But he never accepted the prospect that the sequester would occur, nor did he ever agree to take tax increases off the table.

2. At least the automatic cuts will reduce runaway spending and begin to control the deficit.

What runaway spending? The $787 billion stimulus was a one-time expenditure that has come and gone. Under current law, not including the sequester, non-defense discretionary spending as a share of the economy will shrink to a level not seen in 50 years. Defense spending grew substantially over the past decade, but that pattern has slowed and will soon end. Additional reductions must be achieved intelligently, tied to legitimate national security needs.

Across-the-board cuts can have perverse effects on deficits; as services are cut, the fees users pay for those services are lost. For example, sequester-driven furloughs of air-traffic controllers will lead to the number of flights being reduced.

The annual budget deficit is projected to fall by almost 50 percent in 2013 compared with the height of the recession. Reducing the deficit over the long term requires going where the money is — boosting economic growth, controlling health-care costs and increasing revenue to handle the expense of an aging population. Deeper discretionary-spending cuts are counterproductive; immediate cuts, as Europe has made, could lead to a recession and bigger deficits.

3. The amounts are so small, they won’t hurt much.

The size of the automatic cuts this fiscal year, $85 billion, looks trivial compared with our $3.7 trillion federal budget. As Post columnist George F. Will has written: “Head for the storm cellar — spending will be cut 2.3 percent! Or: Washington chain-saw massacre — we must scrape by on 97.7 percent of current spending!”

It seems like 2.3 percent of savings can be found without inflicting harm. But that 2.3 percent is applied to only a small part of the budget. And seven months, not 12, remain in this fiscal year to make the cuts. With little discretion about trimming areas such as aviation and food safety, layoffs and furloughs will interrupt services vital to the economy and public health. As disruptive as the first year of the sequester would be, imagine what a decade of automatic cuts would produce.

4. The cuts are so large, they will be catastrophic.

The administration has released state-by-state estimates of the sequester and highlighted the cutbacks most likely to harm or inconvenience the public. The reality is not so immediate or dramatic. The damage will accumulate in less visible ways, as irrational reductions in public spending impede economic growth and job creation; reduce investments in education, infrastructure and scientific research; and further disrupt the routines of a modern democracy. The longer the sequester remains in place, the more harm is inflicted.

5. This fight is all about money.

Those who relish using a sequester — some House Republicans, along with a gaggle of radio talk-show hosts, editorial writers and cable television commentators — say this is one small step toward reducing U.S. deficits and debt. But if the goal were really debt reduction, it would be easy to get a bipartisan deal that would lower the debt enough to meet the original target set by the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, with roughly a third coming from revenue. The insistence on deep discretionary-spending reductions while calling for even deeper tax cuts shows that the sequester is not about money but about taking a meat ax to government as we know it.

The tactics to achieve that goal — from the sequester to the threat to shut down the government in late March to the next confrontation over the debt limit — have made basic governance a huge challenge for the executives managing programs and agencies, nearly all of whom lack a clear sense of how much money they will have from one day to the next. Planning, recruiting personnel and drafting long-term contracts have become impossible in areas from cybersecurity to embassy security to medical research to homeland security, damaging not industries rife with waste, fraud and abuse but critical services. If only it were all about money!

A recent study said the United States is the only advanced economy that does not require paid vacation days or holidays.

The report, released Friday by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, revisited a 2007 study that compared the U.S. with nearly two dozen other countries and also found it to be the only nation that does not require paid vacation or holidays.

The recession-battered U.S. has not closed the gap since 2007, the center’s researchers said, and few companies have boosted employee benefits even as the economy has recovered.

“Relying on businesses to voluntarily provide paid leave just hasn’t worked,” said John Schmitt, senior economist and co-author of the report.

The study’s authors reported that a number of European countries guarantee their workers at least 20 paid vacation days per year. Some countries, such as Norway and France, legally require as many as 30 paid vacation days.

Canada and Japan guarantee at least 10 paid vacation days per year.

The report also tallied the average number of paid vacation and holidays provided to American workers in the private sector. The total -- 16 -- would not meet the minimum required by law in 19 countries.

The lack of paid time off is most acute for low-wage workers and employees working for small businesses, according to the report, which found that 49% of low-wage workers have paid vacation, compared with 90% of higher-wage workers.

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) has introduced a bill that would require employers to provide one week of paid vacation annually. The bill, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act, has most recently been referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

These cases continue on the long road to the Supreme Court, and President Obama’s new “accommodation” of religious employers will do nothing to stop them.

There are now at least 12 HHS Mandate cases in the federal courts of appeals, all challenging Kathleen Sebelius’ deeply-unpopular Obamacare regulation that all employers with 50 or more employees must offer healthcare plans that cover birth control, sterilization, and abortion-related services.

Grote Industries is an Indiana-based company that makes lighting systems for cars. It’s owned and managed by a family of Roman Catholics who object to birth control. On Jan. 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an injunction pending appeal in Grote Industries v. Sebelius by a 2-1 vote, holding among other things that there is enough of a chance that the HHS Mandate violates federal religious liberty protections that the Chicago-based appeals court is ordering that this company does not need to comply with the regulation.

The lead lawyer on the case, Matt Bowman from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said:

Americans have the God-given freedom to live and do business according to their faith. Forcing employers to surrender their faith in order to earn a living is unprecedented, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Honoring God is important every day, in all areas of life, including in our work. Freedom is not the government’s to give and take away when it pleases.

Then on Feb. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit also issued an injunction pending appeal in Annex Medical, Inc. v. Sebelius. Annex Medical has less than 50 employees, so it’s not required by the Obamacare law to provide healthcare. Nonetheless, the owner offers healthcare to all his employees.

But the owner of this Minnesota-based company, Stuart Lind, is again a deeply-religious man who objects to the HHS Mandate. So the federal appeals court in St. Louis likewise held that it’s likely the HHS Mandate violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and possibly the Constitution as well).

So a dozen such cases are now before different appellate courts, in different stages of appeal. (This doesn’t count dozens more cases that are before the trial-level federal district courts.) Decisions on whether to issue what are called preliminary injunctions in these cases–which will be the next step in the legal process–are likely to start coming down in late spring, meaning that sometime this fall the Supreme Court could vote to take one or more of these cases, and decide the legality of Sebelius’ abortion-related mandate in 2014 once and for all.

The Obama administration new supposed accommodation for religious employers doesn’t change this equation. Legal experts are still trying to determine if it isn’t just a series of accounting gimmicks. But even if it allowed religious employers to completely opt out of the HHS Mandate, it nonetheless only applies to nonprofit employers. The companies that secured early wins in their cases last week are for-profit, secular businesses. So their cases will continue, and within a year one of the many cases currently on appeal should be before our nation’s highest court.

During his brief trip, he instantly became an expert about the deep-rooted societal implications of Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1968 assassination there and how they affected the Grizzlies’ inability to stop Tim Duncan and Tony Parker.

He spoke about this to Jalen Rose on his BS Report podcast:

“I didn’t realize the effect [the King assassination] had on that city. […] I think from people we talk to and stuff we’ve read, the shooting kind of sets the tone for how the city thinks about stuff. We were at Game 3. Great crowd, they fall behind and the whole crowd got tense. It as like, ‘Oh no, something bad is going to happen.’ And it starts from that shooting and it’s just that mind-set they have.”

On my pyramid of inane comments about sports and the lingering effects of civic catastrophes from pop culture writers-turned-sociologists, this could make a push for No. 1.

The Martin Luther King Jr. assassination was a national tragedy. Through a series of fateful events, Memphis became the stage for that tragedy. The civic effects have been studied by many people, most of whom probably spent more than five minutes in the city. But does this mean sports fans are walking around with dark clouds around their heads 45 years later, equating a missed Zach Randolph jumpshot with the worst moment in the city’s history?

If this is the case, shouldn’t the same thing be happening in Dallas? Nope. The Cowboys won the Super Bowl nine years after John F. Kennedy was assassinated in the city. But Simmons has an explanation for that, lest his grand theory on Memphis go any more off the rails. Dallas moved past JFK, in part, because of the Cowboys and the television show Dallas. On the other hand, Memphis has done nothing to establish its own identity in the past half-century. It’s still wallowing in the pain of the tragedy. That’s why Graceland is so understated and somber.

We’re already looking forward to the next podcast when Simmons breaks down how the Northridge earthquake and debut of Beverly Hills, 90210 set the stage for the NFL leaving Los Angeles."

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, far more than were previously known. Some 327 permits are still listed as active.

Operators include police, universities, state transportation departments and at least seven federal agencies. The remotely controlled aircraft vary widely, from devices as small as model airplanes to large unarmed Predators.

The FAA, which has a September 2015 deadline from Congress to open the nation’s airspace to drone traffic, has estimated 10,000 drones could be aloft five years later. The FAA this week solicited proposals to create six sites across the country to test drones, a crucial step before widespread government and commercial use is approved.

Local and state law enforcement agencies are expected to be among the largest customers.

Earlier this month, TV footage showed a midsized drone circling over the bunker in southeast Alabama where a 65-year-old gunman held a 5-year-old boy hostage. After a tense standoff, an FBI team stormed the bunker, rescued the boy and shot his captor. Authorities refused to say who was operating the AeroVironment drone, which has a 9-foot wingspan.

In Colorado, the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office has used a fixed-wing drone to search for lost hikers in the mountains, and a helicopter drone to help crews battling fires. Flying manned planes or helicopters would cost at least $600 an hour, explained Ben Miller, who heads the program.

“We fly [drones] for less than $25 an hour,” Miller said. “It’s just a new way to put a camera up that’s affordable.”

Big-city police departments, including Los Angeles, have tested drones but are holding back on buying them until the FAA issues clear guidelines about operating in congested airspace, among other issues.

“You’ve got to take baby steps with this,” said Michael Downing, the LAPD deputy chief for counter-terrorism and special operations.

Advertisement

Los Angeles Police Department officials went to Simi Valley in December, he said, to watch a demonstration of a helicopter-like device that measured about 18 inches on each side and was powered by four propellers. It could fly about 90 minutes on its battery.

Downing said the LAPD was “pursuing the idea of purchasing” drones, but wouldn’t do so unless the FAA granted permission to fly them, and until the department could draw up policies on how to keep within privacy laws.

If the LAPD bought drones, Downing said, it initially would use them at major public events such as the Oscars or large protests. In time, drones could be flown to track fleeing suspects and assist in investigations. Tiny drones could even be used to fly inside buildings to shoot video if a suspect has barricaded himself within.

In theory, drones can offer unblinking eye-in-the-sky coverage. They can carry high-resolution video cameras, infrared sensors, license plate readers, listening devices and other high-tech gear. Companies have marketed drones disguised as sea gulls and other birds to mask their use.

Advertisement

That’s the problem, according to civil liberties groups. The technology is evolving faster than the law. Congress and courts haven’t determined whether drone surveillance would violate privacy laws more than manned planes or helicopters, or whether drone operators may be held liable for criminal trespassing, stalking or harassment.

“Americans have the right to know if and how the government is using drones to spy on them,” said Catherine Crump, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has called for updating laws to protect privacy.

A backlash has already started.

In Congress, Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas) and Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) introduced privacy legislation Thursday that would require police to get a warrant or a court order before operating a drone to collect information on individuals.

Advertisement

“We need to protect against obtrusive search and surveillance by government and civilian use,” Poe said in a telephone interview. A similar bill failed last year.

Legislatures in 15 states are considering proposals to limit drone use. The City Council in Charlottesville, Va., passed a resolution on Feb. 4 barring local police from using drones — which they don’t yet have — to collect evidence in criminal cases.

In Seattle, Mayor Mike McGinn ordered police to return two Draganflyer X6 helicopter drones earlier this month after privacy advocates and others protested. The police said they had hoped to use them for search-and-rescue operations.

Federal agencies fly drones to assist in disasters, check flood damage, do crop surveys and more. U.S. Customs and Border Protection flies the largest fleet, 10 unarmed Predators, along the northern and southern borders to help track smugglers and illegal immigrants.

Advertisement

Although flying drones might appear as easy as playing a video game, pilots and crews require extensive training.

In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Marshals Service tested two small drones in remote areas to help them track fugitives, according to law enforcement officials and documents released to the ACLU under the Freedom of Information Act. The Marshals Service abandoned the program after both drones crashed.

Except in rare cases, the military is barred from using drones in U.S. airspace to conduct surveillance or pursue individuals. No state or federal agency has proposed arming domestic drones with weapons, but the prospect has raised alarms in Congress and elsewhere.

In response to a question during an online Google chat Thursday, President Obama said drones had never been used to kill “an American citizen on American soil.”

“The rules outside of the United States are going to be different than the rules inside the United States, in part because our capacity, for example, to capture terrorists in the United States are very different than in the foothills or mountains of Afghanistan or Pakistan,” Obama said.

No drone was sent up to help find suspected killer Christopher Dorner after his truck was found burning near Big Bear Lake on Feb. 7, said Al Daniel, an officer in the aviation division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. But Customs and Border Protection transmitted secure video from a Pilatus PC-12 plane to police commanders on the ground.

Despite a massive manhunt, Dorner vanished and authorities speculated he had escaped to Mexico. Five days later, however, he was found in a snowbound cabin near his truck and died after a shootout and fire.

The long delay, and the embarrassing fact that Dorner was hiding close by the police command post, sparked sharp criticism of police tactics and abilities.

Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, said an aerial drone might have helped find Dorner more quickly.

“The search would have been much wider and quicker because you’d have an unmanned aircraft looking,” he said. “You can cover more ground.”

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

http://news.yahoo.com/federal-rule-could-upend-states-shark-fin-bans-203717163.html,,[],Federal rule could upend states' shark fin bans,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Several members of Congress representing coastal states are voicing concern about a proposed federal regulation that could pre-empt state bans on buying or selling shark fins.

Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman of California is being joined by representatives of New York, Florida and Guam in seeking changes to a proposal they say would take away a state tool to protect shark populations.

California, Hawaii, New York and several other states have passed regulations on the sale and trade of shark fins, which are used in a soup considered an Asian delicacy. California's ban on the sale, trade and possession of shark fins will go into effect Monday after a compromise allowed time for restaurants and businesses to use up their existing supplies.

A letter from the representatives and the delegate from Guam states that a proposed rule by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries management division, the National Marine Fisheries Services, would undermine those laws. California state lawmakers were also circulating an opposition letter.

""If we are to address the problem of shark-finning head on, we must allow state and territorial statutes to complement the federal regulations and further the U.S. leadership in global shark conservation,"" states the letter, which has not yet been sent to the fisheries service but was given in advance to The Associated Press.

In addition to Huffman, it is to be signed by Democratic Reps. Sam Farr of California and Grace Meng of New York, Florida Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan and Democratic Delegate Madeleine Bordallo of Guam. Their letter is dated July 8, which is when the public comment period on the proposed rule is scheduled to end.

A request for comment was left with a press officer for the National Marine Fisheries Services.

The proposal under consideration says state and territory shark fin laws are pre-empted if they are found to be inconsistent with federal fishery management plans or regulations.

Story continues

Conservation and animal welfare groups have begun circulating petitions against the proposal, but representatives of the fishing industry have argued that federal pre-emption is necessary to maintain fishing of commercially viable shark species.

Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act of 2010 in an effort to strengthen federal laws against shark finning in U.S. waters and require that sharks be landed with their fins still attached. Since then, the fisheries service has been working to craft regulations to implement the act.

Conservation and animal advocacy groups said fishermen have been able to sidestep the rules by taking only the fins of sharks and dumping the carcasses back into the sea. Advocates say tens of millions of sharks are killed each year for the worldwide demand of shark fins and products.

Jill Hepp, director of shark conservation at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said states should have the right to go beyond federal rules in protecting shark populations.

""If this goes forward as they are proposing, this has the potential to undermine the states' shark fin trade ban and it would be a considerable setback for global shark conservation,"" Hepp said.

But John Whiteside, an attorney for Sustainable Fisheries Association, a Massachusetts nonprofit founded by four seafood processors, said the federal government should have the final say over regulations, especially fish caught in federal waters.

Not doing so would violate trade laws and run afoul of treaties the federal government has with governments around the world, he said. Commercial fishing groups were successful at getting exemptions in some states for certain species of sharks, such as the dogfish, a small shark also used for fish and chips that is sustainably harvested.

However, California provides no such exemption.

""You're building a wall around the state of California from which the free flow of legal goods is forbidden,"" he said. ""If you have these states around the country that build these little islands, you can't have the free flow of commerce and that's what this country needs.""

Jennifer Fearing, California director for The Humane Society of the United States, said the state drafted its bill specifically to ban the sale of shark fins, no matter where the shark was caught.

She noted that a federal judge let California's ban stand earlier this year after the nonprofit Chinatown Neighborhood Association argued in part that state law violated Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce.

""It's not California sharks being finned,"" she said. ""It's dried processed shark fins arriving here already processed and dried. We have no idea where those sharks come from and the only way California can protect sharks globally is if they were not selling.""

California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oregon and Washington have passed laws banning the buying and selling of shark fins, according to the Humane Society. Similar bans are in effect in three U.S. Pacific territories — Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Hawaii state Sen. Clayton Hee, a Democrat who wrote the bill that made the 50th state the first to ban the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins, said Friday that the changes would benefit corporations outside the United States involved in the trade. Hee said he can't think of another incentive for the rule changes unless the agencies are arguing that there are too many sharks in the ocean.

""It's baffling to me why a government agency would work to rid the ocean of its health by taking sharks,"" Hee said.

Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said the state's law must be preserved.

""Our law is working as intended,"" he said. ""We have educated fishers and restaurants, and they are complying.""

Speakers compare immigration debate to civil rights battles

GOP leaders have rejected Senate plan that includes pathway to citizenship

Rallies also target 2 other House leaders

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio -- Hundreds of supporters of immigration reform rallied here Saturday to urge House Speaker John Boehner to push for a broad path to citizenship.

Religious leaders, union officials, legal advocates, residents and busloads of out-of-town supporters gathered in a parking lot downtown and later marched to City Hall, where the West Chester Township congressman has a local office.

""We're here to ensure that pathway to citizenship is part of a bill that emerges and gets voted on quickly,"" the Rev. Troy Jackson, director of Ohio Prophetic Voices, told the crowd.

""We don't want to be on the wrong side of history. We know looking back to the civil rights era there were a lot of people sitting on their hands and we say 'shame on them – we must act,'"" said Jeff Cook, a professor of Bible and urban ministry from Cedarville University, who also spoke.

The rally drew a diverse crowd, both locally and from out of town.

""As a nation of immigrants, I think there should be a path for citizenship,"" said Derek Alvarado, a Springfield resident and middle-school teacher.

Also in the crowd, listening to the speakers was Ester Arteaga, 44, of Louisville, who came on one of six buses of supporters.

A U.S. citizen naturalized from Guatemala two years ago, she said she was here to ease the path for others who want to live peacefully and work in America.

A receptionist for an immigration lawyer, Arteaga, her husband and two sons all sought citizenship at the same time. It took nine years.

""We came here for a better life for our kids,"" she said. ""We're so happy to be citizens and we want others to have it.""

She worries for less fortunate family members.

Her husband's brother, a former accountant, lives in Oklahoma; undocumented, he works in a furniture factory.

""Immigration reform is the right thing to do – workers should be able to come out of the shadows and not be exploited,"" said Bill Dudley, director of strategic campaigns for the UFCW.

At a press briefing two days ago, Boehner said his colleagues want immigration reform, too.

""House Republicans are committed to fixing a broken immigration system,"" he said. ""We're working on a common-sense, step-by-step approach to ensure that the American people have confidence that we're addressing these issues openly and honestly. Our focus is on getting the policy right, so we fix our immigration system once and for all, and help our economy grow.""

The rally outside Boehner's office was one of three events scheduled for this weekend. Other rallies were set to target House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Chief Deputy Whip Peter Roskam, R-Ill.

Boehner and other GOP leaders have rejected a Senate-passed immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Instead, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to advance a series of narrowly focused bills related to border security and other immigration issues.

This week, a House subcommittee debated a proposal that would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children but would not do the same for their parents who knowingly broke the law."

President Hints At Daughter Going On 'Dates',"First lady Michelle Obama speaks with her daughter Malia at the ceremonial swearing-in for President Barack Obama at the U.S. Capitol during the 57th Presidential Inauguration in Washington, Monday, Jan. 21, 2013. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)

It's been less than a month since the nation began speculating just how Sasha and Malia Obama's teenage milestones will play out during their father's second term. And already, the President is offering some clues.

During a stop in Georgia Thursday, where he pushed his education agenda, President Obama hinted that one of his daughters -- most likely the eldest, 14-year-old Malia -- is officially dating.

""I do have to warn the parents who are here, who still have young kids, they grow up to be, like five feet 10 inches. And even if they're still nice to you, they basically don't have a lot of time for you during the weekends,"" he told the crowd. ""They have sleepovers and dates. So all that early investment just leaves them to go away,"" he said.

A White House official declined Yahoo.com's request for comment and clarification on the president's remark, but it's safe to say that First Boyfriend watch is officially in effect.

In an interview with People magazine last month, the Obamas talked about the influence their marriage will have on their daughter's inevitable relationships with boys.

""The great thing about the girls is they've got a wonderful role model in their mom. They've seen how Michelle and I interact — not only the love but also respect that I show to their mom. So I think they have pretty high expectations about how relationships should be, and that gives me some confidence about the future,"" Obama said.

Case in point: The romantic Valentine's date the president said he and Michelle had planned last night.

""She made me promise to get back in time for our date tonight. That's important,"" Obama said during his Georgia stop, ""I've already got a gift, got the flowers,"" he went on to say.

During their father's second term, Sasha, 11, who arrived in the White House as a second-grader, moves on to middle school while Malia begins the many adventures of your average teen.

""Michelle is very good about making sure that we're creating a space for them where they can have sleepovers. They can go to the mall. They can go to the movies. They're going to homecomings at their school,"" Barack noted in an interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest last year.

But don't expect to see much about it in the media. According to White House officials, the unwritten rule guiding news coverage of the girls still stands.

In the meantime, we can only speculate on who Malia Obama's dates will be. Check out this roundup by The Atlantic's Richard Lawson for some thoughts."

This is the time for bold change.”

Hers is one state that is not waiting. It has established a board to create a program for limited-license legal technicians, the first in the country. Within a year, the board is expected to lay out the educational and professional framework for the technicians. They will have more training and responsibility than paralegals but will not appear in court or negotiate on their clients’ behalf.

“The consuming public cannot afford lawyers, and the profession needs to figure that out and own it,” Ms. Littlewood said. “Our hope is to provide more access. The second point is that you have these folks out there doing unauthorized practice, which is harming the public. The hope is to bring them under the tent.”

Elsewhere in the country, law schools are trying to deal with declining popularity in a range of ways. The University of Akron Law School in Ohio has frozen its tuition and virtually ended its out-of-state surcharge. At the University of Oregon, Michael Moffitt, the law school’s dean, has started clinics on nonprofit groups, environmental policy and probate mediation.

(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

When Ronald Reagan signed a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 1986, he confidently predicted: “Future generations of Americans will be thankful for our efforts to humanely regain control of our borders and thereby preserve the value of one of the most sacred possessions of our people — American citizenship.”

More than a quarter-century later, however, that law has not turned out to be the triumph that Reagan envisioned. Instead, those on both sides of the immigration debate see it as a cautionary lesson.

As President Obama and lawmakers from both parties begin to take their first tentative steps toward again rewriting the nation’s immigration laws, opponents warn that they are repeating the mistakes of the 1986 act, which failed to solve the problems that it set out to address. Critics contend that the law actually contributed to making the situation worse.

An estimated 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States when the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) was passed. Now there are upwards of 11 million. And the question of who gets to be an American, far from being settled, has been inflamed.

The latest proposals contain the same three components as the 1986 law: a legalization program — and a possible path to citizenship — for those who are in the country illegally, stepped-up enforcement along the border, and measures to discourage employers from hiring workers who lack proof of legal residency.

“This is the same old formula we’ve dealt with before, including when it passed in 1986, and that is a promise of enforcement and immediate amnesty,” Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) said last week on the Laura Ingraham radio show. “And of course, the promises of enforcement never materialize. The amnesty happens immediately, the millisecond the bill is signed into law.”

But immigration experts note that the country has undergone big changes since then. And the experience of what went wrong after 1986 might help policymakers get it right this time.

“There’s just an entirely different mentality,” said Doris Meissner, who was commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Bill Clinton administration and who now directs immigration policy studies at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

Technology affords new means of enforcing sanctions against hiring illegal immigrants, for instance, and Americans in the post-9/11 world may have lost some of their squeamishness about carrying tamper-proof government identification or submitting personal information to a national database. Meanwhile, businesses are eager to come up with a legal system of immigration that can more quickly adapt to their constantly changing labor needs.

Still, “the problem is always in the details, and that was certainly true in 1986. Once the debate got into the details, the compromises proved to be counterproductive,” said Susan F. Martin, director of Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of International Migration, who in the 1990s served as executive director of the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.

New national circumstances

The most obvious difference between now and a quarter-century ago is demographic. In those days, the Latino vote was not much of a political factor outside a handful of states. Only 3 percent of those who cast ballots in the 1984 presidential election were Hispanic; last year, they made up 10 percent of the electorate. Their growing numbers and increasingly Democratic tilt were considered a crucial factor in Obama’s victory, as well as a serious problem for Republicans in the future.

What also expanded was the national sense of crisis surrounding the issue. At the time the law was passed, Meissner said, illegal immigration had a significant impact in only half a dozen states — New York, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, Illinois and California.

Now, thanks largely to the demand for labor during the economic boom of the 1990s, illegal immigration has become a high-priority issue in virtually every state, including places such as Alabama, Iowa, Georgia and Nebraska.

The most contentious part of the 1986 law was the provision that, for the first time, made it illegal for an employer to knowingly hire a worker who was not in the country legally.

Until then, it had been a felony to harbor an illegal immigrant, but the 1952 “Texas Proviso” stipulated that hiring one did not violate the law. Under the 1986 law, employers who hire undocumented workers are subject to civil penalties of $250 to $10,000 for each of those employees.

What the 1986 act did not provide, however, was any realistic means of enforcing the new requirements for employers, which is why they were and are rarely punished.

In fiscal 2006, for instance, not a single employer was fined, according to statistics compiled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Obama administration has cracked down more vigorously, but the chances of getting caught and punished for hiring an illegal immigrant are still relatively low. In fiscal 2011, ICE issued 385 notifications of intent to fine employers, collecting a total of $10,463,988.

Why so little enforcement, when the practice of hiring illegal immigrants is so widespread? Wouldn’t it be enough to just follow the law that is already on the books?

Those questions come up every time there is talk of immigration reform, most recently seven years ago.

“One answer is that there are never enough federal budget resources,” the law’s authors, former congressman Romano L. Mazzoli (D-Ky.) and former senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), wrote in The Washington Post in 2006.

“Another is that administrations of both stripes are loath to disrupt economic activities — i.e., labor supply in factories, farms and businesses,” they added. “And we know that disruptions in the labor supply are the natural, unavoidable and even desirable consequence of strong border and workplace enforcement.”

One of the law’s most glaring deficiencies was that it did not stipulate or provide a secure means by which businesses could verify the legal status of those they hired. Instead, it listed dozens of documents that could be used — most of them easily falsified.

“You had a wink-and-a-nod system, where the employer was in compliance and the [illegal immigrant] could find a job,” Meissner said.

“The only real beneficiaries of some of the IRCA reforms was the counterfeiting industry,” Martin added.

Simpson and Mazzoli had advocated a new “identifier,” using biometrics or tamper-proof cards. But something so close to a national ID card drew opposition from civil libertarians on the left and the right, as well as concerns about the practicality of issuing new identification to 250 million Americans.

That issue, however, is certain to be revisited.

The set of principles drawn up by a bipartisan group of senators, which is expected to serve as a starting point for comprehensive immigration overhaul, promises: “Our proposal will create an effective employment verification system which prevents identity theft and ends the hiring of future unauthorized workers.”

That would include coming up with what the senators described as “non-forgeable electronic means” to determine an employee’s legal status before he or she is hired.

Questions about legal entry

Another area where past reform efforts — including the 1986 law — have fallen short is on the question of legal immigration.

Unlike many politicians of both parties today, Reagan was unafraid to use the most loaded word in the immigration debate.

“I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though some time back, they may have entered illegally,” Reagan said during a 1984 presidential debate.

The law offered legalization to those who had been in the country for at least five years but excluded those who had resided here more briefly — leaving what Meissner called “a nucleus of today’s illegal population.”

If a new legalization measure is passed, experts say, it is likely to give amnesty to those who entered the country illegally much closer to the moment that a bill is enacted.

More important, the 1986 law did nothing to address the future flow of immigrants, which increased dramatically during the next decade’s economic boom.

A 1990 law did increase the limits on legal immigration. But those quotas did not keep pace with the drastic changes in the labor market or the desire of many immigrants to reunite with family members they had left behind.

Revamping the legal immigration system is an area that has had little debate. The key, experts said, will be coming up with a system that can accurately gauge the demands of the labor market, sorting out actual labor shortages from cases in which businesses are simply unwilling to pay enough to attract legal residents.

“We have no mechanisms to make rapid changes in the legal immigration system, to meet family demands and to meet employer demands,” Martin said. “If it continues to fail, people will find a way around it.”"

Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the so-called Gang of Eight’s immigration reform bill does not have enough votes at this point to pass the Senate.

Even though the bill has exited the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 13-5 vote, Menendez says that it will not receive 60 votes thanks to Republican opposition. “We don’t currently have 60 votes identified in the Senate,” Menendez told Univision. “We need to add more votes on the floor. That means that the community in your state, in every state, should be contacting your state’s two US Senators saying that they want comprehensive immigration reform, that they are going to judge their political future based on this vote.”

Several Republican senators have expressed support for debating the bill, but do not support the bill itself yet, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Menendez does believe that by the time of the Senate vote, which he said will take place just after July 4, the votes will be there. “I believe that in those three weeks we can get the necessary votes and we will have the community. We are expecting that and working for that.”

The goal, said Menendez, would be to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a version of the bill by creating widespread Senate support. “We want to push this bill forward with the most positive votes we can find, more than sixty, the sixty we need to be able to pass it here in the Senate, so we can put pressure on the House,” he explained. “Speaker Boehner, will have to decide how he will proceed.”

Menendez’s statements on Univision are no coincidence – the Democrats’ plan for 2014 is largely built on the notion that by creating bipartisan support for immigration reform in the Senate, then forcing the House to stop a soft-on-border-security bill, they will be able to generate public support for taking the House back for President Obama.

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The U.S. Senate, once considered the most exclusive and chummiest club in America, has in recent years been transformed into an ideological war zone, where comity and compromise have lost their allure, while confrontation and showmanship now pay big dividends.

“The only way you get something is to become obnoxious,” Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) declared during the recent immigration debate, explaining her threat to block the entire process. “We have turned from a Senate to a theater, and I’m tired of being part of a theater. If I wanted to be part of a theater, I would have gone to New York.”

The theatrics reached a new crescendo Thursday when Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) confronted each other over Reid’s effort to change the filibuster rules in ways that would strip the GOP’s ability to block confirmation of executive branch nominees and that could ultimately weaken the minority party’s ability to slow the majority agenda.

Reid’s move provoked some of the most personal attacks two Senate leaders have leveled against another in decades; Reid described McConnell as untrustworthy, while McConnell countered that the Nevada Democrat would go down in history as the worst Senate leader ever.

Suddenly, the world’s greatest deliberative body just isn’t that much fun anymore.

“I miss it like an abscessed tooth,” former senator Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), a 24-year veteran, said on a recent visit to the Capitol.

The dysfunction fever is so strong that Reid and McConnell relented to a rank-and-file request to set up a rare meeting for senators of both parties Monday night in the Old Senate Chamber.

Those working at the last-gasp filibuster compromise fear that if they fail, the Senate will put itself on a permanent downward spiral later this week.

“There’s no doubt that it’s harder and it’s more partisan,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has spent the past few days talking with senators and White House allies hoping to hatch a compromise on Senate rules. McCain has succeeded twice before at reaching a compromise to avoid partisan rule changes, first in 2005 and again this year.

“Each time we come closer and closer to having this happen,” McCain said Friday.

Interviews with more than a dozen current and recently retired senators paint a mostly dismal picture of life in the Senate. There is a growing sense of despair among the rank-and-file senators, who privately grouse that the two leaders, despite many similarities in style and background, have become so distrustful of one another they barely speak to each other, except for small talk about their shared love of the Washington Nationals.

One GOP senator last week pleaded with McConnell to reach out to Reid to establish some regular channel of communication, maybe a biweekly breakfast, to try to solve their problems. McConnell declined, saying he simply could not trust Reid, according to the Senate Republican, who asked for anonymity to speak about the relationship.

Reid and McConnell are “institutionalists” who shared the same career goal — to be Senate majority leader. Reid has been since 2007, McConnell will probably need six additional Republican seats in the 2014 midterms to reach his lifelong prize. By those elections, they will have served as party leaders longer than any duo since Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, instead of growing closer, Reid and McConnell have grown more distant and distrustful of each other, according to senators on both sides of the aisle.

But in some way the Reid-McConnell clash is a symptom of other changes in the Senate.

The giants of the Senate

In the past five years, through death and retirement, the Senate has lost a clutch of legends, powerful voices whose decades of service gave them enough influence to rival that of the leaders.

John W. Warner (R-Va.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). These were Senate barons who could roll their own leadership when it was required to make a deal. Warner retired in 2008. Stevens and Kennedy died in 2009.

A treasured requirement for freshman orientation used to be a rules lecture inside the chamber from Byrd, the longest-serving senator ever, who wrote a book on parliamentary rules. But no senator has taken up that role since Byrd grew ill and died in 2010.

There has been a shift away from “senators who carried with them the sense of the history and the traditions of the Senate,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who arrived in 2003. “There was that class of senior senators that were accorded a great deal of respect and authority.”

They have been replaced by a historically large group of newcomers who are generally more partisan and have pushed leaders, their party and the Senate to a more combative footing.

In March, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a 20-year veteran, bristled at freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) for what she described as his condescending tone during a debate about gun control, lecturing Cruz that she was not a sixth-grader. A week earlier, McCain, responding to a filibuster led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) against the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director, called Paul and his younger libertarian-leaning Senate allies a bunch of “wacko birds.”

If there is any hope that better is possible, it comes from Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.). Six months into his first term, Kaine has been pleasantly surprised. In the past two months the Senate has approved, by large bipartisan margins, legislation to shore up the nation’s waterways, an overhaul of farm policy and a comprehensive immigration bill.

Each of those were approved after lengthy, freewheeling debate on amendments in line with Senate traditions. At this stage of 2011, the Senate had held only 106 roll-call votes; this year, 171. Yet some basics, such as the budget resolution, have ground to a procedural halt.

“The notion that we can’t work together on anything, I’m not finding that to be true,” Kaine said. “But I’m also finding things that ought to be simple are hard. It’s like parallel universes. I’m trying to understand how an institution can be both.”

During his 24 years in the Senate, Bond remembers strong cross-party alliances that ended up with bills that got huge bipartisan majorities when they came to the floor.

“Those were the good ol’ days,” Bond said.

No punching, at least

Nostalgia for the more genteel Senate is a favorite pastime of senators and other close observers of the body.

“I’m exhausted from hearing about the good ol’ days,” said Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a 30-year senator who retired, like Bond, at the end of 2010.

Dodd mocked the idea that the chamber is “too partisan,” noting that the Senate’s heyday in the 19th century — when legends such as Henry Clay, John Calhoun and Daniel Webster served — included fistfights and the occasional gun duel.

Dodd said today’s newcomers will rise to the occasion if they get the time and chance to legislate in the Senate. There are 55 senators who have taken office since January 2007, never having experienced a GOP majority. It’s the third large wave of new senators in the past 100 years, the first coming after World War II and the second coming on the heels of the Watergate scandal and the Reagan landslide of 1980.

In his first term, in the early 1980s, Dodd spent several days a week angling for a seat in the crowded, private, senators-only dining room on the Capitol’s first floor, soaking up the wisdom of the likes of Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), John Stennis (D-Miss.) and Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.). Those three alone served more than 100 combined years and chaired several of the most powerful committees.

“It was my PhD in my first seven, eight years,” said Dodd, who made a habit of showing that dining room to new senators in his last days before retiring. “It was as good an education as could be had in the Senate.”

Nowadays, that room is dormant. Each party schedules mandatory lunches for its own caucus almost every day the Senate is in session.

“I don’t know if the dining room is still open,” Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a 27-year veteran, recently confided.

There was one occasion recently that recalled the old days. In April, to mark the 40th anniversary of McCain’s release from his long captivity as a prisoner of during Vietnam, Reid hosted a luncheon for McCain.

“Nobody can recall the last time there was one,” McCain said of such a bipartisan gathering, “and everybody walked out of that room with goodwill, good feelings.”

There are those who hold on to the possibility that things can improve.

As he considered whether to make a Senate bid, Kaine approached Warner, the venerable Republican first elected in 1978 who served 30 years. From the opposite party, Warner could offer only advice, not an endorsement. He said that the Senate used to be such a wonderful place to be that anyone with even a “2 percent chance to win” should take the chance.

“I can’t tell you that so unequivocally now, because so many things have changed and it’s so much more difficult,” he said, according to Kaine’s recounting.

But Warner urged Kaine to run because he believed that the problems were fixable.

“It’s not in the water supply,” Warner said. “It’s not sick-building syndrome. It’s just the character and inclination of the people who walk in the building every day.”

“So it could be different tomorrow,” he added."

Thursday’s stunning rules change by Senate Democrats can best be described as Obamacare II: another exercise of partisan political power to permit the majority to do whatever it wants. This time, the goal was advancing its agenda unchecked through the courts and executive agencies.

With all Republican members opposed, the Senate voted 52 to 48 to invoke the “nuclear option,” allowing a majority of senators present and voting (so, not necessarily 51) to approve presidential nominees except for Supreme Court justices. For those positions, this eliminated the filibuster, which required 60 votes to proceed to an up-or-down majority vote.

This was the most dangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them. It creates a perpetual opportunity for “tyranny of the majority,” which Alexis de Tocqueville called one of the greatest threats to American democracy.

As Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) noted, quoting former senator Arthur Vandenberg on Thursday: “If a majority of the Senate can change its rules at any time, there are no rules.” It is as if the Red Sox, finding themselves behind in the ninth, added a few innings to make sure they could defeat the Cardinals in the World Series. Future majorities could, for example, end the filibuster for legislation, removing any obstacle to tyranny of the majority.

Democrats offered flimsy excuses, many of which are untrue:

Excuse No. 1: President Obama’s appointees have been unfairly denied seats by failed cloture votes, or filibusters.

According to the Congressional Research Service, no Supreme Court nominee has been defeated by filibuster in the Senate. None. (An arguable exception is Abe Fortas’s doomed nomination as chief justice, about which President Lyndon Johnson engineered a face-saving cloture vote.)

The number of federal district judge and Cabinet nominees defeated by filibuster? Zero. Regarding sub-Cabinet nominees, there were two for President Obama, three for George W. Bush and two for Bill Clinton. That’s it.

As for appeals court judges, Republican filibusters have blocked five, but that happened only after Democrats first blocked five. Beginning in 2003, Democrats blocked 10 Bush nominees. This was the first time that a president’s circuit court nominees were blocked by the failure to obtain cloture. Republicans considered the nuclear option, decided against it, and five of the 10 were confirmed.

Excuse No. 2: President Obama’s nominees have waited too long for confirmation.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Obama’s second-term Cabinet nominees have been confirmed at about the same pace as those of Presidents Clinton and Bush.

This year, the Senate has confirmed 36 of Obama’s second-term nominees to circuit and district courts, compared with 14 for Bush at this point in 2005.

On Friday, the Senate’s executive calendar listed 54 nominees who have been waiting less than three weeks for confirmation, 16 who had waited for up to nine weeks and only eight who have been waiting more than nine weeks. Two of those eight nominees were being “held” by Democratic senators.

Excuse No. 3: Republican obstruction left the Democratic majority leader unable to act.

Only Democratic committee majorities can place nominees on the executive calendar. Only the majority leader can move their confirmation. He may do so anytime he chooses.

What if obstructionist Republicans were to place holds on 10 sub-Cabinet nominees? Under the rules that existed before Thursday, the majority leader could have filed a cloture motion on those nominees on Monday and confirmed them by Friday — unless 41 Republicans voted against cloture. Again, that has happened to only two Obama nominees for non-judicial sub-Cabinet positions and only seven times in Senate history.

In his last Senate speech, former majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) warned against destroying the filibuster, which he called the “necessary fence” against the executive and popular passions. Majority leaders could do whatever they needed to do under the rules, Byrd said.

Excuse No. 4: Republicans have unfairly blocked the president from filling vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

In 2006, Democrats insisted on doing precisely what Republicans are asking in 2013: moving judges from courts where they are not needed to where they are needed most. They did not think this unfair then.

In 2006, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Patrick Leahy, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, said that “under no circumstances” should new judges be confirmed to the D.C. court because its workload was half the national average and there were judicial emergencies elsewhere.

With Bush’s approval, the Senate reduced the number of seats on the D.C. Circuit by one, moving that slot to the 9th Circuit. The D.C. Circuit hears fewer cases today than it did in 2007.

So why would Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) engineer a rules change that he said in 2006 “would be the end of the Senate”? Because the vote was not about the filibuster. It was about permitting the majority to do whatever it wants.

Call it Obamacare II, for which the only cure is a referendum next November."

Pollak'],"White House 'Prison': The Obamas Love the Perks, Hate the Office","First Lady Michelle Obama has raised eyebrows by likening life in the White House to life in a “really nice prison.” Ms. Obama was speaking at the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania, where she is traveling with President Barack Obama and their daughters. Former First Lady Laura Bush was also in attendance.

It was not the first time that Ms. Obama has complained about life in the White House–which has afforded her the opportunity to travel with her husband on a $60-$100 million trip to Africa, as well as to vacation in Spain and other exotic locales with a large entourage, all the while enjoying Secret Service protection.

President Obama himself has expressed similar sentiments. A mere two weeks after taking office in 2009, he and Ms. Obama escaped to a school in Washington, D.C., explaining: “We were just tired of being in the White House.” The president also plays golf with great frequency, and takes many vacations–alone and with family.

Ms. Obama’s remarks were particularly striking, coming just days after she and her children joined President Obama on a tour of the Robben Island prison facility where Nelson Mandela had been held for two decades. Following the visit, President Obama said that he and his family were “deeply humbled” by their experience.

In his 2012 book The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House, author Ed Klein said of Obama: “”We come to know a strange kind of politician, one who derives no joy from the cut and thrust of politics, but who clings to the narcissistic life of the presidency.”

It is responsibility, not just politics, that Obama avoids.

Obama’s Africa tour sums up his absentee presidency perfectly. He tries to emulate world figures like Nelson Mandela; he is driven in a motorcade down Barack Obama Drive in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; he gives speeches declaring that he will not meddle in African affairs, as if Libya–and the past four years–never happened.

And yet, even as he takes his family on tours of historic sites and extols the virtues of the African Union, a member of that Union–Egypt–is being rocked by the largest political demonstrations in the history of the world, Obama has had little to say.

The Obamas certainly love the perks of the presidency. But they hate the office."

The story of those eight years would seem far too vast to contain inside a single volume. Yet here that volume is. Peter Baker (who covered the Bush White House first for The Washington Post, then for The New York Times) neither accuses nor excuses. He writes with a measure and balance that seem transported backward in time from some more dispassionate future. Yet “Days of Fire” is not a dispassionate book. Its mood might rather be described as poignant: sympathetic to its subjects, generous to their accomplishments and extenuating none of their errors.

“Bush was not one given to reflection, at least not out loud. Yet one day,” in the summer of 2008, “he seemed in a rare introspective mood. Sitting in the Situation Room while waiting for another meeting to begin, the president looked at Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, who had succeeded Peter Pace as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and harked back to the critical days in 2003 before he launched the war that had become so problematic. ‘You know,’ he recalled, ‘when I made the decision on Iraq, I went around the room to everybody at that table, every principal. “You in? Any doubts?” Nothing from anybody.’ For Bush, it was a rare moment of doubt. Was he ruing his own flawed judgment? Bitter that he had been led off track by advisers? Or both?”

That story is sourced to an interview with a “senior official” — your guess whether it was Mullen, Gates or somebody else. Baker’s book is informed by remarkable access to its main characters, including Vice President Dick Cheney. (I’ll note here that I am one of those interviewed for and quoted in Baker’s book.) Yet “Days of Fire” is something more than the reporter’s “first rough draft of history.” Almost every leading figure in the Bush White House, including Bush and Cheney, has now published his or her version of events, and Baker has painstakingly worked through them all. The result is what you might call a polished second draft of history, most likely the most polished draft we’ll have until the archives are opened and the academics can get to work."

USA TODAY

Michelle Obama won't abide demonstrations during her speeches.

""One of the things that I don't do well is this,"" the first lady said as a protester began yelling during her speech Tuesday night at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser.

Leaving the lectern, Obama moved toward the shouter and told the crowd they could ""listen to me or you can take the (microphone), but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.""

The crowd made clear they wanted the first lady to stay and for the protester to go, which is what happened.

The gay and lesbian rights organization Get EQUAL identified the protester as one of its members, Ellen Sturtz. She was calling for an executive order to bar discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Obama went on with her speech.

""So let me make the point that I was making before,"" she said. ""We are here for our kids. So we must recapture that passion. That same urgency and energy that we felt back in 2008, 2012. Understand this — this is what I want you all to understand. This is not about us. No one back here. It's not about you or you or your issue or your thing. This is about our children.""

A group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans issued a statement saying, ""LGBT people in North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio and all over the country are dehumanized in our jobs, and we are forced into the closet in order to participate in the American dream.""

The statement said, ""We value the first lady's leadership and invite her to lead the charge within the Democratic Party to end employment discrimination. President Obama has an executive order sitting on his desk that can protect a quarter of the labor force in the U.S. from workplace discrimination. We will continue engaging leaders in the administration and the Democratic Party until President Obama fulfills a promise to our community made five years ago.""

Washington (CNN) - Saying ""we will respond to the threat of climate change,"" President Barack Obama used his second inaugural address to put the divisive issue back on the front burner. But according to a new national survey, Americans are divided over whether global warming is a man made phenomenon.

The president also used his speech to highlight the controversial issue of illegal immigration, and a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday also indicates that a bare majority of the public says the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than deporting them.

The president warned in his Monday address that failure to respond to climate change ""would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.""

According to the poll, which was conducted last week, 49% agree with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars, power plants and factories. That's twice as high as the number who say that global warming has not been proven, as well as the 24% who say that it is a proven fact but is not due to manmade sources. But the 49% figure is down seven points from 2007.

There's an expected partisan divide on the question, with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man made. That number drops to 48% among independent voters and is at 28% among Republicans.

The president tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress. The president also came up empty during his first four years in the White House in trying to pass comprehensive illegal immigration reform though Congress.

But Obama has put the issue on his to-do list this year, and in his inaugural address he said ""our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.""

By a 53%-43% margin, people questioned in the poll say that main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than deporting them.

That's a switch from 2011, when by a 55%-42% margin, Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S policy on illegal immigration.

As expected, the poll indicates a partisan divide on the issue, as well as a generational divide, with younger people saying allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal should be the top priority, and a slight plurality of those 50 and older saying the emphasis should be on deportation and border security.

One of the president's biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing a sweeping health care bill through Congress in 2010. In his inauguration address, Obama acknowledged that there is still much work ahead on this issue, saying ""we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care.""

According to the poll, 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the official name of what many people refer to as ""Obamacare,"" with 44% opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law.

""That's a switch from 2011, when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Minutes after his inauguration speech, the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts, including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. The Nebraska Republican's nomination has been met with reservations, and even outright opposition, by some senators of both parties, who point to past positions he has taken on Israel, Iran and the war in Iraq.

According to the poll, 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel.

""That's twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation, but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue, the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50% rather than just under that mark,"" adds Holland.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15, with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/political-intelligence/,2013-02-06 00:00:00,"['David Brooks', 'Gail Collins', 'Errol Morris', 'The Conversation', 'The End', 'The Great Divide', 'All Contributors', 'Series']",Political Intelligence,"In The Conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday.

David Brooks: Gail, let me start out with a troubling issue before I get to a bunch of encouraging ones. How would you vote on the Chuck Hagel nomination for secretary of defense? I would probably still vote yes, but only because I think a president should be given enormous deference to fill out his team.

Gail Collins: If I was a Republican senator, I would vote no just because voting no always works. You can never get into trouble for voting no.

David: I have doubts, after that hearing, about whether Hagel can now be an effective secretary of defense. I don’t think the White House is going to want to send him out on the Sunday shows or to various global forums to represent U.S. policy. I’m not sure Senators of either party will defer to him or fear him when it comes to making choices about where to spend or where not to spend. I’m not sure the military will treat him with genuine fear and respect, beyond what is required by their code.

Gail: David, if our bottom line is that in this age, a secretary of defense has to be good at spin, then you’re right that the Hagelian future does not look bright. He’s lucky that some of the Republican senators were so unnecessarily nasty in that committee hearing. If they had managed to look wise and concerned instead of partisan and hectoring, he’d probably have been cooked.

David: I say that glumly, genuinely liking Hagel. But leadership involves a certain performance element and it involves a certain demonstrated ability to master a brief. Hagel didn’t pass those tests. If I were him I’d call up the president and ask if he was still confident he’d made the right nomination. If Hagel doesn’t have Obama’s full confidence, then he won’t be successful, and then what’s the point of taking the job?

Gail: Cannot argue with that last point. But you know that when presidents really want somebody to go away, they have ways of making that happen.

Obama picked Hagel because he wanted a secretary of defense who thinks the way he does about what military preparedness will mean in the future: drone-prone with a real aversion to putting boots on the ground. Hagel seems to have been successful in his one-on-one encounters with the senators. If he can work successfully on the inside, there are plenty of glib people around who can do the rounds of the talk shows. We’ll just call him the quiet secretary.

David: That issue aside, a lot of positive things are happening in Washington. I’m moderately encouraged about the prospects of us getting an immigration bill this year. The Republican leaders seem to be drifting toward a sensible position, at least judging by Eric Cantor’s speech this week. The president is doing a good job raising the profile of the issue without trying to dictate terms. Various effective legislators, like Schumer, Rubio and McCain, are involved. It’s all coming together.

Gail: Yeah. So far.

David: There are two main dangers, it seems to me. The first is the supposedly moderate position that Republicans are now striking. This involves giving current illegal immigrants a legal status in this country without giving them a path to full citizenship. This idea sounds like something Peter Skerry proposed in National Affairs. Personally, I would be very wary about creating a class of lifelong American citizens who are not citizens and have no way to become citizens. We do not want to regularize a class of legal helots.

Gail: I’ll bet most of the Republicans would agree with you in a heartbeat, if they could just find some way out of that anti-amnesty wall they’ve built. They’re trapped because the approach they’ve railed against for their last several campaigns is actually the right approach. They just can’t admit it.

The Democrats will never agree to limit reform to a path to legal non-citizenship. And if the Republicans kill the bill over it, they’ll be stuck with the consequences in future elections.

David: The other main danger is that the whole debate will be sidetracked by some second-order issue. The main reason to do immigration is to improve the country’s ability to lure the best global talent — both high- and low-skill. A lot of people in Washington don’t see it that way. They are worrying about how many links should be in the Mexican fence, what border security measure will trigger what, how various gay partnership issues will be resolved.

This is a complete inability to distinguish side issues from the main one.

Gail: Border security is a red herring. If Obama was a Republican, the party would be cheering over the way he’d expanded the patrols, and drones, as well as the ratcheted-up deportation of lawbreakers over the last four years.

As to side issues like gay partnership, I guess it depends on who you are. The Violence Against Women Act is hung up on the question of who should prosecute men accused of domestic violence on Indian reservations. It might sound like a minor matter – unless you happen to be an American Indian woman living on a reservation.

David: I’m also moderately encouraged about the Republican Party. Republican donors are rallying to prevent future Todd Akins. Every day another party leader gives a speech trying to sound sensible. The Tea Party isn’t dead the way Occupy is, but it’s not self-confident either. I wrote one of my usual pieces on the need for a more moderate party that can win on the coasts and of course there was criticism, but there was also a much more respectful hearing on conservative talk radio than I’m used to getting.

Change is slow, and it will not be led by our elected leaders in Washington. But there are good signs.

Gail: I could be negative and point to the new emerging craziness that is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Or the Iowa boomlet for the ultra-loopy Representative Steve King for Senate. But I’d rather follow your positive wave and praise you for being one of the most helpful and influential voices for moderation.

David: Finally, President Obama is visiting the Middle East. This will be his chance to see firsthand the current state of Israeli politics, which is hopeless prosperity. Every Israeli knows that all the political trends are pointing in a bad direction and there is no visible way to escape them. Peace is further away, the demographics stink. Public opinion is polarizing. And yet the economy booms and life gets sweeter. How long can a society live in hopeless prosperity? I’m guessing a century or so.

Gail: I was very, very modestly encouraged by the good showing of the new centrist Yesh Atid party in the recent elections. Their success suggests that there might be a future majority of Israelis who don’t feel they’re getting their share of that sweet life and who are tired of wasting tax money subsidizing the religious right and the West Bank settlement expansion.

I know that’s a stretch, but it’s at least a thought. And we’ve gotten through a whole conversation without hitting a single stone wall of implacable political stupidity. Do you think it’ll last? It’d be great for the country, but then we’ll have nothing to write about."

Blow'],Blind to the Past — and Future - The New York Times,"But that distinction — humanitarianism over opportunism — is as lost on as many of Bush’s fellow Republicans today as when he was in office. They don’t even accept the logic of long-term electoral viability over extinction.

The most outlandish example of conservative rhetoric in its truly offensive glory on this subject came in an interview last week with Phyllis Schlafly, a prominent conservative activist, on the news site PolicyMic. In it she said:

“I don’t see any evidence that Hispanics resonate with Republican values. They have no experience or knowledge of the whole idea of limited government and keeping government out of our private lives. They come from a country where the government has to decide everything. I don’t know where you get the idea that the Mexicans coming in resonate with Republican values. They’re running an illegitimacy rate that is extremely high. I think it’s the highest of any ethnic group. We welcome people who want to be Americans. And then you hear many of them talk about wanting Mexico to reclaim several of our Southwestern states, because they think Mexico should really own some of those states. Well, that’s unacceptable. We don’t want people like that.”

There are so many stereotypes and fallacies in that statement that it’s not even worth unpacking, but it is a great illustration of some deep-rooted conservative views.

The one thing I will take the time to contest is the notion that even if Republicans changed their rhetoric and tactics, they wouldn’t gain traction with Hispanics (not all of whom are Mexican, by the way, Ms. Schlafly)."

It began with a bankruptcy sale in 1933, when a Republican businessman and presidential confidant reinvented himself as a newspaper publisher in the nation’s capital. It ended with an announcement that his descendants had sold the newspaper to an Internet wizard who lives in the Washington on the other side of the country.

In between, The Washington Post and the family collectively known as the Grahams became inseparable, indistinguishable. They were journalism royalty known around the world but remained as distinctly Washington as the cop on the beat. Which one of them was.

From Eugene Meyer to Philip L. Graham to Katharine Graham to Donald E. Graham to Katharine Weymouth, it was always a question of when power would shift from one generation to the next, not whether it would.

Until Monday. The Graham family — an icon of both Washington and journalism for the newspaper it led — had made a startling decision. The Post, they said, would be better off with somebody else.

“We have loved the paper, what it stood for, and those who produced it,” said a letter from Donald Graham, the Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive. “But the point of our ownership has always been that it was supposed to be good for the Post.”

Timeline The major events that have shaped the Washington Post Co.

He added: “We were certain the paper would survive under our ownership, but we wanted it to do more than that. We wanted it to succeed.”

It was the same 80 years earlier, when Meyer, a wealthy native Californian, sent a representative to the steps of The Post’s former headquarters on E Street. His winning bid for the bankrupt newspaper was $825,000, and he was not disclosed as the new owner for 12 days.

He drafted the announcement of the sale and stated his intentions: “It will be conducted as an independent paper devoted to the best interests of the people of Washington and vicinity, and hopes to have their interest and support.”

By the time Meyer was 40, in 1915, his fortune was said to be in the $50 million to $60 million range. When he bought The Post, he was 57 and most recently had been chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

He stressed the “independent” part to dispel rumors that the paper would become a mouthpiece for the Republican Party. He said seven principles would guide The Post, the last of which was: “The newspaper shall not be the ally of any special interest, but shall be fair and free and wholesome in its outlook on public affairs and public men.”

Meyer poured his fortune into The Post and was an enthusiastic cheerleader. He was said to have tried to sell a subscription to the driver before he exited a cab.

But the real change for The Post came 21 years after the purchase, when Meyer and his son-in-law Philip L. Graham bought out its morning rival, the Washington Times-Herald. “For the Post, it meant a doubling of circulation, a morning monopoly and within five years the overtaking of the traditional advertising leader in Washington, The Star,” Post reporter Chalmers Roberts wrote in a history of the paper.

Graham was brilliant and charismatic, a former Supreme Court clerk with big ambitions and serious problems. He became publisher at 31, and Meyer arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his own daughter Katharine because, he explained to her, “no man should be in the position of working for his wife.” Mrs. Graham did not object.

“I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,” Katharine Graham wrote in her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, “Personal History.”

Philip Graham struggled with mental illness and committed suicide in 1963; his 47-year-old widow was faced with the decision of whether to sell the paper or run it herself.

It was the beginning of a long career for Katharine Graham that coincided with — and came to symbolize — two powerful trends. The first was the role of women as leaders in American life. The second was the rise of Washington’s permanent elite, an orbit of the unelected that grew along with the federal city and exercised soft power on those who had hard power.

Graham became both the leading woman in American business and a center of connection and influence in Washington society. When Graham later penned her bestselling memoir, writer Nora Ephron wrote in a review: “The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.”

Graham’s legacy at The Post was defined by her choice of editor, Benjamin C. Bradlee, and by a series of journalistic crises. In 1971, a judge had ordered the New York Times to stop publishing reports about the Pentagon Papers, a secret official history of the Vietnam War. The Post obtained its own copy. “Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, ‘Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let’s go. Let’s publish,’ ” Graham recalled saying.

She was best known for her support of Bradlee and two reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, during their reporting on the Watergate break-in. That story, which had been scoffed at by big-name reporters at The Post and elsewhere, led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon and became the most famous in the history of American journalism.

“It was a small group of people on the Metro staff against the world. Except we had the backing of Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham,” said Leonard Downie Jr., who was an editor on the metropolitan staff during Watergate and served as executive editor from 1991 to 2008.

Katharine Graham later faced down a strike from the paper’s pressmen’s union in 1975, a tense period in which presses were vandalized and daily copy was ferried out by helicopter to other printing facilities.

In 1979, 33-year-old Donald E. Graham became the next generation to run The Post. “Today, as in the rest of my life, my mother has given me everything but an easy act to follow,” he said.

Donald Graham joked often about how he got his job, but he worked hard to expand what had been a life of privilege. He served in Vietnam and learned all aspects of The Post: He worked as a reporter and editor, advertising salesman, production supervisor, and in many other roles on the business and editorial staffs of The Post.

But before that, he became a police officer because, as his mother said, he wanted “to become acquainted with the city, its people, and its problems.”

As regal as Katharine Graham could be, Donald Graham was a down-to-Earth publisher with better sources in the city and the region than most of his paper’s reporters. He prided himself on knowing the names of everyone who worked in the building.

“I hated getting into an elevator with Don, because I have a terrible memory for names,” Downie said. “He knew all the people from the ninth floor to the sub-basement.”

It is impossible to overstate how close the paper’s employees felt to the owners. When reporters picked up the check for lunch or dinner with sources, the standard line was: “The Grahams are paying.”

The fifth member of the family to run the paper is Katharine Weymouth, Donald Graham’s niece and a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Stanford. Weymouth was announced as publisher on Feb. 7, 2008.

“Our rate of success with publishers named Katharine has been outstanding,” Donald Graham said in making the announcement.

Weymouth grew up in New York City, the daughter of Katharine Graham’s daughter Lally Weymouth. The stories she recalls hearing about the Graham family involved its influence in Washington: Phil Graham helping put Lyndon B. Johnson on the Democratic ticket in 1960; Ronald Reagan turning up at her grandmother’s birthday parties.

Weymouth inherited a very different business from what Donald and Katharine Graham had been given. Morning newspapers everywhere had long functioned as near-monopolies, making enough money to insulate owners and journalists from the grim details of profit and loss.

But the Internet had derailed that model, in Washington and everywhere else.

“The increase in digital income is not nearly as great as the loss in advertising income. And that’s the problem,” Downie said. He recalled hearing worries about the trend long before Weymouth took the publisher’s job. “She did not preside over this change. The change began well before her.”

At the same annual meeting where Weymouth’s promotion was announced, the company also revealed a new round of buyouts for newsroom employees. And it said it would close one of its two printing plants.

During Weymouth’s tenure as publisher, the problems at The Post — and other papers — have worsened. Post circulation fell from 638,000 on weekdays to about 450,000 for the first six months of 2013. The newspaper’s revenue dropped as well. The company’s newspaper division took in $801 million in Weymouth’s first year as publisher and $582 million in 2012 — a decline of more than 25 percent.

Weymouth’s early tenure was also marred by a scandal over proposed “salons,” where The Post would connect high-paying business interests to government officials. In 2012, she replaced the first editor she had hired to run the newsroom, Marcus Brauchli, with Boston Globe editor Martin Baron.

Weymouth said she and Donald Graham together decided that The Post needed a new owner who was more like her great-grandfather: wealthy enough to buy the paper and make it again a private company.

“What I said to Don [was] if the journalism is the mission — and it is — then you can make an argument that The Post [Company] is no longer the best place to house The Post,” Weymouth said Monday.

Did she consider whether Katharine Graham, her grandmother, would have approved?

“It didn’t play a role. She’s not here,” Weymouth said. “Times have changed, and we need to do what we think is best for The Post.”

Weymouth will stay on as publisher, and she described herself as “actually pretty excited.” But for the first time in 80 years, the paper will be out of her family’s ultimate control.

“The Graham family legacy is not as important as The Washington Post’s legacy,” Weymouth said."

That he won a rousing reelection is more than icing on the cake, it is affirmation that Obama has changed our Nation in a profound way for all time.

But, it is quite clear that President Obama is looking for more than this regarding his legacy. Does he still have dreams of ""transforming"" politics—what I have derisively referred to as the Post Partisan Unity Schtick? It seems not.

Then what can he be hoping to achieve in terms of legacy?

Well, as the philosopher Yogi Berra has taught us, it's hard to make predictions, especially about the future. But the intrepid amongst us do so without fear. (And if you are a Washington pundit, with no reason to fear. Being wrong about everything is a feature, not a bug for the DC pundit.)

Obama's Legacy

History and legacy are strange things. They are more malleable than conventional wisdom would have. One of the subjects that has been of interest of mine has been the Lost Cause, especially its relationship to the reputation of Robert E. Lee, both as a general and as a human being. While this subject should be the topic of a series of posts, I merely note for this post that Robert E. Lee's legacy was the vehicle of a political movement, as well as a question of pride. But to prove the malleability of history, Lee's reputation as a general has suffered greatly when separated from the political motivations that spurred the creation of the Marble Man.

President Obama's legacy will, in the short term, be a political football. If the economy is in good shape come 2016, Democrats will be rushing to burnish it as much as possible. But over the longer term, burnishing President Obama will become secondary to burnishing whatever part of the policy legacy President Obama is able to create is conducive to successful Democratic politics.

FDR is still an icon to Democrats 80 years after the commencement of his presidency because his policy legacy, especially Social Security, is the centerpiece of what the Democratic Party is thought to be about. In addition, FDR's realignment of national politics stood for a very long time. President Obama's legacy will be viewed from this twin perspective.

The Bully Pulpit

President Obama once controversially said:



I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what is different is the times. I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. They felt like with all the excesses of the 60s and the 70s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.""

I understood his point, though I think it was inartfully delivered. Ronald Reagan changed the political conversation in the country. And the point goes to the power of the bully pulpit, properly understood. Too many have misunderstood the argument of the bully pulpit as being the power to force congresspersons from the opposing party (or even from the president's party) to bend to the president's will.

That is a faulty assumption. The power of the bully pulpit is to drive the national political conversation. Of course, some presidents are not good at this part of the job and have only fleeting influence. Some are constrained by their times (Obama made this point as well.)

But sometimes presidents change the political conversation in a lasting and meaningful way. Reagan did that. (Bill Clinton did not and could not because of the times in which he governed. Clinton's achievements did not include changing the national political conversation in a lasting and meaningful way.) What Reagan did was make Calhounism the dominant ideology of the Republican Party.

Can President Obama change the national political conversation? Is he trying to? I think he is. So does Ross Douthat, in reaction to President Obama's Second Inaugural Address:



This does seem like a sense in which, come what may in 2016 and beyond, Obama is already more like Reagan than he is like any other recent president of either party. His substantive achievements are still open to question, but he really has succeeded in pushing a philosophical reorientation of American domestic politics—tentatively in 2008, explicitly in 2012, and triumphantly in Monday’s address—that neither Bill Clinton nor George W. Bush ever really attempted.

If the President does have a lasting effect on the political conversation regarding government, this would be a huge legacy item.

Policy Legacy

The Supreme Court

A president's second term does not often offer significant policy legacy opportunities. Mostly, a president's second term is an exercise in attempting to consolidate and defend policy victories of the first term. However, there is one area that has offered presidents legacy shaping opportunities—the Supreme Court. Will Obama have such opportunities? We should never wish ill health on anyone, but the fact is Obama's legacy shaping opportunities regarding the Court are entirely dependent on the health of its extreme right wing justices. They certainly will not retire voluntarily. (I believe the older non-conservative members (Ginsburg and Breyer) should retire to enable the President to name two younger persons for the Court.)

Can President Obama positively shape the Court in an unexpected way? We can't know for sure, but justices with innovative progressive ideas about the Constitution are not likely to be nominated in this term for the simple reason that such a nomination might not be confirmed. It is not fair to ask the President to risk it in my view.

But there is nothing special about this legacy. The opportunity either arises or it does not. It is out of the president's control.

The Affordable Care Act

What is in his control? Not everything or in toto, ANYTHING. But he can do a lot. Consider his most important substantive new policy—the Affordable Care Act. For the most part, the ACA has not been implemented. In my view, this should be the ""new"" policy priority for the Obama Administration. The longevity of ACA is not assured at this time. Successful implementation is critical to having ACA stand for a significant time (and to improving it in progressive ways.) If the second term of President Obama's presidency does nothing ""new"" except successfully implement ACA, it will have accomplished a big f*cking deal.

Future Political Success for the Democratic Party: A Third Democratic Presidential Term

I place this in policy goals because the most important protection to President Obama's legacy will come from delivering political success to the Democratic Party in the near future. Especially holding the White House in 2016.

But what can President Obama do to help there? The answer is obvious—everything he can to help average Americans in these times of economic uncertainty and difficulty. Yes, for politics, it is the economy, stupid.

Of course this is an incomplete list of of policy initiatives and goals that the second term of the Obama presidency can impact, but I do think it includes the most important that are achievable (climate change is more of a bully pulpit goal it seems to me, though it should be noted the president promised EPA action if the Congress did not act. But, as I state above, the most important accomplishment the president can achieve regarding climate change in his second term is to positively impact the future political success of the Democratic Party.)

Assessing the Legacy of the Obama Presidency

As I stated at the outset, the historic nature of the Obama presidency is assured. It will remain its most important legacy no matter what he accomplishes. That said, President Obama clearly is aiming for more than that, and rightfully so.

In terms of achievements, additions to the first term successes seem unlikely, However, successfully preserving and implementing these successes is essential. Absent that, the Obama legacy will be light in terms of policy.

The most important achievement of an Obama second term will be the creation of a political climate that will put the 2016 Dem candidate for President in a good position to win a third Democratic term.

As Markos has noted, Hillary Clinton is well positioned to win that third term. But there are no guarantees in life or politics, and, oddly enough, the most important legacy issue for the second Obama term will be his successor. Helping average Americans in these hard economic times will have the biggest impact on that."

Mitch McConnell, and to begin unveiling her own positions in the high-profile Kentucky Senate race.

With an icy smile, the 34-year-old Grimes scoffed at the notion that she was philosophically or politically close to President Barack Obama, who is so unpopular here that he is mentioned by Kentucky Democrats fewer times than Voldemort ever was at Hogwarts.

“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.

“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”

It was funny -– and definitely not nice. Even the thought of the doughy, 71-year-old McConnell in a dancer’s outfit might be enough to cost him a sixth term.

In a wide-ranging, half-hour interview, Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Senate nominee for 2014, told me that she was pro-choice down the line on abortion, and that she would delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.

The two statements were her first substantive comments on policy matters. Until now she has spent most of her time attacking McConnell as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and unproductive about Washington.

The interview took place on the eve of the 133rd annual Fancy Farm Picnic, a church-sponsored day of politicking and speechifying on a rural expanse in the far-western Purchase region of Kentucky.

Grimes is one of five daughters in a devout Catholic family in Lexington. “I am a practicing Catholic,” she told me. “But I’m also for separation of church and state. I am supportive of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. And I think that this is the kind of choice that has to be up to the woman, her God and her doctor.”

On the Affordable Care Act -– Obama’s signature legislative measure -– Grimes was cautiously critical. “I am troubled by some of the provisions,” she said, and for the first time said exactly which one.

“There are 700,000 businesses in Kentucky and I am concerned that especially the smaller ones are overburdened,” she said.

Her suggestion: delay the imposition of the coverage mandate on small business, as the president already has done for larger corporations.

“The mandate will not work for many small businesses in Kentucky,” she said, “so I believe that a delay is the right course so that changes can be made.”

She also blasted McConnell for wanting to abandon the law altogether, pointing out that the state’s health ratings are among the worst in the nation, and that other provisions in the law will extend coverage to an estimated 600,000 more Kentuckians.

“Unlike Sen. McConnell, I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water,” she said. Of course McConnell is being blasted by tea party conservatives for his refusal -– so far -– to sign a letter that would force the issue by tying the next budget and debt-ceiling bills to the “defunding” of the ACA.

“He has a tightrope to walk,” Grimes observed, not sympathetically.

Her opening gambits on the issues are revealing for what they show about her beliefs and the strategy -- disagree with Washington Democratic orthodoxy when she can; hew to it when it is useful.

A pure pro-choice view is a must in the Democratic Party, if for no other reason than so many women activists are motivated to vote for –- and work for -– the party because of their strong belief in that view.

Grimes clearly wants to tap the fast-growing power of women in the Democratic Party, a phenomenon with a surprisingly long history in Kentucky politics.

She stressed the female mentors in her life -– a teacher who taught her rhetoric, her mother and grandmothers, her four sisters. She proudly stated that she is the “youngest female secretary of state in the nation.”

It sounded like a rather obscure claim when she made it at the Marshall County Bean Supper in nearby Kentucky Lakes on Friday night.

But it drew a big round of applause -– even bigger than the one Marshall County Judge/Executive Mike Miller got when he auctioned off a donated “whole hog” for $350.

Her speech was primarily sound-bitten attacks on McConnell. It was well received, if only because Democratic loyalists deeply despise McConnell.

But to win -– she is in a dead-heat in some recent polls –- she will have to come of age on the fly in the midst of a grueling, 15-month race from here to November 2014.

Nobody really knows who she is or what she really stands for, but she began the process of saying so Friday night.

Next stop, Fancy Farm."

Sarah Palin went to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Sunday–along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)–to support thousands of veterans demanding that President Barack Obama re-open the memorials that have been barricaded due to the government shutdown.

At the World War II Memorial, Palin said that Obama is showing a “shameful lack of respect” and a “lack of valor” by barricading the memorials to veterans from across the country that marched in Washington to demand that Congress pass a law making it illegal for the federal government to close the memorials in future government shutdowns. They reportedly chanted, “tear down these walls.”

“We were proud to stand with thousands of America’s vets and other patriotic Americans today in Washington, D.C. This morning, Todd and I met with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and they joined us and other Americans at the World War II Memorial and then at the Lincoln Memorial, where we were met by a SWAT team in full riot gear!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “Watching those who have fought to protect freedom prevented by barricades from visiting these memorials to freedom was truly heart wrenching.”

Palin has said Messrs. Lee and Cruz are leading a party of “good guys” in the Senate against both party establishments that make up Washington’s permanent political class. After the Republican establishment attacked Lee and Cruz during the defunding Obamacare fight, Palin fiercely defended them for representing everyday Americans. Palin has also called for Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience regarding the “Barrycades” at the memorials. At the march, veterans removed barricades from the memorial and took them to the White House.

Though the Obama administration officials put up barricades at the open-air memorials, they allowed thousands of amnesty supporters to rally on the National Mall, which was also supposed to be closed due to the government shutdown, last week in support of comprehensive immigration reform. On Saturday, Palin called out the Obama administration for revealing what their true priorities are during what she called a government “slim-down.”

Lee urged the crowd to “stand strong for liberty” and emphasized the memorial “belongs to the people.”

Cruz echoed Lee’s remarks.

After emphasizing that “our veterans should be above politics,” Cruz said he met with World War II veterans on “Honor Flights” last week and said they told him, “We stormed the beaches of Normandy, do they really think these little barricades [will keep us from seeing the World War II memorial]?”

Palin emphasized that Americans will now “take up the fight for freedom” and “won’t let you down”:

We’re here to show that the size of America’s heart for our veterans is immeasurable! But look around – barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a Commander in Chief expresses his gratitude? This “shutdown” priority proves a shameful lack of respect. It reflects a person’s lack of valor. But, Vets, We the People have learned from you! We know America will only remain the “Home of the Free” so long as we are the “Home of the Brave!” So, as we honor you, U.S. Military, know that our gratitude will not sleep! We will be brave! You were not timid, so we shall not be timid in calling out ANY who heart-wrenchingly would use you as pawns in a political game. America’s finest paid the price for our freedom today. Vets, you protected us from tyranny then. Rest now, it is OUR turn to protect against tyranny again. Ronald Reagan said, “Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world.” YOU, vets, need never ask that of yourselves. You made ALL the difference! Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. YOU paid the price! Rest now! We will pick up the mantle. We won’t let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom!

I honestly don't know how to feel about this.

No Boehner, no Cantor. I honestly don't know how to feel about this.

Speaker John A. Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the House’s two most senior Republicans, were invited to speak at the 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington — but declined. […] “They asked a long list of Republicans to come,” [civil rights activist Julian Bond] continued, “and to a man and woman they said ‘no.’ And that they would turn their backs on this event was telling of them, and the fact that they seem to want to get black votes, they’re not gonna get ‘em this way.”

Cantor, meanwhile, was asked 12 days ago to participate in Wednesday’s event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.’s delivery of the famous “I Have a Dream” speech, according to an aide. The Virginia Republican, however, is currently traveling in North Dakota and Ohio, touring energy sites with Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and participating in “nonofficial events,” according to an aide.

Conservatives complaining that the March on Washington anniversary celebration seems awfully partisan should note that they have only themselves to blame. Boehner instead spoke at a small Congressional ceremony. Eric Cantor's reason for not being there, though, is rather odd:Hmm. You know, when someone asks you to participate in the anniversary celebration of one of the most important inflection points of modern American history, you should generally say yes. You certainly shouldn't blow them off to tour North Dakota fracking sites, or whatever the hell he's claiming was more important.

That said, I disagree with Bond. I think declining a speaking spot was a perfectly appropriate choice on the part of conservative leaders, or at least the more intellectually honest one. Efforts to portray conservative reaction to the civil rights movement as anything less than hostile at the time (and hostile now) are insultingly dishonest, and having the community organizers, activists, spiritual leaders and labor leaders of that time putatively honored on the same spot by people like John Boehner or Eric Cantor, people who have open contempt for many of the goals expressed by those same leaders even now, might have been a bigger sin than any pretense at modern fluffy nonpartisanship could justify. Hooray that they were politely asked; hooray that they politely said no.

If Eric Cantor believes that it is more important to wander rural North Dakota in self-imposed exile than to show up to honor the 50th anniversary of one of the great moments and movements in American history, I am not about to argue with him. If only the rest of the conservative movement had even half as much self-restraint.

A steady stream of people entered the House of Prayer and Praise church in Detroit on Friday for the funeral of McBride, 19, who was shot to death about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday on the porch of a home in Dearborn Heights, Mich. Civil rights leaders have called for an investigation of the shooting using language that recalls the racially charged deaths of Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till and Yusef Hawkins.

The family and her supporters say the woman, who was a recent graduate of Southfield High School and had just gotten a job at Ford Motor Co., was in a car accident in the early morning hours. Her cellphone battery was dead so she walked several blocks seeking help at a house. The person inside, a man who has not been named, went to the door and fired a shotgun in her face, according to police reports.

“It's hard to be believe it’s an accident when a gun is in her face and the trigger is pulled,” the family's attorney, Gerald Thurswell, told reporters.

“It appears this young woman was merely seeking help following a car accident as her cellphone went dead,” said a statement by leaders of the Detroit branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. “After knocking on a neighbor’s door, instead of being aided in the situation or police called for an investigation, she was shot fatally in the head. Have we become a society where we are no longer our neighbors’ keeper?

“This shooting must be investigated at every level,” said the civil rights group, one of several involved in the case.

All have called for an investigation into the shooting and the familiar refrain of “No Justice, No Peace” was chanted by about 50 people protesting at the Dearborn Heights police station this week. That slogan was frequent battle cry during the protests over the acquittal of George Zimmerman who shot unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.

“We are in prayer for the family of Renisha McBride but we are also urgently calling for justice,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, also involved with Martin family, said in a statement. Sharpton's National Action Network is one of the groups calling for an investigation in Michigan.

No charges have been filed in the case, but authorities have said they were investigating. According to police, the man told investigators that he thought someone was trying to break into his home and accidentally discharged the gun.

Earlier this week, police said they requested a warrant in the case. The Wayne County prosecutor's office sent the request back to police Wednesday for additional investigation before making a charging decision.

“We will not be able to make a charging decision until the requested work has been completed,” the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

“I'm confident when the evidence comes it will show that my client was justified and acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life,” Cheryl Carpenter, one of two lawyers representing the unnamed man, told the Detroit News."

“We still have a long way to go, but this bipartisan movement is a major breakthrough,” he said.

The group described four main pillars: border enforcement, employer enforcement, the handling of the flow of legal immigration (including temporary agricultural workers and high-skilled engineers) and a pathway to citizenship for those who entered the nation illegally. Mr. McCain called the pathway to citizenship the “most controversial piece of immigration reform,” saying that the current situation amounts to “de facto amnesty” and that the illegal immigrants deserve a chance to live legally in the country and ultimately become citizens.

“We have been too content for too long to allow individuals to mow our lawn, serve our food, clean our homes and even watch our children, while not affording them any of the benefits that make our country so great,” he said. “I think everyone agrees that it’s not beneficial to our country to have these people hidden in the shadows.”

Mr. Schumer said that he and Mr. Durbin spoke Sunday evening with President Obama, who plans to deliver his own speech on immigration Tuesday in Nevada, and that “he couldn’t be more pleased.” Mr. Menendez met with the president Friday as part of a meeting that the White House held with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus."

With remarkable speed, the House overwhelmingly approved legislation to give the secretary of transportation enough financial flexibility to shift as much as $253 million to the air traffic control system, less than a week after the onset of politically problematic flight delays driven by across-the-board spending cuts. The money will be shifted from airport improvement funds, and none would come from additional revenues, once a key demand of Mr. Obama and the Democrats. The 361-to-41 vote came less than 24 hours after the Senate rushed the measure through.

Republicans claimed victory. “Consider that the Democrats’ opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases,” Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a memo to members before the vote. “By last night, Senate Democrats were adopting our targeted ‘cut this, not that’ approach. This victory is in large part a result of our standing together.”

The Congressional action effectively undoes one of the thorniest results of “sequestration,” the $85 billion in spending cuts that took effect March 1 and have rippled across the federal government. With the president’s promised signature, Democrats will lose significant leverage they had hoped would force Republicans into a larger agreement since the flight delays were seen as the sort of inconvenience that could force a reversal of the cuts."

Both President Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are proposing “paths to citizenship” for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Other proposals abound, including finishing the border fence, creating a better E-Verify system for employers and passing the last Congress’ Dream Act.

All of these ideas, however, fundamentally misunderstand immigration in America: Future immigration is probably going to be governed not by U.S. domestic policy choices but by global demographics.

For the last 30 years, a massive number of immigrants has poured into the U.S. from south of the border. Today there are 38 million people living in the United States who were born somewhere else. That’s an average of more than 1 million immigrants a year for three decades, a sustained influx unlike any we’ve seen before in U.S. history. And regardless of what policies Washington decides on, that supply is likely to dry up soon.

Like much else in the world, immigration is influenced by the fertility rate: that is, the number of children the average woman has during her lifetime. If the total fertility rate of a country is above 2.1 — what demographers called the replacement level — then that country’s population grows. If the rate is below 2.1, then eventually its population contracts.

When it comes to immigration, demographers have a general rule of thumb: Countries with fertility rates below the replacement level tend to attract immigrants, not send them. And so, when a country’s fertility rate collapses, it often ceases to be a source of immigration.

Consider Puerto Rico. In the 1920s, Puerto Ricans began to trickle into the United States. Their numbers accumulated slowly, and by 1930, there were 50,000 Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. (nearly all in New York City). Over time, however, the community reached a critical mass, and by the mid-1940s, 30,000 Puerto Ricans were arriving every year. The Puerto Rican wave continued, and grew. In 1955, 80,000 Puerto Ricans came to the United States.

Advertisement

But from 1955 to 2010, the number plummeted. Even though the population of Puerto Rico had nearly doubled in that time, the total number of Puerto Ricans moving to the United States in 2010 was only 4,283.

Why? After all, migrating to the United States from Puerto Rico had become easier, not harder. And while economic conditions in Puerto Rico brightened somewhat, the opportunities and standard of living in the U.S. are still superior.

Advertisement

What happened is that Puerto Rico’s fertility rate imploded. In 1955, Puerto Rico’s total fertility rate was 4.97, well above replacement. By 2012, it had fallen to 1.64 — even further below the replacement line than the United States’.

And what has happened in Puerto Rico is happening all across Latin America, where fertility rates have been dropping on an express elevator for 20 years.

Advertisement

Many Latin American countries have already fallen below the replacement level. It’s not a coincidence that sub-replacement countries — such as Uruguay, Chile, Brazil and Costa Rica — send the U.S. barely any immigrants at all. The vast majority of our immigrants come from above-replacement countries, such as Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico.

But even though they’re still above-replacement, those countries are witnessing epic fertility declines too.

Advertisement

Consider Mexico, which over the last 30 years has sent roughly two-thirds of all the immigrants — legal and illegal — who came to the United States. In 1970, the Mexican fertility rate was 6.72. Today, it’s hovering at the 2.1 mark — a drop of nearly 70% in just two generations. And it’s still falling.

The result is that from 2005 to 2010, the U.S. received a net of zero immigrants from Mexico.

Advertisement

Certainly some of that change can be attributed to the Great Recession, particularly the slowdown in construction and the housing industry. But we may also be witnessing the beginning of a structural change in our immigration relationship, as Mexico’s demographic profile comes to resemble Puerto Rico’s.

It’s important to understand that Mexico’s experience is not unique but rather is part of a global phenomenon. Today, 97% of the world’s population lives in countries where the fertility rate is falling. And once a country’s fertility rate starts dropping, it nearly always settles far below the replacement level. And because of this, most demographic models project that the world’s population will peak sometime before the end of this century, and then begin contracting — for the first time since the Black Death ravaged Europe.

The U.S. immigration debate is largely driven by politics. And the truth is that both liberals and conservatives have valid concerns about immigration’s effect. But this political debate is shortsighted, and whatever policy choices we make will probably only matter in the near term. In the end, demography always wins.

Asked whether consumers mistakenly believe that the shot does not produce a caffeine-related crash, Ms. Lutz said that the use of the special mark and its explanation were clear. “I don’t believe that it is misleading,” said Ms. Lutz, who added that the advertising division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus had approved the “No Crash Later” claim.

She added that another study showing the benefits of 5-Hour Energy was undergoing “peer review” for possible publication in a scientific journal. But she declined to say why the results of the study, which was apparently conducted five years ago, had not yet appeared. That study found a benefit when 5-Hour Energy was compared to a placebo like flavored water, she said.

Whatever the case, the energy drink boom has come full circle in Asia, the region where it started. Over the last decade, sales of Lipovitan D have fallen and its maker, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, has tried various strategies to revitalize the brand. Among them: bringing out Lipovitan Junior, a caffeine-free version for children.

In Thailand, Krating Daeng has suffered a similar fate. Its producer has tried to freshen up that brand by proclaiming that the Vitamin B12 in it “helps the functions of the nervous system and brain.”

Last year, the Foundation for Consumers in Thailand, an advocacy group, started a publicity campaign against energy drinks like Krating Daeng, arguing that producers were promoting unfounded health claims to push caffeine.

“This product just needed a way to add value to extend its life cycle,” said Patchara Klaewkla, an official at the foundation. “This product has been in the market for a long time.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/marco-rubio-immigration-bill_n_3358191.html,2013-05-30 00:00:00,[],Marco Rubio Message Leaves Supporters Of Immigration Bill Unsettled,"By Caren Bohan

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio's repeated criticism of parts of the sweeping U.S. immigration bill he helped craft has unsettled immigration reform advocates and others who support its passage.

Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender, has consistently defended the bill's centerpiece - providing legal status for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.

But he has publicly said he wants changes to the bill and said last week that he agreed with some of the concerns voiced in a letter by 150 prominent conservatives who oppose the legislation. He also told CNBC that it would not pass without changes.

His office also raised eyebrows a few weeks ago when it circulated a memo to other Senate staff listing 21 concerns with the bill and ideas for changing what would be the biggest overhaul of federal immigration law in decades.

Frank Sharry, head of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, said Rubio's comments made him ""anxious"" and cautioned that the lawmaker must avoid taking his message too far.

""Rubio is uniquely qualified to talk to conservatives about immigration reform,"" Sharry said. ""On the other hand, if he thinks now that he's the face of immigration reform, that he's going to drive this bill in a direction that makes it less palatable for the progressive coalition that created the political space for reform, it's going to be a huge problem.""

Rubio, however, has said that failure to heed his concerns could endanger the prospect of overhauling immigration law, an issue that has historically divided conservatives and the American left.

As the most high-profile conservative in the bi-partisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators who labored for months to craft the legislation, Rubio will play a key role when it comes up for debate in the Democratic-controlled chamber.

Selling the bill is a delicate balancing act for Rubio. His comments are intended to build trust with conservatives, who have traditionally opposed immigration reform, but he must avoid alienating Democrats, whose support is also vital for passage.

While enactment of the bill could help Rubio's overall presidential prospects, it could cost him support in crucial early-voting conservative states such as Iowa and South Carolina.

Rubio has won credit from Democrats for backing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Pushing the economic case for the bill's passage, Rubio argues that new visa programs for foreign workers could boost America's global competitiveness, especially in the technology sector.

Yet he has often qualified his support by making clear he favors toughening the enforcement provisions of the bill, which are seen as politically necessary to get many Republicans' support for giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.

In a town hall-style appearance on Fox News last week, Rubio said he wanted to see the bill go farther to boost security on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Asked about conservatives' mistrust of the Obama administration on border enforcement, he replied, ""You've hit on the exact point.""

Rubio promised to consider revisions that would put Congress in charge of creating a border security plan rather than the Department of Homeland Security as currently called for in the bill. ""Unless we get people's confidence that we are going to secure the border, this bill won't pass,"" he said.

SELLING TO CONSERVATIVES

As a frequent guest on conservative radio and television programs, Rubio has a broad platform. And his arguments have converted some talk show hosts, including Mike Gallagher who acknowledged recently that he had been won over to supporting the central focus of the bill.

But David Leopold, general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports immigration reform, said Rubio was ""pushing the envelope.""

""Rubio needs to back up this bill,"" Leopold said. ""To offer a bill, to sit down and roll up your sleeves and write a bill with Democrats - I'm not going to discount that that took guts - but in that same vein, he needs to go into his caucus and sell this bill as a champion and not as a critic.""

Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, which supports immigration reform, said some of Rubio's comments were ""off-putting.""

But he added that Rubio's approach might turn out to be a shrewd way of reaching out and showing fellow conservatives that he is listening to their concerns. ""He does have a difficult role in trying to sell this package to conservatives.""

Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant emphasized that the lawmaker was not the only member of the Gang of Eight to say publicly that more work was needed to pass the bill in the Senate.

Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American from New Jersey, told Univision in an interview that the supporters ""don't currently have"" the minimum 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.

""After the last four or five months, I don't think anybody should question Senator Rubio's commitment to passing immigration reform,"" Conant said. That commitment is ""why he says we need to be open-minded about criticisms and we need to be open-minded about improving the bill,"" Conant said.

Fitz warned that Rubio ""may be creating expectations that aren't going to be able to be met"" in terms of promises to toughen border security.

Other Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight, including Senators John McCain, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, also are expected to push for the bill within their party.

""I think Rubio is critical,"" said Rebecca Tallent, a former aide to McCain who is now director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which supports immigration reform.

""He speaks to a lot of the folks who wouldn't necessarily be inclined to vote for something like this but Senator McCain brings the historical context and has a leadership role within the party and is good at building coalitions,""

In at least one recent closed-door meeting with Republicans, Rubio was even more blunt than he has been in public about what he sees as the bill's flaws, according to participants.

""The message was not, 'Listen, I've come up with a really good bill that we need to support it.' It was, 'This is a terribly flawed bill but it moves the ball forward and over the next weeks and months, it will move ever rightward,'"" said a conservative who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity."

Jefferson expanded on that theme in a segment on ""All In With Chris Hayes"" Tuesday night, playing the part of a concerned citizen wondering how the white community is going to deal with the ""problems of white culture.""

""You probably haven't heard much about the white riot in Huntington Beach,"" Hayes began. ""That's because the story of white criminal culture is not a story the mainstream media will tell you. But once you scratch the surface, these stories are everywhere you look.""

Hayes and Jefferson engaged in a back-and-forth that parodied several tired tropes that surface when talking heads discuss race on TV.

""There are people that are going to tell you that ... this has nothing to do with white people, it's just a few bad apples. What do you say to that?"" Hayes asked.

""To that I say that if that's your actual belief then you're living with your head in the sand,"" Jefferson said. ""I used to live in New York City and would occassionally go to Hoboken, New Jersey's St. Patrick's Day parade, and there were so many young white men there vomiting in the streets, urinating in the streets, getting in fistfights in the streets. It was a sight to be seen.""

""Do you have a personal problem with white people?"" Hayes later asked. ""Is this animus?""

""No, I think any time that you tell the truth there's going to be those people who come out and think you're doing it for some insidious reason and say that you're a racist,"" Jefferson said. ""I knew that some white people were going to call this playing the race card, but it isn't playing the race card. My best friend is white.""

Jefferson's Gawker piece drew ire on social media, and not just from people who disagreed with his critique of how African Americans are portrayed in the news.

Sarah Palin announced that she will travel to Washington, D.C. on Sunday to support and honor the veterans who will be arriving for the “Million Vet March” on the memorials.

Speaking at a rally for New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan along with Mark Levin on Saturday, Palin denounced the Obama administration for dishonoring veterans by barricading the World War II Memorial during the federal government shutdown. She said it was “heart-wrenching,” “atrocious,” and “not right.”

“We’re going to zip on in to D.C.,” Palin said of herself and her husband Todd. “We’re going to shake hands with those vets who are being dishonored.”

Palin then accused the Obama administration of “using our military as pawns” during the government shutdown with such actions.

She also mentioned that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), whose seat Lonegan and Democrat Cory Booker are running for, was the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress and noted that his memory was also being dishonored by the Obama administration’s actions.

Palin said the memorials serve to remind Americans of “the cost to provide for this exceptional nation” and the price Americans have had to pay to fight “against tyranny” and “for liberty.”

Palin noted that the memorials, though they received some federal assistance, were also built with private donations.

“And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets?” Palin said. “For shame.”

Palin has previously urged Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience at the “Barrycades.” At the “Million Vet March”, veterans will demand that the Obama administration re-open the memorials and urge Congress to pass legislation to forbid the memorials from being closed in future government shutdowns."

In an emotional and defiant address to the council after the vote was announced, Filner apologized to his victims and supporters but also said he had been victimized by “the hysteria of the lynch mob” caused by politicians and the media once the allegations by some 18 women became public.

“I faced lynch mobs many times when I was younger,” Filner said, a reference to his activism in the 1960s as a Freedom Rider in the segregated South when he spent two months in a Mississippi jail.

But, Filner added, his voice breaking, “The city should not have been put through this, and my own personal failings were responsible.” The resignation is effective Aug. 30.

“This settlement is an end to our civic nightmare and allows this city to begin to heal,” said Council President Todd Gloria, one of two council members who negotiated for three days with Filner, his attorneys, and the city attorney to reach the deal.

Within minutes of the council decision, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office confirmed that a criminal investigation into Filner’s treatment of women “is underway.” Investigators have been interviewing some of the women who have come forward with allegations.

Filner’s resignation does not affect the investigation, a source close to the investigation said.

Filner, 70, was elected in November as the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades.

When he entered the council chambers after the vote was announced, his supporters stood and applauded but council members, all of whom had called for Filner to resign, showed no emotion.

He repeated his previous apologies to the city and to the women he has offended. But he also called on the council and his potential successors not to abandon the agenda he brought to the mayor’s office: better neighborhood services, respect for city employees and concern for lower-income neighborhoods.

Filner said that his own conduct provided the ammunition for his critics but that “well-organized interests who have run this city for half a century” conspired to run him from office. He singled out politicians and the media for criticism.

He apologized to his ex-fiancee, Bronwyn Ingram, who ended their relationship just days before the first allegations were made against Filner. She said she had caught Filner making dates with other women.

“I love you very much,” Filner said to Ingram, who was not present. “You love San Diego as much as I did. I personally apologize for the hurt I caused you.”

“Justice has been done,” said City Atty. Jan Goldsmith.

The deal approved 7-0 by the council does not resolve the lawsuit filed against Filner and the city by Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred on behalf of Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner’s former director of communications.

Under the agreement, the city will pay $98,000 to Filner’s private attorneys. The city will also defend Filner against the Jackson lawsuit and pay any damages that result from a court decision or an out-of-court settlement.

Council members insisted that even though the deal obligates the city to assist Filner financially in fighting the lawsuit, it is in the best interests of the taxpayers because it may limit any damages the city might face from her case.

Even as he apologized, Filner remained defiant, blasting the council’s decision to pay some of his legal fees only if he resigned. “I cannot afford to continue this battle,” he said, “even though if I did I know I would be vindicated.”

His conduct, he said, was due to awkwardness and thoughtlessness but not an intention to harass or abuse women.

The council now must call an election to be held within 90 days to find a successor. In the interim, Gloria will assume greater authority but not the full powers of the “strong mayor” adopted by voters in 2004.

Filner becomes the fourth of the last seven mayors of San Diego to leave office early.

Before the council went into closed session, it heard the comments of several dozen people from among the 200-plus who had crowded into the council chambers for the 1 p.m. meeting.

Many demanded that the settlement be rejected and that the recall movement be allowed to proceed. Others, some speaking Spanish, said the council should remember Filner’s long history of support for minority communities.

Joan Raymond, a retired garbage truck driver, expressed support for Filner and urged the council to let the voters decide his fate, calling fears of civic paralysis if he remained as mayor exaggerated.

“It’s the city workers in the field that make the city run 24/7. Our water is still being delivered. Our toilets are still flushing. Our trash is still being picked up despite this political hysteria,” Raymond said.

Laura Fink, a political consultant and one of Filner’s accusers, pressed for his ouster. Early in the scandal, Fink told interviewers that Filner had patted her buttocks.

“Today I stand shoulder to shoulder with the other women that have come forward asking for the mayor to resign,” she told the council.

“Without the mayor’s resignation, our city will continue to be paralyzed with this scandal, progress will be arrested, and our focus will continue to be monopolized by this dark chapter in our history,” Fink said.

The scandal began in mid-July when three former Filner supporters sent letters to him demanding that he resign. When he refused their demand, the three held a news conference to again seek his resignation for alleged sexual harassment.

Faced with the allegations, Filner distributed a video in which he admitted treating women with disrespect, apologized and said, “I need help.” He hired new staff to give a sense of stability in his office.

Then he announced he planned to undergo a two-week regimen of intensive behavioral therapy. He promised to return to City Hall on Aug. 19 ready to be “the best mayor I can.”

At first, the allegations were anonymous. Then Allred filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Filner and the city on Jackson’s behalf.

Soon other women began going public with accusations in television interviews. By Friday, 18 women had accused Filner of groping them and making lewd remarks.

His accusers included three business executives, two college officials, two military veterans, a Navy admiral, two singers, three city employees and a nurse.

"" data-share-img="""" data-share=""twitter,facebook,linkedin,reddit,google,mail"" data-share-count=""false"">

The Post Office’s problems are the same today as they were back in September: the long-term secular decline of postal mail, on the one hand, combined with all manner of Congressionally-mandated restrictions which make a bad situation much, much worse. And now the inevitable has happened: we’re going to have a $5.5 billion default.

A default of that magnitude sounds scarier than it actually is. Congress requires the Post Office to make inordinately huge pension-plan payments, for reasons which nobody can really understand. But in the final analysis, USPS pensions are a government obligation, and it doesn’t make a huge amount of difference whether they come out of a well-funded pension plan, a badly-funded pension plan, or just out of US government revenues.

What does make a lot of difference is the degree to which the Post Office is hamstrung by Congress. There’s still room for the Postal Service to reorient itself and become a successful 21st-century utility — but there’s no way that’s going to happen if it’s constantly on the back foot and if Congress prevents it from entering new businesses, possibly including banking.

To put it another way: the Post Office is broken, in large part thanks to unhelpful meddling by Congress. And it won’t get fixed unless and until Congress gets out of the way and stops forcing it into the corporate equivalent of ketosis, essentially consuming its own flesh in order to survive.

The talking point from the mailing industry here is that multi-billion-dollar defaults “could make consumers lose confidence in the Postal Service”, and thereby make matters even worse. It’s a bit like the argument we saw in Detroit in 2009, when lots of people said that if the big auto makers went bankrupt, no one would buy their cars any more. That argument wasn’t convincing at the time, and it turned out not to be true. Similarly, I’m not worried about that bickering in Washington will directly affect the confidence that Americans have in their postal service.

On the other hand, it’s pretty much certain that bickering in Washington will unnecessarily make the situation at the Post Office much worse than it needs to be. And as such, it’s a prime example of US political dysfunction. As Zero Hedge says, if the muppets in Washington can’t get this right, what are the chances that they’re going to be able to do the right thing when the fiscal cliff arrives at year-end?

The best hope for America is that politicians are more likely to create fights and dysfunction for things which don’t rise to the level of outright crisis, but that they somehow manage to come together to find solutions when the alternative is catastrophic. That’s often a good bet — but not always. And so while I’m reasonably confident that we’ll get through the fiscal cliff somehow, I’m not at all certain of it. Meanwhile, I am reasonably certain that Congress will starve the USPS of the funding and freedom it needs to succeed over the long term. Which of course will cost taxpayers enormously for as long as postal workers are collecting pension checks."

USA TODAY

The Department of Transportation has fined Southwest Airlines $200,000 for violating the agency's fare advertising rules. The agency says Southwest did not extend advertised fares to enough seats during two recent sales.

""Consumers should be able to trust that the price they see advertised is the price they'll pay for a seat,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx says in a statement. ""DOT will continue to take enforcement action against carriers and ticket agents when our price advertising rules are violated.""

The DOT says one Southwest violation came during a Valentine's Day ""Luv a Fare Sale"" promotion in which the carrier advertised one-way, nonstop fares ""for $100 or less."" However, the DOT asserts that Southwest ""failed to include a reasonable number of seats available in a significant number of city-pair markets in the fare sale.""

The DOT says fares offered in sale were offered only on 1%-2% of the available seats on some routes, according to the Los Angeles Times.

For Southwest's part, The Dallas Morning News says the airline, in its formal response to the DOT, notes its Feb. 14 sale fares were available in about 80% of the markets it served at the time and that the sale fares sold out in fewer than 10% of the available city pairings.

The DOT also cited a Jan. 30 incident in which the DOT says no seats were available for an advertised fare of $66 each way. The advertised price for flights between Dallas Love Field and Branson, Mo., was made through Southwest's DING! app for special fares.

""These were temporary and unintentional circumstances that were aggravated by a technical glitch in our inventory and sales systems,"" Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins is quoted as saying by the News-Leader of Springfield, Mo. ""We've worked with the DOT to address their concerns and have corrected the issues internally to prevent this from happening again.""

""By advertising fares for which a reasonable number of seats were not available and advertising fares that were not available at all, Southwest violated the full fare advertising rule and engaged in prohibited unfair and deceptive practices,"" the DOT says in its statement.

The Southwest fine comes as the DOT has become increasingly aggressive in enforcing its consumer protection rules.

Among other recent DOT fines:

A $375,000 fine against Delta in June for bumping violations.

A $130,000 fine against United for a tarmac delay violation.

A $200,000 fine against American affiliate American Eagle for tarmac delay violations.

As for the latest fine against Southwest, the Chicago Tribune says it ""is fairly significant compared with similar violations of price advertising. Chicago-based Orbitz was fined $60,000 in 2011 under the same rule."""

Story highlights John Avlon: It's telling and sad that IRS workers were on lookout for ""patriot"" groups ""Patriot"" is a word whose meaning has been corrupted by extremists, he says Avlon: Past decade has seen exploding number of ""patriot"" paramilitary groups

Editor’s Note: John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the author of “Independent Nation” and “Wingnuts.” He won the National Society of Newspaper Columnists’ award for best online column in 2012.

(CNN) —

On Memorial Day, we honor those patriots who gave “the last full measure of devotion” – in Abraham Lincoln’s words – and died defending our freedom and union.

But this Memorial Day is partly clouded by the resurgence of partisan scandal in Washington. At the IRS, employees filtered through the exploding number of tax exemption applications by politically associated organizations by being on the lookout for groups that had the name “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their name. This was improper, illegal, unethical and outrageous.

But hold on – when did the word “patriot” become a partisan pejorative? How did such a bipartisan positive word get identified as a sign of hyperpartisan politics?

Newsweek John Avlon

It’s actually an interesting story.

Over the past few years, you might have noticed more than few political fundraising e-mails addressing you as “Fellow Patriot.” They ain’t from the ACLU. They tend to be from conservative activist groups, and there is more than a little self-congratulation in their tribal identifier.

The idea, of course, is that their fellow travelers on the right side of the aisle are the “real” patriots – related to Sarah Palin’s “Real Americans” – defenders of a political faith and traditional way of life under attack by liberals, Democrats, demographics and above all, President Barack Obama.

The fact that many of these self-styled superpatriots seem to hate their twice-elected president is itself a sign of just how dumb the false dualities that dominate our politics can be.

But it’s nothing new. Like so many themes in our politics, there are echoes of the past in our present debates. Going back to at least the virulently anti-Catholic “Know-Nothing” Party of the 1800s, conservative populists have always styled themselves as superpatriots whose commitment to our country outpaces their neighbors and especially our country’s newest arrivals.

There has always been an anxiety – most recently articulated by Pat Buchanan and Anne Coulter – that immigration will change the complexion and cultural character of our country. It has always been ultimately exposed as xenophobia poising as patriotism.

Three of my grandparents arrived to the United States more or less a century ago from Southern Europe, and they were derided as “garlic eaters” and far worse by some earlier immigrants, but welcomed with open arms by many more. Their achievement of the American Dream is why I proudly count myself as an almost cheesy patriot of the Norman Rockwell variety.

But history teaches us to be wary of people who lord their patriotism over others and use it to divide rather than unite.

The precursors to some of today’s more cultish conservative groups emerged during post-war anxiety about the legitimate threat of communism and the McCarthy-ite excesses that flowed out of that era’s right wing politics. The us-against-them, “enemy within” rhetoric of the John Birch Society endures today in the polemics of Glenn Beck, Alex Jones and others.

The early growth of self-styled paramilitary groups began in the early 1960s during the presidency of John F. Kennedy – a committed Cold Warrior, but not incidentally a Catholic and a Democrat.

The “Minutemen” were one such group who thrived off survivalist drills and a supposed plan to “confiscate all private firearms by the end of 1965.”

We hear similar strains of fearmongering today in the attempts to block the universal gun background check bill. Notably, the Minutemen’s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, briefly tried to form a political party called – you guessed it – The Patriot Party. They fell into some discredit when DePugh’s followers were implicated in a half-baked plot to attack the United Nations.

At the time, former President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, felt compelled to weigh in by saying, “I don’t think the United States needs Super-Patriots. … We need patriotism, honestly practiced by all of us and we don’t need these people [who pretend to be] more patriotic than you or anybody else.”

Ike’s advice was good then and now.

He had the credibility that comes from leading our troops in World War II. Nobody with half a brain was going to accuse him of being anything less than a full-fledged patriot (which didn’t stop the founder of the John Birch Society from accusing him of being a Soviet agent just as Obama is called a Muslim Marxist by some today.)

Over the past decade, we’ve seen the explosive growth of paramilitary style “patriot” groups – to more than 1,000 according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. This dynamic definitely didn’t help the word “patriot” recover its bipartisan bona fides. Neither did the impulse of some on the far left since the late 1960s to denigrate patriotism and military service as signs of what they call American imperialism.

The fact that the word “patriot” was used as a filter by IRS workers is a sign of the persistence of culture wars in our politics, perhaps more prevalent now than ever because of the rise of partisan media.

It is a deep breach of the trust that the IRS has struggled to rebuild since the audit scandals of the Nixon administration. And it is a particular irony that the completely inappropriate partisan filter they used will no doubt actually impede investigations of what might ultimately be revealed to be a more widespread scandal – the illegal abuse of tax-free status by partisan political groups. But the damage has been done.

When the word “patriot” becomes a pejorative, it is a sign of how much our shared civic faith has been denigrated by the rise of hyperpartisan politics.

The very emotion that should unite us all as Americans is too often used as a wedge to divide us. On this Memorial Day, that’s worth reflection and a determination to do better as one small way of honoring those whose sacrifice makes all our bitter political battles seem small and self-indulgent.

Frustrated with the lack of progress, Ms. Collins, a Republican, two Saturdays ago quickly zipped out a three-point plan that she thought both parties could live with, marched to the Senate floor and dared her colleagues to come up with something better. A few days later, two other Republican female senators eagerly signed on — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who overcame the Tea Party to win re-election in 2010, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who benefited from the Tea Party wave.

Together the three women started a bipartisan group whose negotiating framework formed the centerpiece of a tentative Senate deal nearing completion Monday to reopen the federal government and avert a disastrous default.

“Before I went to the Senate floor, no one was presenting any way out,” Ms. Collins said. “I think what our group did was pave the way, and I’m really happy about that.”"

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Justice Samuel Alito’s middle-school antics,"The most remarkable thing about the Supreme Court’s opinions announced Monday was not what the justices wrote or said. It was what Samuel Alito did.

The associate justice, a George W. Bush appointee, read two opinions, both 5-4 decisions that split the court along its usual right-left divide. But Alito didn’t stop there. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, Alito visibly mocked his colleague.

Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the high court, was making her argument about how the majority opinion made it easier for sexual harassment to occur in the workplace when Alito, seated immediately to Ginsburg’s left, shook his head from side to side in disagreement, rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling.

His treatment of the 80-year-old Ginsburg, 17 years his elder and with 13 years more seniority, was a curious display of judicial temperament or, more accurately, judicial intemperance. Typically, justices state their differences in words — and Alito, as it happens, had just spoken several hundred of his own from the bench. But he frequently supplements words with middle-school gestures.

Days earlier, I watched as he demonstrated his disdain for Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the two other women on the court. Kagan, the newest justice, prefaced her reading of an opinion in a low-profile case by joking that it was “possibly not” the case the audience had come to hear. The audience responded with laughter, a few justices smiled — and Alito, seated at Kagan’s right elbow, glowered.

Another time, Sotomayor, reading a little-watched case about water rights, joked that “every student in the audience is going to look up the word ‘preemption’ today.” Alito rolled his eyes and shook his head.

Alito is best known for his antics at the 2010 State of the Union address, when President Obama criticized the Citizens United decision. While other justices remained expressionless, Alito adopted a sour look, shook his head “no” and appeared to mouth the words “not true.” At the various oral arguments I’ve watched over the past few years, Alito’s eye-rolling, head-shaking and other expressions of exasperation are a fairly common occurrence, most often when Sotomayor has the floor.

Alito’s latest irritability came, ironically, on a day when the main headline about the court was comity: Justice Anthony Kennedy read an unexpectedly modest decision on affirmative action that left some racial preferences intact and commanded a 7-1 majority. Many in the audience expected bigger decisions, on same-sex marriage and voting rights (former justices John Paul Stevens and Alito’s predecessor, Sandra Day O’Connor, were both in the house), but those contentious issues were held for another day.

Beyond the broad agreement on affirmative action, though, were three 5-4 decisions Monday, two read by Alito with a dry and clinical delivery. In the first, he announced that the court was rejecting a jury award for a woman who was disfigured and disabled by a drug that didn’t come with adequate warnings. Despite the “dreadful injuries,” Alito argued, siding with the drugmaker and throwing out an appellate-court ruling, “sympathy for respondent does not relieve us of the responsibility of following the law.”

The second case Alito read, one of two cases Monday limiting claims of workplace discrimination, rejected an African American woman’s complaints of a racially hostile work environment. Alito argued that the employer was not liable because, under Alito’s narrowed definition, the person doing the harassing did not qualify as the employee’s supervisor.

Other conservative justices share Alito’s views but aren’t quite so dour in expression. Antonin Scalia is caustic and even incendiary, but often funny. Chief Justice John Roberts can be droll. On the other side, Kagan has tried to make the court more accessible to a lay audience by giving chatty lectures from the bench rather than reading from her written opinions, which also have been playful. In an opinion she wrote this month on a transportation case, she made reference to the 1980s song “867-5309/Jenny” by Tommy Tutone.

Even Ginsburg, no comedienne, can be colloquial and accessible. In her dissents Monday, she noted that an employee can avoid a harassing co-worker by telling him to “buzz off,” and she argued that “the ball again lies in Congress’s court to correct this court’s wayward interpretations.” She also invoked the self-deprecating quotation defining a legal mind as one that “can think about a thing inextricably attached to something else without thinking about the thing which it is attached to.”

Ginsburg was tart, even acidic — but she confined her objections to words. That kind of judicial restraint would benefit her junior colleague.

Officials said the releases, which began last week and continued on Tuesday, were a response to the possibility of automatic governmentwide budget cuts, known as sequestration, which are scheduled to take effect on Friday.

“As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” the agency’s spokeswoman, Gillian M. Christensen, said in a statement. The agency’s budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is $2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system.

Immigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations.

They refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants’ advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

“Coal Miner’s Daughter”: No. 1 country hit that spawned her bestselling 1976 autobiography and the 1980 Academy Award-winning biopic, this is Lynn’s theme song. Lynn told the story of her hardscrabble but loving upbringing in the Appalachian coal-mining country of eastern Kentucky from which she made her remarkable rise to worldwide fame and acclaim.

“Don’t Come Home A’Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)”: Lynn’s first No. 1 hit on the country chart, “Don’t Come Home A’Drinkin’ ” slammed the door on the passive female victim of wayward boyfriends and husbands who’d populated so many country songs before she came along. “Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find/Cause if you want that kind of love well you don’t need none of mine.” This was a woman who knew what she was worth and wasn’t about to be devalued by a lout -- powerful stuff in country music in 1966.

“One’s on the Way”: As the women’s liberation movement grew and promoted the idea that women had a right to control their own bodies, Lynn took that message written by satirist Shel Silverstein to rural America in 1971. Lynn emphasizes Silverstein’s wry observational skill and sense of humor over outrage or stridency in pointing out the differences between the nation’s haves and have-nots and the effect that child-bearing had on most women’s lives.

But here in Topeka the rain is a fallin’

The faucet is a drippin’ and the kids are a bawlin’

One of them a-toddlin’ and one is a-crawlin’ and one’s on the way

“Rated X”: In 1972, with the Motion Picture Assn. of America’s recently instituted movie ratings system the subject of endless controversy, especially when it came to films with sexual themes that earned the feared “X” rating, Lynn scored another No. 1 hit with her examination of the way women, far more than men, were stigmatized by divorce in society’s eyes: “The women all look at you like you’re bad and the men all hope you are/But if you go too far you’re gonna wear the scar of a woman rated X.”

“Miss Being Mrs.”: Lynn stopped making music for years when her husband Oliver “Mooney” Lynn’s health was declining. After his death in 1996, she slowly resumed her career, then in 2004, surprised much of the world by teaming with brash young songwriter, guitarist and producer Jack White of the White Stripes, a longtime admirer of her music. He produced her album “Van Lear Rose” that demonstrated she had plenty left to say in music. For all the songs she wrote or sang about the inequities, injustice and abuse that women endure on behalf of the institution of marriage, she stayed with her husband from the day she became his teenage bride, and in this song, reflected on what it meant to continue without him.

Elsewhere...

Highly-paid mouthpiece Sarah Palin explained to Breitbart.com why she and Fox News recently parted ways.

""I encourage others to step out in faith, jump out of the comfort zone, and broaden our reach as believers in American exceptionalism,"" she told the site. ""That means broadening our audience. I'm taking my own advice here as I free up opportunities to share more broadly the message of the beauty of freedom and the imperative of defending our republic and restoring this most exceptional nation. We just can't preach to the choir; the message of liberty and true hope must be understood by a larger audience.""

Meanwhile...

Like clockwork, The National Review chimed in with complaints about President Obama's description of Nazism.

President Obama issued a statement yesterday to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He noted that survivors who bore witness to ""the horrors of the cattle cars, ghettos, and concentration camps have witnessed humanity at its very worst and know too well the pain of losing loved ones to senseless violence."" [...] The idea that all violence is ""senseless"" violence is one that has taken deep root on the left; it’s also, unfortunately, one that poses a major impediment to understanding the world. Nazism may have been an ideology to which the United States was — and to which the president is — implacably opposed, but it is hardly ""senseless.""

And, in related news...

Idaho state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll (R) compared the fate of insurance companies under Obamacare to that of Jews under the Nazis.

""The insurance companies are creating their own tombs. Much like the Jews boarding the trains to concentration camps, private insurers are used by the feds to put the system in place because the federal government has no way to set up the exchange. Based on legislation and the general process that is written toward this legislation, the federal government will want nothing to do with private insurance companies. The feds will have a national system of health insurance and they will eliminate the insurance companies.""

His argument for redrawing the California map: The state is underrepresented in Washington. He’s looking to get an initiative on the California ballot.

He told TechCrunch: “It is about time California was properly represented with senators in Washington. Now our number of senators per person will be about average.”

California has a long history of secessionist fervor. Now Silicon Valley is coming up with its own version, fueled by growing anti-government sentiment.

In October at Y Combinator Startup School, one tech entrepreneur called for Silicon Valley to secede from the United States altogether.

Balaji Srinivasan, co-founder of San Francisco–based genetics company Counsyl, gave a talk to aspiring entrepreneurs about “Silicon Valley’s ultimate exit,” which outlined his vision of a tech world free of the constraints of government.

“We need to build opt-in society, outside the U.S., run by technology,” Srinivasan said.

This techno-utopian vision of a world insulated from big-government intrusion is not new to Silicon Valley, which has some deep libertarian roots.

Google CEO Larry Page, during his Google I/O keynote in May, spoke of his desire to set aside a place in the world where technological experimentation can be conducted unfettered by regulation. (“There are many exciting things you could do that are illegal or not allowed by regulation,” Page said.)

Investor Peter Thiel has championed the “seasteader” movement, which would create floating societies off the coast of California just beyond the clutches of the U.S. government.

And the Blueseed project wants to put foreign-born workers on a cruise ship off the coast of Northern California in international waters to evade immigration laws.

Draper recently said he would not participate in his investment firm’s next fund, so he has some time on his hands to devote to this new six-state project. He’s holding a news conference Monday.

Under his proposal, the northernmost new state would be called Jefferson and would encompass these counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama and Trinity.

Just south of that, Northern California state would encompass these counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba.

The state called Central California would be the only one to have no coastline, and it would encompass Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare and Tuolumne counties.

Silicon Valley state would encompass these counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.

Advertisement

The state named West California would encompass these counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.

And finally, South California state would encompass Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.

What do you think of Draper’s plan for California? Let us know in the comments.

Howard Dean (D) chastised Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during a CNN interview on Sunday, criticizing the senator's ideas for health care reform and dreading the idea of Cruz becoming anything more than a U.S. Senator.

""Ted Cruz may be a very good politician but he certainly doesn't know anything about health care,"" Dean said.

Dean criticized Cruz's plan for buying health insurance policies across state lines, saying he didn't want Texas' health care system infiltrating Vermont's universal health insurance policy.

“I don’t want the Texas insurance commissioner being the commissioner up here in Vermont,” Dean said. “So these are crazy ideas that are from the far right. He’s a slick spokesman and God help us if he ever does get to be anything more than the senator from Texas.”

Cruz appeared on CNN's State of the Union earlier on Sunday, saying he's ""not convinced"" that President Barack Obama's opposition to defunding the Affordable Care Act is set in stone.

""You're not convinced of that? This is what they consider his signature achievement of his administration so far,"" CNN's Candy Crowley responded.

Cruz admitted that the Senate's push to defund Obamacare doesn't yet have the support it needs, but the fight isn't over.

""We don't have the votes right now,"" Cruz said. ""This fight is likely to heat up in the month of September.""

Sierra Club official says requests have %27been fought at every turn%27

Critics say Christie protecting his image in advance of 2016 presidential run

Christie spokesman dismisses criticism

TRENTON, N.J. -- In advance of an expected 2016 presidential campaign, Chris Christie's administration is stepping up efforts to control the Republican governor's image at all costs — even skirting sunshine laws that permit public access to government records.

Getting the Christie administration to release its grip of records tracking use of federal recovery money for Superstorm Sandy has been particularly difficult for watchdog groups and media outlets, including the Asbury Park Press.

The Fair Share Housing Center recently received the first detailed information about housing recovery programs supported by federal grants — only after suing the administration for not complying with a public records request.

The Press has yet to receive Sandy recovery information the newspaper first sought four months ago. The Press asked for internal administration records from the contract bidding that resulted in Christie and his family starring in TV commercials for the $25 million ""Stronger Than the Storm"" tourism campaign.

In September, state officials told the Press a search had ""identified hundreds of potentially responsive documents"" and promised to begin sharing the information ""on a rolling basis"" starting in the second week of October.

For two months after the deadline, nothing was forthcoming — until some of the documents were released Friday, just hours after this story first appeared on the newspaper's APP.com website. State officials said more information would be available later this month.

""Withholding public records that, by law, have to be released is just government censorship by another name,"" said Hollis R. Towns, executive editor and vice president of news for the Press. ""When the state loses a public access battle in court, the taxpayers end up footing the legal bill for both sides, sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars. We hope that we do not have to sue, but we will if we have to protect the public's right to know under the law.""

Jeff Tittel, state director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said his pursuit of information from Christie's Department of Environmental Protection ""has been fought at every turn."" Tittel is a constant critic of the administration's environmental policies.

Tittel said Christie's national ambitions have led to tightened restrictions on the flow of government information to the public.

""Everything at this point is about Christie's image, and delaying and keeping records from you protects the brand,"" Tittel said. ""All administrations try to hide stuff, but the current administration has been the worst. They've taken it to a new art form because of Christie's pursuit of higher office. They are in lockdown mode.""

Christie's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, dismissed the criticism. He offered no explanation as to why responses to information requests have been delayed.

""The governor's press office is not involved in the OPRA process, which has always been a legal process in this administration and prior administrations,"" Drewniak said in an email.

Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, called the tactics ""standard operating procedure for the administration.""

""Is this a sign they are controlling his image? As opposed to the dozens of other signs over the past four years?"" said Murray, adding that Christie loyalists ""manage his image extremely well, and as of yet there has been no price to pay. Given the governor's personal popularity, the only thing that will get the public to reconsider their view of him is a smoking gun. And since this administration is airtight, there is no smoke.""

The 2002 Open Public Records Act lays out definitions of public records and also includes a uniform system for requesting records and responding to requests. The law says, in short, if the government holds a record, it must release it within seven business days or cite the specific law that exempts the record from public review. Criminal investigations, for example, are generally exempt. Budget documents are cited as being public."

Now, a university study has chronicled just exactly how much the former vice presidential candidate was making when she did each interview on the network.

The University of Minnesota's Eric Ostermeier tallied up all of the words Palin uttered during her three years on Fox News, and, knowing that she made $3 million over that time, made this conclusion:

A Smart Politics review of the more than 150 FOX broadcasts in which Sarah Palin appeared as a paid commentator from 2010 through 2012 finds that she spoke 189,221 words on air during this span, for an average pay rate of $15.85 per word.

That's what a lot of people would consider a decent sum for an hour's worth of work, let alone a 7-minute hit with Neil Cavuto. But it's definitely a lot less than what people like Bill O'Reilly, who pulls down a purported $20 million a year, take home per word.

Palin's most frequent interviewers were Sean Hannity --perhaps the network's most hard-line Republican host -- and Greta Van Susteren, whose husband was an adviser to the former governor.

It may seem like a minor hiccup, or a symbolic failure. But it spells doom for the party’s near-term budget strategy and underscores just how bogus the party’s broader agenda really is and has been for the last four years.

But none of these are excuses for failure. Presidential leadership (or the lack of it) still makes an enormous difference.

What if I told you this big government giveaway would destroy years of hard-won fiscal responsibility, resulting in a ""lost decade for jobs"" as we fought two wars and expanded the government in unprecedented, unfunded ways? And after this $1.3 trillion boondoggle fueled skyrocketing inequality and blasted a gaping hole in the budget we would be left with a once-in-a-half-century financial crisis that would leave America borrowing more than a trillion dollars a year?

You might say, ""Boycott the Bush tax cuts!""

But Republicans would call you a crazy, un-American, ACORN-suckling, Sharia trial lawyer, communistic, socialistic, fascistic, Maoistic, son-of-a-Saul Alinsky. Who would turn down a tax break? That's our money, libtard. GIVE IT BACK.

But that's the magic of President Obama. He can turn Republicans against tax breaks or subsidies for the poor and the middle class, if they were ever for them in the first place."

Gov. Candidate Admits He Funded Mysterious Group Behind Mailers,"On Friday night Corey Stewart, one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia, admitted to a crowd of 50 Tea Party activists that he was not only “connected to” the mysterious Virginians for Limited Government (VLG) group that has paid for attack mailers on five of his opponents; he’s also provided funding for the group.

Larry Nordvig, the Executive Director of the Richmond Virginia Tea Party who attended the Friday meeting, told Breitbart News on Monday that Stewart admitted his connection to VLG during a public question and answer period. Holding two of the VLG funded attack mailers in his hand, Nordvig described this back and forth he had with Stewart:

Nordvig Question: “Do you agree with these ads and did you have any connection to them whatsoever for the record?”

Corey Stewart Answer: “Am I connected? Yes. I have donated money to that organization.”

Nordvig Question. “At least a couple of these candidates fought against these budget increases, specifically Steve Martin…The information on the flyer is not correct so this information is misleading. Will you do the right thing and publicly condemn these ads as false?”

Corey Stewart Answer: “No, I’m not going to do it. I play hardball. This is politics.”

Sue Sadler, who is with a concerned citizens group in James City County and was present at Friday’s event, told Breitbart News on Monday that “Nordvig’s account is absolutely correct.”

Carolyn Worssam, a member of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News on Monday “that sure is an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey Stewart.”

A third source, who is one of the 13,000 delegates to the convention that will select the Republican Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor in Richmond on Saturday and was present at the Friday event, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s an accurate and balanced description” of the exchange between Nordvig and Stewart.

A fourth source, who was also at the meeting on Friday, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s completely accurate.”

The meeting was held at Mimi’s Cafe in Henrico, Virginia, near Richmond, and was moderated by Carol Stopps, a supporter of Mr. Stewart. Ms. Stopps told Breitbart News on Tuesday: “That was an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey. Corey did not deny he knows the organization and contributed to the organization. In my opinion this is typical campaign material and there were no misstatements in the mailers.”

Stewart’s admission could be a violation of Virginia election law, which requires that independent expenditure political action committees not coordinate their activities with the campaigns of any candidates. It is unclear how much Stewart has contributed to VLG, since it has failed to file its Statement of Organization with the Virginia State Board of Elections.

The exact organizational structure of VLG remains unclear. On Monday the group changed its “about us” description on its website to say that it is a 501(c)4 tax exempt non profit corporation.

A search of Guidestar, the online source that provides information about non profit corporations that have received 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 tax-exempt status from the IRS shows no entry for “Virginians for Limited Government.” By law, 501(c)4 organizations are prohibited from “primarily” engaging in political communications.

On Tuesday, Corey Stewart emailed this statement to Breitbart News: “Over the course of my life, I have supported and recommended several conservative organizations including the Family Foundation, Gun Owners of America, National Right to Work, Campaign for Liberty and Virginians for Limited Government to various people.”

Stewart emphasized that neither he nor his campaign “had any coordination” with Virginians for Limited Government. “I am proud to support these like-minded organizations over the course of my political career,” his email statement continued. “What these groups do, I have no control over. Neither myself or my campaign have had any coordination with this group.”

Chen']","Weiner’s Record in House: Intensity, Publicity and Limited Results","A few minutes later, Mr. Schwartz called back to say that his motivation for the large donations in 2007 and 2008 was to repay what he called a personal debt to Mr. Weiner’s father.

Single-Payer Hero

To his detractors, Mr. Weiner’s showy style was not just annoying. It revealed a willingness to risk upsetting a delicate consensus to elevate his own profile.

In July 2010, members of the New York City delegation were working quietly to line up some Republican support for a bill to pay for the treatment of Sept. 11 rescue workers. In a moment that became famous on cable TV, Mr. Weiner blew up at Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, on the floor over Republican opposition to the bill, though other Democrats saw Mr. King as still on their team.

Mr. King said the explosion antagonized other Republicans, impeding the bill. “That was really his first and last venture into it,” he said. “He really never seemed to comprehend the nuances and complexities of it.”

Mr. Weiner called it a moment of honest anger, and said there was “resentment,” among colleagues who “worked much harder and longer on it than I did,” that this “became a kind of definitional turning point in that debate.”

But it was on health care, in 2009, that Mr. Weiner first, and most indelibly, broke through as a camera-ready, forceful hero to liberals. He became the de facto champion of a single-payer system, attacking Republicans and criticizing Mr. Obama’s compromise strategy. He prided himself on his relentlessness.

“If there was not someone out there doing what I was doing, someone who was fighting every day for the voice of that left contingent, you’d have to create one — or two, or three, or four,” he said."

Sarah Palin called on Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace to release the names of the “top Republicans” that sent him opposition research on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to “hammer” Cruz before his appearance on the program to discuss defunding Obamacare.

“Keep it TRULY fair & balanced,” Palin tweeted. “Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.”

@FoxNewsSunday Keep it TRULY fair & balanced. Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources. — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) September 22, 2013

On Sunday, Wallace said that establishment Republicans are so worked up that Cruz is leading the defund Obamacare fight that he immediately got unsolicited questions and research on Cruz from “top Republicans” before Cruz’s appearance.

In an appearance on Washington D.C.’s Fox 5 to preview his Sunday show, Wallace said, “I will tell you I have never in my time in Washington seen a party so upset with one of its own members.”

In an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News on Saturday, Palin urged Cruz to stay strong in the face of the inevitable backlash from fellow Republicans and suggested they compare “shiv marks” the next time they meet:

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.”

Marco Rubio (R-FL) disparaged American workers during an interview with Ryan Lizza, a partial transcript of the interview the New Yorker reporter released Monday afternoon shows.

Originally, it appeared as though only one anonymous Rubio “aide” disparaged American workers and only did so in the context of speaking about low-skilled jobs in the U.S. However, the Lizza interview transcript shows two aides referenced low-skilled and high-skilled American workers.

Lizza asked the two staffers to respond to this statement: “Well their argument is, what, that they have American workers for these jobs, they don’t need this program.”

The thus-far unidentified “Rubio Aide 1” said that some workers either can’t or won’t make it in the work force anyway:

Yeah. I mean one of the problems you have with this, “Oh, there’s American workers who are unemployed.” There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it. There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you obviously can’t discuss that publicly because–

At that point, “Rubio Aide 2” interjected, “But the same is true for high-skilled workers.”

“Aide 1” then said, “Yes, and the same is true across every sector, in government, in everything.”

Lizza’s story had originally not specified that two Rubio aides made the argument, leaving a little room for Rubio’s staff to try to discredit the reporting.

As excerpted by Politico’s Mike Allen Sunday morning, Lizza’s story reported the exchange as follows:

Rubio sided with the Chamber against the construction workers. “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it,” a Rubio aide told me. “There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you can’t obviously discuss that publicly.” In the end, the wage issue was settled to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s satisfaction, and the Building and Construction Trades union won a cap on the number of visas for foreign construction workers.

After National Review editor Rich Lowry picked up on how Rubio’s anonymous “aide” disparaged American workers, and published a piece on it, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tried to argue Lizza’s reporting was inaccurate.

“We strongly objected to the magazine including that background quote in the piece because it’s not what Sen. Rubio believes or has ever argued,” Conant told Lowry. “In truth, Sen. Rubio has always said the reason we need a robust temporary worker program is to create legal avenues for US businesses to meet labor needs when not enough Americans apply for jobs… Sen. Rubio believes that American workers can compete against anyone in the world.”

Sen. Rubio himself gave a quote to The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis publicly rejecting the comments. “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program,” Rubio told Lewis. “It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”

The transcript Lizza released casts doubt on whether the quote was simply “a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program.” Rather, it indicates the quotes were two Rubio staffers making the argument on their own, not in an abstract context. The transcript also shows that the two Rubio aides were talking about high-skilled and low-skilled American workers, not just those who would be part of a guest worker program.

After Lewis’s piece was published, Breitbart News reported that several immigration organization leaders and hill staffers have called on Sen. Rubio to publicly identify the aide who made those comments. NumbersUSA director of government relations Rosemary Jenks and Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, as well as various hill staffers, called on Rubio to publicly identify the aide and terminate him or her.

On Twitter, National Review‘s Lowry asked Lizza, “i have no reason to doubt you but can you share any more of the context of that quote? rubio staff pushing bk hard.” He added that Rubio’s office’s pushback included Conant saying “the aide was describing some industries’ response to unions’ opposition to temp workers.”

When Lizza sent out the partial transcript of the interview, Lowry responded, “great, thank you. looks like you were exactly right unless im missing something.”"

Tom Coburn and Jim Inhofe. She worked for Republican Gov. Mary Fallin. She worked for Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) last Senate campaign.

But ever since the tea party gained a dominant hold on the GOP agenda, Caliendo has taken both her vote and her small campaign contributions to the Democrats.

""They've gone so hard right,"" Caliendo, who calls herself a Colin Powell Republican, said. ""They have no common sense left.""

In 2012, Caliendo began making small donations to the reelection campaign of President Barack Obama. After the election, she gave to the chief political arm of congressional Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She has now made more than 13 contributions totaling $376.

In the first 10 months of 2013, the DCCC dominated its Republican counterpart in fundraising. It did so in no small part by attracting new donors like Caliendo, frustrated with the Republican-led House of Representatives.

""The tea party, more than anything, and their growing influence in Congress,"" said Mike Snider, who works on a Navy base in southern Maryland, when asked why he has made at least 17 contributions to the DCCC totaling $513 this year.

That may not seem like much when the most expensive 2014 House race has already topped $9 million in fundraising. But Democrats have been remarkably successful at tapping huge numbers of small donors like Snider and Caliendo, who give over and over. That success may translate beyond money in next year's elections. As Caliendo noted, ""Smaller donors are where the votes are at.""

More than 15 percent of the DCCC's $65.2 million in fundraising through October -- or $10.1 million -- came from more than 11,700 donors who did not make a contribution in the 2012 election cycle, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post.

The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $5.7 million from more than 4,200 donors who did not give in 2012. Through October, the NRCC had raised $52.4 million.

More than half of the new DCCC donors made more than one contribution. Nearly 700 individuals made 10 or more donations. These repeat donors accounted for $3.4 million of the new donor money raised by the committee. That may only be one-third of the total raised from new donors, but these repeat donors are far more likely to keep giving through Election Day 2014.

While the DCCC is successfully getting new donors to pony up multiple times, the NRCC is struggling. Just 28 percent of new NRCC donors made more than one contribution. Only 19 individual donors made more than 10 contributions.

The NRCC, heavily reliant on big donors, received more than half of its new money from donors giving $10,000 or more. Donors giving $1,000 or more accounted for 90 percent of all new contributions to the Republican committee.

The NRCC did not respond to a request for comment.

Big donors also played a huge role for the DCCC, with 47 percent of its new donor funds coming from those giving $10,000 or more. Two-thirds of the new money came from donors making a contribution of $1,000 or more.

But donors giving less than $1,000 accounted for one-third of the new DCCC money. The NRCC raised 10 percent from that category of donors. These donors do not include those giving less than $200, the threshold for public disclosure of a donor's name and amount they gave.

Controversy has aided the Democrats' fundraising successes. The committee's two best fundraising months, among both overall and new donors, came during the 16-day government shutdown in October and the political standoff that led up to it.

""Mainly my giving works when [Republicans have] done something really stupid, made a really stupid remark, and the [DCCC] comes out with their thing saying can you give $5,"" Caliendo explained. ""In one week I think I gave like $250 because I was so mad. That was leading into the shutdown.""

The elevation of Democrats' enemies, like the austerity-promoting House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), also helped rake in money. The DCCC's third-best fundraising month came in March, after the House passed Ryan's budget, which would have cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.

“Every time House Republicans denigrate women, double down on millionaires over the middle class or push their agenda to hurt seniors, our grassroots supporters step up -- and, needless to say, it’s happened a lot this year,"" DCCC digital director Brandon English said.

These strategies are at the heart of the DCCC's successful digital fundraising program. The committee has carefully tailored its appeals to Democratic partisans, angry at the tea party and the Koch brothers. This is done through a stream of emails to the DCCC's massive list of supporters.

""Once you've given once, if you give them your email, you get lots of emails,"" Snider said.

Some help the DCCC raise more money.

Randall Redmon, a bagger and janitor at a Kroger supermarket in Versailles, Ky., has made more than 56 contributions totaling $370. He posts every fundraising email he gets from the DCCC to Facebook and Twitter to try to help raise more money than he can give himself.

""If they say that Republicans are trying to steal something or take away something, I'm trying to get as many people as I can to help stop them,"" Redmon said. ""That's what I do. I spread the word.""

Supporters can set up a recurring donation to keep their support flowing, as Caliendo, Snider and Redmon, among many others, have done.

The DCCC also raises money through an online store, a tactic pioneered by the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.

""Sometimes I buy stuff from their store and that's like a contribution, too,"" Redmon said. ""Sweaters and stuff, and shirts.""

These new Democratic donors will likely continue to pile on contributions whenever the DCCC amplifies the actions of House Republicans. But there are always some important factors that could lead some to cut off their giving.

""It depends on how things are going with polls and my finances and my job,"" Snider said.

Aaron Bycoffe contributed reporting. This story has been updated to include comment from the DCCC."

Before Joining The Post', 'She Was A Political Columnist', 'Food Writer At The Baltimore Sun', 'She Has Also Worked For The Associated Press', 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram', 'The Hartford Courant.']",Mansion spending records indicate improper billing by Virginia governor and his family,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, have used taxpayer money for a range of small personal items they should have paid for themselves under state policy, according to spending records.

The McDonnells have billed the state for body wash, sunscreen, dog vitamins and a digestive system “detox cleanse,” the records show. They also have used state employees to run personal errands for their adult children. In the middle of a workday, for example, a staffer retrieved Rachel McDonnell’s newly hemmed pants at a tailoring shop nine miles from the governor’s mansion. Another time, a state worker was dispatched to a dry cleaner 20 miles away to pick up a storage box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress.

About six months into the governor’s term, the official who oversees mansion spending told the McDonnells that they should not have charged taxpayers for a number of expenses, including deodorant, shoe repairs and dry-cleaning their children’s clothing. The official asked the McDonnells to pay the state back more than $300, which they did, and also gave them a refresher on what the state will and won’t provide for occupants of the governor’s mansion.

But since that time, state records show that the McDonnells have continued to let taxpayers pick up the tab for numerous personal items, including vitamins, nasal spray and sleep-inducing elixirs.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Washington Post sought records of personal expenses covered by the state over the couple’s 31 / 2 years in the mansion. The full cost of those items is unknown because the state released only 16 sales receipts, most of them from 2011. State records show that there were many more personal shopping trips — nine others in January 2011 alone, including two to Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up “college stuff” for the McDonnells’ children.

The McDonnells repaid the state for at least some personal items purchased on those occasions. But without receipts, it is impossible to know whether they fully reimbursed taxpayers. The few receipts that were released show only partial repayment.

McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin declined to say why other receipts were not released.

Based on the disclosed records, the amount of personal expenses the McDonnells billed to the state is small — less than $600, including the $300 they repaid. But the disclosure comes at time when spending at Virginia’s Executive Mansion is already under scrutiny.

The FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the $15,000 catering tab at Cailin McDonnell’s mansion wedding in June 2011 that was paid by a McDonnell campaign donor. That same donor, Star Scientific chief executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also lent the governor his Ferrari, lakeside vacation home and private jet. A Richmond prosecutor also is investigating whether the governor violated state gift disclosure laws.

Emerging as the former mansion chef faces charges of stealing food from the kitchen, the McDonnells’ expense records provide some insight into how the executive home has been managed. The chef has alleged that the McDonnells — already entitled to a free mansion, food, personal chef, maids and one of nation’s few state-funded butlers — have engaged in petty pilfering.

In court filings submitted as part of his defense, chef Todd Schneider has said that the McDonnells’ five children raided the mansion kitchen and liquor cabinet, taking large quantities of food and alcohol to their own homes or college dorm rooms. He also said that Maureen McDonnell had given away mansion pots and pans to her three daughters. McDonnell has declined to respond to those accusations, noting the ongoing criminal case against the chef.

Martin said the McDonnells have sought to properly distinguish personal expenses from state ones while living in the mansion, a 200-year-old Federal-style gem that is a public building and a private residence.

“Every Administration strives to balance private family life with the official state functions that are all occurring under the same roof, at the same time,” Martin said in an e-mail. “It is a balance and there is a constant effort to ensure that it is appropriately managed. The McDonnell Administration has adhered to precedent in reimbursing the state for items meant for personal use.”

In the McDonnell family’s first six months in the mansion, taxpayers paid for dry-cleaning the twin sons’ suits and shirts, repairing the first lady’s shoes and putting new shoulder pads into an item of her clothing. The McDonnells billed their energy drinks, body wash, deodorant and breath-freshening strips to the state as well.

Virginians paid for a $62 laminated banner to celebrate the twins’ high school graduation, with a state employee picking up the sign at the print shop and paying for it with the mansion credit card. When Ginger, the sheltie/terrier mix billed as “Virginia’s first dog,” needed vitamins, the McDonnells passed the $9.49 expense to taxpayers.

Eventually, an official who reviews mansion spending kicked those expenses back and asked the McDonnells to reimburse the commonwealth $317.27. The McDonnells paid the money back.

“These expenses are personal ones, that due to auditing and the direction of Dennis Johnson, Division Director of DSAS [Division of Selected Agency Support Services], cannot be covered by the State or Mansion funds,” mansion director Sarah Scarbrough said in a note to the McDonnells in the fall of 2010.

The state will cover the cost of dry-cleaning for the governor and first lady, basic hygiene items, “including toilet paper, mouthwash, bar soap,” cleaning and laundry supplies, and food for family meals, state functions and events, Johnson said in the memo.

But it does not cover the cost of clothing alterations, dry-cleaning for other family members, deodorant or body wash, pet food or treats, or food for non-family meals or non-state functions, Johnson wrote.

The McDonnells directly pushed back on one front, insisting that the state continue to pay for their energy drinks. The governor’s chief of staff, Martin Kent, overruled Johnson to allow the drinks at state expense.

“While other governors and spouses may have had bacon and eggs, or cereal, or etc for breakfast, Governor McDonnell drinks Boost every morning, and the First Lady has a 5-Hour energy and/or a Boost,” Martin wrote. “That is their breakfast. And that is why those items are covered, just like breakfast is covered for EVERY Governor and First Lady.”

Like all new governors and their families, the McDonnells were told the expense rules at the outset of the administration but needed some time for them to sink in, Johnson said in an interview. Energy drinks aside, Johnson said that ever since he gave the McDonnells their refresher on what the state will and won’t pay for, their spending has been in line with state policy.

“Typically when an administration comes in, we do discuss things,” he said. “There are growing pains, and early on in the administration, there will be some things we have to review and discuss.”

But sales receipts released by the state indicate that energy drinks are not the only extra the governor and first lady have continued to get at state expense. They went on to bill taxpayers for myriad medicine-cabinet products, vitamins and the body wash that Johnson said shouldn’t be billed, records show.

Records also show that the McDonnells used state employees to run personal errands for their children — and directed the employees to use the mansion credit card to pay for their children’s personal items.

In some cases, personal items for the McDonnell children are the only products listed on mansion credit card receipts. In those instances, the errands do not appear to have been performed in conjunction with any official state business.

In July 2011, for example, a state employee picked up Rachel McDonnell’s hemmed pants at Lucy’s Divine Creations, located 20 minutes west of the mansion. And that November, a worker was dispatched to Handcraft Cleaners, 30 minutes away, to get a box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress. The $24 charge for the hemming and the $49.50 cost of the box went on the mansion credit card. The McDonnells later repaid the state for those personal expenses, but not for the use of employee time.

Martin said that Maureen McDonnell would have run those errands herself, but because she is the first lady, she must always travel with a security detail.

“First Ladies have Executive Police Protection,” Martin wrote. “They cannot just jump in their own car and run errands. Therefore the reimbursement process exists to allow First Families to reimburse for personal items that may have been picked up by staff.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

* Obama opponents target Sebelius solicitations for group

* Approached H&R Block and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

* Health secretary: fundraising effort legal and appropriate

* Probes could discourage donations to Enroll America

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - With the White House already reeling from three major controversies, some Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on what they perceive is another possible scandal tied to President Barack Obama's landmark health reform law just as it nears implementation.

On top of the troubles the administration is facing over its handling of the attack on the Benghazi mission, the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups, and the Justice Department's seizure of Associated Press phone records, Republicans hope to target Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

They are questioning her soliciting of funds on behalf of a non-profit group, called Enroll America, from two private entities, a practice which if not unprecedented is at the very least unusual. Federal law bars officials from soliciting any organization or individual with whom they do business or regulate.

Enroll America is run by the president's former campaign backers to do something Congress refused to fund: sell ""Obamacare"" to the public.

An HHS statement last week said that since March Sebelius solicited financial donations for Enroll America from H&R Block Inc, the tax preparation company, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic entity devoted to public health issues. Asked Monday for a list of all solicitations before or after March, an HHS spokesman referred Reuters to the department's original statement.

Neither H&R Block nor the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are regulated by HHS, the department's spokesman said, so there was nothing improper or illegal about soliciting them.

Enroll America is intended to serve as the private sector flagship for a massive public outreach campaign intended to get millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for subsidized insurance coverage through new online marketplaces, or exchanges, that will begin open enrollment on Oct. 1.

NO COMMITMENT

H&R Block said it has made no commitment to Enroll America. ""We received a phone call from the Secretary during which the Secretary discussed supporting Enroll America,"" the company said in a statement. ""While we took her suggestion under consideration, we have made no commitment,"" it said.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a statement that it had ""recently approved new funding"" for Enroll America, bringing its total contributions to the group to nearly $14 million since 2010. It did not say how much of that, if any, came in response to Sebelius' solicitation.

It's the second controversy over the novel method used by the Obama administration to promote its agenda: using campaign-style organizations staffed with loyalists and former campaign or White House aides to mobilize grassroots support for government policies. The first involved Organizing for Action, an independent non-profit group seeking to harness both the energy and personnel from Obama's re-election campaign in support of the president's legislative agenda.

The Enroll America issue is complicated by the fact that Republicans in Congress have succeeded in blocking proposed government spending that otherwise could have been used to achieve the ends pursued by the independent group.

That has given lawmakers, such as Republican U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, an opening to allege a violation of the federal ""anti-deficiency"" act, which bars agencies from accepting ""voluntary"" services except when authorized by law.

In defense of the help the department is getting from Enroll America, an HHS spokesman said it is permitted by a section of the Public Health Service Act that allows the secretary to encourage support for new and innovative health programs.

Some conservative legal experts say finding a clear-cut violation of the law is a long shot. ""I would be skeptical of the claim that it's illegal, unless someone made a really compelling case. However, the appearance is such that it at least raises questions,"" said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western University who opposes healthcare reform.

But legal issues may be the least of the concerns for supporters of the healthcare law.

They worry that a political storm over Obamacare, with congressional hearings likely, could discourage private donors to Enroll America and jeopardize the administration's ability to find the funds needed to reach a public that is already largely unaware of the healthcare reforms.

One of the biggest concerns is that younger, healthier people will not sign up for health plans on the exchanges, driving the costs up for coverage of the people who do sign up.

""The danger"" to the health program, said former Obama healthcare adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle, ""is that people don't come and enroll and get insured. That leaves the health plans in the exchanges trying to cover people without any young, healthy people, and it drives the price up.""

REPUBLICANS PROMISE PROBES

Republicans certainly see an opportunity.

""Our guys on the Hill think this is the fourth scandal,"" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. ""It fits into that narrative Republicans are building not only about incompetence in the executive branch but also dishonesty.""

""This is a good issue for Republicans,"" Mackowiak added. ""We want to maximize it.""

The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has launched an investigation into the fundraising to determine whether it involved regulated companies and has asked nearly a dozen healthcare firms including major insurers such as Aetna Inc, a member of Enroll America's advisory council, to say whether they have received solicitations.

Republicans in the House and Senate have also called on the non-partisan Government Accountability Office to investigate.

""People are watching it very closely. We're hearing about it from constituents, people who are incredibly concerned,"" said Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn.

Enroll America was launched in September 2011 in part by leaders of Families USA, a key backer of the healthcare reform effort as it moved through Congress in 2009 and 2010. It is led by Anne Filipic, who worked on public engagement projects in the Obama White House. It's managing director, Chris Wyant, directed Obama's eastern Ohio field operation during the 2012 election campaign.

Last night, though, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer took the attacks a step further by taking Ailes completely out of context. This allowed 9/11 Truther and cop killer-defender Van Jones to claim Ailes had made a “racial charge” against Obama:

Van Jones being Van Jones is not news.

But for Wolf Blitzer to take Ailes completely out of context and stand idly by as Jones dishonestly smears Ailes for making a “racial charge” only serves to further explain why this network is swirling the drain. In the age of the Internet, the media can no longer get away with this kind of stuff. Once the truth gets out, the damage to your brand’s credibility is forever.

The background and the truth:

Yesterday, Vanity Fair published an exclusive excerpt from an upcoming Ailes biography. Here’s the full context of the quote Blitzer wasn’t interested in sharing with his audience. I’ve bolded the portion not shared with CNN viewers:

‘Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won’t report that.’ He noticed my arched eyebrows and added, ‘I didn’t come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.’

Here’s what Obama told Barbara Walters in December of 2011:

BARBARA WALTERS: Okay. What’s the trait you most deplore in yourself and the trait you most deplore in others?

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Laziness.

WALTERS: You’re lazy?

OBAMA: You know, it’s interesting. There is a deep down, underneath all the work I do, I think there’s a laziness in me. I mean, it’s, it’s probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii, and it’s sunny outside and sitting on the beach.

This morning, CNN’s Soledad O’Brien got caught on-the-air by her own panel doing the same thing.

Anyone sensing a pattern here? Horrible journalism? Agenda? My vote goes to “both.”

It’s also worth mentioning that those who hear the word “lazy” and immediately think of black people are the ones who might want to do some soul-searching.

ADDED: CNN Chief, Jeff Zucker (pictured), needs to have a sitdown with Blitzer to ensure the record is corrected on-the-air today. He might also want to throw in an apology

For nearly two decades, even Republicans supported the Violence Against Women Act, because what kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being would publicly take issue with that?

Well, on Tuesday, when the Senate voted, again, to re-authorize the VAWA, 22 senators—all Republicans, all men—raised their hands to proudly proclaim, ""I am that kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being!""

Let's take a look at some of these brave defenders of the sacred right to rape and beat the shit out of women:

There's Marco Rubio of Florida, the savior du jour of the Republican Party. He's the guy Republicans think will make them seem reasonable and not at all the party of old white guys because, hey, his parents are from Cuba and he speaks Spanish. Which is why, of course, he should have even greater sympathy for immigrants, and yet, for some reason, he has a real problem with VAWA protecting immigrants. Huh. Go figure.

There's Dr. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who never shies away from invoking his medical expertise to justify, say, opposing reproductive health care for women. See, when he supports laws to strip women of their rights, it's because he's a doctor, and he's simply acting out of concern for women. As a doctor. Funny that in all his years of practice, he apparently never encountered a victim of rape or domestic violence. Hell of a ""doctor,"" that guy.

There's Rand Paul of Kentucky, who thinks the government doesn't have the right to do a single thing except crawl up inside your vagina and regulate the hell out of it. Oh, and there was that one time in college when he kidnapped a woman—you know, as a joke. But hey, he probably has a really good reason for standing up for the rights of woman-beaters. Besides self-interest.

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the very model of chivalry, so it's hard to understand his opposition. After all, he so generously offered to mansplain how math and numbers and budgets work to his fellow Wisconsinite, Tammy Baldwin, when she was elected to the Senate in 2012. Guess he's fickle that way. He'll help the girls with their math homework, but if they get beaten, they're on their own.

James Inhofe of Oklahoma doesn't want to lift a finger to combat violence against women, but that's probably because he knows it isn't a real problem. Just like he knows climate change isn't a real problem. Just like he knows properly training and protecting women who are already in combat in the military isn't a real problem. In fact, the only real problem that concerns Inhofe is how to stop The Gays from taking over the world with their big gay agenda.

You can go below the fold for the full list of Republicans who don't give a damn about women. And be sure to sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

The (Louisville, Ky.) Courier-Journal

Several sources have accused Paul of plagiarism in speeches%2C an article and one of his books

Paul has accepted responsibility for material included in his speeches by his staff and advisers

Paul first said he was a victim of %22haters%2C but now says he was sloppy

WASHINGTON — After facing accusations of plagiarism in speeches, an article and one of his books, Sen. Rand Paul said Tuesday through a spokesman that he made mistakes in crediting sources and has set up a new system for vetting his work.

The Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 presidential contender has been buffeted since last week by a steady stream of allegations that he copied the works of others.

On Tuesday, Buzzfeed said it uncovered a new passage in Paul's book, ""Government Bullies,"" that is nearly identical to a portion of a Forbes magazine article. Buzzfeed also reported earlier that three paragraphs Paul wrote in an op-ed in September for The Washington Times were nearly identical to a piece in The Week magazine.

Although he previously had said he was being targeted, Paul told CNN on Tuesday that he accepted responsibility.

""Ultimately, I'm the boss, and things go out under my name, so it is my fault,"" he said. ""I never had intentionally presented anyone's ideas as my own.""

Paul spokesman Doug Stafford said the office intends to be more careful.

""In the thousands of speeches and op-eds Sen. Paul has produced, he has always presented his own ideas, opinions and conclusions,"" Stafford said in a statement. ""Sen. Paul also relies on a large number of staff and advisers to provide supporting facts and anecdotes — some of which were not clearly sourced or vetted properly.""

Stafford said footnotes on sources ""were not always used.""

""Going forward, footnotes will be available on request,"" he said. ""There have also been occasions where quotations or typesetting indentations have been left out through errors in our approval process. From here forward, quoting, footnoting and citing will be more complete.""

Stafford added: ""Adherence to a new approval process implemented by Sen. Paul will ensure proper citation and accountability in all collaborative works.""

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Politico and Buzzfeed all have found cases in which Paul used wording similar or identical to other sources without making it clear that the work was not his.

Maddow first found that Paul's speech recounting the plot line from the film ""Gattaca"" used wording similar to a Wikipedia entry.

Buzzfeed reported that a speech the senator gave in June 2012 contained similar language from a Wikipedia entry on the film ""Stand and Deliver.""

Paul's response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address earlier this year used words identical to those in an Associated Press report from 2011, Politico reported.

The Kentuckian also used nearly identical phrases from a Focus on the Family magazine article in part of a speech he gave earlier this year at Howard University, Politico found.

Buzzfeed reported Saturday that ""Government Bullies"" contained three pages that borrowed heavily from a 2003 Heritage Foundation study, and a passage from a Cato Institute report.

Paul first said he was a victim of ""haters."" But on Sunday, he said he was sloppy. ""The footnote police have really been dogging me for the last week,"" Paul said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I will admit that. And I will admit, sometimes we haven't footnoted things properly.""

He also said that, among ""thousands of things I've written, yeah, there are times when they have been sloppy or not correct or we've made an error.""

But Paul distinguished between the kind of plagiarism that results in students getting ""F's"" on papers or being kicked out of school and giving a speech.

""I think the spoken word shouldn't be held to the same sort of standard that you have if you're giving a scientific paper. I've written scientific papers. I know how to footnote things,"" he said.

""I take it as an insult, and I will not lie down and say people can call me dishonest, misleading or misrepresenting,"" Paul said on ABC. ""I have never intentionally done so.""

Paul also suggested he would have a remedy if this was an earlier century.

""If dueling were legal in Kentucky, if they keep it up, you know, it would be a duel challenge,"" the senator said. ""But I can't do that, because I can't hold office in Kentucky then.""

Jonathan Bailey, founder of the blog plagiarismtoday.com, said the instances uncovered in Paul's book, speeches and an article fit the definition of plagiarism.

""This is dealing with different types of work, and it definitely indicates a much broader problem,"" he said.

Bailey added that the plagiarism would be treated seriously in schools: ""Even in quantities less than this, it can result in disciplinary action against a student.""

Noting that Paul is a former medical school student, Bailey said ""I'm sure he would be aware that in an academic environment, this would not be acceptable."""

A sect of the Republican Party has again flexed its political muscle and effectively shut down the government because it doesn’t feel it necessary for those without healthcare insurance now to be able to obtain it.

This group has been unwilling to work with President Obama since he has been in office — if he says yes, they vote no; if he says up, they vote down. These lawmakers’ concern has never been about what’s right for the nation, but only about how to thwart the president whenever possible.

Once again, the lesson is that politics and ignorance don’t mix. Perhaps this time the voters are paying attention.

Leave it to the Republicans to shut down government because they don’t think millions of uninsured people should be covered by health insurance. We pride ourselves on being the best country in the world. Surely the “best country in the world” can provide health insurance to its people.

Maybe members of Congress should take a reduction in their salaries to help everyone out. They should have to pay some penalty for this blackmail.

I hope Obama stands strong on this. No party should be able to hold the country hostage. I hope the Republicans pay dearly for this come election time.

Hundreds of thousands of federal government employees are now furloughed as a result of the government shutdown facilitated by the Republican-controlled House. As a result, these workers and their families will be facing tough financial choices.

In 2011, the average net worth of a GOP House member was nearly $8 million. Republicans in the House have the resources to withstand any government shutdown. The same cannot be said of other government employees.

I’ve got a great idea to ameliorate this suffering: Let the Republicans pay the wages of all furloughed workers.

Congress holds the purse strings. Whether the president signs a budget or vetoes it is his choice. But the president doesn’t “make” the laws; Congress does.

In 2012, the nation reelected Obama, kept the Senate in the hands of the Democrats and left the House firmly in the hands of Republicans. I think what the nation was saying to the leaders is simple: Here’s the hand you’ve been dealt, now do the best you can and compromise.

Back when this happened under Bill Clinton, he vetoed what Congress had sent him. But thanks to the media, voters blamed Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, even though they did their job and gave the president a budget.

There’s a reason the Constitution doesn’t allow one person to decide what budget the country should live on.

Whatever happens, the Affordable Care Act will be implemented. The Democratic-controlled Senate and the president are clearly not going to yield on this issue.

Funding any law is implicit in its passage. Republican attempts to defund Obamacare, delay it for a year or make it ineffective are pathetic attempts to reverse a law of the land. Tying their objections on this law to the budget or the debt ceiling is extremely irresponsible and completely indefensible.

Shame on these poor examples of lawmakers. Maybe we should think about removing from office those who have no qualms about bringing down our government and our entire economy just to get their way.

Conservative House Republicans have managed to shut down much of our government because they disagree with the provisions of a law passed by both houses of Congress, signed by the president and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

So they had a bunch of pow-pows where they decided that, well, the problem wasn't in their, but in how theythose policies.

Or something silly like that.

But let's see how their marketing efforts are coming along. Remember, Republicans lost the woman vote 55-44 in 2012. And to make matters worse, women made up 53 percent of all voters, far outperforming their male counterparts. So if you've got a double-digit deficit against the largest single voting group, you should do something about it, right?

Well, protecting abusers and rapists wasn't the answer, but that's what the majority of the GOP caucus tried to do today when voting on the Violence Against Women Act.

As Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a rare Republican woman, said in a statement after the vote:



Democrats wanted a hammer to beat over the heads of Republicans and far too many misguided Republicans provided them with that hammer. This is exactly why hardworking Americans are fed up with Congress.

Actually, Democrats wanted a sensible and once-uncontroversial piece of legislation to pass. It was Republicans who took that hammer and beat themselves in the face with it.

Then there's brown Americans, many of whom continue fighting for the same access to the voting booth enjoyed by their whiter counterparts. Yet just months removed from an election in which non-white voters had to wait hours to vote, fight efforts to purge them from voter rolls, and fight efforts to require overly restrictive voter ID laws specifically designed to disenfranchise them, you had a conservative SUPREME COURT JUSTICE (Scalia) say that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires federal pre-clearance of changes in voting laws in parts of the country with a history of racial disenfranchisement, enables the



perpetuation of racial entitlement.

The old coot doesn't even bother hiding his bigotry. Yet despite howls of protest from the Left, there was only crickets from the Right (and the occasional defense here and there). Given the GOP's inability to win any meaningful level of support from African American, Latinos, and Asians, you'd think they'd begin trying to address those deficiencies. But nope. Not interested.

And so concludes another day in the GOP's ongoing campaign to rebrand itself, which looks no different from the version of the GOP already relegated to the fringe of mainstream American opinion.

So it's sort of your job to uphold and enforce the law, even the laws you don't like, because that's part of the job. You know what isn't part of the job? Advising people to break the law you've sworn to uphold.

While that might seem obvious, apparently it isn't so obvious to a certain attorney general and wannabe governor whose name is Ken Cuccinelli. (As is so often necessary when discussing Republicans, please note this is not from The Onion.)



Cuccinelli recounted an exchange with his own bishop in which he counseled the cleric to embrace civil disobedience: “My local bishop said, ‘Well, you know I told a group I’m ready to go to jail.’ And I said, ‘Bishop, don’t take this personally: You need to go to jail.’”

“You know, Abraham Lincoln has many good quotes, but one of them is ‘the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it vigorously.’ And here we’re going to have an example of what tyranny means when it’s played to its logical conclusion,” Cuccinelli said. “Because forcing business owners and businesses to do this is not consistent with our history of preserving religious liberty, one of the most important protections we have in this country.”

Lest you think Cuccinelli and his bishop were casually discussing breaking the law in a righteous battle for some greater good, you can stop that right now. Because the greater good for which these two fine Catholics think law-breaking is worthwhile is, of course, the fight to stop women from having access to basic health care because Abraham Lincoln had some good quotes about stuff and also religious liberty:If you're scratching your head trying to figure out how encouraging civil disobedience is actually a form of ""vigorously"" enforcing the law, don't bother. It doesn't make sense, and it isn't supposed to. We're talking about Republicans, after all, and they never let a little thing, like not making a goddamned bit of sense, stop them.

For almost a year, wingnuts and Catholic bishops (and yes, in the Venn diagram, that's basically just one big circle) have been whining and stamping their feet and reciting their favorite old timey quotes because it makes them super sad to think about women having basic health care. This has not actually persuaded anyone that women having health care is a bad thing. Quite the opposite, as demonstrated by about a bazillion polls on the issue. Not like that ever stops them.

So Cuccinelli, in his run for governor, is definitely doing his best to appeal to the wingnuttiest wingnuts in his base, and damnit, he'll even advise breaking the law—contrary to, you know, his current job description—to prove that he's just the guy for them.

You can listen to the audio here. You know, if you can stomach it."

At a press conference on Monday, President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism, and said, “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)

After answering questions Monday morning about two of the controversies that have undermined his administration, President Obama flew off to New York to raise money for the Democratic Party. There, before partisan donors, he reflected on his second term and said he will continue to reach out to Republicans. “I sure want to do some governing,” he explained.

Obama’s words suggest that he believes there is a way to compartmentalize the business of his second term: legislative and other business here, scandals over there. But things are too messy for that right now. A politician who has counted good luck as part of his skill set will need all the breaks he can muster to pull off that bit of political jujitsu.

Even in the best of times, Obama’s outreach to Republicans produced little in return — and these are no longer close to the best of times. The question is whether the barely civil relationship between the White House and the opposition party has been irreparably damaged. A related question is how much the controversies will weaken Obama’s standing with the public. Together, the answers will decide how effectively he can govern.

It is too early to draw any broad conclusions about the long-term damage to Obama’s presidency from the news that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups and that the Justice Department collected two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors. But in the moment, these controversies — along with the ongoing congressional investigation of the attacks in Benghazi, Libya — have created major challenges for the administration.

The president and his advisers have tried to insulate the White House from the actions of the IRS and the Justice Department, claiming ignorance. The IRS, officials argued Friday, is quasi-independent. It took the president three days to express his outrage at the agency’s actions. As for the Justice Department’s leak investigation, White House officials said Monday night that it was a department decision that was not forwarded to the president.

Those are temporary responses that probably will not be sufficient over time. The White House may have known nothing about either, but both are now the president’s problem. And both reflect questions about the administration that predate the revelations of the past few days.

The tea party movement has been a political nemesis for Obama since the first year of his presidency. The movement helped turn the battle over health care into one of the most divisive fights of his presidency. The political potency of the grass-roots activists who rallied behind tea party banners helped deliver the worst midterm-election defeat to a party holding the White House in 70 years.

The president and his advisers may not have known anything about IRS targeting of tea party groups for greater scrutiny, but the abuse of power confirmed complaints by conservatives and GOP lawmakers that the practice was taking place and impressions among conservatives that the administration is truly hostile to the tea party movement. Holding those responsible accountable will be only part of Obama’s challenge in responding.

Less is known about the Justice Department’s leak investigation. It was carried out by an administration that came into office talking about the importance of civil liberties, but whose record has been a disappointment to civil libertarians. No one can recall anything as far-reaching as what the Justice Department apparently did in secretly gathering information about the work of AP journalists.

Obama showed his greatest passion Monday when he denounced the GOP-led inquiry of the killing of four Americans in a terrorist attack in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. That partisan politics are involved in the congressional investigation is certainly the case. In addition to whatever enmity is felt toward the Obama administration over its handling of the aftermath, GOP leaders see former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton for what she is, which is a potentially formidable presidential candidate in 2016.

Obama argued that the current focus on administration talking points is a political sideshow. As others, including The Post’s Glenn Kessler, have noted, the multiple alterations in those talking points appeared to reflect an internal turf war between the State Department and the CIA. Obama argued that it was hardly a coverup.

Given the timing of the attack in Benghazi, which occurred in the heat of a presidential race, White House officials worked to keep the issue from becoming part of the campaign debate — and GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s maladroit handling of it at the start provided convenient cover for the White House. Obama’s campaign put Romney on the defensive, rather than the opposite, although the deaths of the four Americans — and the subsequent security lapses that were enumerated — were a major stain on the administration.

As questions were raised, White House officials avoided drawing conclusions about the origins of the attacks. Even as the head of the National Counterterrorism Center testified that what happened at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, the president continued to resist labeling it as such. For whatever reason, the administration’s semantic gamesmanship contributed to what the president now dismisses as a sideshow.

Obama is early into his second term, but it has not gone as planned. His gun-control initiative was blocked. Prospects for a grand bargain on the budget are problematic. Immigration reform is moving forward slowly in the Senate and faces uncertainty in the House, although administration officials remain optimistic that Congress eventually will approve a bill.

On Monday night in New York, the president said, “I’m going to do everything I can over the next 31 / 2 years to continue to reach out to my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle. . . . I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.”

He will have to spend some of that precious time trying to clean up unexpected messes that have landed on his desk. How seriously off track his administration is will depend in large part on how skillfully Obama handles what is before him."

She has since deleted the tweet, but the Sunlight Foundation’s “Politwoops,” which preserves tweets politicians have deleted, has the retweet on its website:

“RT @PaulSteel4: @nancymace we support you here in Florida. Nancy Mace vs Nancy boy graham.”

“Nancy boy” is a derogatory term used to describe “an effeminate or homosexual man.”

Mace is the first female graduate of The Citadel, where her father, Ret. Brigadier General J. Emory Mace, also attended. Mace’s father is the most decorated living graduate of The Citadel.

Graham, a member of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” that wrote the controversial immigration reform bill passed in late June, has long faced criticism for being less ideologically pure than his conservative constituents desire.

Carolina Conservatives United (CCU), a political group created by former GOProud co-founder and conservative activist Bruce Carroll, launched the website defeatlindseygraham.org shortly before Mace announced her candidacy. CCU’s site attacks Graham for what it deems are his “Beltway Republican” values.

“The truth is Lindsey Graham only panders with conservative language once every six years,” CCU states. “But every day he shows his true stripes by bashing small government conservative activists and ‘voting wrong’ on many of the most important issues before us.”

Former South Carolina Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint was asked on Tuesday’s “Daily Rundown” on MSNBC, “Do you think Lindsey Graham is a Jim DeMint conservative?”

DeMint simply answered, “I don’t think he would want to be called a Jim DeMint conservative. We’re all different. People will have to decide that for themselves.”

Host Chuck Todd then asked, “Is it fair to call him a conservative?”

DeMint replied: “Lindsey can tell you what he is himself. I’m not speaking for him.”"

Steve King (R-Iowa) in 2012 that he was a huge fan, and now it turns out that the two share a knack for drawing controversial comparisons when it comes to immigration policy.

Cuccinelli made his strange remark during a radio interview in 2012. Speaking on the conservative radio show ""The Morning Majority,"" the attorney general launched into a critique of Washington, D.C.'s pest control policies, which he claimed protected rats from being killed.

""They have to relocate the rats. And, not only that, that’s actually not the worst part, they cannot break up the families of the rats!"" Cuccinelli said, incorrectly suggesting that the District’s 2010 Wildlife Protection Act forced pest control specialists to dump them across the river in Virginia.

Cuccinelli then made his comparison.

""So, anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy,"" he said. ""You can't break up rat families. Or raccoons, and all the rest, and you can't even kill 'em. It's unbelievable.""

It's unclear what Cuccinelli meant by that -- perhaps that he believes the nation's immigration policy is better because it allows for immigrant families to be broken up -- but the comments come to light as the gubernatorial candidate attempts to finesse his position on immigration reform. In the past week, he's expressed positions that make him sound like both a moderate and a hardliner on the issue, depending on the audience.

As for King, one of Cuccinelli's favorite congressmen, he recently drew widespread criticism from both sides of the aisle after suggesting that many undocumented immigrants who had been brought here as children were acting as drug mules. He said they'd developed ""calves the size of cantaloupes"" from their illicit work.

King has been one of the most rigid opponents of immigration reform efforts over the past years, a stance that he's developed not just through legislative efforts, but also through divisive comments he's made about immigrants themselves. He recently was forced to explain remarks he made in 2012 in which he compared immigrants to dogs."

USA TODAY

Rep. Mark Sanford's fiancée, Maria Belen Chapur, says she is ""happy"" in her relationship with the Republican congressman.

Chapur gave her first extended remarks about her relationship with Sanford, a former South Carolina governor whose political career was derailed by his extramarital affair, to Infobae, an Argentine TV station, last week.

""When we're together, we live together,"" Chapur said, according to a translated version of her TV interview. ""Partly in Washington, partly in Charleston. Now it's difficult, but until last year, he would come to Buenos Aires.""

Sanford won redemption from South Carolina voters in May, winning back his old congressional seat after a two-year break from politics. Sanford's affair with Chapur, which he admitted to in 2009, wrecked his marriage. The relationship became tabloid fodder when he told his staff that he was ""hiking on the Appalachian Trail"" and could not be reached, when he was instead visiting Chapur in Argentina.

Sanford and his ex-wife, Jenny, had a messy divorce which came up again in his congressional campaign this year when she charged him with trespassing at her South Carolina home. (They settled out of court.)

Chapur, a former TV journalist and divorced mother of two, appeared at Sanford's primary victory events. She stayed largely behind the scenes during his short campaign against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Chapur attended Sanford's swearing-in celebration at the U.S. Capitol, and sat in the visitor's gallery next to two of his sons.

Chapur told Infobae that she and Sanford met in 2001 in Uruguay. She said they had a ""strict friendship"" for years — she even received the Sanford family Christmas card — until their relationship changed in 2008.

""Since that time, we've stayed in the relationship,"" Chapur said. ""Today, he returned to politics. Many asked him to resign and (he) decided to stay at a great cost and finished ranked as one of the four best governors in the United States.""

Yelton said Voter ID law would hurt Democrats%2C referenced %22lazy blacks%22

Local%2C state GOP representatives denounced Don Yelton%27s comments

Yelton said he would not change anything%2C and he refused to apologize

After bragging in a TV interview that the state's Voter ID regulations would ""kick the Democrats in the butt,"" and after making reference to ""lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything,"" a North Carolina conservative activist has stepped down from his Republican Party post.

Don Yelton made the decision to leave after the Buncome County GOP asked him to resign his position as a precinct chairman, according to the Asheville Citizen-Times. Yelton made the comments on Wednesday's edition of Jon Stewart's The Daily Show on television, setting off a firestorm of reaction in social media land.

Yelton told the Citizen-Times that in spite of the circumstances, he would not change anything, and he refused to apologize.

""There's nothing I said that I would take back – so be it,"" Yelton told the news organization.

Voter ID laws, which require would-be voters to present identification when registering to vote and/or when voting, have been criticized as damaging to Democratic voters who are more likely not to have identification.

""The law is going to kick the Democrats in the butt,"" Yelton told Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi. ""If it hurts a bunch of college kids too lazy to get up off their bohonkas and go get a photo ID, so be it. If it hurts a bunch of whites, so be it.""

Yelton also said, ""If it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything, so be it.""

The Buncombe County GOP released a statement via Facebook denouncing Yelton's comments, calling them ""outrageous and intolerant"" and indicating North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Claude Pope was calling for Yelton's resignation.

""The North Carolina Republican Party finds the comments made by Mr. Yelton to be completely inappropriate and highly offensive,"" the statement read. ""I would like to make it very clear that Mr. Yelton does not speak for either the Buncombe County Republcan Party or the North Carolina Republican Party.""

Buncombe County GOP chairman Henry Mitchell echoed those comments, according to Politico.

""Let me make it very clear, Mr. Yelton's comments do not reflect the belief or feelings of Buncombe Republcians, nor do they mirror any core principle that our party is founded upon,"" Mitchell said in a statement. ""this mentality will not be supported or propagated within our party."""

Paul LePage tells fellow Republicans: Obama 'hates white people',"There is not one damn thing Barack Obama has ever done in his life that might convince anyone he hates white people, but there are still a small subset of extremely pasty people who are convinced of it, and the Republican Party seems to have elected most of the dumbest ones they could find to office. I don't even think LePage is just playing to the base here—I don't see any past evidence that would suggest the world give him that much credit. No, he apparently seriously, honestly believes Barack Obama goes through life figuring out how he can hurt good white pasty stupid people like Paul LePage unless people like Paul LePage figure out how to hurt him first, because that belief, expressed 20 different ways, an emotion so primitive and non-subtle that even dogs have evolved above it, is the only remaining Republican Party position on anything.

To hell with managing the affairs of the nation or making the trains run on time, or at all, or even knowing what a train might be: The only supposed core party belief that survived the Bush-to-Obama transition without spinning into a ditch was the same racial/ethnic/religious paranoias that have driven the worst of the base since the civil rights movement made all of them sad. And, since 2008, it's been boiling over because the worst of the base has to look at Obama every day and the mere presence of one of ""them"" in a position of power proves, to them, every conspiracy theory anyone ever muttered about how giving other people any rights at all will mean that now it's the good white folks turn to be oppressed; the rights of citizenship played out as zero-sum game. It's not a question of ensuring basic rights to all Americans: if those other Americans are given rights, they will use it to hurt us. It's not a question of giving Muslim Americans the same basic right to religious freedom and a place of worship that everyone else is entitled to: if we allow them to meet in our neighborhoods, soon we will be under their law. A trash conspiracy opinion, to be sure, and yet one that multiple states and lawmakers cannot move quickly or often enough to wallow in. Surely, that should be proof enough of where the heart of the party lies.

What Paul LePage said was based on racism. Terribly sorry to break it to you, old sports of the more polite media venues, but you really can't have it any other way. Whether Paul LePage is a racist, directly, I don't give a damn, but the only way you can ever get to the theory that ""Obama hates white people"" is through a thicket of racial conspiracy theories in your own head. That makes LePage no different from the vast swath of Everyone Else in his entire damn party, none of whom have any idea as to what they're doing other than the urgent belief that everything non-white-upper-class America wants is, de facto, a plot against them, and that the Republican Party is still not only electing these people but making them the models of the party ought to be proof enough that the party is an intellectual wasteland, a big loud megaphone for spouting obscene nothings that dwindling group of people too angry and dumb and bitter to figure out how to leave.

Koch has not taken a position on the legislative tactic of tying the continuing resolution to defunding ObamaCare nor have we lobbied on legislative provisions defunding ObamaCare.

The Koch Brothers may want America to believe that. The statement is not accurate. On February 14th, 2013 Matte Kibbe of FreedomWorks sent out a letter. The letter titled “Coalition Letter: Congress Must Honor Sequester Savings and Defund ObamaCare Before It Is Too Late” said that,

Conservatives should not approve a CR unless it defunds Obamacare. This includes Obamacare’s unworkable exchanges, unsustainable Medicaid expansion, and attack on life and religious liberty. [Source]

In other words they supported a government shutdown strategy. Why did they think a government shutdown strategy was necessary? They noted what every supporter of Obamacare knows.

On October 1, 2013, open enrollment begins for the federally backed health care exchanges. On January 1, 2014, new money from Washington will begin flowing to states and individuals, all but ensuring that these new entitlements will become a permanent fixture of life in America. The window of opportunity to stop the implementation of these massive new subsidies is closing. Although many of Obamacare's provisions are now the law of the land, many of the law's most damaging and irreversible provisions do not take effect until 2014. [Source]

FreedomWorks is one of the many organizations that are funded by the Koch Brothers. The Kochs are part responsible for this Tea Party government shutdown strategy. There is no doubt about it.

It is clear from the letter that the Koch Brothers were shaken. They want to us to ignore the New York Times article. They want to dispel Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s implicating them in the shutdown.

It is evident that the shutdown has become a train wreck for the Tea Party. By implication it could damage the reputation of the Koch Brothers with their own base, the Right Wing of the Republican Party. They get little benefit from being associated with Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Steve King (R-IA), and the other sophomoric architects of this government shutdown strategy.

How will the Tea Party react to this letter? Will they now allow John Boehner to bring the CR to the floor? It seems like they must find a way out since their chief sponsor is no longer on board.

Government Shutdown Strategy Abandoned?

Did something like that actually happen?

Patrick Hynes, an adviser to Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign who worked with online media for the communications department, answered some questions from Breitbart News about the show via email.

Big Hollywood: What was your reaction to The Newsroom scene description about reporters getting booted off the Romney campaign?

Patrick Hynes: My initial reaction was that once again the Hollywood left is out to depict Republicans as unreasonable, authoritarian, stupid, hostile and mean spirited because in the absence of such a stereotype, Republicans might actually win some elections, and well, we can’t have that, can we?



BH: To your knowledge, did any such event ever take place during the campaign?

PH: No, nothing like that ever took place, as far as I know. Don’t get me wrong, relations between the campaign and the press were not good and there were frequent moments of hostility every day. But I don’t recall ever hearing of reporters getting thrown off the bus.

BH: If such an event occurred, would you have heard about it? Would Gov. Romney have heard about it?

PH: I would have heard about it. We would almost certainly have been in rapid response mode if something like this had happened. In fact, it would have been impossible for anyone not to hear about it, as anything like this fictional account would have consumed a day’s worth of campaign coverage. There is nothing the press likes to cover more than itself.

BH: Why do you think a show would manufacture such an event?

PH: To make a boring and insufferable program slightly more interesting and to make Republicans look stupid."

Pat McCrory said it effectively halted capital punishment in the state Democrats say four condemned convicts had their sentences reduced to life under the law

(CNN) —

North Carolina’s governor says he agreed to repeal a law that allowed inmates to challenge their death sentences on racial grounds because it effectively banned capital punishment in the state.

North Carolina legislators barred death sentences “sought or obtained on the basis of race” in 2009, when both houses of the state General Assembly were under Democratic control.

The, legislation, known as the Racial Justice Act, allowed condemned convicts to use statistical analysis to argue that race played a role in their sentencing.

Republicans who took control of the Legislature in 2010 weakened the law last year, overriding a veto by then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat.

Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican elected in 2012, followed legislative action and signed its complete repeal Wednesday.

“Nearly every person on death row, regardless of race, has appealed their death sentence under the Racial Justice Act,” McCrory said in a statement Wednesday. “The state’s district attorneys are nearly unanimous in their bipartisan conclusion that the Racial Justice Act created a judicial loophole to avoid the death penalty and not a path to justice.”

The state still allowed capital punishment even while the Racial Justice Act was on the books. But state Democrats said the law resulted in at least four convicts being taken off death row after judges ruled that their sentences resulted from racial bias, with their sentences commuted to life in prison instead.

About 53% of the 153 convicts awaiting execution in North Carolina are black, according to the state Department of Public Safety, while about 40% are white. African-Americans make up about 22% of the state’s population, according to Census figures.

What if your credit or debit cards won't work tomorrow and you have no access to your money? How do you continue to conduct commerce in these emergency situations?

To protect Virginians and their assets, Marshall has drafted legislation with the goal to give Virginia its own currency.

House Joint Resolution 590, which passed by a two-thirds vote in the House of Delegates last week, would establish a 10-member joint subcommittee consisting of eight legislators and two non-legislative Virginia residents who would study the feasibility ""of a metallic-based monetary unit.""

Marshall said the new currency would not replace but compete with the U.S. dollar.

""It would be an additional vehicle of trade and commerce,"" he said.

The study's projected $17,440 cost would justify the means, he added.

""That's very cheap, just about what one delegate makes a year,"" he said.

His concern that the dollar might not always be available prompted him to introduce this measure, Marshall said.

""There are sniper attacks going on right now from foreign powers on our financial institutions,"" he said. ""If they succeed, you're not going to be able to buy gas with a credit card. If you are on Medicaid, you won't get a debit card to buy food at the grocery store. A whole bunch of transactions are going to cease.""

A simple way around this, Marshall said, would be to require at least the 81 state-chartered banks to issue checks to all account holders ""so they can carry on commerce, so they can buy food, gasoline, pay their rent and electricity.""

Marshall's idea isn't new. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, a passionate advocate for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve -- who has run for president as a Libertarian and as a Republican -- previously introduced his ""Free Competition in Currency Act"" in Congress.

The measure, which would have allowed states to introduce their own currencies, was never signed into law but was reintroduced last month by Georgia Rep. Paul C. Broun, a Republican.

The proposals have gained support, especially among some Republicans and tea party groups nationwide, who worry about the Fed's continuing infusions of cash into the economy and who are pushing for a return to the ""gold standard"" that would require the U.S. dollar to be backed by gold reserves.

The guarantee of the convertibility of dollars into gold on demand was first established in 1944 at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce under the Bretton Woods Agreement. But in 1971, the measure was abandoned under Republican President Richard Nixon.

Since President Barack Obama's first election in 2008, several states have pursued legislative efforts for currency creation. These efforts face legal challenges, because while individual localities are permitted to issue their own currency -- as long as it is distinguishable from U.S. dollars -- the Constitution bans states from printing their own paper money or issuing their own paper currency.

But Article 1, Section 10 also leaves states the option to mint coins to be used for debt service -- a loophole that some use as a step toward currency creation.

At least 13 other states -- Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- have explored the option of issuing their own currency.

To date, only Utah has passed such legislation, recognizing gold and silver coins issued by the U.S. Mint, like Silver Eagles and American Gold, as a legal form of payment.

Marshall introduced legislation in 2011 that authorized the governor to direct the state treasurer to mint ""gold, platinum and silver coins for commemorative use that bear the seals of the commonwealth."" The bill passed in both houses and was signed into law.

Two years ago, Marshall complained that his bill had been mischaracterized as an attempt to mint a separate currency for Virginia -- bringing criticism that he offered an alternative to the Federal Reserve. ""Some hysterical comments,"" he said.

That was then. But now, Marshall is serious about taking that next step.

""Virginia has to do this, we need to be prepared,"" he said. ""We have to anticipate this so we don't descend into social chaos. When you got massive inflation, you are setting up the stage for dictatorships. We don't need that in this country.""

But experts say Marshall's fears are not grounded in reality.

""There is no chance whatsoever that hyperinflation will happen in the United States,"" said Michael Smitka, professor of economics at Washington and Lee University. ""Only countries that are on the brink of a complete political breakdown ever face this.""

Smitka said Japan, a country with an economic system most similar to that of the U.S., has never experienced hyperinflation after its 1991 economic meltdown.

""After all this time, what they have is outright deflation, not inflation, much less hyperinflation,"" he said. But slight, one-digit inflation, as the U.S. experiences, is manageable, he said.

Cyberattacks are even less likely to cause serious damage, Smitka said.

""Banks are very careful with their Internet systems. Anyone suggesting that a cyberattack can bring down an entire centralized system has no understanding of how it works,"" he said.

A system that can be trusted is already in place, Smitka said.

""Who are they going to put in to run the Virginia monetary system? I'd fear the competence of a state-level monetary board and state-level financial regulation more than the federal level,"" he said.

The Fed is prepared for national emergencies, Smitka said.

""The Federal Reserve in Richmond has multiple billions in cash reserves that can be infused into the Virginia economy if needed,"" he said.

Democrats also slammed Marshall's proposal.

""House GOP put on tin foil hats in late-night session,"" was the headline of a statement released by the Virginia House Democratic Caucus last week. Caucus chairman Mark D. Sickles, D-Fairfax, called the debate over this legislation ""political theatrics.""

Marshall stands by his measure, which the state Senate has referred to the Rules Committee.

""It's a serious effort dealing with a serious problem,"" he said.

But Marshall -- who suggested in 2011 to name a Virginia currency ""Ginny"" -- said he has not given any thought to whose head he would want to grace the commonwealth's coin.

""We are not at that point yet,"" he said. ""But it won't be mine.""

* Obama opponents target Sebelius solicitations for group

* Approached H&R Block and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

* Health secretary: fundraising effort legal and appropriate

* Probes could discourage donations to Enroll America

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - With the White House already reeling from three major controversies, some Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on what they perceive is another possible scandal tied to President Barack Obama's landmark health reform law just as it nears implementation.

On top of the troubles the administration is facing over its handling of the attack on the Benghazi mission, the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups, and the Justice Department's seizure of Associated Press phone records, Republicans hope to target Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

They are questioning her soliciting of funds on behalf of a non-profit group, called Enroll America, from two private entities, a practice which if not unprecedented is at the very least unusual. Federal law bars officials from soliciting any organization or individual with whom they do business or regulate.

Enroll America is run by the president's former campaign backers to do something Congress refused to fund: sell ""Obamacare"" to the public.

An HHS statement last week said that since March Sebelius solicited financial donations for Enroll America from H&R Block Inc, the tax preparation company, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic entity devoted to public health issues. Asked Monday for a list of all solicitations before or after March, an HHS spokesman referred Reuters to the department's original statement.

Neither H&R Block nor the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are regulated by HHS, the department's spokesman said, so there was nothing improper or illegal about soliciting them.

Enroll America is intended to serve as the private sector flagship for a massive public outreach campaign intended to get millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for subsidized insurance coverage through new online marketplaces, or exchanges, that will begin open enrollment on Oct. 1.

NO COMMITMENT

H&R Block said it has made no commitment to Enroll America. ""We received a phone call from the Secretary during which the Secretary discussed supporting Enroll America,"" the company said in a statement. ""While we took her suggestion under consideration, we have made no commitment,"" it said.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a statement that it had ""recently approved new funding"" for Enroll America, bringing its total contributions to the group to nearly $14 million since 2010. It did not say how much of that, if any, came in response to Sebelius' solicitation.

It's the second controversy over the novel method used by the Obama administration to promote its agenda: using campaign-style organizations staffed with loyalists and former campaign or White House aides to mobilize grassroots support for government policies. The first involved Organizing for Action, an independent non-profit group seeking to harness both the energy and personnel from Obama's re-election campaign in support of the president's legislative agenda.

The Enroll America issue is complicated by the fact that Republicans in Congress have succeeded in blocking proposed government spending that otherwise could have been used to achieve the ends pursued by the independent group.

That has given lawmakers, such as Republican U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, an opening to allege a violation of the federal ""anti-deficiency"" act, which bars agencies from accepting ""voluntary"" services except when authorized by law.

In defense of the help the department is getting from Enroll America, an HHS spokesman said it is permitted by a section of the Public Health Service Act that allows the secretary to encourage support for new and innovative health programs.

Some conservative legal experts say finding a clear-cut violation of the law is a long shot. ""I would be skeptical of the claim that it's illegal, unless someone made a really compelling case. However, the appearance is such that it at least raises questions,"" said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western University who opposes healthcare reform.

But legal issues may be the least of the concerns for supporters of the healthcare law.

They worry that a political storm over Obamacare, with congressional hearings likely, could discourage private donors to Enroll America and jeopardize the administration's ability to find the funds needed to reach a public that is already largely unaware of the healthcare reforms.

One of the biggest concerns is that younger, healthier people will not sign up for health plans on the exchanges, driving the costs up for coverage of the people who do sign up.

""The danger"" to the health program, said former Obama healthcare adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle, ""is that people don't come and enroll and get insured. That leaves the health plans in the exchanges trying to cover people without any young, healthy people, and it drives the price up.""

REPUBLICANS PROMISE PROBES

Republicans certainly see an opportunity.

""Our guys on the Hill think this is the fourth scandal,"" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. ""It fits into that narrative Republicans are building not only about incompetence in the executive branch but also dishonesty.""

""This is a good issue for Republicans,"" Mackowiak added. ""We want to maximize it.""

The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has launched an investigation into the fundraising to determine whether it involved regulated companies and has asked nearly a dozen healthcare firms including major insurers such as Aetna Inc, a member of Enroll America's advisory council, to say whether they have received solicitations.

Republicans in the House and Senate have also called on the non-partisan Government Accountability Office to investigate.

""People are watching it very closely. We're hearing about it from constituents, people who are incredibly concerned,"" said Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn.

Enroll America was launched in September 2011 in part by leaders of Families USA, a key backer of the healthcare reform effort as it moved through Congress in 2009 and 2010. It is led by Anne Filipic, who worked on public engagement projects in the Obama White House. It's managing director, Chris Wyant, directed Obama's eastern Ohio field operation during the 2012 election campaign.

It includes on its boards of directors and advisers, executives of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Blue Shield of California, Kaiser Permanente, and CVS Caremark as well as officials of major health-related trade associations, such as the American Hospital Association and the National Association of Health Underwriters.

Filipic said she is confident that Enroll America will get the funds it needs for the outreach campaign. ""We feel really good that we'll have the resources we need,"" she said.

No, really.","I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.

I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.

On Friday, GOP congressional candidate Ian Bayne went all in, comparing [Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson] to civil rights icon Rosa Parks. ""In December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians,"" Bayne said in an email to supporters. ""What Parks did was courageous,"" he added. ""What Mr. Robertson did was courageous too.""

The ""stand"" Robertson took was to compare homosexuality to bestiality , also lumping them in with ""the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes"" and so forth, which makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think gay Americans are going to hell. (Really, though, has their been a dearth of good conservative Christians willing to pipe up about that? Not seeing the pioneer status of this particular reality TV star, myself.) Oh, and Robertson also had said that black Americans had it Just Fine Thank You during the Jim Crow era, which also makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think Rosa Parks didn't have anything to complain about in the first place.

Bayne is running to challenge Democratic Rep. Bill Foster in Illinois' 11th District next year, presuming he makes it through the primary. That primary being the reason he's sending out emails about Duck Dynasty stars and what they can teach us about being like Rosa Parks, of course.

I'll say this again: Congress is already very full of crackpots and frothing nutcases, thank you. We don't need any more. I don't know what letter went out in Republican circles that encouraged yet another raft of these loons to come sailing down the ol' wingnut river, but we are full up already.

Fundraising dropped for two-thirds of new House Republicans who led effort to dismantle Obamacare

Several Tea Party-aligned incumbents face primary challengers

Business groups increase political involvement with centrist Republicans

WASHINGTON — Campaign donations to some of the House's most prominent Tea Party insurgents tumbled in recent months, and several of the chamber's most conservative new members struggled to match the fundraising pace of their business-backed primary challengers, new campaign filings show.

Fundraising fell in the July-to-September fundraising quarter for two-thirds of the 42 House Republicans elected since 2010 who signed an August letter that urged House leaders to tie dismantling the Affordable Care Act to a bill funding the government, a USA TODAY analysis shows. That letter, circulated by first-term Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., helped ignite the budget showdown that shuttered parts of the government for 16 days this month.

In Detroit's upscale Oakland County suburbs, first-term Republican Rep. Kerry Bentivolio raised $59,177, a 10% drop from his haul in the previous fundraising quarter. In less than a month on the campaign trail, Bentivolio's primary challenger, lawyer David Trott, raised nearly $650,000. Trott tapped $200,000 of his own funds plus donations from prominent business leaders in Michigan, including billionaire Amway heir Dick DeVos.

In Florida, first-term Rep. Ted Yoho, who argued that a debt default would ""stabilize the world's markets,"" took in $51,000 during the third quarter, down from $117,900 during the previous three months.

Another Tea Party-aligned lawmaker, two-term Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais, failed to match the fundraising pace of his GOP primary challenger, state Sen. Jim Tracy. Tracy ended September with nearly five times the cash reserves of DesJarlais, whose support among the party's establishment eroded after a series of personal scandals.

""This could be the beginning of the revenge of Main Street,"" said Jack Pitney, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. Republicans rode a wave of Tea Party anger with the health care law and bank bailouts to take control of the House in 2010, he said, but ""a lot of mainstream Republicans are starting to worry that Tea Party Republicans are costing the party more than the support they bring in.""

In recent weeks, primary challengers to Tea Party-aligned incumbents have emerged in at least other three other congressional districts — in North Carolina, Alabama and in western Michigan. In Michigan, Rep. Justin Amash, a rising star among conservatives who was part of an attempted coup this year against House Speaker John Boehner, faces investment manager Brian Ellis. (Ellis entered the race in October after the books closed on the third fundraising quarter of the year.)

The fundraising reports come as a growing number of Washington trade groups, typically aligned with Republicans in Congress, have raised concerns about the economic toll of Washington's fiscal crises. Several business leaders say they are considering backing primary challengers to Tea Party incumbents.

""Our members are going to be a lot more active because they are getting frustrated,"" said the National Retail Federation's chief lobbyist, David French, citing the recent fiscal showdown and the ""general sense of dysfunction in Washington.""

He said it's too soon to put a precise price tag on the shutdown's cost to the industry, but retailers are worried about the effect of recurring budget confrontations on consumer confidence as the nation heads into the $602 billion holiday retail season. ""Pessimistic and disengaged consumers are not good for retail,"" French said.

The National Association of Manufacturers plans to host a fundraiser this year for Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, an eight-term Republican. He faces a primary challenge from Bryan Smith, a lawyer backed by the anti-tax Club for Growth and Tea Party-affiliated FreedomWorks. Both groups have supported Republican upstarts in recent elections and called this week for lawmakers to vote against the Senate-brokered deal that ended the partial government shutdown.

FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe denounced the agreement as ""complete surrender,"" because it failed to delay or disrupt the health care law.

In the end, Simpson was one of 87 House Republicans who voted for the compromise. ""The easiest, most politically expedient thing for me to do would have been to vote 'no' and protect my political right flank,"" he said in a statement. ""Doing so, however, would have been the wrong thing to do for my constituents and our economy.""

Simpson, a veteran appropriator and Boehner ally, is ahead in the money race. He raised $437,000 in the July-to-September fundraising period — including $4,000 from Boehner, federal records show. Smith collected nearly $276,000.

Asked about Simpson's fundraising edge, Smith campaign manager Carrie Brown said in an e-mail that she's ""confident that as voters become aware of Mike Simpson's liberal voting record and support for higher taxes and more spending that they will support Bryan in next year's primary.""

Russ Walker, FreedomWorks' political director, said the early fundraising advantage of Republicans in the party's business-oriented wing, doesn't mean they will prevail.

""Money can't buy the support of the grass roots,"" he said. ""After these last several weeks, the grass roots will be more fired up than ever to replace the guys in D.C. who favor the status quo.""

Campaign-finance reports released this week do not cover candidates' fundraising during the partial government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. Some Tea Party-aligned lawmakers saw an increase in campaign funds during the third quarter. Meadows, the freshman Republican from North Carolina who first circulated the letter seeking to link the Affordable Care Act to continued government funding, saw a 49% increase in his total receipts over the previous quarter.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who became the public face of the fight against the health care law after leading a 21-hour filibuster-style Senate speech in late September, collected nearly $1.2 million for his Senate re-election committee and leadership PAC, from July 1 through Sept. 30. That's roughly on par with his previous fundraising."

Paul LePage tells fellow Republicans: Obama 'hates white people',"There is not one damn thing Barack Obama has ever done in his life that might convince anyone he hates white people, but there are still a small subset of extremely pasty people who are convinced of it, and the Republican Party seems to have elected most of the dumbest ones they could find to office. I don't even think LePage is just playing to the base here—I don't see any past evidence that would suggest the world give him that much credit. No, he apparently seriously, honestly believes Barack Obama goes through life figuring out how he can hurt good white pasty stupid people like Paul LePage unless people like Paul LePage figure out how to hurt him first, because that belief, expressed 20 different ways, an emotion so primitive and non-subtle that even dogs have evolved above it, is the only remaining Republican Party position on anything.

To hell with managing the affairs of the nation or making the trains run on time, or at all, or even knowing what a train might be: The only supposed core party belief that survived the Bush-to-Obama transition without spinning into a ditch was the same racial/ethnic/religious paranoias that have driven the worst of the base since the civil rights movement made all of them sad. And, since 2008, it's been boiling over because the worst of the base has to look at Obama every day and the mere presence of one of ""them"" in a position of power proves, to them, every conspiracy theory anyone ever muttered about how giving other people any rights at all will mean that now it's the good white folks turn to be oppressed; the rights of citizenship played out as zero-sum game. It's not a question of ensuring basic rights to all Americans: if those other Americans are given rights, they will use it to hurt us. It's not a question of giving Muslim Americans the same basic right to religious freedom and a place of worship that everyone else is entitled to: if we allow them to meet in our neighborhoods, soon we will be under their law. A trash conspiracy opinion, to be sure, and yet one that multiple states and lawmakers cannot move quickly or often enough to wallow in. Surely, that should be proof enough of where the heart of the party lies.

What Paul LePage said was based on racism. Terribly sorry to break it to you, old sports of the more polite media venues, but you really can't have it any other way. Whether Paul LePage is a racist, directly, I don't give a damn, but the only way you can ever get to the theory that ""Obama hates white people"" is through a thicket of racial conspiracy theories in your own head. That makes LePage no different from the vast swath of Everyone Else in his entire damn party, none of whom have any idea as to what they're doing other than the urgent belief that everything non-white-upper-class America wants is, de facto, a plot against them, and that the Republican Party is still not only electing these people but making them the models of the party ought to be proof enough that the party is an intellectual wasteland, a big loud megaphone for spouting obscene nothings that dwindling group of people too angry and dumb and bitter to figure out how to leave.

Thought Tom Perez was Radical? Meet Debo Adegbile:



But in the Obama Justice Department, the law is not as important as the cause. And with Adegbile, the cause is racialist.

We are already aware of the animus against Barack Obama's paternity, and the Kenyan father he never knew, along with the birther conspiracy theory about his nativity. So many of the racist depictions of him as an ape, simian-like, or a savage with a bone in his nose, are deeply rooted in ideations about the Dark Continent , used to maintain slavery and white supremacy.

There have been numerous studies that prove having a non-WASP name affects getting hired, an interview for a job, or entry to a specific college or university. Of course, historically that was true for names that sounded Irish or Jewish. I was fortunate to have the surname Oliver, though after marrying and becoming a hyphenated Velez, slurs of ""sp*c"", have increased.

Adegbile faces a formidable array of rationales for the vituperation unleashed against him. Bad enough to be black in America, a child of a mixed race union, and to have a clearly African first and surname, coupled with the hated resume of tenure with the NAACP, and his support of voting rights.

He expressed that support clearly in an interview done at NYU when he was chosen as Alumnus of the Month for July 2010.



Q: You also were involved in voting rights cases with the LDF during the 2000 presidential election and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. What draws you to these kinds of cases? A. Voting rights fascinated me when I studied the topic in my constitutional law class with Professor Christopher L. Eisgruber. Leaders like Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall knew that individuals’ ability to express their political voices was essential to take down the racial caste system of Jim Crow. So many of the civil rights leaders understood that having a vote—having an ability to pick leaders and to have a full measure of citizenship—was essential to ensuring equality, not just in the moment but in the future. That lesson was not lost on me. Q: How did you develop an interest and expertise in voting rights law? When I studied at NYU, I had a chance to take a couple of wonderful classes on race and the law in the United States and South Africa with the late, great A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and later I practiced with him at the Paul, Weiss law firm. He was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He spent his career working as a civil rights lawyer and a federal judge, and was a passionate and unyielding voice for equality in the United States. He was very involved in a number of voting cases and was very passionate in defending the voting rights of African Americans, especially in the twilight of his career. I got to work with him as a summer associate and then as an associate at Paul, Weiss, and through that experience I participated in my first case with the LDF. So that experience set me on a path of not only caring deeply about these issues, but having an opportunity to become involved in the continuing struggle for equality.

In 1966, founders Gus and Marty Trowbridge set out to create an independent school where equality, social justice, a diverse community, and the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. would form the basis for childrens’ education. Four decades later, at a school with no racial majority, that dream has become a vibrant reality for nearly 200 students every year.

A: I auditioned for Sesame Street during the first or second season the show was on the air. A big ""cattle call"" went out in New York City because they were looking for more kids. Off to the audition I went, and I guess I made it through without wrecking the set or acting too unruly. I filmed episodes for nine years. At NYU, I distinctly remember taking a workshop from placement services early in my time at NYU. Their advice was to take anything you’ve done that’s interesting or different and put it on your résumé, because law firms get a lot of résumés and after a while they all start to look alike. On the strength of that advice, I put Sesame Street on my résumé. And true to form, in almost every interview, it was a substantial part of the focus. I guess that talking about the show was a lot more interesting than my views on the law or my command of legal topics – I suspect that is still the case. So in some way, I owe my career success to attending that workshop and heeding that advice.

Adegbile was exposed very early in life to concepts of justice and equality. He is an alumnus of Manhattan Country School , and sits on their board of directors. The school's mission statement reflects the man he is:Of course his childhood association with Big Bird may not win him any applause on the right either ;)The good news on his nomination and future confirmation is that given the rules change in the U.S. Senate, he may not be blocked. We should help make that happen.

For those of you planning to attend Netroots Nation in Detroit in 2014 and interested in hearing more from him, he is scheduled to be on a panel. Here's hoping his bio posted on the NN website will have a new addition—Debo Adegbile, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice."

Dana Milbank:

A good indication of House Republicans’ mind-set came last week, when Rep. John Boehner’s spokesman wrote on the House speaker’s official blog that a speech by Obama on student loans was an attempt “to change the subject from its growing list of scandals.” It’s telling that the GOP leadership would view a student loan event as a distraction from scandals but wouldn’t see the obsession with scandals as a distraction from pocketbook issues. As The Post’s Paul Kane reported Tuesday, House Republicans haven’t passed much ambitious legislation this year after they “disintegrated into squabbling factions, no longer able to agree on — much less execute — some of the most basic government functions.” One of the few things that unite them is the investigation of scandals. A few weeks ago, Heritage Action for America, an influential conservative group, suggested that House Republicans focus on investigations and avoid legislation that could divide them.

The Republicans not only can't govern, they are not even interested in trying. it's becoming so obvious, even some of the Villagers are beginning to see it.

Greg Sargent:

If current obstructionism continues, Dems may exercise the nuclear option and change the rules by simple majority to nix filibusters of nominations. With the showdown escalating, the battle is already being treated as a he-said-she-said argument in which there’s no real way to settle the core question of whether what we’re seeing from Republicans is something new and different. For example, the New York Times noted without comment the other day: “Republicans deny being slow to confirm the president’s choices for his cabinet and the courts.” Yes, but are they right, or wrong? It is not easy to conclusively determine whether GOP obstructionism is unprecedented. But there are some data points we can look at.

For instance, Dr. Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts who focuses on judicial nominations, has developed what he calls an “Index of Obstruction and Delay” designed to measure levels of obstructionism. In research that will be released in a July article he co-authored for Judicature Journal, he has calculated that the level of obstruction of Obama circuit court nominees during the last Congress was unprecedented. Goldman calculates his Index of Obstruction and Delay by adding together the number of unconfirmed nominations, plus the number of nominations that took more than 180 days to confirm (not including nominations towards the end of a given Congress) and dividing that by the total number of nominations. During the last Congress, Goldman calculates, the Index of Obstruction and Delay for Obama circuit court nominations was 0.9524. “That’s the highest that’s ever been recorded,” he tells me. “In this last Congress it approached total obstruction or delay.”

Republican obstructionism isn't opinion, it's fact."

Rand Paul on plagiarism: 'Do I have to be in detention the rest of my career?',"In an interview with National Review Online on Capitol Hill, Paul was furious, especially with the press coverage of the allegations. “It annoys the hell out of me,” Paul said. “I feel like if I could just go to detention after school for a couple days, then everything would be okay. But do I have to be in detention for the rest of my career?”

“What makes me mad about the whole thing is that I believe there is a difference between errors of omission and errors of intention,” he said. “We aren’t perfect and we have made errors of omission, but we never intended to mislead anybody.”

Am I the only one here who is deeply impressed with Sen. Rand Paul's insistence on playing the victim in his own plagiarism scandal? The narcissism levels are off the chart Well poor effing baby—you get caught lifting entire pages worth of material and passing it off as your own work, and your primary response is to be irritated that people keep bringing it up several days? Dear God, I don't know where our country finds these people, but we should be paying NASA some serious cash money to develop a system for sending them back there.No. You cannot get caught with your hand in other people's cookie jars to the tune of thousands of words and then plead oopsie, saying you didn't mean it. Of course you meant it. Either you—the person who wrote the book with your name on it—or some random staffer—the person who actually wrote the book with your name on it—copypasted large sections of text and put them under your byline. Same for op-ed articles. Same for speeches. The only way that happens is (1) if nobody involved, despite presumably at-least-basic levels of edumacation, has the slightest grasp of what plagiarism is or (2) nobody involved cares. The good senator has still not properly elucidated which of those two things happened, but from his sad coyote howling I am guessing that he would like us to believe that Mr. Doctor Senator Rand Son Of Ron Paul is simply unfamiliar with this whole don't goddamn steal concept. How dare people ask him about these things. For multiple days in a row!

Smart people have noted that Rand Paul seems to be a more political politico than his father, a man who always was a crackpot first and a politician second. Paul the Younger inherited his father's notions but attached an ambition all his own. Short version: The bullshit force is strong in this one.



“It’s also what people hate about politics, and it’s why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,” he said. “To tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they’re tired of me. I’ll go back to being a doctor, and I’ll be perfectly content.”

That's right, America, the Rand Paul family is none too keen on politics. If you're going to keep yelling at him for stupid things like junior-high level plagiarism, well Mr. Doctor Rand Paul will just go back to his self-certified ophthalmology career. None of those people give a damn if you design your own medical accreditation and sign your name to the bottom of it. Not like you ""haters.""

So far the only consequence of Paul's serial oopsies has been the cancellation of his Washington Times op-ed column. That's right: Sen. Rand Paul has been considered too unethical for the damn Washington Times. That's got to be worth a framed certificate right there.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/obama-impeachment-poll_n_2669820.html,2013-02-12 00:00:00,[],Obama Impeachment Poll Finds At Least Half Of Republicans Support Removing Him,"WASHINGTON -- It should come as no surprise to anyone that most Republicans aren't members of the Barack Obama fan club. According to one recent survey, a significant majority of Republicans in one state not only dislike the president but want to see him impeached. As a new HuffPost/YouGov national poll shows, however, questions about impeachment are a tricky business, and simply asking whether people support or oppose it may produce results that overstate their support.

A January survey of Texas voters conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 67 percent of Texas Republicans, and 39 percent of Texas voters overall, said they favor impeaching Obama. The survey asked, ""Would you support or oppose impeaching President Obama?""

But that relatively straightforward question leaves open several possibilities for interpreting what respondents meant when they said they favor impeachment. For example, the question contained no definition of impeachment, so that some respondents may have misunderstood what impeachment entails, even if they grasped that it functions as some kind of reprimand. Some respondents could have been just expressing an unfavorable opinion of Obama (virtually all Republicans rate him unfavorably) or endorsing a more generic reprimand, rather than advocating a process that could remove the president from office after trial for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""

To help better parse levels of support for impeaching the president, The Huffington Post and its polling partner YouGov conducted a survey experiment to see how question wording might affect that support. Between Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, a total of 3,000 respondents nationally were randomly assigned to answer one of three questions about impeaching the president, including the original question asked by PPP and two alternative questions.

The results showed both that a simple support/oppose question may overstate the number favoring impeachment and that support for impeachment remains surprisingly high among Republicans even when they are asked a more explanatory question.

One set of respondents answered the same question that was asked on the PPP poll. Similar results were found nationally to those that PPP found in Texas, particularly among Republicans. In the new survey, 35 percent of Americans overall and 66 percent of Republicans said they would support impeaching Obama.

The first alternative question asked respondents to choose between two options: Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" or he ""hasn't committed crimes that would justify impeachment."" The second alternative question allowed respondents to say they like Obama and think he should not be impeached, to say they think Obama should be impeached, or to say they dislike Obama but don't think he should be impeached.

Support for impeachment varied by 9 percentage points among the three questions, from 35 percent among those asked the original question to 26 percent of those asked the first alternative question. Support for impeachment among Republicans varied even more widely, from 66 percent of those asked the original question to 51 percent of those asked the first alternative.

The lowest support for impeachment, both among respondents overall and among Republicans specifically, came from the first alternative question, which made clear both that impeachment is a process to remove a president from office and that it is spurred by crimes committed by the president, rather than a more general reprimand or distaste for his policies. Even so, one-quarter of respondents and half of Republican respondents persisted in saying that Obama should be impeached and removed from office.

And those asked the second alternative question, which did not mention crimes but did ask if Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" and also gave respondents the option of expressing dislike of the president without calling for his impeachment, found a slightly higher 29 percent of respondents overall and 57 percent of Republicans would support impeachment.

The results of these polls, both on the state level and nationally, reflect the extreme dislike for Obama among Republicans. A recent YouGov/Economist poll found that nearly three-quarters of Republicans strongly disapprove of the job that the president is doing. Moreover, the desire to impeach a president of an opposing party isn't limited to Republicans: For example, a Time magazine poll conducted in November 2006 (and accessed through the Roper Center's iPoll database) found that 48 percent of Democrats were then in favor of impeaching George W. Bush, while an equal number were opposed.

More than anything, surveys finding support for impeachment show just how divided Americans are today along party lines and how strongly rank-and-file members of each party dislike presidents from the opposing party.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Jan. 30-Feb. 2 among 3,000 U.S. adults, of whom 1,000 were randomly assigned to answer each question (no respondent was shown more than one of the questions). The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

""I didn't go there with a grudge against Romney,"" he said. ""I really had no idea he would say what he said.""

Prouty said he grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in Boston. He said he felt that people who couldn't afford to attend a high-priced fundraiser should get a chance ""to find out what the candidate actually thinks.""

He said he struggled for two weeks with whether or not to release the video and risk his own career. He worried about losing his job or getting sued; Florida laws prohibit the recording of anyone without their consent. He did not have health insurance. He also worried about hurting the company that employed him and paid him well. After wrestling with the decision, he decided it would be cowardly not to release the video: ""I went down the path and never looked back.""

""The guy was running for the presidency, and these were his core beliefs,"" he said. ""And I think everybody can judge whether that’s appropriate or not or whether they believe the same way he does. I felt an obligation to expose the things he was saying.”

Romney's comments on ""47 percent"" of Obama voters, whom he described as dependent on government handouts and unable to take responsibility, had a major -- and negative -- impact on Romney's campaign. The former Massachusetts governor himself acknowledged in a recent interview that his words ""did real damage.""

But it was Romney's anecdote about going to China to potentially buy a factory that first piqued Prouty's interest. He was bothered by the candidate's description of barbed wire fencing and crowded dorm rooms.

""He just walked though this horrendous place and thought, 'Hey, this is pretty good,'"" Prouty said.

After the fundraiser, Prouty did some research and found a Mother Jones article by David Corn about Bain Capital's investment in a Chinese manufacturing firm. He also got in touch with Charles Kernaghan, an international labor rights activist.

The service industry worker was also miffed by the way Romney addressed the staff at the event, asking as soon as he arrived for them to move things along. Prouty had actually tended bar at a previous Romney event and served the candidate a Diet Coke with lemon.

""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" Prouty told the Huffington Post. ""He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a 'thank you' or anything else.""

Prouty posted the China clip in comment sections on news Web sites and liberal blogs. But without more context -- and with the image distorted to mask details that might expose the videographer -- the videos didn't gain traction. Prouty decided that he wanted Corn to take the story national. He approached Corn through former president Jimmy Carter's grandson, James Carter, who had been posting political clips to YouTube. On Sept. 17, Mother Jones posted the entire video.

Prouty said he did not reveal himself before the election because he did not want to draw attention away from the video itself: ""I wanted Mitt Romney's words, and Mitt Romney's words only"" to be the focus. Now, he said, he expects ""to be torn apart by the right-wing media.""

If he earns some ire, Prouty is also getting some positive attention. The United Steelworkers are looking to hire him.

Now that Prouty has revealed himself, Corn has published his own account of the video's release. He writes that after learning Prouty's real name, he Googled his source and was relieved by what he learned: Prouty had once rescued a drowning woman from a car.

Prouty said he is a registered independent but tends to vote Democratic. He had no contact with the Obama campaign. Watching the second presidential debate, in which Obama invoked the ""47 percent"" video in his final statement, Prouty cheered.

""I was thrilled that he hit him with it when he did,"" he said.

Mr. Christie said there was “only one group to blame” for the money being delayed six times longer than relief for Hurricane Katrina: the Republican majority and Mr. Boehner personally.

In a joint statement, Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said: “When American citizens are in need, we come to their aid. That tradition was abandoned in the House last night.” Mr. Christie called the delay in aid “disappointing and disgusting.”

Mr. Boehner had promised to allow the House to vote this week on a $60.4 billion aid package that easily passed the Senate.

That argument went down in flames in January 2012, and the Republicans were ordered to turn over their communications related to the new maps. And among the key Legislative aides that were involved in the map-making at MBF were ""afoltz"" - Adam Foltz, an aide to then-Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald - and ""tottman"" - Tad Ottman, and aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.

And the Democrats who made their own filing to coincide with Lanterman's findings note that the dates Foltz and Ottman had their deletion party was not coincidental.

On January 3, more than a month before trial, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to reconvene the depositions of Messrs. Ottman and Foltz and Joseph Handrick. It again ordered those witnesses to “produce documents in their possession that have been requested by the plaintiffs.” Order (Dkt. 104) at 10. Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with the legislature’s counsel on January 6, and the legislature produced additional documents on January 10 and 11. The January 6 deletions occurred just after the Court’s order and just before the legislature’s supplemental production. And they occurred on computers in Michael Best’s offices. Questions about the legislature’s document productions arose immediately after the close of trial. See Mem. in Support of Post-Trial Mot. for Remedial Discovery (Dkt. 253) at 8-11. On July 18, 2012, after majority control of the state senate shifted, the new majority leader requested Michael Best’s redistricting file. The following day (July 19), Michael Best agreed that it would make its redistricting file available for review. One week later (July 25), a user logged into the account of Tad Ottman, aide to state Senator Scott Fitzgerald—who just had been replaced as majority leader—deleted hundreds of thousands of redistricting files. The following week, Michael Best turned over its redistricting file to the new senate majority leader.

Ruh roh. And did I mention that Foltz has already testified that the new maps didn't take political implications in mind when they were done? I already said last year that this guy's looking at prison time for that perjury, but refusing to comply with court orders and deletion of evidence is a whole 'nother level of law-breaking. Hope THAT was worth it, Foltzie.

But as I like to say about WisGOP, not a lot of things with these guys are coincidental, and they come from the top. Let's face it, if you know what youngster GOP leggie aides are like these days, they are some of the biggest toolbags you can find - remote-controlled dopes who need an instructional manual to figure out what words to use on a press release. With that in mind, did I mention that former Wisconsin GOP Chair and current RNC Chair Reince Priebus is a former Michael, Best and Friedrich lawyer, and wanted to make sure Sean ""from the Real World"" Duffy and other WisGOP Congress members could be protected. And did I also mention that his college roomate Robin Vos was very interested in what the maps would say, since it was probable that Jeff Fitzgerald and Vos had worked out an agreement that Jeff Fitzgerald would run for U.S. Senate, and Vos would move up to Speaker if the GOPs maintained their majority after the 2012 elections (which they did)?

Hilariously, Vos is quoted in the State Journal article on the latest developments as saying ""he was not in leadership during the time in question and referred questions to attorneys handling the case."" RIIIIGHT. The guy known around the Capitol as ""Boss Vos"" with a newly-installed spiral staircase in his office to have a centralized office of WisGOP communcations and ""policy research"" had no hand in what was going on in a redistricting that would help him cement power? If you believe this, then....you probably believe that Scott Walker had 5 personally-hired aides breaking the law in Milwaukee County without his knowledge, either. I may have been born at 10:02pm, but it sure wasn't last night.

Given what Lanterman describes in his filing, he's been able to get back a lot of these files that Foltz and Ottman thought they'd gotten rid of, and given that the findings are due on May 10, we'll find out what's in those soon enough. But given that the only thing that Republican socipaths seem to understand is power and money, the only suitable punishment to stop these people are to THROW THE MAPS OUT (to take away their undeserved power) and make the aides and the bosses who gave the orders GO TO JAIL for such flagratn defiance of court orders and state open records laws.

This is definitely going to blow up. It's just a question of how high up it'll go. And if the national media wants a good ""off-year"" scandal, this may be one they might want to look at, because it could be a good one.

WASHINGTON — Embroiled in scandal, the IRS has replaced the official who supervised agents involved in targeting Tea Party groups.

Lois Lerner, IRS director of exempt organizations, refused to answer questions by a House committee Wednesday, saying she did nothing wrong but was nevertheless invoking her Fifth Amendment right not to testify against herself.

""I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee,"" Lerner said.

She was replaced Thursday by Ken Corbin, a 27-year IRS veteran who had a deputy director in the wage and investment division.

In announcing the change in an e-mail to IRS employees, the agency's new acting commissioner, Danny Werfel, did not mention Lerner. Administration and congressional sources told news organizations that she was placed on administrative leave.

The move came hours after Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., who lead the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent Werfel a letter urging him to suspend Lerner ""immediately.""

Lerner was the IRS official responsible for the office in Cincinnati that created a ""be on the lookout"" list for tax-exempt applications from groups using the words ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" and ""9/12 project"" in their names. Those applications were held up for more than a year while applications from liberal groups requesting similar status were routinely approved, a USA TODAY review found.

An audit by the IRS inspector general found that Lerner tried to immediately correct that list when she learned about it in 2011 but replaced it with criteria that included groups ""critical of how the country is being run."" Members of Congress from both parties want to know why she never informed Congress — even under direct questioning.

Levin and McCain wrote that they believe that Lerner ""failed to disclose crucial information concerning the IRS's inappropriate targeting of some conservative ... organizations"" during the committee's investigation into how the IRS enforces the law for tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups.

""Given the serious failure by Ms. Lerner to disclose to this Subcommittee key information on topics that the Subcommittee was investigating, we have lost confidence in her ability to fulfill her duties as Director of Exempt Organizations at the IRS,"" the senators wrote. ""Ms. Lerner's continued tenure in the office she holds, where she is responsible for overseeing 1.6 million tax-exempt organizations, would erode public trust and confidence in the IRS and its professional integrity. We believe that the immediate removal of Ms. Lerner from office would be a vital step in helping to restore public trust in the agency.""

Last week, acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller resigned at the request of President Obama.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who said if he was the Senate leader he’d move toward a rules change. “Support is growing for changing the rules when they play these games.” “The pattern of ‘obstruct and delay’ has returned as the norm in the U.S. Senate with today’s filibuster of two highly qualified nominees,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) “It proves once again the need to reform the Senate’s rules.”

“I’m going to file cloture on two other D.C. Circuit [nominees] and then make a decision. I’m not making it today,” Reid told reporters following a closed-door Democratic lunch. When informed that Republicans don’t believe Reid will invoke the nuclear option, Reid said, “Well, time will tell, won’t it?”

So much for gentlemen's agreements with Senate Republicans. Once again, Republicans filibustered two of President Obama's nominees—Rep. Mel Watt at the Federal Housing Finance administration and Patricia Millett for the D.C. Circuit court—Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will bring the two nominees back, as well as two more D.C. Circuit nominees, and some Democrats are calling for him to use the nuclear option to break the filibuster.Senators from Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to Kay Hagan (D-NC) sounded their frustration after these votes, frustration that's going to just build, something Reid might be counting on. Reid apparently wants to give Republicans more rope with other pending nominations, particularly Janet Yellen at the Federal Reserve, a nomination Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are threatening over Benghazi (because that makes sense).Reid had the votes and the will of his caucus to end the filibuster for executive nominations this summer, when Republicans backed down and allowed some long-blocked nominees through. He might not have the votes right now for ending the filibuster on judicial nominations, but more specious opposition from Republicans could force a change of mind among the handful of reluctant Democrats."

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Republicans are waiting for Holder's response to a letter about the apparent discrepancy between his sworn testimony and reports about his involvement in the near prosecution of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

""It is fair to say we're investigating the conflict in his remarks, those remarks were made under oath, but we also think it’s very important that the attorney general be afforded the opportunity to respond, so we will wait to pass judgment on that until we receive his response,"" Goodlatte said.

The Justice Department accused Rosen of being a criminal co-conspirator in the prosecution of a former administration official who had provided Rosen information about North Korea. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" there was no contradiction between Holder's testimony and his involvement in the case because Holder said he was not involved in the ""near prosecution"" of journalists and Rosen had not been prosecuted.

""It is often the practice in cases where you have investigations that you target somebody for the purpose of gathering information with never having any intention of prosecuting them,"" Van Hollen said.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Holder should consider resigning. ""The attorney general has to ask himself the question, is he really able to serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?""

""The attorney general has definitely lost the trust of the American people,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I think it will take a generation to rebuild trust in the federal government at this point.""

But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also appearing on ""Meet the Press,"" said there's been no perjury and that Holder should stay, despite the mounting calls for his resignation.

“There have been all kinds of accusations, but I haven’t seen anything that would prevent him from continuing to do his job,” Schumer said.

Spencer Bachus Won't Seek Reelection,"After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.

After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.

Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”

This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.

“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”

During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.

“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”

Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits.

“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.

Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight."

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his leadership role in the effort to defund Obamacare in the wake of attacks from the mainstream media and anonymous statements from establishment Republicans and their staffers.

“I do feel obligated to speak because Senator Cruz is my senator and I endorsed him last year in his election against Lt. Gov. [David] Dewhurst,” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) said in response to a question from Breitbart News at Thursday’s Conversations with Conservatives press event on Capitol Hill. “We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for his vision and his leadership,” he explained. “We are grateful for the fact that we are here today with this opportunity to deliver for the American people. We hope that the American people will help the Senate understand the enormous task that is in front of us.”

Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) added that Republicans are united in their push to defund Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution (CR). Labrado said he believes it is a “mistake” for some anonymous Republicans to suggest Cruz is somehow splitting the Party.

“Anonymous members and anonymous aides accusing other people of dividing the Republican Party?” Labrador said in response to Breitbart News’ question. “I think that’s a mistake. I think we’re behind this move.”

“I think you’re going to see a huge number of members, in fact, I almost believe that it’s going to be unanimous with the Republican members in the House,” he ventured. “I don’t think we’ve ever been this unified.”

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), along with House conservative leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Tom Graves (R-GA), deserve credit for helping unite the Republican Party around the effort to defund Obamacare. He said the American people also deserve credit for rising up and demanding their lawmakers fight for them.

“I’ll just echo that the Senators are getting credit and Tom Graves and Jim Jordan and others for helping get us to this point,” Duncan said. “They all deserve credit. But I’ll tell you what: The involvement of the American people cannot be ignored in this. Their voices were heard.”

“They made phone calls to our offices. They came to a rally here in Washington. They made personal contact during August at town halls,” he continued.” The American people got engaged and so I don’t want to discount them at all and I actually want to give them all the credit for getting us where we are today on this.”

Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) argued that the current debate is the result of the American people wanting leaders in Congress like Cruz to stand up and defund Obamacare.

“Republicans are always blamed for defunding Obamacare and this is like 30 or 40 times we’ve done that,” Yoho said. “We’re not doing it because we want to do it. It’s because the American people have spoken up and said we want this thing done and if you go back to 2009 when the infamous words were ‘we have to pass it to see what’s in it. We have to pass it to see how it’s going to work.'”

“You’re seeing now what’s coming out and the American people don’t want it. American business said ‘no we don’t want it.’ The unions are saying ‘no we don’t want it.’ So I think the people have spoken loud and clear and I’m proud to be on this team in the 113th Congress where we’ve said we’re going to do this for the American people,” he stated. “This is what’s right for our country. This is what’s going to stimulate our economy by creating jobs and getting rid of this.”

Later on Thursday on a conference call with Cruz and conservative media, Reps. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) and Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) also signaled their thanks and support for Cruz.

“It’s an honor to be on the phone with Sen. Cruz, and I think we have Jim Bridenstine on the call with us too, another great patriot,” Salmon said. “I just want to thank the leadership in the Senate of Sen. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee.”

“It’s been interesting to watch this debate develop,” Bridenstine added. “It started off when this debate first started and Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee have been doing the Lord’s work on this effort.”"

Rush Limbaugh:

Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday blasted the Republican Party as “irrelevant” and responsible for “creating one of the greatest political disasters” he’s ever seen. “I was trying to think earlier today, if ever in my life I could remember any major political party being so irrelevant,” the conservative radio host said on his show, according to a transcript. “I have never seen it. I have never seen a major political party simply occupy placeholders, as the Republican Party is doing.” Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black.

Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black. Hardliner and actual CNN contributor Erick Erickson, or maybe he's not there anymore because who the hell watches CNN these days:

I am tired of funding Republicans who campaign against Obamacare then refuse to fight. It’s time to find a new batch of Republicans to actually practice what the current crop preaches.

The Tea Party Nation is very, very sad:

Barack Obama demanded unconditional surrender from the Republican Party. He pretty much got it. […] In short, the GOP got nothing from their fight. But then again, McConnell, Boehner and the GOP establishment never tried.

As are a great many of the arsonists themselves, lighters still in hand:



@CongHuelskamp Must be kidding. After 15 days and no proposal by Obama or Reid, GOP leadership may pass Democratic deal for them? http://t.co/...

FreedomWorks and Club For Growth are frothing and foaming.



@philipaklein FreedomWorks: ""The line separating the Democrats and the Republican establishment is fading- it might have disappeared today.""

But House conservatives like Raul Labrador know what the real problem with their plan was. It's the fault of that damn meddling media for saying House Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare instead of calmly explaining that the Republicans merely wanted to reasonably exchange defunding or delaying the law in exchange for allowing the federal government to continue to function. Stop painting us as unreasonable!

""We never asked for a full repeal of Obamacare because we can't get that,"" he said. ""We have voted on a full repeal of Obamacare that the Senate has rejected every single time. But what we were asking for, our position from the beginning, was exchanging a one-year CR for a one-year delay of Obamacare. That was something we thought both sides were giving on something.""

John Boehner may have decided that he'd rather not plunge the United States into default quite just yet, but the true believers? They're mad. Really, really mad. A roundup of arsonist reactions:

http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/christies-honeymoon-with-conservatives-is-over/,2013-02-27 00:00:00,['Nate Silver'],Conservatives’ Love Affair With Christie Is Over,"Christopher Gregory/The New York Times

In September 2011, when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was considering making a last-minute entry into the presidential race, I pointed out an incongruity in Republican attitudes toward him. Many Republican organizations and activists, including some very conservative ones, were enthusiastic about the possibility that Mr. Christie might enter the presidential race. But Mr. Christie’s history of actions and issue statements was fairly moderate.

Roughly 18 months later, the attitude toward Mr. Christie has changed. Mr. Christie has not been invited to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, which will gather next month. Mr. Christie’s failure to be invited is not a mere oversight; virtually every other prominent Republican who might be a plausible nominee in 2016 has been asked to participate.

Isn’t it premature to conclude very much about 2016 dynamics based on something that is happening in February 2013?

Actually, as I wrote in my piece on Marco Rubio week, the Republican primary is already under way. Candidates like Mr. Rubio, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, and Bobby Jindal are already positioning themselves with an eye toward 2016.

The broader public certainly won’t be paying much attention to what they do or say for a very long time. But the nomination process is as much an inside game as an exercise in voting. The candidates who perform well in the so-called invisible primary — the phase of the campaign when candidates seek to accumulate scarce resources like money, endorsements, staff talent and favorable relationships with the news media — will be far better positioned to succeed once voters in Iowa and New Hampshire get to have their say.

The veto of Mr. Christie by CPAC, which represents a relatively broad coalition of conservative and Republican interest groups, is an ominous sign for him. Candidates who have won the CPAC straw poll in the recent past include Mitt Romney and Rudolph W. Giuliani, other Republicans with whom some conservatives have had considerable disagreements. So the fact that Mr. Christie has not even been invited to the conference this year says something.

Mr. Christie was in good graces of CPAC as recently as last June, when he was the headliner at a regional conference the group sponsored in Chicago.

So what has changed? Is it Mr. Christie, or is it CPAC?

In fact, I’m not sure that either has. Instead, what seems to have changed is the salience of different issues, as driven by major news events over the past year.

Mr. Christie has long been an advocate of gun-control policies, for example. But that issue has become far more relevant since the shootings in Newtown, Conn.

Mr. Christie has also taken moderate positions on immigration. Immigration was an issue in the 2012 campaign, but it seems to have grown in importance now, after the poor performance of the Republicans with Hispanic voters in November, and the push by President Obama and by some Republicans in Congress for immigration legislation.

Of course, there was Hurricane Sandy, which yielded Mr. Christie’s literal and figurative embrace of Mr. Obama, and his later criticism of Congressional Republicans for failing to pass a disaster-relief bill. This is an important symbolic issue, but would Mr. Christie have behaved differently if the storm had hit in 2010 or 2011?

And on Tuesday, Mr. Christie became the eighth Republican governor to announce that he will accept Medicaid expansion under the president’s health care law, in spite of his party’s general opposition to the law.

Contrast this to the political climate in late 2011, when Mr. Christie was winning praise from conservatives for his statements toward teachers’ unions — an issue that was then in the news because of the protests against efforts by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin to curtail benefits for public-sector unions in that state. Mr. Christie also takes relatively conservative views on gay marriage and abortion, social issues that had the stage more to themselves in 2011, but which may have to compete more against immigration and gun control in the next political cycle.

So far as I can tell, Mr. Christie hasn’t changed his positions on any of these issues very much. Rather, it’s that Mr. Christie had a number of relatively moderate positions to begin with, along with some conservative ones.

Does that mean there could be a reconciliation between Mr. Christie and conservative groups later on? It’s certainly possible. Surely the news cycle will shift again. And Mr. Christie could shift his stances to the right, especially once he secures re-election in New Jersey next year, as he is heavily favored to do.

But my premise when I wrote about Mr. Christie in 2011 was that conservatives had been underrating how moderate Mr. Christie was — perhaps because they were so desperate at that time to find alternatives to Mr. Romney and their other candidates. Now that he’s been “outed” as a moderate, it may be hard to close the closet door.

Mr. Christie, meanwhile, will need to consider whether to compete for the Republican nomination in 2016. While the mainstream media tends to chronically overrate the likelihood of a viable independent bid for the presidency, Mr. Christie would be better positioned to seek one than most, with very high favorability ratings among independent voters and the access to money and news media attention that comes from being a prominent politician in the Northeast. Or he could shoot for another office. Because of the ethical cloud surrounding Senator Robert Menendez, the Democratic incumbent in New Jersey, the Senate race in New Jersey could be very competitive in 2018.

Mr. Christie’s relationship with conservative Republicans, however, may have been doomed from the start."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/10/Coulter-Addresses-USC-Republican-Tea-Party-Event,2013-11-10 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Coulter Jokes, Provokes at USC Republican-Tea Party Event","Conservative columnist Ann Coulter entertained an audience of 400 at the University of Southern California on Sunday night at an event co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, a local Tea Party group.

Fears of large and violent protests failed to materialize, as five peaceful demonstrators were the only presence outside the Ronald Tudor Campus Center.

Coulter spoke at length about crime, and the New York of the 1980s–to which, she joked, New Yorkers were about to return with leftist Bill de Blasio as mayor. (She is re-reading Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities to prepare, she joked.)

Though she has written about race and crime, she is an equal-opportunity critic–arguing, for instance, that accused murderer Amanda Knox was protected by the U.S. media because she is a “pretty white girl.”

There were plenty of macabre jokes to follow–including an extended riff on how several MSNBC hosts would each commit suicide (“Chris Matthews would bungle it…Al Sharpton would do it in such a way as to blame some poor white guy”). On a more serious note, she slammed MSNBC for attacking what they called “pro-rape Republicans” over the Jamie Lee Jones rape case, in which the victim’s claims were dismissed and she was ordered to pay the attorneys’ costs of her former employer, an American military contractor.

Likewise, she noted that MSNBC had pushed the false allegation that a U.S. Census Bureau worker had been a victim of a right-wing attack, when in fact he had committed suicide in apparent insurance fraud scheme.

In her remarks, conducted in an interview format, Coulter fielded questions about her new book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3–Especially a Republican. She criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his support for immigration reform (“amnesty”) and for playing into sudden enthusiasm in the mainstream media for his political prospects.

She also had a few choice words for those who she said were not true Tea Partiers–evidently including Liz Cheney in that category for challenging Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming: “If only she’d moved to South Carolina to run against Lindsey Graham.”

Coulter described the Senate Conservatives Fund as a “fake group”: “On their ‘About’ page, they won’t tell me who runs it–George Soros, George Soros, George Soros.” Her message was that Republicans had to unite to unseat Senate Democrats rather than following new, would-be leaders into internecine party strife.

“Look, unless they get a good candidate to run against Lindsey Graham, I don’t think they should primary him either, and he’s my favorite candidate to primary.” She criticized the nomination of Christine O’Donnell in 2010, saying that the Delaware seat in the U.S. Senate she contested was now lost to the GOP “forever.”

She joked that Republicans needed to do a better job of removing primary candidates who could not win a general election. “We need a Luca Brasi,” she said, referring to the assassin in The Godfather, offering herself as a volunteer.

In the question-and-answer session that followed, Coulter defended her support for the Iraq War–a “magnificent war,” she said, whose gains President Barack Obama had been “pissing away.” She noted that Iraq had been relatively stable during the Arab Spring, and that the case for war in 2003 remained strong, including suspected links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.

Asked about GOP strategy in 2014 and 2016, Coulter said: “Why do we keep using the same strategists? Because we don’t know their names.” She said that her book was the beginning of an effort to expose failed consultants who had misled candidates into believing they could win in places where they could not. “I think a lot of these Tea Party groups are George Soros fronts,” she warned. She lamented that Republicans had lost the Virginia gubernatorial race, saying that Ken Cuccinelli had suffered from a “fake libertarian” spoiler and was dragged down by “a black Christian minister [E.W. Jackson] who could not win a statewide election” because of his social views.

On a more encouraging note, she said that Democrats would struggle without Obama in the presidential race: “They have a suck-ass ‘B team.'”

At the close, a liberal student asked politely “what kind of world” Coulter was looking for, citing some of her more offensive Google quotes.

“My ideal world is a world without liberals,” she said, to laughter and applause."

(CNN) - Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, called on the president Saturday to delay the individual mandate in the health care law that requires Americans to obtain insurance or face a penalty.

The GOP-controlled House passed a bill this summer urging the administration to do so, but the bill has no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.



The administration already announced it would delay a provision requiring businesses with more than 50 employees to provide insurance.

""It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate,"" the congresswoman said in the GOP weekly address. ""Let’s delay this health care law not just for some, but for all Americans.""

Read a full transcript of her remarks below.



It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate.

Hi I'm Shelley Moore Capito, and I represent West Virginia’s Second Congressional District.

Last month, members of both parties came together in the House to pass legislation delaying the individual mandate in the president’s health care law.

Because you and your family deserve the same relief the president gave to big businesses by delaying the employer mandate – it’s only fair.

Actually, it’s more than fair when you look at how this law is already raising costs, hurting jobs, and reducing access to the plans and the doctors you like.

Recent developments have proven the wisdom – and the urgency – of this bipartisan vote.

More companies have said that because of this law, they’ll have to shift full-time workers to part-time and lay off others altogether.

More states have detailed the rate shock consumers will soon experience.

And just days ago, it came to light that the president gave big businesses another pass – this time at the behest of insurance companies that say they need more time to comply. Meanwhile, yes, you and your family are expected to adhere to all the prescribed mandates, as scheduled.

Where’s the fairness in that?

The president claims this law is “working the way it’s supposed to,” but clearly it’s not. Not when the administration is missing deadlines, issuing waivers, and granting delays hand over fist. Things have become so bad that the administration wants to rely on the ‘honor system’ to verify who is eligible for subsidies. Senator Max Baucus was right about this law he helped write: it’s a ‘train wreck.’

The need for the bipartisan, House-passed delay of the individual mandate couldn’t be plainer. Yet, even though the president has already signed seven bills that repeal or defund parts of this law, he has threatened to veto this one.

Mr. President, in light of this latest unfair delay, we ask you to reconsider. It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate. Let’s delay this health care law not just for some, but for all Americans. That would only be fair. That would be government working the way it’s supposed to.

For now, Republicans will continue to work to protect all Americans from the president’s health care law so we can focus on patient-centered reforms that actually lower costs and help jobs.

Thank you for listening, and enjoy your weekend."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/rand-paul-filibuster_n_2819740.html,2013-03-06 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Rand Paul Filibusters John Brennan Nomination,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday he intended to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as director of the CIA, citing concerns about President Barack Obama's policy on civil liberties.

""I will speak until I can no longer speak,"" Paul said.

Paul, an outspoken libertarian, pointed to what he called the abuses of executive power and civil liberties under Obama's administration. In particular, he objected to the contents of a letter he received from Attorney General Eric Holder that asserted the U.S. government had the legal authority to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil.

""Where is the Barack Obama of 2007?"" he asked, referring to then-presidential candidate Obama's criticism of Bush-era violations of civil liberties. ""If there were an ounce of courage in this body, I would be joined by many other senators,"" he added. ""Are we going to give up our rights to politicians?""

Paul had asked the Justice Department about the constitutionality of drone strikes and whether they could be used agains U.S. citizens. Holder responded in a letter that conceded the military could authorize a drone strike on U.S. soil.

""It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.

Paul elaborated on his concern Wednesday: ""When I asked the president, 'Can you kill an American on American soil,' it should have been an easy answer. It’s an easy question. It should have been a resounding an unequivocal, ‘No.’ The president’s response? He hasn’t killed anyone yet. We’re supposed to be comforted by that. The president says, ‘I haven’t killed anyone yet.’ He goes on to say, ‘And I have no intention of killing Americans. But I might.’ Is that enough? Are we satisfied by that?""

Paul started his filibuster speech around 11:45 a.m. Unlike most modern filibusters, the Kentucky senator is actually attempting to talk through the whole thing -- like Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" -- rather than simply raising his hand to object and requiring 60 votes to proceed. The last ""talking"" filibuster was in 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), spoke out against extending the Bush-era tax cuts. Filibuster reform advocates have proposed returning to this old-fashioned style.

""I will not sit quietly and let him shred the constitution,"" Paul said of Obama, later adding that getting an answer from the president on drone strikes was like ""pulling teeth.""

The White House declined to comment Wednesday.

Paul's speech drew on the work of bloggers from both the left and right who have criticized the president on civil liberties, such as Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian and Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic. Kevin Williamson of the National Review also earned a mention for a piece he wrote asking whether under Obama's standards the Nixon and Johnson administrations should have bombed college campuses.

""To be bombed in your sleep? There's nothing American about that,"" Paul said. ""There's nothing constitutional about that.""

Last week, Paul voted for the nomination of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary -- another key Obama national security appointment -- after first voting against cloture on the matter, saying he was using his vote to try to get more information about Hagel.

Brennan's confirmation was expected as soon as Wednesday, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Following Paul's filibuster, the aide was still ""cautiously optimistic"" that once the senator ended his speech a time agreement for a vote could be reached.

Paul also used his filibuster Wednesday to speak out against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He conceded that he would have supported the Afghanistan war at the outset, but said it had since become far wider than its initial response to the Sept. 11 attacks.

""The problem is as this war has dragged on, they take that authorization of use of force to mean pretty much anything, and so they have now said that the war has no geographic limitations,"" he said. ""So it's really not a war in Afghanistan, it's a war in Yemen, Somalia, Mali. It's a war in unlimited places.""

Paul went on to reprimand Congress for ceding its authority to govern U.S. wars. ""Were we a body that cared about our prerogative to declare war, we would take that power back,"" he said. ""But I'll tell you how poor -- and this is on both sides of the aisle -- how poor is our understanding or belief in retaining that power here.""

This is a developing story. Updates will appear below:

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined the filibuster just before 3 p.m., giving Paul a break after more than three hours of speaking.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) then took over for Lee just after 3:10 p.m. ""You must surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile,"" he said.

Paul resumed speaking around 3:45 p.m, and the filibuster went bipartisan just before 4:00 pm, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) joined in.

Wyden said he intended to vote for Brennan's confirmation, but added that the nomination provided an opportunity to seek more information on the Obama administration's legal documentation for targeted killings. He said the Senate Intelligence Committee had gotten that information.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came to the Senate floor to ask a question of Paul just before 4:20 p.m. Rubio did not criticize the administration's targeted-killings policy per se, but he defended the Senate's right to ask questions of presidential appointment nominees.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined the filibuster just before 4:40 p.m. The Georgia senator, who is retiring in 2014, said that he thought the administration should be capturing and interrogating more suspected militants, rather than launching drone strikes at them. He said that he did not support the nomination of John Brennan.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to the floor at about 4:45 p.m. to try to invoke cloture on the Brennan nomination to allow the vote to happen Wednesday night.

Sen. Paul (R-Ky.) said he would be happy to vote, but that he hasn't gotten the answer he wanted, and therefore objected to holding the vote.

The filibuster showed no signs of stopping as it entered its eighth hour Wednesday evening. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) read aloud supportive tweets.

""I think the technical term for what the Twitterverse is doing right now is called 'blowing up,'"" he said.

Meanwhile, Obama and several Republican senators were dining at the Jefferson Hotel, meeting in an attempt to find a replacement plan for the automatic spending cuts that took effect March 1.

Just after 9:15 p.m., Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) joined the filibuster as it neared 10 hours.

Close to 11:30 p.m., Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) took to the Senate floor, followed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell expressed support for Paul's efforts, and said that he would not support Brennan's nomination if Reid invoked cloture.

Have those steadfast on obstructing and delaying the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) not understand that they will be causing the suffering and likely deaths of many because of their failed ideology. What do they have to offer citizens if they were miraculously able to stymie Obamacare? The answer is the same it has been for decades; nothing.

What is true is that over the last several months Republican politicians have been in a competition with themselves. It has been a competition as to who can be the most aggressive in obstructing the President on every issue. At no time is the well-being of American citizens considered. It has been simply a visceral hate for the President and his policies no matter how many people it helps.

Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens (R) is the latest candidate attempting to out macho other Republicans in what he is doing to obstruct Obamacare. When one listens to the thrill in his voice on how he intends to attempt to stymie the health insurance exchanges, it is rather scary. It is hard to believe that politicians would attempt to use the law in Jim Crow fashion to cause actual harm to the citizens of their state. What is even scarier is the response, the applause, and cheers by the audience. Can they not see the evil in their actions?

The Affordable Care Act made provisions for ‘navigators’. These are people hired by organizations to help people purchase health insurance policies. The federal government is offering training programs and grants to help create these ‘navigators’. In order to obstruct this process, Hudgens says in the video below,

The problem is Obamacare. We’ve got to now determine what we can do to solve that problem. Let me tell you what we are doing; everything in our power to be an obstructionist. You have probably have heard about the exchanges. Well exchanges are coming to Georgia, not the state is not setting them up. The federal government is going to set them up. But we have passed a law and with the help of senator McCoon and others, we have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance.The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we’ll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we’re going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write ‘navigator test’ on it

He has also stated that Georgia has passed a law that forces insurance companies to state specifically that any rate increases are not the fault of the Governor, general assembly, or department of insurance but because of Obamacare. In other words irrespective of reasons, he forces insurance companies to lie.

Americans are waking up. Several town halls have proven that the expectations many Republicans had that opponents of Obamacare would storm town halls did not materialize. In fact the opposite has occurred (see here and here).

One can only hope that Democrats fight with this same intensity promoting Obamacare. Moreover one hopes the Democrats will campaign on Obamacare during the 2014 campaign. There is ample video of many Republicans who in order to placate the Tea Party overtly take positions on Obamacare that hurt the well-being of their constituencies. As Obamacare is rolled out successfully in states that put the well-being of their citizens ahead of ideology, state run by obstructionist will kick them out of office as citizens realize they were lied to.

We had no idea that the ad was being aired during his show. We have made the call to Clear Channel to remove our ad immediately.""

The StopRush count for today - 2,629 Limbaugh have pulled ads

I must disclose: I am one of the many, possibly hundreds of thousands, of people protesting Limbaugh. We're everywhere - in your grocery store, at the bank, in your Facebook 'Friends' list...There are petitions, a Boycott Rush Limbaugh Facebook Group (56,500 followers), FlushRush Fight Group, a StopRush Database, a ThinkContext Limbaugh sponsor browser app, poems, lists, there's even a Daily Kos Limbaugh petition now!... it's a virtual anti-Limbaugh candy store out there. Why? The American public is done with Limbaugh's blatant racism, sexism and lgbt-hating bigotry.

Protestors are now reaching out to radio stations, the FCC and iHeart artists as well. (iHeart is owned by Clear Channel run by Bob Pittman). To be sure, Pittman is feeling the bite. Clear Channel has lost hundreds of millions since the protests began. Cumulus Radio Network also complains of losing millions to Rush smut. A rep from the company says 49 out of 50 advertisers have 'No-Rush' clauses when buying air time. There is also talk that Limbaugh may have broken a few federal FCC Laws Telecommunications Act.

The public is not going to give up. They are going to find some way to end Limbaugh's reign of hate. You just don't get to call a woman a slut and prostitute on air, for three days, and not expect consequences. He compares same-sex marriage to pedophilia and animal sex, calls children on government assisted lunches, 'serfs and waifs,' mocked and accused Michael J. Fox of faking his Parkinson Disease... The list is long and documented thanks to Media Matters going back to 2006. Au Revoir, Rush.



""As it happens we agree with your analysis of Mr. Limbaugh and his message of rancor and hate, and have asked WSB to not air our ads during his show. This is, we might add, very unusual for us in that we firmly believe in the First Amendment and the right of all to speak their minds as they see fit. But Mr. Limbaugh seems beyond the pale in his ravings, and perhaps beyond what the Founding Fathers contemplated when framing the Constitution.""(""...pale in his ravings, and perhaps beyond what the Founding Fathers contemplated."" That is rich?.)"

(CNN) – Longtime Alaska Rep. Don Young, 79, attempted to clarify Thursday his use of the derogatory term ""wetbacks"" to describe immigrant workers in an interview earlier this week.

""I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California,"" the Republican congressman said in a statement issued to a local television station in Anchorage. ""I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Young, Alaska's sole congressman, originally made the comment during a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio earlier this week. Talking about how technology is affecting the economy, he referenced an anecdote from his family's farm in California.

""My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,"" Young said. ""It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine.""

The word is widely considered an ethnic slur and generally refers to those from Mexico who come to the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande River.

The 21-term congressman later issued the statement, which didn't come as a full apology but sought to explain his reasoning behind using the word. The word was used by the U.S. government in the 1950s for ""Operation Wetback,"" a massive crackdown on illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Young's comments come at a time when the Republican Party is attempting to rebrand itself and expand its outreach to various minority groups, chief among them are Latinos.

Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, blasted Young in a statement, saying migrant workers come to the country for work and opportunities, not to ""hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials.""

""The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity,"" he continued.

GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana focused on the impact of damaging comments earlier this year, when he said at the Republican National Committee winter meeting that the GOP has ""to stop being the stupid party"" and should start talking ""like adults.""

""It's no secret we've had a number of Republicans this year damage our brands with bizarre and offensive comments,"" he said. ""I'm here to say we've had enough of that.""

“Did you see his convention speech?” she asked the crowd. “It was really bad. And I must say, though I loved Chris Christie, I’m now a single issue voter against amnesty, so Christie is off my list.” She noted, however, that Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) “is still on (her) list.” Coulter has hopes for Senator Marco Rubio (R – FL) but wondered, “Why on earth is Marco Rubio and these endless Republicans supporting [amnesty]?”

Governor Christie was not invited to the annual conference this year. The decision raised questions among conservatives again if Christie’s actions during the Romney-Ryan campaign, particularly towards the end damaged his credibility with the GOP’s conservative base.

“This year, for better or for worse, we felt like he didn’t deserve to be on the all-star selection, and for decisions that he made,” CPAC Chairman Al Cardenas told reporters. “And so hopefully next year he’s back on the right track and being a conservative.” Cardenas noted that Christie “is popular figure, but everyone needs to live by the parameters of the movement.”

Coulter said that she does not know who she is focused in on for 2016 but she described what kind of candidate should not be running. She previously supported former Republican Delaware Governor Pete du Pont, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, business mogul Steve Forbes, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter (R – CA). Coulter admitted she made mistakes with some of her past choices.

“No, you can’t run a congressman. I have learned that. You cannot run a governor from a state that’s only as big as a congressional district. That’s the equivalent of running of congressman. We can’t run businessmen, pundits,” she said, adding, “People who have not run and won elections in at least a mid-size state. We’re looking at governors and senators. Once you throw in the governors and senators, let’s see how they debate, let’s see their positions then.”

Coulter was particularly critical of conservatives who put themselves before the movement. She pointed to the Senate races lost by Republicans in 2012. Coulter pointed to former Congressman Todd Akin’s unwillingness to drop out of the Senate race in Missouri and those who supported his decision. “Passion is great but in politics, scoring is all that counts,” she said."

Former New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici told the Journal on Tuesday he fathered a son outside of his marriage over 30 years ago, revealing a secret kept for decades. Statements given to the Journal by Domenici and the son’s mother, Michelle Laxalt of Alexandria, Va., identified the son as Adam Paul Laxalt, a Nevada lawyer. Michelle Laxalt formerly was a prominent government relations consultant and television political commentator in Washington, D.C. She is a daughter of former U.S. senator and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt. [...] Michelle Laxalt said “one night’s mistake led to pregnancy” and she chose to raise the son as a single parent.

Don't you just love the smell of a Republican sex scandal in the morning?Now, far be it from us to judge what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults. After all, it's really no one's business if the former senator of New Mexico was diddling a colleague's daughter behind his wife's back. Clearly, such a private matter is nobody's business, and we should all stay out of it.

Oh, unless that senator happens to believe that the government has a vested interest in what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults, women have no right to privacy at all, and adultery ""rise[s] to the level of impeachable offenses that the Founding Fathers envisioned.""

First was the release from Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley recusing herself from a potential discipline hearing against the ""man"" accused of choking her, fellow Justice David Prosser. Bradley said that when Prosser attacked her

what happened in my office on June 13, 2011 was not an isolated event. Rather, it is one event in a history of abusive behavior in our workplace that has escalated from tantrums and rages, to threats, and now to phyiscal contact.

Bradley went on to say that she and Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson have taken to locking themselves in their offices out of fear of their safety, as they find Prosser unstable.

The Walker Administration tried to run interference and claim that they couldn't find a record of such a request, no doubt to try to feed the Charles Sykeses and Mark Bellings a meme that Bradley was lying. But former Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs backed up Bradley's account Friday afternoon, saying that Capitol Police were indeed contacted by a ""Supreme Court official,"" and put in a security plan soon thereafter.

But hey, maybe Bradley was overreacting. I mean, look at the grace in which Prosser handled being interviewed on the incident.

That doesn't look like an unstable maniac, does it?

What kept Prosser from facing criminal charges for the incident was the fact that the other 3 right-wing members of the Court - Michael Gableman, Annette Ziegler and Pat Roggensack - claimed the incident did not happen or that Prosser was somehow provoked and threatened by Bradley (who is significantly shorter and smaller than Prosser), so there wasn't enough unquestioned evidence against Prosser to charge him.

Roggensack was also called out by Bradley in her complaint, as Bradley said Roggensack deceived investigators about what happened that June day, and was lying when Roggensack claimed earlier this month that things really aren't that bad between the justices. Given that a key attack against Roggensack in the upcoming Supreme Court election will be that she is part of the problem with the Court's embarrassing dysfunction (along with her partisan, conservative record), you can see why she might want to say something like that.

But an ethics case remains from the incident, with Franklyn Gimbel as the head prosecutor for the state's Judicial Commission. That was also in the news this week because the Journal-Sentinel had a story where Gimbel said he had been told not to add any new evidence or scopes to the Prosser investigation by the state's Judicial Commission."

Sure, it would take a little chutzpah for Mr. Obama to nominate three D.C. Circuit judges at once. The move dares Republicans to filibuster confirmation of the appointments or to turn tail. It would also cheer liberals who want to flip the conservative tilt of the D.C. Circuit, not merely to see well-qualified judges serve. But it would take gall for Republicans to filibuster qualified nominees to bona fide openings on the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that Mr. Obama is trying to pack the court. That logic could be used to criticize any nomination that might upset the ideological disposition of an appeals bench. The president doesn’t just get to appoint judges to vacancies when the stakes are low.

The authors met in occupied Baghdad in 2009, when the book was conceived. Strolling among the ruins, the two became excited that consumer technology was transforming a society flattened by United States military occupation. They decided the tech industry could be a powerful agent of American foreign policy. ... “The New Digital Age” is, beyond anything else, an attempt by Google to position itself as America’s geopolitical visionary — the one company that can answer the question “Where should America go?” It is not surprising that a respectable cast of the world’s most famous warmongers has been trotted out to give its stamp of approval to this enticement to Western soft power. The acknowledgments give pride of place to Henry Kissinger, who along with Tony Blair and the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden provided advance praise for the book.

Julian Assange , the editor in chief of WikiLeaks, looks at a new book by Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen and opines on how Google's cheery motto masks a desire to become the techno-cultural might behind America's actions abroad.I don't necessarily agree with Assange's assumption of evil in this government plus tech pairing, but in light of the Araújo and Cardenal article, is this the fight we're really facing for world domination: Google against China? Is state-allied technology the answer to state-managed capitalism? (And hey, boys and girls, for 100 points, state-managed capitalism is not fascism because...?)

The New York Times highlights the very real effects of Republican grandstanding in the Senate.

A United Nations report, “The State of the World’s Children,” underscores the moral bankruptcy of Senate Republicans who blocked ratification of a treaty to help disabled people around the world. ... A United Nations convention would ban discrimination against persons with disabilities and accord them the same rights as those without disabilities. It has been ratified by 127 countries and the European Union. President Obama has signed it, but, in December, the Senate, though supporting the convention by a hefty 61 to 38, fell five votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for ratification. This was mostly because Senate Republicans caved in to far-right ideologues who contended, erroneously, that the convention would infringe on American sovereignty, usher in socialism, and allow United Nations bureaucrats to prohibit home-schooling or wrench disabled children from their parents’ arms.

According to the Tea Party, anything the United Nations does, anything other nations do, hell, anything our nation does, is intrinsically evil, and necessarily the first step in an Vast Evil Conspiracy. Never forget that the real threat isn't disease or discrimination; what's really hurting these kids is government gun grabbers taking away their right to buy bulk quantities of assault rifles without a background check.

James Marsh wants a little less jingoism with his baseball, please.

I am a Methodist minister and a Washington Nationals fan. I was there on Opening Day in 2005 at old RFK Stadium, and I try my best to plan my summer around Nats home games. I have only one issue with the ballpark experience, and it’s not with the beer prices. It’s with “God Bless America.” ... One hot Sunday afternoon last season, I did not rise for “God Bless America.” In a beer-soaked tone of voice that wasn’t pleasant, a gentleman several rows behind me told me to stand up. I reminded him that I don’t have to. This incident made me think more about the question: I love this country and don’t want to live anywhere else. But being pressured to stand up at a baseball game for a song that’s essentially a prayer seems, well, un-American. It feels like being pushed into the river for a baptism I didn’t choose. It’s an empty ritual, and one that I think doesn’t hold much theological water.

I'd like to argue that we drop the song for another reason: it's a crappy song. How about singing a verse or two of ""This land is your land"" or maybe just ""America the beautiful."" I can never get pastwithout actually tearing up.

Leonard Pitts looks at arguments that start ""I know this may seem racist, but...""

It seems Bill has an idea. Given that “all of the radical terrorists have been Muslims,” he wants the government to mount a program to surveil every follower of Islam who immigrates to these shores. We are, claims reader Bill, “faced with a population who swears an oath to God to kill Americans — not Canadians, not Mexicans, but Americans.” It is, he says, “time we protect ourselves.” ... Bill’s point is clear enough. And his anger is understandable, coming as it does after the Boston Marathon bombing and the savage butchering of a British soldier by Islamic extremists. Predictably, the UK has suffered a rash of right-wing demonstrations and attacks on mosques ever since Lee Rigby’s death. One suspects there’d be no shortage of sympathy for Bill’s suggestion — and for measures even more draconian — both there and here. But I find myself thinking about white boys. Consider: This nation’s recent history is stained by repeated acts of school violence. From Newtown, Conn., to West Paducah, Ky., to Santee, Calif., to Eugene, Ore., to Conyers, Ga., to Pearl, Miss., to Jonesboro, Ark. to DeKalb, Ill., to Littleton, Colo., we have seen scores of people killed and injured. The violence has been random, large scale and indiscriminate, identical to terrorism except that it has no political motive. And the profile of the assailants is virtually always the same: white boys and young men from suburban, small town or rural communities.

The ""tea party"" is back and is brewing trouble for the Republican establishment. After the GOP debacle in the 2012 election, when Republicans not only failed to win the presidency but blew a chance to take over the Senate, party leaders paused to consider what had gone wrong. The Republican National Committee issued a scathing report warning that the party was in ""an ideological cul-de-sac"" and resolved to act friendlier toward women, minorities and low-income voters. Strategist Karl Rove said the lesson was to nominate more moderate candidates and set about raising money to do just that. But tea party and other conservative leaders, undaunted, drew the opposite conclusion."

Smoke rises as water is sprayed at the burning remains of a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas

Gov. Rick Perry on Thursday declared McLennan County - home to West, the small community rocked by the deadly fertilizer plant explosion - a disaster area and announced that he's asking President Barack Obama for a federal emergency declaration as well.

That's not an unreasonable request, and the victims of the fire and the residents of West deserve it. (Even if West Fertilizer Co should ultimately pay the costs for gross negligence.)

Still, it's curious seeing Perry run to the feds after hearing his secessionist rhetoric because of the ""oppressive"" federal government. And he's joined in the hall of hypocrisy by the rest of the area's federal delegation.



U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, whose district includes West, called on all Americans to pray for the victims of this tragedy [...] ""I am grateful for all of the police, fire, emergency responders and volunteers from our community and around the state who have come to aid those in need,"" he said. ""Our offices will continue to monitor the aftermath and be on hand to assist our friends and neighbors throughout the recovery process.""

""It was too large,"" Flores said about the latest bill Wednesday. “It does more than meet the immediate needs of Sandy victims."" Flores, whose district includes Waco, said he could have supported an earlier version of the bill with $17 billion in aid if it had been offset by federal spending reductions.

U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas released a joint statement saying they are among those grieving for those who were injured or lost loved ones in the blast. ""(We) are grateful to the firefighters and first responders who risked their own lives to keep others safe,"" they said. ""We ask all Texans to keep West in their thoughts and prayers. We remain in communication with Gov. Perry's office and emergency management officials, and stand to offer whatever support we can.""

How does Flores plan on assisting? By asking for federal aid presumably (his prayers won't accomplish anything tangible), the same kind of federal aid he voted against for Sandy victims.Then there are the two Texas senators:Both Cornyn and Cruz voted against Sandy aid as well, of course. What kind of aid do they think they are proposing for West? Aside from their prayers, that is.

Again, the federal government will and should absolutely lend resources to the town's recovery. But perhaps the state's politicians should be less hostile toward similar aid to other parts of the country. Otherwise, the people of West and their neighbors should reconsider reelecting people like Flores with 80 percent of the vote.

Either we're all in this together, or we're not.

You though Rupert Murdoch was bad? Just wait till you meet the Kochtopus.

Think Progress Media:

The Koch brothers own Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in America, and bankroll a network of Tea Party groups and Republican political war chests.

In 2012, the brothers spent millions to defeat President Obama and even sent mailers to employees urging them to support Mitt Romney and other conservative candidates.

David and Charles Koch, billionaire industrialists who own Koch Industries, America's second-largest privately held company, have expressed interest in the Tribune Co. newspapers. The Chicago-based empire emerged from a long bankruptcy Dec. 31 and has hired investment firms Evercore and JPMorgan Chase as offers have come in for its print properties. Tribune Co. spent more than four years in bankruptcy after being purchased by Sam Zell. Following the company's emergence from chapter 11, it named TV industry veteran Peter Liguori, formerly of Fox Entertainment and News Corp., as its CEO. Several Hollywood figures sit on its board of directors, including Ross Levinsohn, CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, parent company of THR.

The Koch brothers have long dominated American industry; their holdings include Georgia Pacific paper products as well as major fertilizer, refinery and oil pipeline companies. More recently they have become known for their financial support of Republican candidates, especially those from the Tea Party, and the fight against regulations and legislation aimed at curbing climate change.

The latest rumor about the next owner of the L.A. Times, which is for sale, is a doozy. A bombshell. It's a doozy wrapped in a bombshell exploding inside a Drudge siren. Multiple sources tell L.A. Weekly that Charles and David Koch -- the infamous right-wing billionaire brothers -- are considering an offer on either the Tribune Co. newspaper group, which includes the L.A. Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun or the entire Tribune Co., which includes more than 20 stations like WGN and KTLA Channel 5. The Koch Brothers are most famous for spending boatloads of money on Republican and libertarian political candidates and causes, favoring lower taxes, fewer regulations and weakening union influence. It's hard to believe there's a chance that the liberal and Hollywood-adjacent Los Angeles Times might one day be owned by the Koch Brothers.

TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's excoriation of House Speaker John Boehner commanded national attention Wednesday — carried live by CNN, making his last name one of the top trending words on Twitter for the rest of the day, analyzed and deconstructed by countless pundits and columnists.

One question raised in some quarters was whether Christie, a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, had hurt himself in GOP circles by bashing his party's House speaker, who already was politically wobbled from the conclusion of the ""fiscal cliff"" showdown.

Christie said in a Friday interview that he has no concerns that he damaged himself among Republicans nationally.

""I think what right-thinking Republicans will understand is that I'm representing my people, and that that's got to be my first and most important job,"" Christie said. ""I think the second thing that right-thinking Republicans will come to the conclusion of is that the speaker made a mistake, not only by pulling the vote but by pulling the vote and not even discussing it with anybody first.""

On Wednesday, Christie blamed the ""toxic"" nature of Congress and ""palace intrigue"" in Washington for Congress' failure to vote on aid to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.

""There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims: The House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,"" Christie said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon in Trenton.

Congress approved $9 billion in aid Friday.

Within New Jersey, the comments are unlikely to hurt Christie, who is seeking re-election this year.

""I don't have to worry ... too much. I think if you try to think about these things too hard, you wind up not being yourself. And I have no interest in not being myself,"" Christie said. ""If it angers some Republicans, I'm sorry. I don't think it should. I think they'd want their governor to do exactly the same thing in the same circumstances. In fact, they would expect him or her to do that, so they shouldn't have any different expectations of me.

""I love my party. I'm a Republican,"" he said. ""I have great respect for the speaker, but he just was wrong on this one.""

The governor said his office received 800 supportive emails and 1,000 phone calls from New Jersey residents the afternoon of the news conference and only a few negative reactions, all from out-of-state."

A former Marquette classmate has written about Walker's time on the Avenue, and intimates quite clearly what has been a persistent rumor in alumni circles -- that Walker was asked to leave Marquette due to some academic shenanigans. Thus far, Walker has declined to release his college transcripts, so the question remains open. Noonan's Law applies — is it irresponsible to speculate? It would be irresponsible not to.

There are many delicious details at the link, including the college newspaper concluding that Walker was ""unfit for office"" due to his being ""sanctioned for illegal campaigning on numerous occasions, and brutal personal attacks upon his opponent’s character."" Plus, ""Walker’s campaign was secretly and systematically (stealing and) throwing out copies of the newspaper that endorsed his opponent"" (prior to the ""unfit for office"" editorial), and newspapers never like that kind of theft.

But the key bit is this:



I wish I could say definitely why he never graduated – it is a closely guarded secret. I believe the general line of thinking – that Scott Walker was caught cheating.

Well, that makes sense.

Walker was not a good student -- he has refused to release his transcripts, but his 2010 campaign said that his GPA was 2.59.

And then there's the timing issue -- Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986 and left sometime in 1990, which is four, or three and a half at least, years.

Yet he was substantially short of the credit hours required for graduation:



Walker released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. He had 94 credits and would have needed at least 36 more. The exact number of credits he needed isn't clear because students must take classes in certain areas of study to get degrees.

Somewhere along the way, Walker lost a year's worth of college credit.

Maybe, in the two years he was running for college offices, he took some incompletes that he did not make up.

Maybe his parents decided they did not want to fund a five-year plan.

Maybe Walker got caught cheating, and was told to get out of Marquette and not return.

So he didn't.

Walker's ancient history is, IMHO, far more relevant than Romney's prep-school bullying or Obama's teen-age drug use -- Walker was a far-right pol in training at Marquette, his college campaigns were wingnut, dirty and fact-free, and he moved as quickly as possible into political office.

In the words of Babu Bhatt, Walker is a very, very bad man.

And has been since Marquette.

Tom Barrett needs lots of help to retire Walker, those of you with credit cards can help here."

McDonnell UPDATED x1 w,"Rachel also tallied up all the other gifts the same donor gave Governor Bob and family:

A $6,000 Rolex watch that the Governor dishonestly claimed was a gift from his wife.

A multi-thousand dollar suede Oscar De La Renta jacket for the wife.

A multi-thousand dollar Louis Vuitton handbag, also for the wife.

2 pairs of sooper fancy shoes for the wife.

An expensive designer dress for the wife.

These are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.

Rachel then showed excerpts of an interview the Governor gave yesterday, in which he said the donor ""received nothing"" in exchange for all these riches. Rachel quickly proved this was a lie. He got a launch party at the Governor's mansion for his 'magic quit smoking drug'. He also got meetings with state officials regarding the same drug. And the Governor's wife has also been criss-crossing the country touting the awesomeness of this drug. The donor even got a photo of the Governor himself smiling as he holds up a bottle of said drug. ""Nothing"", Governor? really?

But Rachel wasn't done. There's apparently a second scandal, in which the Governor charged thousands of dollars to the state for 'off to college' supplies for his children. She enumerated those as well, from snack foods to toiletries.

Rachel brilliantly reminded viewers that the Governor receives a yearly salary of $175,000, but that all this stuff was not paid for with that money. What a grifter!

I thought Rachel couldn't have been more thorough in her take-down of Señor Ultrasound. But after the break, she had a Virginia State Senator with her, live, who demanded that Governor McDonnell resign immediately.

Go Rachel! I will try to post the video the moment it becomes available.

You would click on the link, and there you’d find the Tea Party Patriots’ mailer, calling for liberty and asking for money, decrying “big-government Republicans” and “leftist Obama Democrats” alike.

But the real target of this particular pitch was none other than Karl Rove himself, the “architect” of George W. Bush’s two White House wins, accused in the ad of trying to “crush the Tea Party movement.”

And he was depicted as a Nazi.

Newsweek John Avlon

Photoshopped into the uniformed visage of vicious SS commandant Heinrich Himmler, no less – the architect of the Holocaust.

It’s hard to imagine a more offensive piece of political e-mail.

Not surprisingly, within hours, the e-mail was retracted and apologies offered all around. It was a terrible case of mistaken identity, an inexplicable bit of human error, the Tea Party Patriots said through a high-priced PR agent when called by Politico’s Ken Vogel, who broke the story. The Virginia-based political fundraising firm, Active Engagement, promptly fell on its sword, which is the decent thing to do when you’ve been paid $1.5 million and screw up this definitively.

The tea party’s impulse to attack Rove personally – so deeply felt that putting an SS uniform on him seemed like a good idea to somebody in the chain of command – is a sign of just how bitter this GOP civil war is becoming.

Rove’s alleged sin is the formation of a group dedicated to nominating electable congressional candidates for the GOP. It seems that some folks in “the establishment” don’t like losing Senate races every year because the partisan primary system keeps kicking up extreme candidates who are beloved by the hyperpartisan base but can’t win in a general election.

Cases in point: Senate candidates Sharron Angle, Ken Buck and Christine (“I am not a witch”) O’Donnell in 2010; the no-abortion-even-in-cases-of-rape duo Richard Mourdock and Todd Aiken in 2012. If those five tea party favorites hadn’t imploded in spectacular fashion, Republicans could be in control of the Senate right now.

So Rove & Co. are backing more centrist Republican candidates who they think have a chance.

Borger: Obama can’t kick his legacy down the road

The midterms are 18 months away, but the fault lines are already forming. Two states – Georgia and Iowa – appear primed to put forward the next Angle and Aiken in the form of two right-wing congressmen: Paul Broun and Steve King.

It turns out that Broun has a bit of a Nazi-calling problem himself. Days after Barack Obama’s first election in 2008, Broun was first out of the gate on this ugly front, comparing the president-elect to Hitler.

In his apology, Broun tortuously explained that “I’m just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may – may not, I hope not – but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism.” In recent years, Broun has become best known for proclaiming evolution and the big-bang theory “lies from the pit of hell” and asserting his belief that the Earth is 9,000 years old. Despite these and many other slips into the fringe, Broun was uncontested in his most recent election and serves on the House Science Committee. If he is the GOP nominee, Democrats could have a chance at winning the Georgia Senate seat for the first time since Max Cleland.

Likewise, Iowa congressman Steve King is the proud father of a steady stream of hyperpartisan howlers, beginning in the 2008 election, when he predicted that if Obama were elected, “The radical Islamists, the al Qaeda … would be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11, because they would declare victory in this war on terror.” When the McCain campaign sensibly disavowed his statements, King pushed back and said terrorists would view Obama as their “savior” and “That’s why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him.” Tell that to Osama bin Laden.

In recent years, King has been the lone “no” vote on a congressional resolution apologizing for the use of slaves in building the U.S. Capitol, supported deporting “anchor babies” and, yes, defended Akin’s campaign comments by saying he hadn’t heard of any young woman getting pregnant from rape or incest. You see pretty quickly where this campaign is likely to go in a swing state that voted for Obama twice.

LZ Granderson: Rubio missed the year of the woman

Nonetheless, Broun has thrown his hat in the ring, and polls show King a favorite among rank-and-file conservatives in Iowa. Hence Rove’s group, getting ready to do some reverse RINO-hunting of its own with a spinoff of the Crossroads super PAC. It’s called “The Conservative Victory Project.”

I appreciate how tea party groups might howl when the outside money is directed against them, but a taste of your own medicine is sometimes morally clarifying.

In a larger sense, this family feud is fascinating for several reasons. It represents a realization by Rove – the father of the “red state vs. blue state,” “play to the base” strategy – that there is such a thing as too extreme. Some of the forces that the Republican establishment encouraged when its self-righteous hate was directed against Obama have found that venom can be directed at them. In this same vein, House Speaker John Boehner has found that 50 or so tea party radicals are his biggest problem in governing; they are quick to undercut him and eager to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United State. Golem always turns on its creator.

In the end, the Republican Party does need to reform. It needs to rebuild the big tent and reach out beyond its base. It needs to stop coddling the angry and unhinged in its ranks. And it needs to become more philosophically consistent when it comes to advancing individual freedom as well as fiscal responsibility.

Count me with Karl Rove and Co. – in at least this one case. The Tea Party Patriots’ misfired e-mail was an ugly tell, a reminder that angry conservative populist passions can transform into a mob mentality. Extremes are always ultimately their own side’s worst enemy.

Before Joining The Post', 'She Was A Political Columnist', 'Food Writer At The Baltimore Sun', 'She Has Also Worked For The Associated Press', 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram', 'The Hartford Courant.']",Mansion spending records indicate improper billing by Virginia governor and his family,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, have used taxpayer money for a range of small personal items they should have paid for themselves under state policy, according to spending records.

The McDonnells have billed the state for body wash, sunscreen, dog vitamins and a digestive system “detox cleanse,” the records show. They also have used state employees to run personal errands for their adult children. In the middle of a workday, for example, a staffer retrieved Rachel McDonnell’s newly hemmed pants at a tailoring shop nine miles from the governor’s mansion. Another time, a state worker was dispatched to a dry cleaner 20 miles away to pick up a storage box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress.

About six months into the governor’s term, the official who oversees mansion spending told the McDonnells that they should not have charged taxpayers for a number of expenses, including deodorant, shoe repairs and dry-cleaning their children’s clothing. The official asked the McDonnells to pay the state back more than $300, which they did, and also gave them a refresher on what the state will and won’t provide for occupants of the governor’s mansion.

But since that time, state records show that the McDonnells have continued to let taxpayers pick up the tab for numerous personal items, including vitamins, nasal spray and sleep-inducing elixirs.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Washington Post sought records of personal expenses covered by the state over the couple’s 31 / 2 years in the mansion. The full cost of those items is unknown because the state released only 16 sales receipts, most of them from 2011. State records show that there were many more personal shopping trips — nine others in January 2011 alone, including two to Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up “college stuff” for the McDonnells’ children.

The McDonnells repaid the state for at least some personal items purchased on those occasions. But without receipts, it is impossible to know whether they fully reimbursed taxpayers. The few receipts that were released show only partial repayment.

McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin declined to say why other receipts were not released.

Based on the disclosed records, the amount of personal expenses the McDonnells billed to the state is small — less than $600, including the $300 they repaid. But the disclosure comes at time when spending at Virginia’s Executive Mansion is already under scrutiny.

The FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the $15,000 catering tab at Cailin McDonnell’s mansion wedding in June 2011 that was paid by a McDonnell campaign donor. That same donor, Star Scientific chief executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also lent the governor his Ferrari, lakeside vacation home and private jet. A Richmond prosecutor also is investigating whether the governor violated state gift disclosure laws.

Emerging as the former mansion chef faces charges of stealing food from the kitchen, the McDonnells’ expense records provide some insight into how the executive home has been managed. The chef has alleged that the McDonnells — already entitled to a free mansion, food, personal chef, maids and one of nation’s few state-funded butlers — have engaged in petty pilfering.

In court filings submitted as part of his defense, chef Todd Schneider has said that the McDonnells’ five children raided the mansion kitchen and liquor cabinet, taking large quantities of food and alcohol to their own homes or college dorm rooms. He also said that Maureen McDonnell had given away mansion pots and pans to her three daughters. McDonnell has declined to respond to those accusations, noting the ongoing criminal case against the chef.

Martin said the McDonnells have sought to properly distinguish personal expenses from state ones while living in the mansion, a 200-year-old Federal-style gem that is a public building and a private residence.

“Every Administration strives to balance private family life with the official state functions that are all occurring under the same roof, at the same time,” Martin said in an e-mail. “It is a balance and there is a constant effort to ensure that it is appropriately managed. The McDonnell Administration has adhered to precedent in reimbursing the state for items meant for personal use.”

In the McDonnell family’s first six months in the mansion, taxpayers paid for dry-cleaning the twin sons’ suits and shirts, repairing the first lady’s shoes and putting new shoulder pads into an item of her clothing. The McDonnells billed their energy drinks, body wash, deodorant and breath-freshening strips to the state as well.

Virginians paid for a $62 laminated banner to celebrate the twins’ high school graduation, with a state employee picking up the sign at the print shop and paying for it with the mansion credit card. When Ginger, the sheltie/terrier mix billed as “Virginia’s first dog,” needed vitamins, the McDonnells passed the $9.49 expense to taxpayers.

Eventually, an official who reviews mansion spending kicked those expenses back and asked the McDonnells to reimburse the commonwealth $317.27. The McDonnells paid the money back.

“These expenses are personal ones, that due to auditing and the direction of Dennis Johnson, Division Director of DSAS [Division of Selected Agency Support Services], cannot be covered by the State or Mansion funds,” mansion director Sarah Scarbrough said in a note to the McDonnells in the fall of 2010.

The state will cover the cost of dry-cleaning for the governor and first lady, basic hygiene items, “including toilet paper, mouthwash, bar soap,” cleaning and laundry supplies, and food for family meals, state functions and events, Johnson said in the memo.

But it does not cover the cost of clothing alterations, dry-cleaning for other family members, deodorant or body wash, pet food or treats, or food for non-family meals or non-state functions, Johnson wrote.

The McDonnells directly pushed back on one front, insisting that the state continue to pay for their energy drinks. The governor’s chief of staff, Martin Kent, overruled Johnson to allow the drinks at state expense.

“While other governors and spouses may have had bacon and eggs, or cereal, or etc for breakfast, Governor McDonnell drinks Boost every morning, and the First Lady has a 5-Hour energy and/or a Boost,” Martin wrote. “That is their breakfast. And that is why those items are covered, just like breakfast is covered for EVERY Governor and First Lady.”

Like all new governors and their families, the McDonnells were told the expense rules at the outset of the administration but needed some time for them to sink in, Johnson said in an interview. Energy drinks aside, Johnson said that ever since he gave the McDonnells their refresher on what the state will and won’t pay for, their spending has been in line with state policy.

“Typically when an administration comes in, we do discuss things,” he said. “There are growing pains, and early on in the administration, there will be some things we have to review and discuss.”

But sales receipts released by the state indicate that energy drinks are not the only extra the governor and first lady have continued to get at state expense. They went on to bill taxpayers for myriad medicine-cabinet products, vitamins and the body wash that Johnson said shouldn’t be billed, records show.

Records also show that the McDonnells used state employees to run personal errands for their children — and directed the employees to use the mansion credit card to pay for their children’s personal items.

In some cases, personal items for the McDonnell children are the only products listed on mansion credit card receipts. In those instances, the errands do not appear to have been performed in conjunction with any official state business.

In July 2011, for example, a state employee picked up Rachel McDonnell’s hemmed pants at Lucy’s Divine Creations, located 20 minutes west of the mansion. And that November, a worker was dispatched to Handcraft Cleaners, 30 minutes away, to get a box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress. The $24 charge for the hemming and the $49.50 cost of the box went on the mansion credit card. The McDonnells later repaid the state for those personal expenses, but not for the use of employee time.

Martin said that Maureen McDonnell would have run those errands herself, but because she is the first lady, she must always travel with a security detail.

“First Ladies have Executive Police Protection,” Martin wrote. “They cannot just jump in their own car and run errands. Therefore the reimbursement process exists to allow First Families to reimburse for personal items that may have been picked up by staff.”"

McDonnell UPDATED x1 w,"Rachel also tallied up all the other gifts the same donor gave Governor Bob and family:

A $6,000 Rolex watch that the Governor dishonestly claimed was a gift from his wife.

A multi-thousand dollar suede Oscar De La Renta jacket for the wife.

A multi-thousand dollar Louis Vuitton handbag, also for the wife.

2 pairs of sooper fancy shoes for the wife.

An expensive designer dress for the wife.

These are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.

Rachel then showed excerpts of an interview the Governor gave yesterday, in which he said the donor ""received nothing"" in exchange for all these riches. Rachel quickly proved this was a lie. He got a launch party at the Governor's mansion for his 'magic quit smoking drug'. He also got meetings with state officials regarding the same drug. And the Governor's wife has also been criss-crossing the country touting the awesomeness of this drug. The donor even got a photo of the Governor himself smiling as he holds up a bottle of said drug. ""Nothing"", Governor? really?

But Rachel wasn't done. There's apparently a second scandal, in which the Governor charged thousands of dollars to the state for 'off to college' supplies for his children. She enumerated those as well, from snack foods to toiletries.

Rachel brilliantly reminded viewers that the Governor receives a yearly salary of $175,000, but that all this stuff was not paid for with that money. What a grifter!

I thought Rachel couldn't have been more thorough in her take-down of Señor Ultrasound. But after the break, she had a Virginia State Senator with her, live, who demanded that Governor McDonnell resign immediately.

Go Rachel! I will try to post the video the moment it becomes available.

Politically speaking, the last thing we want to do, as we head into a crucial gubernatorial election year against one of the poster boys for the war on women (presumptive Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli - yeah, this lunatic!), is to let Republicans off the hook for their ""personhood"" amendments; their ""transvaginal ultrasounds;"" their efforts to shut down women's health, family planning and abortion clinics across the state; etc. We certainly DO NOT want to keep this out of the media, to hush it up, or to lay low on this subject.

Thankfully, Democratic Attorney General candidate, State Senator Mark Herring (D-Loudoun, Fairfax), is all over this one.



Update: 4:59 p.m. -- Herring told The Huffington Post on Friday that no kind of bargain among Senate leadership could keep him from trying to repeal the abortion clinic regulations. ""Nobody's going to be able to muzzle me on these issues,"" he said. ""I wont be a part of any kind of a deal like that. This is about fighting for what's right for women.""

That about sums it up right there, thanks to Sen. Mark Herring for putting it so clearly. The bottom line:! To the contrary, as Sen. Herring clearly understands, we should be redoubling our efforts to protect Virginia women's health from extremists' attacks. If you agree with this goal,Thanks."

(CNN) - Gov. Paul LePage, known for making controversial comments, reportedly said President Barack Obama ""hates white people,"" according to two Maine newspapers citing unnamed sources.

""I never said that. And you guys are all about gossip,"" he told reporters as he walked out of the Maine State House in Augusta. His comments were recorded by CNN affiliate WCSH.



The Portland Press Herald reported late Monday night that two state lawmakers said LePage, a Republican, made the comment at a Maine GOP fundraiser on August 12.

The Bangor Daily News also reported that LePage made the comment, citing an unnamed attendee.

The Portland Press Herald wrote that LePage argued Obama would be the best president ever if he would highlight his biracial heritage, but he doesn't do so because of his negative feelings towards white people.

The governor's office and the state Republican Party declined to answer questions from CNN about the incident. And a senior political adviser to LePage refused to even speak to the issue, but sent a prepared statement criticizing the Press Herald and noting that the governor had raised a Jamaican teenager.

""It seems farfetched for anyone, even a newspaper, to make an insinuation the Governor is racist given his life history,"" said Brent Littlefield, LePage's political adviser. ""He and his family made a choice and sacrifice when they offered Devon the opportunity to join their family many years ago. Paul and Ann call him their son. Paul LePage recognized many people helped him make it out of poverty and he has been determined to help others succeed.""

LePage took in Devon Raymond Jr., in August 2002 to live with his family. LePage refers to him as his son, though they did not formally adopt him.

Lisa Fortier, who hosted the fundraiser with her husband, told CNN: ""I never heard it. I never heard anybody mention it.""

LePage's reported comment about Obama marks the latest in a string of off-color remarks by the first-term governor, who plans to run for re-election next year. Earlier this month, LePage joked that he wanted to blow up the headquarters of the Press Herald.

According to the Sunlight Foundation, the paper's majority owner is Donald Sussman, a billionaire manager of boutique hedge funds and a major political donor to Democratic super PACs in 2012, as well as other Democratic campaigns over the years. Sussman is married to Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine.

Just a few weeks ago, sitting in a flight simulator, LePage was asked where he wanted to fly to.

""I want to find the Portland Press Herald building and blow it up,"" he replied, according to video posted on the website of the Daily News.

Later, LePage explained on Twitter he was making a joke.

The governor also caused a stir in June when he made a crude sexual reference to describe a Democratic state lawmaker.

""Sen. Jackson claims to be for the people but he's the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline,"" LePage told the television station WMTW, referring to state Sen. Troy Jackson.

And last year, he apologized for referring to the Internal Revenue Service as the ""Gestapo"" in his weekly radio address.

""It was not my intent to insult anyone, especially the Jewish Community, or minimize the fact that millions of people were murdered,"" the governor said in a statement.

LePage was elected in 2010, after first winning a crowded GOP primary, then narrowly winning the general election with 38% of the vote. In addition to the Democratic candidate, LePage also ran against two independents. The three candidates caused a wide split in his opposition.

Though he and his brother were charged with stealing a car in the 1970s, prosecutors later dropped charges, and Issa said he was a victim in the incident, according to a New Yorker profile of Issa from 2011. After a suspicious fire at his business’s factory, the company’s former owner said he suspected Issa set the fire for insurance, but a cause of the fire was never determined and no charges were filed, according to the profile.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) claimed on Sunday that political officials in the Obama administration directed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents in Cincinnati to target conservative groups applying for 501 (c)(4) status, but his charge fell apart when probed by CNN host Candy Crowley.

CROWLEY: The investigator said “So is it your perspective that ultimately the responsible parties for the decisions reported by the [Inspector General] that is the decision that target tea party and patriot applications, are not in the Cincinnati office?

The employee says, ‘I don’t know how to answer that question. I mean, from an agent standpoint, we didn’t do anything wrong. We followed directions based on other people telling us what to do.’

Investigator, ‘And you ultimately followed directions from Washington, is that correct?

The employee, ‘if direction had come down from Washington, yes.’

The investigator, ‘But with respect to the particular scrutiny that was given to tea party applications, those directions emanated from Washington, is that right?’

The employee answers, ‘I believe so.’ It’s totally not definitive. ISSA: This one isn’t. But I will tell you, one of the agents asked for and got a transfer because that person was so uncomfortable that they wanted out of it.

It's kind of a cheap shot, but certainly no worse than Issa calling Jay Carney a ' paid liar' , and at least some people will know what kind of person is leading GOP 'investigations"" into Democratic ""scandals"".

USA TODAY

GOP party leaders%2C moderates vow %22never again%22

Sen. Ted Cruz says his party caved too soon

Battles over taxes%2C spending%2C immigration loom

WASHINGTON — Republicans began a new week pointing fingers at each other Sunday following a 16-day government shutdown and near-default that left the nation worse off and the GOP taking most of the blame.

If there was a theme to the round of Sunday morning talk shows looking back at the fiasco, it was the determination of most Republicans — from Senate leaders to past and potential future presidential candidates — to move on rather than focus on this month's failed battles.

Sen. John McCain called the effort to defund President Obama's health care expansion ""a fool's errand."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed there will be no more government shutdowns. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush accused the party of stepping on its message.

""There will not be another government shutdown. You can count on that,"" McConnell said on CBS' Face the Nation. ""Shutting down the government, in my view, is not conservative policy.""

""What we need to do is move forward with immigration reform, get a positive agenda for America,"" said McCain, the party's 2008 presidential candidate, on CNN's State of the Union.

""Obamacare, flawed to its core, doesn't work,"" said Bush, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, on ABC.'s This Week. ""But we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message.""

That left Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who instigated the government crisis by demanding an end to Obamacare and getting the Tea Party faction among House Republicans to go along, in a somewhat lonely position — at least in the nation's capital.

Appearing on CNN and on ABC, the freshman senator blamed fellow Republicans for dooming the effort by speaking out against it rather than uniting behind it.

""I think it was unfortunate that you saw multiple members of the Senate Republicans going on television attacking House conservatives, attacking the effort to defund Obamacare, saying it cannot win, it's a fool's errand, we will lose, this must fail,"" Cruz said. ""That is a recipe for losing the fight, and it's a shame.""

Neither Cruz nor McConnell went after each other personally, but their sentiments were clear. McConnell, as he has done before, compared a second government shutdown following the one engineered by upstart Republicans in 1995-96 to a second kick of a mule. Cruz defended it as a valuable weapon in a tactical war.

There was little support for Cruz among other Republicans appearing on TV Sunday. Two fellow conservatives, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Roy Blunt of Missouri, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should testify before Congress on Obamacare but should not – at least not yet — be forced to resign, as Cruz and some other Republicans have suggested.

And Bush said the GOP needs to ""show a little self-restraint"" and let Obamacare play out, particularly since its government website has left thousands of Americans unable to sign up for health coverage."

@DouthatNYT Right now, the base has a plan for winning 46 percent of the vote in 2016, and the establishment has a plan for winning ... 48 percent.

But these days, Mr. Brown — who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California — is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.

Here's a NY Times profile on Jerry Brown of CA:Republicans usually tout their governors, but that's mostly because they can't tout their Congressional people. How can they, when their entire schtick is ""send me to hated Washington where I swear to do nothing (and less than my predecessor)""?

Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei on how much it sucks to be a Republican these days:

It is almost impossible to find an establishment Republican in town who’s not downright morose about the 2013 that has been and is about to be. Most dance around it in public, but they see this year as a disaster in the making, even if most elected Republicans don’t know it or admit it. Several influential Republicans told us the party is actually in a worse place than it was Nov. 7, the day after the disastrous election. This is their case: • The party is hurting itself even more with the very voters they need to start winning back: Hispanics, blacks, gays, women and swing voters of all stripes. • The few Republicans who stood up and tried to move the party ahead were swatted into submission: Speaker John Boehner on fiscal matters and Sen. Marco Rubio on immigration are the poster boys for this. • Republicans are all flirting with a fall that could see influential party voices threatening to default on the debt or shut down the government — and therefore ending all hopes of proving they are not insane when it comes to governance.

Suffering from a broken arm and forced to lay on a mat on the stage, he pressed on to have one of those weekends we will all remember.

We received cards from several, but it was a phone call from our senator - Robert Dole - that came across to let us know that he was proud of the effort and wanted to talk. The only issue on the list of those around us surrounded basic rights - especially for the disabled. Senator Dole came to a town event early the next year, stopped in and laid out why working toward the Americans with Disabilities Act was important to him.

Giving people a chance to participate in society was the way to move things forward; and that the most important role of government was to allow more people to participate in every level.

Now, twenty years later, former Senator Dole sees what his party has become and tells us something is very wrong.



As Dole sat in his Washington law office in February, still stunned by the outcome, he blamed his own party and suggested a headline: “Republican Party closes its doors to make repairs.” The GOP, added Dole, one of the party’s most revered figures, “needs a timeout” to tone down the antigovernment rhetoric.

They saw their job as meeting halfway. “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something,” Dole said.

Supporters hoped the time was right to win ratification. Of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 155 have signed the treaty and 129 have ratified it, including countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, and Russia. In an effort to win Republican support, treaty backers asked Dole to take up the fight. The old warrior, while weakened from his most recent hospitalization, promptly agreed. No one disputed the difficulties faced by many of the 1 billion people worldwide with disabilities; in many developing countries, most children with disabilities don’t go to school and have little chance of gainful employment, not to mention basic accommodation, according to the State Department. Ratifying the treaty, supporters said, would spread American leadership around the globe as well as create new markets for US-made disabilities products.

Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, favorites of the Tea Party, wrote an op-ed for The Washington Times that said the treaty “calls for government agents to supersede the authority of parents of disabled children and even covers abortion.” Dole and other supporters of the treaty viewed the charges as laughably false. The treaty legislation clearly stated that it required no change in US law, and there were no new abortion rights, they said.

The article is chock full of quotes that describe the problem with the current leadership of the republican party.Republicans turned their backs on those who were part of one of their greatest victories.

I can remember sitting in a room listening to Senator Dole tell us how he always held a pen in his hand - a hand he couldn't really use due to a war injury, because as a younger man from the war the sign of disability made it harder for him to get respect; and holding a pen in his hand was a way to seem as though he was doing something and to hide a disability. His story was a moving moment to how a person understood directly the issues that face those who are disabled.

I am not here to rah-rah a Republican Senator who I'm sure we all would have many policy disagreements with. But I am here to remember a Republican Senator who pushed through the Americans with Disabilities Act. He put forward the Clean Air Act.

I read the article at the Boston Globe and remember that at one point, Dole was right "" “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something""

Too bad the current Republicans believe they are elected to make sure nothing happens. A nation cannot move forward if leadership from 20 years ago looks infinitely more progressive then a current implementation of a party. While everyone else tries to move forward, the modern Know-Nothings do everything in their power to take as many steps back as possible."

The government shuts down and Pres. O. comes to the podium for a statement.

""The Republican party just shut down the government in an attempt to prevent millions of Americans from getting affordable health insurance.

This whole episode is pointless because even though government workers aren't getting paid today, members of the armed forces aren't being paid today, and social security checks will be going out late because of this temper tantrum... the health insurance exchanges still open today and the benefits of the affordable care act are there for everyone to see.

No more lies. No more hyperbole. Just go to Healthcare.gov and see how much money you can save for your family each month.

Sally Smith from Kentucky is saving over $200 per month.

Bob Jones from CO is saving $600 per month for his family of 4.

Wendy Wright is able to get affordable health insurance for the first time in 10 years.

All because of the Affordable Care Act. All because of Obamacare.

That's $600 more dollars per month that they can use to buy things they need for their family. $600 more dollars per month of breathing room.

Go to Healthcare.gov... see for yourself.

See who has been working for you... and who has been working against you.

The truth is out there just for you to see.

It's what the Republicans in congress don't want you to see. They don't want you to have access to affordable health insurance.

They don't care about the middle class. The don't care about you.

I do.

They have abandoned the Tea Party government shutdown strategy. In fact they make the claim in their letter (the entire letter can be found below) that,

Koch has not taken a position on the legislative tactic of tying the continuing resolution to defunding ObamaCare nor have we lobbied on legislative provisions defunding ObamaCare.

The Koch Brothers may want America to believe that. The statement is not accurate. On February 14th, 2013 Matte Kibbe of FreedomWorks sent out a letter. The letter titled “Coalition Letter: Congress Must Honor Sequester Savings and Defund ObamaCare Before It Is Too Late” said that,

Conservatives should not approve a CR unless it defunds Obamacare. This includes Obamacare’s unworkable exchanges, unsustainable Medicaid expansion, and attack on life and religious liberty. [Source]

In other words they supported a government shutdown strategy. Why did they think a government shutdown strategy was necessary? They noted what every supporter of Obamacare knows.

On October 1, 2013, open enrollment begins for the federally backed health care exchanges. On January 1, 2014, new money from Washington will begin flowing to states and individuals, all but ensuring that these new entitlements will become a permanent fixture of life in America. The window of opportunity to stop the implementation of these massive new subsidies is closing. Although many of Obamacare's provisions are now the law of the land, many of the law's most damaging and irreversible provisions do not take effect until 2014. [Source]

FreedomWorks is one of the many organizations that are funded by the Koch Brothers. The Kochs are part responsible for this Tea Party government shutdown strategy. There is no doubt about it.

It is clear from the letter that the Koch Brothers were shaken. They want to us to ignore the New York Times article. They want to dispel Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s implicating them in the shutdown.

It is evident that the shutdown has become a train wreck for the Tea Party. By implication it could damage the reputation of the Koch Brothers with their own base, the Right Wing of the Republican Party. They get little benefit from being associated with Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Steve King (R-IA), and the other sophomoric architects of this government shutdown strategy.

How will the Tea Party react to this letter? Will they now allow John Boehner to bring the CR to the floor? It seems like they must find a way out since their chief sponsor is no longer on board.

Government Shutdown Strategy Abandoned?

""Double-you tee effing eff!"" I replied, because huh? The Virginia House of Delegates, by contrast, has a mere 100 members. And, oh yeah, the actual U.S. House of Representatives has 435 voting members.

These two sentences from the Wikipedia entry on the New Hampshire House of Reps is sufficient to put the fear in you: ""On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. If the same level of representation were present in the U.S. Congress, that body would have approximately 99,000 members, according to current population estimates.""

On top of that, Celock told me that members of this august body receive a mere $100 a year for their participation, which means that the only people who are likely to seek these offices are people who are just beginning their political careers, people who are winding down their political careers, and people who have literally nothing better to do than run for these seats. With a system designed like this, it can't not feature a nutter like Tremblay.

So, anyone who is truly concerned about getting Stella Tremblay out of office would be well served to stop thinking about running a better candidate in ""Rockingham 4,"" and instead concentrate on making New Hampshire's legislative body a lot less bonkers.

GOP senator tweeted picture of empty water bottle

Sen. Marco Rubio is being a good sport about awkwardly taking a sip of water during his response to President Obama's State of the Union Address, using some Wednesday morning TV appearances to poke fun at himself.

""I needed water, what am I going to do?"" Rubio, R-Fla., said on ABC's Good Morning America. ""God has a funny way of reminding us we're human.""

Twitter exploded and Rubio's sip of water became a social media sensation.

For the millions of people watching Rubio's nationally televised remarks on Tuesday night, it wasn't so much that the senator was cotton-mouthed as he offered the GOP's vision on the economy. It was the way Rubio — a young, charismatic politician mentioned as a future presidential hopeful — quenched his thirst.

Rubio was standing in front of a TV camera in one of House Speaker John Boehner's conference rooms at the U.S. Capitol as he delivered his remarks. An 8-ounce bottle of Poland Spring water was out of view on a table, and he stepped out of the shot for a moment — without taking his eyes off the camera — to take a sip.

Rubio took a bottle of water to some of his morning show interviews, playing along with the joke as he took a swig while he was on Fox News. It was a step beyond what he did after his speech, when he posted a picture of an empty Poland Spring bottle on Twitter.

""When you give a speech on a podium and the water is right there. But when you don't, you start looking around thinking, 'Where am I going to get the water?'"" he said on Fox News.

Rubio explained on CBS that he had a long day. Before giving his speech live in English, he also taped his remarks in Spanish — marking the first time in history that the State of the Union response was delivered in two languages.

""I had already taped an 18-minute speech in Spanish,"" the senator said. ""So I'm just glad the water was nearby. I don't know what I would have done without it.""

In politics, the ability to poke fun at oneself is a critical survival tool. Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeared on late-night TV shows after he uttered ""oops"" during a GOP presidential debate in 2011 because he could not remember the name of a federal department he wanted to cut. Perry, whose presidential campaign was already struggling at that time, also walked into the media spin room immediately after the debate to tell reporters he ""stepped in it.""

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie got into it, too, during a recent appearance on David Letterman's Late Show. Letterman likes to make fat jokes about Christie, so the governor took a bite out of a doughnut as he was being interviewed.

David Marin, a former communications director for a House committee now with the Podesta Group public relations firm, said Rubio is handling the water break deftly.

""I think Sen. Rubio is going to turn lemons into lemonade here,"" Marin said. ""He's already doing the most important thing: Making light of a moment and owning it. And he's doing it in the right forum — via digital media, which shows real smarts since that's where the conversation was happening.""

Charlton McIlwain, a professor of media, culture and politics at New York University, said Rubio was wise to redefine the incident on his own terms by tweeting a picture of his empty water bottle.

By immediately ""making a joke of it,"" McIlwain said, Rubio was able to set the tone of the discussion without leaving pundits and others to define the sip of water as a mistake or a bungle.

As a result, the event will be memorable but ""probably not in a negative way"" for Rubio, McIlwain said.

They lost.

On Wednesday, those two ugly facts began to sink in among the House’s hard-core conservatives. For nearly three years, they had effectively led the House itself — drawing their power from the intimidating sense that they were capable of anything. They often compared themselves to William Wallace, the Scottish rebel who (at least in the movies) succeeded because he refused to compromise.

But then — just like in the movies — “Braveheart” died.

On Wednesday, conservatives’ frontal attack on President Obama’s signature health-care law had ended after a government shutdown, a major decline in Republican popularity and a final compromise that gave them almost none of what they had wanted.

“We tried,” Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said at a gathering of glum conservatives on Wednesday morning. “We lost.”

Senate leaders announced a budget compromise Wednesday that will raise the debt ceiling and re-open the government. In Play's Chris Cillizza breaks down which political players came out of the deal on top and which ones did not. (The Washington Post)

He continued. It got worse. After the first effort to defund the health-care law, Mulvaney noted, conservatives tried to take away health-care subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs. If Obama­care would survive, then at least the “political class” would not benefit from it, he said. But then — “We lost that one as w ell.”

“We’re all pretty down today,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), sitting on the same dais. Labrador’s only hope was that the polls were wrong and that the American people had somehow been impressed by all this. “Now they know we’re willing to fight,” he said.

For House conservatives, Wednesday was a day unlike many others in the giddy period since Republicans took the House in 2010. They had lost all control of the standoff after House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) had failed to find a bill that all Republicans could support.

So the Senate — led by Democrats — was supposed to cut the deal instead. And did. The House was expected to pass it, with most Democrats and a few Republicans voting yes. And did.

For House conservatives, at last, there was nothing to do but wait. And then lose.

“He said, ‘Y’all need to get some rest. Go home. Sleep. We’re going to live to fight another day,’ ” said Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), relaying the message Boehner gave House Republicans in a private meeting Wednesday afternoon.

But before they could go home, there was a vote. And it wasn’t supposed to come until the evening. In the meantime, some conservatives filled the empty hours giving tours of the Capitol (since the regular tour guides had been furloughed by the shutdown).

“It actually looks like a jellyfish,” said Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who was in a basement tunnel, showing a group the display of artwork from students who had won a congressional art competition. The winner from Wilson’s district sent in an abstract composition. Apparently some kind of marine life.

“You see a lot of teen angst as you walk down here,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), doing the same thing, in the same tunnel, a few feet behind Wilson.

Inside a House hearing room, several members attended a lunch meeting called “Conversations with Conservatives.” Over lunch from Chick-fil-A, they pondered what could have gone wrong.

The answer, for several members, was that other people had done them wrong. At the top of the list were Democrats and Obama. The conservatives — having taken the ultimate hardball tactic of refusing to fund the government unless “Obamacare” was defunded — were unhappy that Democrats had played so tough in response.

“He won’t negotiate,” Labrador said.

The conservatives also blamed Democrats for not acting on a series of miniature spending bills to reopen parts of the government.

Another problem: Congress’s Republican leadership. In particular, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) blamed his party’s leaders for . . . well, for acting on a series of miniature spending bills to reopen parts of the government.

“We kept talking, and in a negotiation, the person who keeps talking loses,” Massie said. “That’s what Harry Reid did so wonderfully. He refused to talk,” Massie said, referring to the Senate majority leader, who steadfastly refused to consider what Republicans were sending over.

The conservatives also, at times, seemed to blame their own faction. They lamented that one potential winning message — that the health-care law’s “individual mandate” should be delayed a year — had been obscured by other demands.

“We didn’t really articulate that well,” said Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). “It kind of got lost in the shuffle of the initial ‘defund’ push.”

By the “defund” effort, DeSantis meant the attempt — led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) — to defund the health-care law entirely. Defunding the law was even more odious to Democrats than delaying its impact. Its chances of being accepted were zero.

So, in hindsight, DeSantis said throwing the GOP’s weight behind the defunding effort was a mistake.

He did not mention that among the legislators who made this mistake was . . . DeSantis himself. “I fully support the House’s continuing resolution that will keep our government open while stripping funding from Obamacare,” DeSantis said in a statement on Sept. 19.

On Wednesday, the legislators at “Conversations with Conservatives” said they would look to the future. They hoped that — as in “Braveheart” — this abject defeat would lead to victory. Eventually.

Maybe new Republicans would be elected to Congress next year, they said. “This would have turned out better if we had more conservatives in the House,” Labrador said.

Reporters asked: Will they try the “Braveheart” strategy again? After all, if the Senate’s plan passes, the debt ceiling will need to be raised again in a few months. And the government will need to be funded.

But even before this fight ended, there was a sense that the next one might be different.

“I’m going to commit candor here,” Massie said. “I think we have less leverage on the next CR, and on the next debt-limit [debate], than we do right now.”

The vote, at last, came about 10:20 p.m. Conservatives clustered in the back of the chamber, looking at the votes tallying up. They lost, as expected — the vote was 285 to 144. The ayes had it.

Usually, when a big vote is won, that is the moment when somebody cheers. But in this case, both sides kept quiet. The conservatives and everybody else just filed toward the exits, out toward the end.

Second question: Why is New Jersey electing a United States Senator on a Wednesday in the middle of October anyway? Why can’t everything be at the same time? Because Gov. Chris Christie says he does not want to “cause unnecessary voter confusion,” that’s why. Christie is up for re-election on Nov. 5, and you do not want writers scratching their heads about whose name to put at the top of the story. So the state will spend $12 million to provide the crystal clarity of a special Senate election on Oct. 16.

People, do you think Governor Christie used to be one of those kids who refused to share? When other children came over, do you think he put all his toys in one big pile and sat on it? I once had a friend like that, but I don’t think she grew up to be in charge of a state.

O.K., enough making fun of Chris Christie.

About the Senate election: This is to fill the seat of the late Frank Lautenberg. It pits Cory Booker, the Democratic mayor of Newark, against Steve Lonegan, who was once the Republican mayor of a suburb of about 8,000 people, which despite his heroic efforts, never did vote to make English its official language."

In other words—the vast majority of folks in the U.S seem to fall into some group Teapublicans are taking out their ire upon.

It’s amazing to me when I add up the numbers.



My first face-to-face encounter with Teapublicans was back in 2010, in my neighboring town of Kingston, New York, which I wrote about in a piece called "" Social Justice is Tyranny ,"" the title taken from one of the many signs held up by people with hate-filled faces.

Trying to talk to them was futile. They were opposed to paying taxes, yet wanted the government to keep its dirty hands off their Medicare. They had been fed on a steady diet of anti-government sentiment and conspiracy theories from Faux News. Their heroes are the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs of the world.

I had a strong feeling then that we were going to be in trouble as a nation if these people, and people like them, were going to elect representatives who held their views. Yes, they didn't win the presidency (twice), but their elected cabal in Congress could care less. They don't recognize him as legitimate.

These people are not rich. They depend on government services. Yet their hate, deeply rooted in fear, keeps them from voting in their own interest.

Democracy Corps' ""Republican Party Project"" has recently issued a report from focus groups conducted with the three main factions that currently comprise a majority of the Republican Party, which helps to illuminate the forces behind the Teapublican shutdown:



Evangelicals. Social issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep “culture rot” that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats. Tea Party. Big government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obama’s America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency. They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting “back to basics” and believe it has the potential to reshape the GOP. Moderates. Moderates are deeply concerned with the direction of the country and believe Obama has taken it down the wrong path economically. They are centrally focused on market-based economics, small government, and eliminating waste and inefficiency. They are largely open to progressive social policies, including on gay marriage and immigration. They disdain the Tea Party and have a hard time taking Fox News seriously.

And while few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.

In the analysis of the focus group results (PDF) they point out:The first two groups are holding any elected moderate Republicans (a minority) hostage, just as they hold all of us hostage to their obsessions, paranoia, and hate.

The most important thing we each can do is fight this in every district currently controlled by Teapublicans.

MoveOn/PPP has identified seats that could be vulnerable:



Twenty-four new surveys in GOP-held House districts, commissioned by MoveOn.org and conducted in the wake of the government shutdown, make clear that Republicans could easily lose control of the House if the next election were held today. The surveys challenge conventional wisdom that gerrymandering has put the House out of reach for Democrats and indicate the shutdown has significant electoral implications.

Yes, 2014 elections are a year away.

We have to put in the footwork now, registering new voters, fighting voter disenfranchisement efforts and making plans to get voters to the polls."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/obama-court-packing_n_3645515.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Republicans Wrongly Accuse Obama Of Court-Packing -- Again,"WASHINGTON -- It may not be factually accurate, but some Republican senators just can't resist accusing President Barack Obama of ""court-packing"" as he tries to fill empty seats on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

During a Wednesday hearing on one of Obama's key judicial nominees, Nina Pillard for the D.C. Circuit, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee resurrected the claim that the president's effort to fill three vacancies on the court amounts to ""court-packing."" The term refers to an effort to increase the number of judge slots on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies.

""The president appears to have targeted the D.C. Circuit in hopes that he can pack the court and stack the deck to his advantage,"" said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) noted that the Senate already confirmed a nominee to the D.C. Circuit this year, Sri Srinivasan, and argued that Obama's efforts to fill the court's remaining vacancies are politically motivated.

""I have deep concerns about what the administration is doing now with a package of three nominees to the D.C. Circuit after the Senate just confirmed a very qualified nominee,"" Cruz said. ""I believe [this] is an attempt by this administration to pack that court.""

Not only is the charge factually inaccurate -- the court has three empty seats, which the president is constitutionally required to fill -- but one could easily make the case that Republican efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having any more judges appointed by a Democrat, are actual instances of ""court-unpacking.""

Scuffles over the D.C. Circuit come as Senate Republicans have been using a variety of methods to block Obama's judicial nominees. Tensions over stalled nominees have gotten so high that Democrats nearly proceeded with filibuster reform earlier this month, a standoff that was defused at the last minute as party leaders cut a deal that allowed some of Obama's executive nominees to get votes. That deal did nothing to unclog Obama's judicial nominees, though, and filling the D.C. Circuit is a major priority for the president.

Republicans haven't signaled much interest in allowing D.C. Circuit nominees to get a vote. As it stands, the court has 11 seats, three of which are vacant. Lee and Cruz are both are cosponsors of a bill by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would eliminate those three seats altogether and keep the court where it is: with eight judges, four of whom were appointed by Democrats and four of whom were appointed by Republicans.

Grassley, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, re-upped that argument during Wednesday's hearing. He cited statistics that he said illustrated that the court has the lowest workload of all circuit courts. He also read aloud anonymous statements that he said were from current D.C. Circuit judges arguing that the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its vacancies. Those statements came in response to a letter that Grassley said he sent to the court's judges asking for their take on the matter.

""The judges themselves confirmed everything I've been saying,"" Grassley said. ""Who is in a better position than the judges to make an assessment about the court's workload and the need for additional judges?""

But Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Grassley's argument overlooks the fact that the D.C. Circuit, considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its importance, takes on particularly hefty and complex cases that require extra scrutiny. He also listed off the names of current and former judges on that court -- including Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts -- who have spoken publicly about the court's intense workload.

Plenty of judges who have served on the court ""have commented for the record, not anonymously, their views as to the workload of the court,"" Blumenthal said, ""all indicating very strongly and unequivocally that the workload of this court is certainly a tremendous challenge and growing, rather than diminishing."""

With those words Donald Trump officially joined the ongoing battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party by aligning himself as a defender of the tea party and a merciless critic of Karl Rove and his new, controversial initiative known as the “Conservative Victory Project.”

Trump’s fiery appearance on The Mark Levin Show signaled an escalation in the very public argument that has played out over the past ten days between divergent factions of the GOP.

Trump and Levin hit Rove where it really hurts. First Trump criticized Rove’s effectiveness as a campaign strategist by slamming his SuperPAC, American Crossroads’ performance in the 2012 election: “Four hundred million dollars was wasted. They do the worst ads I have ever seen, ever.”

Levin followed up with what might be the most significant line of attack against Rove: “I would say to the wealthy donors out there, ‘Why do you keep donating to him?’ why don’t you donate to all these groups who are actually grassroots, who are actually fighting and who are actually effective?”

The combination of the influential voice of Mark Levin challenging donors to shut-down the flow of cash to the Rove machine, coupled with Trump (one of those high-profile donors) repeating FIVE TIMES the fact that Rove spent “four hundred million dollars” with no results to show for it could have a brutally devastating effect on the former Bush strategist’s balance sheet.

Trump then positioned himself as the defender of the tea party movement: “If the Republicans are going to win, they’re going to have to break away from the Karl Rove’s of the world and, frankly, get more about you know the tea party… they are great Americans, they love this country, they work so hard, and they have been so mistreated by the liberal press, the liberal media. They have been just so mistreated and made to look so bad.”

The continuing battle playing out on cable news, talk radio and on influential websites will surely continue now that Trump has entered the fray. And with stalwart Republican names like Rove and Barbour on one side and Bozell and Schlafly (now joined by Levin and Trump) on the other, this could shape up to get even uglier as the battle wages on."

As recently as 2003, the president of the Greater Fort Bend County Tea Party had a very different title: director of propaganda for the American Fascist Party. James Ives, a prominent Tea Party activist who has hosted statewide rallies and political debates and has been a regular contributor on conservative radio, was the AFP's fourth in command, commenting about the party’s principles on a fascist message board. An image of Ives in what appears to be a black uniform with yellow shoulder patches can be seen in a 2006 promotional video for the party. Ives tells a more nuanced story; the Richmond, Texas, resident says he stumbled across the fascist party — which supports extreme right-wing authoritarian regimes — online in the early 2000s as an “amateur political science student and frustrated novelist” and was merely curious.

Emily Ramshaw at the Texas Tribune writes Just curious. Uh-huh. Thought he would ""blow the lid off of this"" by getting involved, he told the Tribune. He said it was just a ""funny story.""

In the promotional video, which I won't link but can be found at youtube.com/watch?v=9aqXEN5iDpQ, you can see Ives in a black uniform at the 36-second mark. He claims the uniform was Photoshopped on.

The group's founder, Seth Tyrssen, ran for president in 2004 and self-published a book, The New Fascism, in 2009.

Ives admitted to the Tribune that he was, in fact, the group's propaganda director because nobody else volunteered for the post. But he claimed that the fascist group was just ""a chat room with a fancy title."" I also won't link it, but the message board can be found at //groups.yahoo.com/group/americanfascistparty/messages/340. One of Ives's sprinkling of messages there begins:



Gentlemen, first let me say that I am proud to be a member, no, VERY proud to be a member of the American Fascist Party. In the growth of this group over a short time, there can truly be said to be signs of light in the tunnel of recent national history. THE VERY FACT THAT SUCH A GROUP CAN GET TOGETHER AT ALL, AND FLOURISH, SAYS THAT THERE IS STILL LIFE IN THE FURROWS AND HILLS, THE BAYOUS AND GLENS OF OUR AMERICA!

State Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, whose radio station has regularly hosted Ives’ political commentaries in recent years, said that if his past connections to the American Fascist Party were legitimate, the station would no longer put him on air. Patrick said Ives had “never been on our payroll, never been an employee.” He called the promotional video and online postings “very disturbing, no matter how far in the past it is.” [...] Debra Medina, a well-known Tea Party activist who ran against Gov. Rick Perry in the 2010 Republican primary, said she isn’t familiar with Ives and isn’t in a position to judge his dealings with the fascist group. But she said part of the challenge of working with the grassroots is that it’s “so hard to know who you’re working with sometimes.”

While what apparently was a brief connection to a short-lived organization nearly a decade ago might not bother some people, not everyone feels that way:Yep. Hard to avoid rubbing elbows with wackos when you're one yourself"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/03/Inside-Conservative-Rebellion-Boehner,2013-01-03 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Inside the Conservative Rebellion Against John Boehner,"House Speaker John Boehner barely held onto his job atop Congress’ lower chamber on Thursday. Just how close a call Boehner had is now becoming clear.

Nine House conservatives voted for somebody other than Boehner, two abstained from voting and one voted “present.” That total of 12 Republicans who didn’t support Boehner was a stone’s throw from the required 17 to force a second ballot election – at which point several more Republican members were slated to back a competitor to Boehner’s, who would unite the party behind him or her.

Politico has reported the original list of members possibly considering defection from Boehner was longer and included Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Steve Fincher and Scott DesJarlais, both of Tennessee.

Politico uncovered this list because Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp “sat on the House floor during the speaker vote brandishing an iPad” with a message “displayed on the screen ticking off members of the House Republican Conference he hoped would oppose the sitting speaker.”

The title of the email message was reportedly: “You would be fired if this goes out.”

Breitbart News has confirmed that the following members were considering voting against Boehner retaining his speakership as well: Reps. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Sam Graves of Missouri, Steve Southerland of Florida, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, David Schweikert of Arizona, Arkansas freshman Tom Cotton and Brett Guthrie of Kentucky.

Reps. Guthrie and Cotton denied to Breitbart News that they were on the list.

“Speaker Boehner was voted out of the Republican Conference unanimously and I never considered not voting for him on the House floor. I do not know where these lists originated and my proposed involvement is completely false,” Guthrie said.

Doug Coutts, Chief of Staff for Rep. Cotton, asserted, “Contrary to Breitbart’s reporting, Mr. Cotton did not consider voting for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, an intention he stated plainly the morning of the vote on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal.

“Further, no one approached Mr. Cotton to ask his support for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, nor did Mr. Cotton engage such conversations.”

Breitbart News also learned that outgoing House GOP conference chairman Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling was considering opposing Boehner. Boehner recently named Hensarling to be the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress.

All in all, there were more than 20 House Republicans who were considering unseat Boehner. Many of these members bailed on the movement at the last minute on the House floor.

There did appear to be at one point a chance Boehner wouldn’t regain his position during the happenings on the House floor. The Clerk of the House had reached the end of her list of names to call when Boehner reached 216 votes – he needed 217 to win re-election. As the National Review’s Washington, D.C., editor Robert Costa noted on Twitter, there were 17 Republican members either not voting, voting present or voting for someone other than Boehner. “So: In short, we were over 17 for a minute, looking at 2nd ballot, when the conservatives come to floor, save Boehner from 2nd ballot,” Costa wrote.

Then, as Costa notes, Bachmann, Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey’s Scott Garrett came back to the floor – after ignoring their names being called the first time during the alphabetical roll call – and voted for Boehner.

“Boehner is fine, people/ He will be reelected. Blackburn, Bachmann, and Garrett saved him,” Costa said of those conservatives saving Boehner. “What a story. What a story.”

This article has been updated to include responses from Rep. Guthrie and a representative of Rep. Cotton."

On Thursday, upon hearing of the former South African president's death, Gingrich put up a post on Facebook, expressing his condolences.

""President Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime,"" he wrote. ""When he visited the Congress I was deeply impressed with the charisma and the calmness with which he could dominate a room. It was as if the rest of us grew smaller and he grew stronger and more dominant the longer the meeting continued.""

Gingrich's statement, however, was met with backlash from many of his followers.

""Newt, I was rooting for you to win the primaries and become the next president; please tell me your joking!! Mandela was a commie murderer!!"" read one comment that was popular with other users.

""You're forgetting Mandela's extreme racism! There are YouTubes of Mandela singing songs about murdering the white man. I spit on his grave....,"" read another.

When asked about the criticism in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Gingrich replied, ""I was very surprised by it. [My wife] Callista posted my statement on her Facebook page and was amazed at some of the intensity -- some of whom came back three, four and five times repeating how angry they were.""

In response, on Saturday, Gingrich put out a new statement and video to his supporters, challenging critics to put themselves in Mandela's shoes.

""I was surprised by the hostility and vehemence of some of the people who reacted to me saying a kind word about a unique historic figure,"" he said. ""So let me say to those conservatives who don’t want to honor Nelson Mandela, what would you have done?""

Responding to conservatives who dismiss Mandela as a communist, Gingrich added, ""Actually Mandela was raised in a Methodist school, was a devout Christian, turned to communism in desperation only after South Africa was taken over by an extraordinarily racist government determined to eliminate all rights for blacks.""

As Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic pointed out, Gingrich's support for Mandela is not new or an attempt to rewrite history.

""Newt Gingrich was among a cadre of conservatives who opposed the mainstream conservative stance on Apartheid and ultimately helped override Reagan's unconscionable veto of sanctions,"" he wrote, adding, ""When Gingrich compliments Mandela on his presidency he doesn't do so within the context of alleged African pathologies, but within the context of countries throughout the world. It's a textbook lessons in 'How not to be racist,' which is to say it is a textbook lesson in how to talk about Nelson Mandela as though he were a human being.""

Watch Gingrich's video:

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also encountered a fair amount of vitriol last week when he honored Mandela in a Facebook post, writing, ""Nelson Mandela will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe… Because of his epic fight against injustice, an entire nation is now free.”

When CNN host Candy Crowley asked Gingrich if he believed his and Cruz's critics were fellow conservatives, the former House speaker said they were people who bought into ""a rationale that defined everybody who was in any way in rebellion against the established system in the third world as anti-American."""

COVID-19 has claimed the life of another New Brunswicker, pushing the total number of COVID-related deaths in the province to 38, Public Health announced Monday, along with 15 new cases. A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Heather Wilson,"Former U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson collected nearly half a million dollars in questionable payments from four federally funded nuclear labs after she left office, the Energy Department's inspector general says in a new report.

Wilson failed to provide documentation for the work she did to earn $20,000 a month from the Los Alamos and Sandia national labs in New Mexico from January 2009 to March 2011, the report said. Officials at the Nevada Test Site and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee acknowledged there ""were no deliverables"" associated with $30,000 the two labs paid Wilson. Sandia had Wilson lobby for more defense dollars, an apparent violation of her contract, the report said.

In total, nearly $450,000 in questionable payments were identified, the bulk from Los Alamos and Sandia.

The contractors that run the labs have paid the money back to the federal government but an investigation continues, the report said.

In a statement emailed Tuesday to The Associated Press, Wilson said the report ""confirms that the labs were satisfied with my work. The work was done in full compliance with the contracts we signed and under the direct supervision of lab sponsors.""

The report called Wilson's agreements with the labs unusual and in some cases ""highly irregular."" And it said the agreements and the lab operators failed to include or enforce ""even minimum"" invoicing standards.

Wilson, a Republican who represented New Mexico's 1st Congressional District, collected much of the money in between two unsuccessful runs for the U.S. Senate. She was defeated last year by Democrat Martin Heinrich during a campaign that highlighted her connections to Los Alamos and Sandia. The labs conduct classified research on nuclear weapons.

Wilson, a former Air Force officer, has a doctorate in international relations and is a former staffer for the National Security Council. She campaigned as an expert on defense, arms control, and intelligence matters.

During the 2012 Senate campaign, the AP sought copies of Wilson's contracts with the labs after she disclosed income from Los Alamos, Sandia and Oak Ridge. And all three labs called the documents confidential.

Saying much of her work was classified, Wilson's campaign declined to release the contracts. But it said her work included helping Oak Ridge establish a senior advisory group on intelligence; providing advice to senior managers at Los Alamos on nuclear deterrence and threat reduction programs, and serving on the Intelligence Advisory Panel for Sandia National Labs.

""Her relationship with our national labs goes back over 20 years and she has worked on a wide range of projects with different groups of scientists and engineers over time,"" her campaign said in an e-mail.

The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the national labs, requested the DOE review of whether the agreement between the contractor that runs Los Alamos and Wilson was properly administered.

In addition to problems with the contracts and documentation of services provided by Wilson, the report said an agency contract officer was ""subjected to pressure""' when Los Alamos National Security, LLC, which runs Los Alamos, requested approval to enter an agreement with Wilson. The report said inspectors were unable to identify any evidence of that pressure.

It noted that the separate investigation continues. The report was issued by the civil division. The office also conducts criminal investigations.

The report is the latest in a string of reprimands from government oversight agencies for a lack of oversight of contracts and projects at the nation's nuclear facilities.

Congress has appointed a special committee to study a potential overhaul of the NNSA. Last month, the agency's acting director suddenly announced she is stepping down after less than six months in the top spot.

Wilson gave up her seat five years ago to run for the nomination to replace her mentor, longtime New Mexico Republican Sen. Pete Domenici. She lost in a tight primary, but ran again last year against Heinrich in a race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat.

Wilson called herself a consultant and said she turned down a top spot at Sandia to make her second run for Senate."

After the arrest the senator denied any sexual intent, and in a statement issued Monday afternoon he attributed the matter to a misunderstanding.

“At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions,” Mr. Craig said in the statement. “I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct.

“I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously.”

Mr. Craig also severed ties Monday with the Republican presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, in which he had been serving as a co-liaison to the Senate with Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah. The Romney campaign issued a statement that said: “Senator Craig has stepped down from his role with the campaign. He did not want to be a distraction, and we accept his decision.”

Mr. Craig, whose seat is up for election next year, is the second senator in recent weeks to find his personal behavior under scrutiny. Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, was implicated in a separate case in the Washington area when his phone number turned up in the records of an escort service that the authorities have described as a prostitution ring. Mr. Vitter made a public apology for what he called “a very serious sin in my past,” but he has not been charged with any crime."

Oh noes, not again.

I'm still not quite able to parse out what it is, exactly, that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and president of the United States Barack Obama have been doing that has much of the hard-right dousing themselves in gasoline and lighting themselves on fire. In the wake of a particularly devastating hurricane in Christie's state, they met together? More than once, even? Is that it? Or is it that Christie did not personally punch the president on first meeting him, or is it the even more profound insult of Christie agreeing that people in his state affected by the storm really could use some damn help, even if it came from—gasp—the federal gubbermint? I don't know. I don't know because, and this is the key point, I am not freaking insane.

Rapidly devolving radio host Rush Limbaugh, however, most certainly is, and so the primitive talking land-fish is all over this ""Christie and Obama were in the same place at the same time and this is an abomination unto Ayn Rand"" or-whatever-the-hell-he's-talking-about story:



There isn't any bipartisanship here. Obama has money. Governor Christie wants the money, Governor Christie needs the money, so the people will be helped. So Christie praises Obama. It's a master-servant relationship. That's exactly the kind of bipartisanship that the Drive-By Media wants. Master-servant. That's ""bipartisan"" That's what's going on here. (interruption) Master-SERVANT. Master-STAFF. Don't take it any further than that, Snerdley. I'm not going on, going there. I'm just telling you. Obama's got the money; Christie needs the money. ""Obama wants to walk the beach; that's what we're gonna do. Obama wants a photo-op; it's what we're gonna do.""

It's more than little funny to see the usual Washington wags bemoan the lack of ""bipartisanship"" and ""working together"" and all those nice things while conspicuously dodging awareness of just how much even the vague perception of ""working together"" will result in full-on revolt from the nutcases of the Republican base (or, in this case, the grand and glorious nutcase leaders). Really, having a president and governor tour disaster-stricken areas together is not generally considered a difficult bipartisan lift, much less an act of ideological treason.

Christie is for the most part a loyal conservative foot soldier. He hates the poors, he hates the unions, he does all the nice citizen-screwing things that are so popular among the party these days. But he hosted the president when a disaster struck the state, and that's just not done. At least not these days. It smacks too much of the premise that the government might really have an obligation to help people, or provides too much acknowledgement of the government existing and doing things at all. That thought puts a whole hurricane's worth of sand down the movement's collective pants, and they've not been shy in letting Christie know it.

Mr. Williams, 57, who until recently paid himself $1 million a year as a chief executive of Star Scientific, which has lost money for a decade, has a history of promoting over-the-counter treatments and a parallel history of running afoul of regulators. Two decades ago he was ordered to pay $300,000 for pumping up a stock with false claims about an anti-wrinkle cream named Lacramore.

In March, Star Scientific, which sells two dietary supplements and two face creams, revealed it was the target of a federal investigation into its stock.

A lawyer for Mr. Williams, Jerry Kilgore, did not respond to requests for comment.

Another friend of Mr. Williams’s is Virginia’s attorney general, Mr. Cuccinelli. Mr. Cuccinelli has reported $18,000 in gifts from Mr. Williams, including regular vacations at a house on Smith Mountain Lake, near Roanoke, and a catered $1,500 Thanksgiving dinner. He also received a box of Anatabloc.

Mr. Cuccinelli, 44, bought stock in Star Scientific, which at one time was worth more than $20,000, although he failed to disclose his holding as required by law for nearly a year. Last October, he filed an updated statement of economic interest to include the stock, his only substantial investment.

The Cuccinelli campaign declined to answer questions about Mr. Williams and Star Scientific. Chris LaCivita, a strategist for the campaign, has said Mr. Cuccinelli did not realize his stock’s value had passed $10,000, the threshold for reporting. Once he did, he corrected the record. He has since sold all of his shares, his campaign has said, the last in mid-April."

Chuck Grassley’s request for a briefing on their coming immigration reform bill.

Last week, Grassley (R-IA) and his conservative committee colleagues Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Mike Lee (R-UT) wrote to “Gang of Eight” senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), John McCain (R-AZ), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), asking them to champion a transparent immigration reform process complete with thorough hearings examining each facet of any legislation those “Gang” Republicans and their Democratic counterparts develop.

“Because the president has failed to lead on this matter, your group has secretly met for months and not consulted with members of this Committee about major changes to our nation’s immigration laws,” Grassley and his colleagues wrote. “The time for transparency has come. Given the Majority’s rushed timetable, we believe it is time for you to discuss the status of your negotiations, disclose what concessions have been made, and provide details to members of the Judiciary Committee as well as the entire Republican Caucus.”

In the letter that Grassley organized, he and his fellow Judiciary Committee conservatives asked for a briefing from the Gang GOP by the close of business on Monday April 8. “[W]e ask that your staff be made available to Republican Committee staff no later than the close of business on Monday, April 8,” Grassley and the Senate Judiciary conservatives wrote. “We also request that you personally discuss your group’s proposal with the entire caucus early next week so that all members can raise concerns and questions before the deal is finalized.”

Despite this request from Grassley and his colleagues, an aide for one of the offices who signed the letter confirmed for Breitbart News that the Gang of Eight Republicans ignored the deadline.

“The request for a staff briefing by today was declined,” the aide said.



Rubio had responded to Grassley’s and his colleagues’ original letter by saying he agreed with their concerns about process. In his response, Rubio did not mention Grassley’s request for a briefing of Senate Judiciary Committee GOP staff by the close of business on Monday.

“I believe strongly that all other 92 senators should be given ample time not just to review the legislation, but to offer ways to improve it,” Rubio said instead. “Earlier this week, I requested and received permission to brief the entire Republican conference during our policy lunch next week. I look forward to briefing you at that meeting.

“In addition, I have asked my staff to brief the staff of every Republican member of your committee once the details of our starting point proposal are finalized. Rest assured I continue to welcome, value and encourage any input you may have. In the meantime, if you or your staff has any specific ideas on immigration reform, please contact us as soon as possible.”

Grassley is known for being a tough oversight official and led, with House oversight committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious that spanned most of last Congress and is ongoing.

Spokespersons for each of the Gang of Eight Republican members either did not return Breitbart News’ request for comment on their bosses’ decision or would not comment on the record."

That argument went down in flames in January 2012, and the Republicans were ordered to turn over their communications related to the new maps. And among the key Legislative aides that were involved in the map-making at MBF were ""afoltz"" - Adam Foltz, an aide to then-Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald - and ""tottman"" - Tad Ottman, and aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.

And the Democrats who made their own filing to coincide with Lanterman's findings note that the dates Foltz and Ottman had their deletion party was not coincidental.

On January 3, more than a month before trial, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to reconvene the depositions of Messrs. Ottman and Foltz and Joseph Handrick. It again ordered those witnesses to “produce documents in their possession that have been requested by the plaintiffs.” Order (Dkt. 104) at 10. Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with the legislature’s counsel on January 6, and the legislature produced additional documents on January 10 and 11. The January 6 deletions occurred just after the Court’s order and just before the legislature’s supplemental production. And they occurred on computers in Michael Best’s offices. Questions about the legislature’s document productions arose immediately after the close of trial. See Mem. in Support of Post-Trial Mot. for Remedial Discovery (Dkt. 253) at 8-11. On July 18, 2012, after majority control of the state senate shifted, the new majority leader requested Michael Best’s redistricting file. The following day (July 19), Michael Best agreed that it would make its redistricting file available for review. One week later (July 25), a user logged into the account of Tad Ottman, aide to state Senator Scott Fitzgerald—who just had been replaced as majority leader—deleted hundreds of thousands of redistricting files. The following week, Michael Best turned over its redistricting file to the new senate majority leader.

Ruh roh. And did I mention that Foltz has already testified that the new maps didn't take political implications in mind when they were done? I already said last year that this guy's looking at prison time for that perjury, but refusing to comply with court orders and deletion of evidence is a whole 'nother level of law-breaking. Hope THAT was worth it, Foltzie.

But as I like to say about WisGOP, not a lot of things with these guys are coincidental, and they come from the top. Let's face it, if you know what youngster GOP leggie aides are like these days, they are some of the biggest toolbags you can find - remote-controlled dopes who need an instructional manual to figure out what words to use on a press release. With that in mind, did I mention that former Wisconsin GOP Chair and current RNC Chair Reince Priebus is a former Michael, Best and Friedrich lawyer, and wanted to make sure Sean ""from the Real World"" Duffy and other WisGOP Congress members could be protected. And did I also mention that his college roomate Robin Vos was very interested in what the maps would say, since it was probable that Jeff Fitzgerald and Vos had worked out an agreement that Jeff Fitzgerald would run for U.S. Senate, and Vos would move up to Speaker if the GOPs maintained their majority after the 2012 elections (which they did)?

Hilariously, Vos is quoted in the State Journal article on the latest developments as saying ""he was not in leadership during the time in question and referred questions to attorneys handling the case."" RIIIIGHT. The guy known around the Capitol as ""Boss Vos"" with a newly-installed spiral staircase in his office to have a centralized office of WisGOP communcations and ""policy research"" had no hand in what was going on in a redistricting that would help him cement power? If you believe this, then....you probably believe that Scott Walker had 5 personally-hired aides breaking the law in Milwaukee County without his knowledge, either. I may have been born at 10:02pm, but it sure wasn't last night.

Given what Lanterman describes in his filing, he's been able to get back a lot of these files that Foltz and Ottman thought they'd gotten rid of, and given that the findings are due on May 10, we'll find out what's in those soon enough. But given that the only thing that Republican socipaths seem to understand is power and money, the only suitable punishment to stop these people are to THROW THE MAPS OUT (to take away their undeserved power) and make the aides and the bosses who gave the orders GO TO JAIL for such flagratn defiance of court orders and state open records laws.

This is definitely going to blow up. It's just a question of how high up it'll go. And if the national media wants a good ""off-year"" scandal, this may be one they might want to look at, because it could be a good one.

Jennifer Carroll resigned amid fallout from a probe into Internet cafes that are fronts for gambling

Carroll proposed a bill when she was in the Legislature that would benefit Internet cafes

Authorities refused to discuss any ties between Carroll and the investigation

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida's lieutenant governor resigned and nearly 60 other people were charged in a widening scandal of a purported veterans charity that authorities said Wednesday was a $300 million front for illegal gambling.

Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll's resignation came a day after she was questioned in the investigation. Her public relations firm did work for the St. Augustine, Fla.-based charity Allied Veterans of the World, but she has not been accused of wrongdoing.

Authorities said the probe involved 57 arrest warrants and 54 search warrants issued at gambling operations in 23 Florida counties and five other states: Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said charges, which will be formally filed next week, include racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and possession of slot machines.

""It's callous and it's despicable,"" Bondi said of the alleged scam, which she said ""insults every American who ever wore a military uniform.""

Authorities refused to discuss any ties between Carroll, a 53-year-old Republican, and the investigation. Her aides had no immediate comment.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday he has no knowledge on whether Carroll had broken the law but said she resigned so her former ties to the company would not be a distraction for the administration..

Carroll, a Navy veteran who served in the Gulf War, appeared in a TV ad in 2011 promoting the organization's charitable work on behalf of veterans and their families.

Her resignation letter to Scott offered no details about her reason for leaving, and the Republican governor would not say whether he asked her to resign.

""I will not elaborate on the details of her resignation further, other than to say that she resigned and she made the right decision for the state and her family,"" Scott said.

Allied Veterans evolved from a charitable organization that ran bingo games and held bake sales for veterans beginning in 1979 to a group suspected of operating more than 40 illegal gambling locations around Florida, according to an Internal Revenue Service affidavit. The veterans' charity was a fraud, according to the IRS.

""In an effort to mislead the public into believing that it is not profiting from an illegal gambling enterprise, Allied Veterans and others have engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to defraud,"" the affidavit said.

One of those arrested, Jacksonville, Fla., lawyer Kelly Mathis, is the alleged mastermind of the scheme, authorities said. Mathis is accused of making about $6 million alone from the gambling operation.

From 2007 to early 2012, investigators found evidence of more than $6 million in what appear to be charitable donations by Allied Veterans. However, that amount was only about 2% of more than $290 million made from gambling operations during that period. Instead of going to veterans, the vast majority of the money went to for-profit companies and the individuals who operated Allied Veterans and its so-called ""affiliates.""

Authorities said they seized about 300 bank accounts containing $64.7 million and assets including such exotic vehicles as Maseratis, Porsches and Ferraris.

To play games at one of the Internet cafes, a customer gets a prepaid card and then goes to a computer to play ""sweepstakes."" The games, with spinning wheels similar to slot machines, have names such as ""Captain Cash,"" ""Lucky Shamrocks"" and ""Money Bunny,"" according to the IRS.

Winners go back to a cashier with their cards and cash out.

The games have been the subject of much debate in Florida, and some are legal as long as most of the profits are donated to charity.

Each of the locations had a big sign prominently displayed that read: ""This is not a gaming establishment."" Inside were rows of computers where patrons could play the various games.

At most of the sites, employees wore shirts emblazoned with an ""Allied Veterans"" logo. On the walls were photos of company executives making donations on its behalf and letters of recognition from some of the charities that received donations.

In Anadarko, Okla., the owner of International Internet Technologies, which was accused of supplying the cafes with software, was arrested along with his wife.

Chase Egan Burns, 37, and his wife, 38-year-old Kristin Burns, faced charges including racketeering and conspiracy in Florida. International Internet Technologies made $63 million from the Florida operation from 2007 to 2010, according to the IRS affidavit.

Burns' wife's role in the company was not immediately clear.

Chase Burns was released from Caddo County jail on a $500,000 bond. He denied any wrongdoing.

""What we do is legal,"" he told The Oklahoman on Monday.

His father, Tony Burns, also serves as his lawyer. Tony Burns told the newspaper that his son broke no laws.

""What Chase was doing was he was actually selling the Internet time,"" Tony Burns said. ""That's was what his business was — providing the software. And there's nothing illegal about providing software to any business.""

Calls to the Burnses on Wednesday were not immediately returned.

A telephone number listed for Allied Veterans was disconnected. Multiple e-mails to an address listed on the group's website weren't returned.

Former Florida state Rep. Scott Plakon, a Republican, said he filed bills to shut down the gaming sites in 2011 and 2012.

""I found that this is gambling, happening right next door to our Publix (grocery store) and dry cleaner, and it just didn't seem right,"" he said.

Carroll, an immigrant from Trinidad, served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, working as a jet mechanic before retiring as a lieutenant commander. Elected to the state House in 2003, she's served as deputy majority leader and majority whip. She's also a former executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs. She moved to Florida in 1986.

A married mother of three, Carroll has a son who plays defensive back for the Miami Dolphins.

Carroll was the brunt of late-night talk show hosts last summer after she apologized for offending lesbians when she said black women who engage in those relationships don't look like her.

Carroll, who was implying that black lesbians aren't attractive, made the remarks when she was asked about court documents in which a fired staffer claimed that she walked in on Carroll and a female travel aide in a compromising position. Carroll denies that claim.

The former staffer is charged with violating state law for allegedly giving a recording of a conversation with Carroll's chief of staff to a newspaper reporter.

It was wrong for the announcer, a local school superintendent, to rile up the crowd by saying, “We’re gonna stomp Obama now.”

And wrong for him to say, “As soon as their bull comes out, Obama don’t you move. He’s gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha!”

It was wrong for the crowd to go wild.

Perry Beam, a 48-year-old musician who describes himself as an “old country boy,” was appalled by what he saw and blew the lid off this embarrassment by posting about it on Facebook. “One of the clowns ran up and started bobbling the lips on the mask and the crowd went crazy,” Beam wrote, according to his friend, Bob Yates, who reposted the item on a politically liberal Missouri website called Show Me Progress.

“Everybody screamed” and “just went wild” when the rodeo announcer talked about stomping the clown, Beam told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

“It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear,” Beam told the Dispatch. “It was that level of enthusiasm. ... It was cruel. It was disturbing. I am still sick to my stomach over it. ... I’ve never seen anything so blatantly racist in my life.”

Later, in an interview with Missouri TV station KSDK, Beam said the scene was “like an effigy at a Klan rally.”

The condemnations were harsh and swift.

The Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Assn. apologized. The state’s Democratic governor and Republican lieutenant governor condemned the prank. Noting that the state fair is a family event funded by taxpayer dollars, Missouri’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill said young people should not be taught that “it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

So why did it happen?

Probably for the same reason that some idiot threw a banana on Sunday at Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones at the Giants’ AT&T Park.

Probably for the same reason that a rodeo announcer near San Luis Obispo made a grotesquely racist joke about First Lady Michelle Obama last year.

And probably for the same reason that a medical resident at UCLA thought it would be funny to photoshop the face of a black surgeon onto a gorilla and show the gorilla being sodomized by a white department head. (That antic, by the way, cost UCLA $4.5 million.)

We may have a black president for the first time in our history, but racism in the guise of humor continues to be an undiminished flaw of the American personality.

It would be nice to report that no prominent person defended the blatantly racist disrespect on parade in Missouri over the weekend.

Dream on.

On Monday, the man you might call the head clown for racist humor in America put the blame for the Missouri embarrassment squarely at the president’s feet because the president had the audacity to discuss serious issues of foreign policy when he appeared with Jay Leno on “The Tonight Show” last week.

“When the president of the United States more often than not connects with the American people on late-night comedy shows,” opined Rush Limbaugh on Monday morning, “what else can happen other than the diminishing of the office?”

Oh please. For decades, American politicians (John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin, John McCain) have appeared on comedy shows. Far from diminishing the offices they hold or to which they aspire, they demonstrate -- or try to anyway -- that they are normal human beings, that humor can co-exist with the serious business of governing.

Presidents diminish their offices in many ways (see some of the names above). But appearing on television is not one of them.

And to link the disgusting spectacle at the Missouri State Fair to an innocuous Obama appearance on “The Tonight Show” is clownish at best.

[For the Record, 2:59 p.m. PDT Aug. 12: An earlier version of this online post incorrectly stated that Missouri’s governor is a Republican. He is a Democrat.]

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/17/Media-Matters-Attacks-NYT-For-Clinton-Foundation-Expos,2013-08-17 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Media Matters Attacks NYT over Clinton Foundation ExposÃ©,"In the wake of last week’s much-discussed New York Times investigative report detailing cronyism and mismanagement inside the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton issued an open letter in an attempt to stem the public relations backlash. Clinton’s letter challenged a couple of the Times’ assertions that his nonprofit had run deficits.

Curiously, Clinton’s letter left unchallenged the Times’ more troubling reporting–based on over two dozen interviews with Clinton Foundation insiders–that the nonprofit is rife with cronyism and conflicts of interest that leverage access and power to benefit for-profit ventures like Teneo, a consultancy co-founded by Bill Clinton’s “surrogate son” and former Clinton Foundation aide Douglas Band. Teneo, whose earliest clients included the now-defunct MF Global headed up by Obama bundler Jon Corzine, has also hired Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.

That placed Media Matters in the awkward position of defending Hillary and Bill Clinton from the liberalNew York Times. Media Matters blogger Emily Arrowood filed a blog post chastising the New York Timesfor its “misleading Times story, which apparently failed to perform due diligence in reporting on the accounting requirements for foundations.”

Oddly, Arrowood went on to scold conservative media outlets for having the temerity to cite the New York Times reportage.

“Predictably, conservative media did not wait to learn these facts surrounding the Clinton Foundation, preferring to cite the initial Times story to decry imaginary scandals and lob both new and old attacks at Hillary Clinton,” wrote Arrowood. She blasted Fox News host Eric Bolling, The Blaze, The London Telegraph (sic), former New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Ed Klein, and The Atlantic as being part of a “right-wing noise machine” that was “scrambling to find a new Hillary scandal.”

Like Bill Clinton’s letter, however, Arrowood’s blog post sidestepped the Times’ more serious charges of cronyism and conflicts of interest and ducked altogether the Breitbart News report last week featured on Drudge Report that chronicled additional Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest not included in theTimes’ original report. As Breitbart News reported, by 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments with whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would later negotiate. In her role as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton also reportedly helped New York developer Robert Congel win millions of dollars in federal assistance after Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

Then there is the case of Teneo. According to the Times, the Clintons, Band, Teneo, and the Foundation were entangled in a web of crony alliances and conflicts of interest:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds. By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm. Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band’s relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

The crony connections between Teneo, Douglas Band, and the Clintons had grown so alarming, reports theTimes, that Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band’s outside business might have on her father’s work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.”

The Media Matters piece made no mention of Teneo, Douglas Band, Robert Congel, or Chelsea Clinton’s concerns over crony capitalist conflicts of interest.

Instead, following Bill Clinton’s lead, Media Matters dodged the New York Times‘ most serious revelations and quibbled over “context”–a risky tactic that may encourage the Times to dig deeper.

Indeed, just one day after Bill Clinton and Media Matters’s retort, liberal New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd followed up the Times’ Clinton Foundation cronyism report with this: “If Americans are worried about money in politics, there is no larger concern than the Clintons…Clintonworld is a galaxy where personal enrichment and political advancement blend seamlessly, and where a cast of jarringly familiar characters pad their pockets every which way to Sunday.”

Dowd added, “The most egregious nest of conflicts was a firm founded by Doug Band called Teneo, a scammy blend of corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking. Band, a surrogate son to Bill, put Huma, a surrogate daughter to Hillary, on the payroll. Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviser.”

No word yet from Media Matters on Maureen Dowd’s newly minted allegiance with the “right-wing noise machine.”"

Who knows?

The juicy tale of how batshit crazy Rep. Michele Bachmann screwed over her presidential campaign staff is fast becoming the greatest soap opera EVER!

First, we learned that Bachmann is refusing to pay five staffers unless they sign a nondisclosure agreement that prohibits them them from talking to any reporters or police about any ""unethical, immoral, or criminal activity"" they may have witnessed during the campaign. And it seems they did witness some, um, questionable activities—including stealing an email list from a home-schooling group.

Then, because leaking that story did not motivate Bachmann to open the checkbook and just pay her damn staff, her especially bitter former field coordinator, Peter Waldron, started dishing the dirt about how Bachmann was basically mind-controlled by her debate coach, whose ""Rasputin-like"" relationship was so powerful, he even forbade her own husband from sleeping in the same room with her on the trail. Which, as we all know, must have been just devastating for poor Marcus.

In today's episode of why you should probably not refuse to pay staffers who know an awful lot of juicy things about you and your potentially illegal campaign activities:



A top adviser in Michele Bachmann's 2012 White House bid has filed a complaint with federal election officials alleging campaign finance violations involving her presidential campaign and the independent political action committee she leads. [...] Waldron, formerly Bachmann's national field coordinator, is accusing the campaign of improperly dipping into money from MichelePAC to pay longtime fundraising consultant Guy Short for presidential campaign work he performed in the critical final weeks ahead of Iowa's caucuses last year. Waldron also alleges that the campaign concealed payments to Iowa state campaign chairman Kent Sorenson, a state senator who abruptly left the Bachmann camp to join then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul's insurgent campaign.

Call me Bachmann-crazy, but I don't think Waldron is going to shut up until he gets a check in his hands. Here's hoping, anyway. Tune in tomorrow ...

(CNN) - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz is accusing critics of smear tactics after they attacked his father for saying President Obama should go ""back to Chicago, back to Kenya"" at an event last year.

Even as he dismissed his father’s comments as a “joke” and ill-advised, he said critics were motivated as much by politics as by genuine outrage.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Speaking to CNN affiliate WFAA on Friday, the first-term Republican senator from Texas said, ""sadly, those who are trying to play the politics of personal destruction are trying to smear him and use that to attack me. That's a shame.""

""I love my father,"" said Cruz. ""He is a pastor. He is a man of deep integrity. And he made a joke.""

Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, is an influential figure in his own right and is known for his outspoken conservative positions. He has attracted a following among tea party activists and social conservatives, and he has campaigned alongside his son on many occasions.

The controversial remarks were captured in a video first posted on the left-leaning news website Mother Jones on Thursday. The website posted that video, along with several other videos of Rafael Cruz addressing conservative groups, and the comments quickly circulated online, drawing criticism from liberals.

Sen. Cruz's statement to WFAA marks his strongest reaction so far to his father's critics.

A spokeswoman for the senator previously declined to offer comment about the elder Cruz's statements, instead referring CNN to a statement that Cruz Communications Director Sean Rushton gave to Mother Jones.

""These selective quotes, taken out of context, mischaracterize the substance of Pastor Cruz's message. Like many Americans, he feels America is on the wrong track,"" Rushton said in the statement, adding, ""Pastor Cruz does not speak for the Senator.""

Rafael Cruz's remarks are reminiscent of the so-called birther movement, led by influential figures such as Donald Trump, who have suggested that Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore ineligible to be president.

Obama responded to those critics in 2011 by releasing his long-form birth certificate, which shows that he was born in Hawaii."

Florida%27s lieutenant governor did ads for non-profit now under scrutiny

Federal investigators say only 2%25 of proceeds from non-profit went to charity



Nearly 60 people in 6 states arrested in connection with gambling investigation

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Wednesday's resignation of Florida's lieutenant governor and the arrests of almost five dozen people in six states shows the need for a crackdown on Internet cafes in Florida, a prominent state senator said.

Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, 53, submitted her resignation letter Tuesday afternoon amid a state and federal investigation into a chain of Internet cafes she once represented called Allied Veterans of the World, a charity based in St. Augustine, Fla.

Carroll, a Navy veteran who served in the Gulf War, appeared in a TV ad in 2011 promoting the organization's charitable work on behalf of veterans and their families, and her public-relations firm once represented Allied Veterans. Federal agents arrested the owner of an Oklahoma software company and his wife Tuesday, accusing them of supplying illegal gambling software to Allied Veterans, and law-enforcement agencies in Florida and five other states arrested nearly 60 people in connection with the investigation.

""You can see people are having problems,"" said Sen. John Thrasher, a Republican from St. Augustine, adding that law enforcement has told him the Allied Veterans investigation has led to the confiscation of $50 million. ""I think this is a system that they need to justify.""

Last month, Thrasher pitched a bill that would place a moratorium on Internet cafes, saying they harbored illegal gambling. Carroll's resignation and the investigation of Allied Veterans of The World proves changes must be made, he said.

Thrasher pitched a similar idea for a moratorium on the cafes last year, but the bill did not pass.

The Coalition of Florida's Internet Cafes, an informal trade group, said the promotions they offer have been legal in the state since 1971 and are not gambling, according to their website. They say the games promote the sale of telephone minutes and Internet time.

To play games at one of the Internet cafes, a customer gets a prepaid card and then goes to a computer to play ""sweepstakes."" The games, with spinning wheels similar to slot machines, have names such as ""Captain Cash,"" ""Lucky Shamrocks"" and ""Money Bunny,"" according to the Internal Revenue Service.

Winners go back to a cashier with their cards and cash out.

According to an IRS affidavit filed in federal court, Allied Veterans evolved from a charitable organization in 1979 that ran bingo games and had bake sales for veterans to a group suspected of operating more than 40 illegal for-profit gambling locations around Florida. The veterans' charity was a fraud, according to the IRS.

The federal investigation alleges that Allied Veterans of the World, operating as a non-profit corporation since 2007, misled the public about the amount of money it donated to charity. The company claimed to donate ""anywhere from 70% to all of the net proceeds or profits from its gambling operation.""

From 2007 to early 2012, investigators say they found evidence of more than $6 million in what appear to be charitable donations, about 2% of net proceeds of $290 million.

Carroll's resignation brought a wave of reactions around the state Capitol.

""Lt. Gov. Carroll has been a great leader for our party and our state. She was a terrific advocate for Florida's military and economic development efforts,"" Lenny Curry, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said in a statement. ""Her resignation is disappointing, but she made the right decision to protect both her family and the work she has done to move our state forward over the last few years.""

USA TODAY

Rep. Mark Sanford's fiancée, Maria Belen Chapur, says she is ""happy"" in her relationship with the Republican congressman.

Chapur gave her first extended remarks about her relationship with Sanford, a former South Carolina governor whose political career was derailed by his extramarital affair, to Infobae, an Argentine TV station, last week.

""When we're together, we live together,"" Chapur said, according to a translated version of her TV interview. ""Partly in Washington, partly in Charleston. Now it's difficult, but until last year, he would come to Buenos Aires.""

Sanford won redemption from South Carolina voters in May, winning back his old congressional seat after a two-year break from politics. Sanford's affair with Chapur, which he admitted to in 2009, wrecked his marriage. The relationship became tabloid fodder when he told his staff that he was ""hiking on the Appalachian Trail"" and could not be reached, when he was instead visiting Chapur in Argentina.

Sanford and his ex-wife, Jenny, had a messy divorce which came up again in his congressional campaign this year when she charged him with trespassing at her South Carolina home. (They settled out of court.)

Chapur, a former TV journalist and divorced mother of two, appeared at Sanford's primary victory events. She stayed largely behind the scenes during his short campaign against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Chapur attended Sanford's swearing-in celebration at the U.S. Capitol, and sat in the visitor's gallery next to two of his sons.

Chapur told Infobae that she and Sanford met in 2001 in Uruguay. She said they had a ""strict friendship"" for years — she even received the Sanford family Christmas card — until their relationship changed in 2008.

""Since that time, we've stayed in the relationship,"" Chapur said. ""Today, he returned to politics. Many asked him to resign and (he) decided to stay at a great cost and finished ranked as one of the four best governors in the United States.""

Rand Paul on plagiarism: 'Do I have to be in detention the rest of my career?',"In an interview with National Review Online on Capitol Hill, Paul was furious, especially with the press coverage of the allegations. “It annoys the hell out of me,” Paul said. “I feel like if I could just go to detention after school for a couple days, then everything would be okay. But do I have to be in detention for the rest of my career?”

“What makes me mad about the whole thing is that I believe there is a difference between errors of omission and errors of intention,” he said. “We aren’t perfect and we have made errors of omission, but we never intended to mislead anybody.”

Am I the only one here who is deeply impressed with Sen. Rand Paul's insistence on playing the victim in his own plagiarism scandal? The narcissism levels are off the chart Well poor effing baby—you get caught lifting entire pages worth of material and passing it off as your own work, and your primary response is to be irritated that people keep bringing it up several days? Dear God, I don't know where our country finds these people, but we should be paying NASA some serious cash money to develop a system for sending them back there.No. You cannot get caught with your hand in other people's cookie jars to the tune of thousands of words and then plead oopsie, saying you didn't mean it. Of course you meant it. Either you—the person who wrote the book with your name on it—or some random staffer—the person who actually wrote the book with your name on it—copypasted large sections of text and put them under your byline. Same for op-ed articles. Same for speeches. The only way that happens is (1) if nobody involved, despite presumably at-least-basic levels of edumacation, has the slightest grasp of what plagiarism is or (2) nobody involved cares. The good senator has still not properly elucidated which of those two things happened, but from his sad coyote howling I am guessing that he would like us to believe that Mr. Doctor Senator Rand Son Of Ron Paul is simply unfamiliar with this whole don't goddamn steal concept. How dare people ask him about these things. For multiple days in a row!

Smart people have noted that Rand Paul seems to be a more political politico than his father, a man who always was a crackpot first and a politician second. Paul the Younger inherited his father's notions but attached an ambition all his own. Short version: The bullshit force is strong in this one.



“It’s also what people hate about politics, and it’s why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,” he said. “To tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they’re tired of me. I’ll go back to being a doctor, and I’ll be perfectly content.”

That's right, America, the Rand Paul family is none too keen on politics. If you're going to keep yelling at him for stupid things like junior-high level plagiarism, well Mr. Doctor Rand Paul will just go back to his self-certified ophthalmology career. None of those people give a damn if you design your own medical accreditation and sign your name to the bottom of it. Not like you ""haters.""

So far the only consequence of Paul's serial oopsies has been the cancellation of his Washington Times op-ed column. That's right: Sen. Rand Paul has been considered too unethical for the damn Washington Times. That's got to be worth a framed certificate right there.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) - Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used an analogy about rape Friday to blast this week’s decision by the Senate's Democratic majority to change the chamber’s filibuster rules despite the unanimous opposition of minority Republicans.

The so-called “nuclear option” will allow a bare majority of senators – as opposed to 60 - to approve most judicial and executive branch nominations. The Democratic caucus controls 55 of the chamber’s 100 seats.



""Let's say, let's take 10 people in a room and they're a group. And the room is made up of six men and four women. The group has a rule that the men cannot rape the women. The group also has a rule that says any rule that will be changed must require six votes, of the 10, to change the rule,"" Limbaugh told listeners.

""Every now and then, some lunatic in the group proposes to change the rule to allow women to be raped. But they never were able to get six votes for it. There were always the four women voting against it and they always found two guys.”

Limbaugh continued: “Well, the guy that kept proposing that women be raped finally got tired of it, and he was in the majority and he was one that (said), 'You know what? We're going to change the rule. Now all we need is five.""

“And well, 'You can't do that.' 'Yes we are. We're the majority. We're changing the rule.' And then they vote. Can the women be raped? Well, all it would take then is half of the room,” Limbaugh said.

“You can change the rule to say three. You can change the rule to say three people want it, it's going to happen. There's no rule. When the majority can change the rules there aren't any.""

Friday’s analogy isn’t Limbaugh’s first inflammatory comment about women. Last year, the radio host apologized for a comment he made on his show about Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, calling her a ""slut"" after she testified about contraception on Capitol Hill."

Bush chief political strategist Matt Dowd continued to try to diminish Sarah Palin and conservatives by once again making false claims about the former Alaska governor.

On Sunday’s “ABC’s This Week,” Dowd assailed CPAC for, in his mind, lessening its credibility by inviting conservatives like Palin and not liberal Republicans favored by the northeastern elite like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

“CPAC, to me, has totally diminished its credibility as an organization,” Dowd said. “And you invite Sarah Palin, who wasn’t competent enough to keep a Fox News contract? But she’s invited to the CPAC meeting?”

Dowd falsely claimed that Palin was not competent enough to be on Fox, whereas Palin turned down Fox’s offer to renew her contract. His remark was not only a dig at Palin but also a shot at Fox, implying the news network that has dominated the cable news ratings employs people with subpar levels of intelligence who do not meet the lofty standards of the Aspen Institute or Harvard’s Institute of Politics. His comments also imply that he feels the conservatives who came out in droves to elect Bush twice–which is the only reason he has his media perch and anyone has even heard of him–are dumb as well.

Other writers purporting to represent the right, like Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post‘s token conservative, also have chimed in, writing any gathering that includes Palin while not inviting GOProud and Christie “isn’t worth attending.”

Conservative writer Jeffrey Lord assailed these elitist Republicans who feel entitled to make CPAC “a big tent” instead of the “conservative tent” that it is supposed to be.

Since Bush left office, his top advisers have begun to show their true–and not-so-conservative–colors. Mark McKinnon, the scarf-wearing, No Labels-founding former Bush media maven, has actively courted the approval of the media elite and made himself a featured attraction at elitist seminars. Karl Rove has slammed conservative candidates and now has created as super PAC that will arm itself to wage war against Tea Party candidates in GOP primaries.

As BizPacReview notes, in 2010, Palin, in response to talk radio host Laura Ingraham’s claim that the Bush family was trying to “kneecap” a potential Palin presidential campaign, referred to the Bush family as “blue bloods” who make up the Republican establishment.

As the publication notes, many pundits attribute the lack of enthusiasm on the right over Mitt Romney’s candidacy to Romney’s and the Republican establishment’s snub of Palin and the Tea Party that won the GOP its House majority in 2010. The Republican establishment advisers were fearful of what their mainstream media bettors would think of them if they embraced the vice presidential candidate who has galvanized the Tea Party and the conservative base more than any other figure on the right over the last four years.

Having not learned their lesson, establishment Republicans, BizPacReview notes, “continue to attack Palin for no apparent reason.”

But there is a deeper reason why establishment Republicans disdain Palin the reformer.

When Palin made her first appearance at CPAC last year, she blistered Washington’s crony capitalism and permanent political class, which Stephen K. Bannon and the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute’s Peter Schweizer would later document in “Boomtown.”

At CPAC 2012, journalists and observers noted that no speaker galvanized the conservative base–with conservative words and ideas–like Palin.

And that is why establishment Republicans like Dowd, who helped enable D.C.’s “Boomtown,” would rather anoint moderates like Christie and Romney as leaders on the right instead of conservatives like Palin, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)–both of whom Palin endorsed in their respective primaries–who are unafraid to challenge Republicans as well as Democrats."

Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted of campaign corruption

Former state Sen. Jane Orie is already in state prison

Melvin will likely face impeachment if she does not resign

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The story has more irony than a Greek tragedy. Three sisters from a devoutly Catholic family have seen their personal and political careers ruined by a scandal that began with, of all things, a letter to some nuns.

Thursday's conviction of suspended state Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin along with her aide and sister, Janine Orie, on campaign corruption charges mean they might join a third sister — former state Sen. Jane Orie — in state prison. No sentencing date has been set.

The former senator was sentenced last year to 2½ to 10 years for using her state-paid staff to run her campaigns, though she was acquitted of having them campaign for Melvin, then a lower appellate court judge, who was running for the Supreme Court in 2003 and 2009. Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted in a spinoff investigation and found guilty of similarly misusing Melvin's former staff and the senator's.

Even before the convictions, their careers — and the family from which they sprang — were extraordinary.

Dr. John Orie, now 90, and his late wife, Jean, raised nine children including five attorneys, Joan and Jane among them; two cardiologists; a teacher; and a human resources manager, Janine, who worked for her sister Joan Orie Melvin in the lower Superior Court before moving up with her to the Supreme Court.

""It's all pretty unbelievable,"" said John Burkoff, a university of Pittsburgh law professor who has closely followed the cases. ""Whatever you thought about the Orie sisters, whether you liked or didn't like them, you have to look at all of this as tragic.""

Jim Roddey is a prominent businessman who heads the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Republicans are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 by Democrats and where Pittsburgh, the county seat, hasn't elected a GOP mayor since the Great Depression.

Before 2010, when Republican Tom Corbett was elected governor, Jane Orie was the state Senate majority whip — the highest-ranking elected Republican politician not just in Pennsylvania, but also of several states in the Northeast, Roddey said. And Melvin, elected in November 2009, was one of seven members of the state's highest court.

And now? Jane Orie resigned her Senate seat in May, and Melvin's status on the state's highest court figures to change, one way or another.

State lawmakers have already asked her to resign or face articles of impeachment. If those are approved by the state House, Melvin would be tried by the Senate, which could remove her from office if she hasn't already been removed by the state's Court of Judicial Discipline.

Now that she has been convicted, Melvin has 30 days to respond to charges of misconduct filed with that court by the state's Judicial Conduct Board. If it is determined Melvin has violated professional conduct rules or the state Constitution, or brought disrepute to the judiciary, the court can remove her from office.

Melvin's criminal defense attorneys and her disciplinary court attorney didn't return calls Friday.

The Ories have argued the prosecution is the result of a political vendetta by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr., a Democrat, who has repeatedly denied ulterior motives.

When the investigation first became public in late 2009, the sisters claimed they were being targeted because Zappala's family has interests in legalized gambling, which the Ories opposed expanding in Pennsylvania.

The allegations grew uglier, when Melvin — after it was known Sen. Orie was being investigated but before the justice was charged — called for an audit of two child care centers that paid kickbacks to two judges in northeastern Pennsylvania's Luzerne County who sent troubled youths to the facilities. The facilities were co-owned by Gregory Zappala, the prosecutor's brother, who was never charged in the scheme and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

To this day, some Orie supporters still believe those politics — not justice — drove the prosecution.

Roddey acknowledges the sisters' success in a politically hostile environment has something to do with that chatter.

""That's part of it,"" Roddey said. ""But the other half of the equation is that her prosecutor was Stephen Zappala, and Joan's biggest public battle was she chastised the Supreme Court for what happened in Luzerne County.""

Whatever the motivations, two juries have now found enough evidence to bring the overachieving siblings from triumph to tragedy despite a raft of supporters — Sen. Orie spent $420 on a chartered bus to bring 50 character witnesses to her trial — and, even, efforts to seek divine intervention.

During the investigation, which centered on the sisters' emails, prosecutors stumbled onto messages Sen. Orie and Melvin sent to the ""angel lady,"" a Philadelphia psychic who read her client's written questions aloud before claiming to receive a whispered answer from an angel.

The senator and justice sought assurances from the $85-an-hour medium that Zappala's investigation wouldn't result in criminal charges.

But rather than being touched by an angel, the sisters were undone by some nuns.

That happened in late October 2009 — days before Melvin won her Supreme Court seat — when a Senate intern complained to Zappala that Sen. Orie's staff was doing campaign work for Melvin.

The complaint centered on a letter Sen. Orie wrote on Melvin's campaign stationery asking Pittsburgh-area nuns to vote for Melvin.

When Orie and Melvin learned of the whistleblowing intern, the senator had a staffer prepare another letter — a ""cover-up"" letter, according to prosecutors. This time, Sen. Orie — on her own stationery — spoke about civic events of interest to nuns but didn't mention Melvin.

Prosecutors contend the letter was created to make it appear the intern was simply mistaken about what she saw and was never mailed. Eventually, Sen. Orie's and Melvin's staffs told a grand jury about other illegal campaign work done in Orie's Senate offices and Melvin's chambers.

""Frankly, it's a smart group of people. How could they put themselves in this kind of situation?"" Burkoff said. ""This is the kind of thing we'll be puzzling about for years."""

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges that FBI agents and Defense Department employees disclosed Kelley's identity to outside parties, including the news media, and violated her privacy while investigating Petraeus' extramarital relationship with Paula Broadwell, the author of a Petraeus biography. Kelley, who frequently hosted Petraeus and his wife at parties, complained to the FBI that Broadwell had sent her threatening emails, and had viewed Kelley as a potential competitor for Petreaus' affections. The FBI later dropped the investigation without charges.

The lawsuit, filed by Kelley and her husband, surgeon Scott Kelley, seeks unspecified monetary damages, a formal apology, and an accounting of the information the FBI and Defense Department gathered about them. The complaint details how the Kelleys' lives were turned upside down once their names were publicly linked to the Petraeus scandal.

In addition to the nonstop media attention, the revelation that Jill Kelley had communicated on a regular basis with both Petraeus and Gen. John Allen led to suggestions she may have had romantic relationships with the commanders. Allen abruptly retired after the disclosure.

""There was no legally acceptable reason for the government to disclose confidential information about the Kelleys and thereby make them part of the public scandal,"" the lawsuit says. Details about the Kelleys' personal lives and their financial difficulties was widely reported.

""Mrs. Kelley’s reputation is indelibly tainted,"" the complaint says. ""She is consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals. As a result, she -- the victim and a participant in none of the bad acts in the sex scandal -- has shouldered the blame as the villain in the generals’ downfall.""

The suit describes damage to Jill Kelley's social reputation and connections to those in high places, which it claims were key to her earnings. The scandal caused the revocation of Jill Kelley's honorary consulship to South Korea, which ""deprived her of significant social and financial networking, investment, and business fee finder opportunities, as well as the loss of the tax-free annual stipend for years,"" the suit says. Today, Jill Kelley ""no longer receives prestigious invitations to the diplomatic and distinguished governmental functions."" The complaint adds that ""Dr. Kelley also suffered dramatic financial losses.""

The lawsuit is peppered with links to news articles about the Kelleys from late 2012. According to one, the Kelleys were considering legal action as far back as late November, when their attorney at the time, D.C. powerhouse litigator Abbe Lowell, released a slew of emails and phone records intended to prove that Jill Kelley did not exploit her friendship with Petraeus for financial gain.

But now, six months later, the issue of potential overreach in a federal investigation has taken on a very different tenor in Washington, a fact likely not lost on Kelley and her attorneys. Public anger has erupted over news that the Department of Justice gathered journalists' phone and email records in leak investigations. This, combined with a scandal at the Internal Revenue Service over the targeting of tea party groups for special tax scrutiny, has put the Obama administration on defense.

In the ensuing months, Jill Kelley has emerged as an advocate for greater Internet privacy and received an award from the Electronic Privacy Information Center on Monday.

Jill Kelley said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post that her experience ""made me an advocate for privacy rights for every American."" She said she would continue to work to ensure that citizens would ""not have their personal communications improperly and unreasonably searched by overreaching government or any other abuse of government powers.""

The Justice Department has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/13/civil-war-buffs-why-media-love-john-boehners-outbursts/,2013-12-13 00:00:00,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",Civil War Buffs: Why the media love John Boehner’s outbursts,"The Huffington Post, which loves to taunt conservatives, must have enjoyed posting this lead headline: “BOEHNER RIPS RIGHT.”

Here we go again, with lefty pundits salivating over the prospect of a bloody Republican civil war. Not since the days of the government shutdown have liberals so relished the eye-gouging on the other side.

“Boehner is going all Howard Beale this week. Fun to watch,” tweeted the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza.

But here’s the thing about the coverage of Boehner’s mad-as-hell moment: it’s undeniably fascinating. (And a heckuva lot more interesting than the details of a budget deal that leaves 90 percent of the sequester cuts intact.)

Boehner’s gamble paid off yesterday as the House approved the cobbled-together compromise on a big bipartisan vote, with 169 Republicans joining 163 Democrats in the yes column.

But the House speaker was at it again before the vote, pouncing on the conservative groups who have slammed the party’s budget deal with the Dems: “Frankly I think they're misleading their followers. I think they're pushing our members in places they don't want to be,"" he added. ""And frankly I just think they've lost all credibility.”

Frankly, this is too good to pass up, and not just because the Beltway loves a brawl. The Tea Party wing of his caucus has made Boehner look weak, and he has mostly suffered in silence until now. On Wednesday he called the opposition of such organizations as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth “ridiculous.”

Keep in mind that Boehner and Eric Cantor were opposed to the government-shutdown strategy pushed by the GOP’s Ted Cruz faction, and they were right that it a) didn’t work, and b) hurt the Republican Party.

You know it’s a serious split when Paul Ryan, the right’s darling in 2012, goes on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to respond to criticism from fellow conservatives that he sold out in cutting the deal with Patty Murray. Ryan says the Republicans have to deal with the reality of divided government. The more purist wing says it’s a betrayal to play small ball when the GOP wants so much more (except that such a deal could never pass the Senate or be signed by President Obama).

Not that Democrats are thrilled with an agreement that fails to extend long-term unemployment benefits. Nancy Pelosi told her members in a closed-door meeting to “embrace the suck” and support the bill, according to Politico—truly one of the strangest rallying cries ever.

So civil war buffs aside, Boehner’s stance is actually big news that could affect GOP strategy in 2014 and beyond.

At Slate, John Dickerson underscores the importance of the speaker’s language:

“Boehner was not simply voicing an alternative policy position about the merits of the plan's spending reductions. He was making a claim about the low motives and trickery of the organizations that claim to represent the interests of grassroots conservatives…

“What GOP leaders are fighting against is the outsize expectations of the faithful who want policy victories that are impossible in a system of divided government. At times like this, pragmatic party leaders often tell their stalwarts not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but Boehner is saying more than that. He is calling out the arbiters of purity in his party, saying that while they use the language of policy and principle, they are merely doing so to advance their own narrow aims. They can never be satisfied because satisfaction doesn't bring in donations.

“Boehner is essentially calling them grassroots con men.”

National Review turns on the party’s former VP candidate:

“House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan has now accomplished the astonishing task of pushing House Republicans substantially to the left of the Senate GOP. His budget deal, announced Tuesday night, was achieved by shutting conservative Senate Republicans out of negotiations, by resorting to the old trick of spending now while claiming savings later, by ignoring a symbolically important budgetary red line, and by treating as Democratic “concessions” things to which even Democratic budgeteers already had agreed.

“The chess equivalent of Ryan’s deal would be trading a castle for a mere pawn. No wonder conservatives are feeling rooked…

“For the duration of the Obama presidency, the deficit would actually rise, with none of the net ‘savings’ occurring until at least 2017. Once again, Congress would play Wimpy to the taxpayers’ Popeye, promising to pay Tuesday for a hamburger today.”

The New Republic says the Republicans have gambled that the collapse of ObamaCare will carry them to victory next November—and are wrong:

“The Murray-Ryan deal isn’t really about the sequester. It’s a two-year truce on fiscal self-sabotage—and, more to the point, a bet on who benefits from such a truce.

“That is, Republicans believe the Obama administration (and really the entire Democratic Party) will collapse under the weight of its irredeemable health care law if we just get through the next two years without a political catastrophe like the recent government shutdown. Democrats believe the economy will pick up momentum and solve a lot of their political problems, not to mention a good chunk of the deficit, if we can just put an end to gratuitous spending cuts while the recovery is still fragile.

“So the question becomes: who got the better side of this bet? And that answer to that, I think, is Democrats.”

Or the budget deal could turn out to be a non-factor in the midterms. A more important factor is whether Boehner’s anger at his right flank will lead him to shift gears toward greater cooperation with the Democrats.

Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.

Fort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.

""On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,"" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. ""Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.""

Despite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.

The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were ""punitive,"" although he later backed off that accusation.

Baroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.

""Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,"" Baroni said in November.

But he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.

According to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, ""that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.""

Wildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.

In a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.

Still, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John ""Jay"" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee.

""While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,"" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.

The inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.

Last week, Christie said the controversy was ""not that big a deal"" even though reporters were ""obsessed"" with it."

Schwartz']",Business Groups See Loss of Sway Over House G.O.P.,"“There clearly are people in the Republican Party at the moment for whom the business community and the interests of the business community — the jobs and members they represent — don’t seem to be their top priority,” said Dan Danner, the head of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which spearheaded opposition to President Obama’s health care law among small businesses. “They don’t really care what the N.F.I.B. thinks, and don’t care what the Chamber thinks, and probably don’t care what the Business Roundtable thinks.”

The lawmakers seem to agree. Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas and a Tea Party caucus member, said in an interview on Wednesday that if American corporations wanted to send their money elsewhere, that was their choice.

“We have got to quit worrying about the next election, and start worrying about the country,” said Mr. Neugebauer, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a recipient of significant donations from Wall Street.

Few of the most conservative House lawmakers draw substantial support from business political action committees, and business lobbyists acknowledged that the mere suggestion they were considering backing primary challenges next year could enhance grass-roots support for the very lawmakers they want to defeat. But the dysfunction in Washington has now turned so extreme, they said, that they had few other options.

“What we want is a conservative business person, but someone who in many respects will be more realistic, in our opinion,” said Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the single biggest lobbying organization in Washington.

In the two previous battles over the debt limit, many chief executives were reluctant to take sides, banding together in groups like Fix the Debt, which spent millions of dollars on a campaign urging Democrats and Republicans to work toward a “grand bargain” on the budget. But with shutdown a reality, and the clock ticking toward default, some of those same executives now place the blame squarely on conservative Republicans in the House."

Here's a talker: Former senator Pete Domenici acknowledged he fathered a son outside of his marriage mroe than 30 years ago — with the daughter of another senator, Paul Laxalt.

Domenici, a New Mexico Republican who was once the top budget expert in Congress, revealed his secret to the Albuquerque Journal. The Associated Press picked up the story Wednesday.

Domenici, 80, and Michelle Laxalt released statements to the Albuquerque paper saying Domenici is the father of her son, Las Vegas lawyer Adam Laxalt. ""One night's mistake led to a pregnancy 30 years ago,"" she said.

The former senator and Michelle Laxalt indicated they were disclosing Adam Laxalt's fatherhood ""because they thought somebody might soon attempt to make it public, with her statement saying she thought someone would shop it to the media to smear Domenici,"" according to the AP.

Michelle Laxalt said they agreed to keep the fatherhood a secret because Domenici and her father, a Nevada Republican, were serving in the U.S. Senate at the same time.

Domenici is a former Senate Budget Committee chairman, who is known for his advocacy on mental health and nuclear energy. He served from 1973 to 2009 and was New Mexico's longest-serving senator. He retired because of health reasons and has a brain disease.

""I deeply regret this and am very sorry for my behavior,"" Domenici said in his statement. ""I hope New Mexicans will view that my accomplishments for my beloved state outweigh my personal transgression.""

Domenici told the Albuquerque paper that he has apologized to his wife, Nancy, with whom he has eight children. The ex-senator appeared before the Senate this month, introducing Treasury secretary nominee Jack Lew at his confirmation hearing.

In New Mexico, political observers hope Domenici will be remembered for his legislative work.

""There is no question that Sen. Pete Domenici accomplished innumerable positive results for New Mexico and our great nation over his 36-year tenure as a New Mexico senator,"" said John Billingsley, chairman of the state Republican Party. ""It is my hope that the people of New Mexico remember him for those accomplishments.""

t's not the first time that a lawmaker has been quiet about a child. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., revealed that he has a 24-year-old daughter — which he did after inquiries were made about the woman he was texting during the State of the Union Address.

Stickyfingers (R-KY)

Sen. Stickyfingers (R-KY)

A top aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been dealing with a series of plagiarism allegations in recent days, acknowledged Tuesday that Paul's staff in some cases failed to properly attribute and quote content pulled from other sources. ""In the thousands of speeches and op-eds Sen. Paul has produced, he has always presented his own ideas, opinions and conclusions,"" senior adviser Doug Stafford said in a statement. ""Sen. Paul also relies on a large number of staff and advisers to provide supporting facts and anecdotes—some of which were not clearly sourced or vetted properly.""

""Adherence to a new approval process implemented by Sen. Paul will ensure proper citation and accountability in all collaborative works going forward,"" he said.

While Sen. Rand Paul is off challenging people to fisticuffs or worse , one of his senior advisers has finally admitted the obvious: Yes, there’s been a bucketload of copying going on in the Paul camp. That doesn’t even count as a faux apology, and I’m not sure how well the whole sorry if you could not see our invisible spoken footnotes routine works out for others caught lifting other people’s work. But Stafford promises—and this is real—that from now on footnotes to Paul’s speeches or op-eds will be available “on request.” And:So from here on in, America, if a Rand Paul op-ed contains entire passages lifted from an old Eddie Murphy movie, it’s because Rand Paul himself signed off on it. Good to know.

The belated acknowledgement of insufficient-footnote-gate comes after a particularly egregious pair of new examples. This weekend BuzzFeed identified three entire pages of Paul’s latest book that were lifted wholesale from a Heritage Foundation paper; that was soon followed by the discovery that portions of a September Rand Paul op-ed in the Washington Times were copied from an op-ed written by a The Week editor just one week earlier.

Now the word has come down; it’s the fault of unnamed staffers, and it’s more the fault of you, the reader, for not being able to magically discern when Rand Paul and his staff are speaking their own words and when they’re lifting entire pages of content from somewhere else because hey, that’s what faux-libertarian Republicanism is all about, baby. I somehow do not think this will satisfy Sen. Stickyfingers’s critics, and somehow I doubt we’re going to be hearing the name of the staffer responsible for those three full pages of lifted text in the book Paul “wrote.”

Rand Paul, for his part, weighs in with the requisite amount of Paul family lunacy:



Acknowledging that his office had “made mistakes,” he said he was putting a new system in place to ensure that all of his materials are properly footnoted and cited. “What we are going to do from here forward, if it will make people leave me the hell alone, is we’re going to do them like college papers,” he said.

Yes, yes. It's all about your hurt feelings. The stupid reporters with their stupid finding things out."

Raul Labrador (R-ID) suggested during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.

Holder said he was not involved in the secret collection of AP phone records because he had recused himself from the investigation which led to the seizure. The Department of Justice hoped to find the source of leaked confidential information, and Holder claims he recused himself because he had access to that information and therefore was a suspect.

“[I] have heard you several times talk about ‘best practices and proprieties.'” Labrador said during his questioning of Holder. “When you decided to recuse yourself, did you look at best practices? I think you admitted already it would have been a better practice for you to put it in writing.”

Labrador then cited federal law, specifically 28 USC § 591, and noted that it requires the Attorney General to put a recusal in writing in “certain circumstances.”

“Frankly, I’ve read it a couple times, I don’t know if it applies to your situation right now, but don’t you think it would have been the best practice for you to just put it in writing especially on an issue of such significance?” Labrador asked.

Holder answered that he would consider putting recusals in writing in the future.

Federal law requires that the U.S. Attorney General sign off on the type of subpoena used in situations such as the AP investigation, but Holder claimed that when he recused himself, that responsibility fell to Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Asked directly if he put his recusal in writing, Holder said no. He claimed he only informed Cole of the decision.

The law that Labrador cited notes that when the Attorney General decides his recusal is necessary, he must put such a determination in writing. The exact text of that section of law is as follows:

“Recusal of Attorney General.– (1) When recusal is required.– (A) If information received under this chapter involves the Attorney General, the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused shall perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. (B) If information received under this chapter involves a person with whom the Attorney General has a personal or financial relationship, the Attorney General shall recuse himself or herself by designating the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused to perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. (2) Requirements for recusal determination.– Before personally making any other determination under this chapter with respect to information received under this chapter, the Attorney General shall determine under paragraph (1)(B) whether recusal is necessary. The Attorney General shall set forth this determination in writing, identify the facts considered by the Attorney General, and set forth the reasons for the recusal. The Attorney General shall file this determination with any notification or application submitted to the division of the court under this chapter with respect to such information. “

A Department of Justice spokeswoman has not immediately responded to Breitbart News in response to Labrador’s line of questioning."

Both Ernie Angelo, Ronald Reagan’s Texas campaign manager in 1980, and Rick Shelby, the 1980 Reagan campaign’s regional political director responsible for Texas, told the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis on Friday that Karl Rove was not the “director of the Texas campaign for Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980” as he claimed Thursday on The O’Reilly Factor:

I finally caught up with Rick Shelby, who helped me get to the bottom of it. Today, Shelby’s with the American Gas Association, but in 1979, he was one of the original Regional Political Directors for the Reagan for President Committee. This involved coordinating nine states — including Texas. Since Texas was important, Shelby tells me he spent an “inordinate” amount of time in the Lone Star State in 1980. And though Rove never technically worked on the Reagan campaign, Shelby says he served as executive director for the state’s Victory Committee. In that capacity, Shelby recalls that Rove “played a vital role in helping raise the funds necessary” for an effective voter ID and turnout program in the state.

Here’s what 1980 Reagan Texas campaign manager Ernest Angelo said about Rove’s role in the 1980 Reagan campaign in an email Friday:

In 1980 I was Gov Reagan’s Texas chairman in the primary and Campaign Manager for the general election. Gov Clements endorsed Reagan after the Texas primary and was the campaign Chairman. I was a full time volunteer on site for most of the Fall campaign in Austin. I worked closely with Rick Shelby who was a Reagan Regional Political Director and was in Austin nearly full time. We had a large staff of volunteers and paid individuals. I’m not much for titles but I can assure you Karl Rove was materially involved since he was working for me and Gov Clements in the campaign.

Reagan biographer Craig Shirley said he was “delighted” to see Angelo and Shelby confirm his own research, he said in an exclusive email to Breitbart News Friday evening.

“This confirms earlier documentation by Tom Pauken and Gary Hoitsma, both deeply involved in the Texas Reagan campaign of 1980,” Shirley wrote. He stated that his own interviews for the book Rendezvous With Destiny, none of his sources linked Rove to Reagan’s campaign.

In the course of interviewing President Carter, Vice President Mondale, John Anderson, Jim Baker, Jody Powell, President George H.W. Bush, Tom Brokaw, Lou Cannon, Dave Keene, Vic Gold, Frank Donatelli, Roger Stone, Ed Rollins and over 150 people all told including Ernie Angelo and Rick Shelby, Mr. Rove’s name never came up except sparingly in relation to the Bush 1980 campaign. But never the Reagan campaign.

Shirley says that he never found Rove’s name in his personal search of the Reagan Library’s files on the 1980 campaign. He claims that of the 200 books used in the bibliography for Rendezvous, “Mr. Rove’s name never came up in connection to the Reagan campaign of 1980 in any of these publications.”

“Just to be sure,” he continued, “we ran a search today of Texas newspapers from March to November of 1980 and Mr. Rove’s name never appeared. Period.”

Earlier this month, Rove’s announcement that he had established a new SuperPAC, the Conservative Victory Project, drew the ire of Tea Party activists, who saw this new organization as yet another attempt to force moderate candidates through the Republican primary process."

A national group of atheists is amending the text of a large roadside billboard after admitting that it misquoted former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a new campaign to encourage Americans to ""Go Godless Instead.""

American Atheists rolled out the new signage over the weekend ahead of their 50th anniversary celebration, set to take place at the end of the month.

One of the billboards featured Palin, alongside the quotation, ""We should create law based on the God of the Bible.”

The quote is a reference to a May 2010 appearance by Palin on Fox News, in which she denounced the backlash against the National Day of Prayer. At the time she suggested that critics were ignoring the Founding Fathers in their opposition to the large-scale expression of faith.

""I think we should kind of keep this clean, keep it simple, go back to what our founders and our founding documents meant,"" she advised. ""They're quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the Ten Commandments.""

CNN reports that American Atheists public relations director Dave Muscato has admitted that the word ""should"" should not appear in quotes and has announced plans to make the correction.

But Muscato and American Atheists President David Silverman told CNN that the “intent and context” of the billboard remains accurate.

“Ms. Palin would stand by what we have quoted her as saying,"" Silverman claimed in a statement to CNN.

Palin isn't the only Republican politician being used to promote the group's event. Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) and former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich are both featured in other billboards, alongside accurate quotations.

That’s what matters.”

Of course, not everyone is applauding, particularly Democrats in Texas, where Republicans control both houses of the Legislature.

“I just kind of shake my head and say, ‘I don’t believe this guy is for real,’ ” said State Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat. “Many individuals in his own party say he has helped the Democrats. I’m more concerned about what he’s done to the country than the good he’s done to any Democratic effort.”

Moderate and establishment Republicans in Texas privately grumble about Mr. Cruz and his handling of the budget fight. They criticize the wisdom of forcing a government shutdown over a health care law that the Supreme Court validated, and wondered how much of Mr. Cruz’s battle was done to benefit his presidential aspirations.

“I grit my teeth and bear it,” said a prominent Texas Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he wanted to avoid an intraparty fight. “I really hope he implodes sooner rather than later.”

One of the few public displays of any Texas backlash came in an editorial on Wednesday in The Houston Chronicle. Headlined “Missing Kay,” the editorial criticized Mr. Cruz, whom the paper endorsed last year, for being “part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.” But even that criticism was muted. When news outlets reported that The Chronicle had “unendorsed” Mr. Cruz, the paper’s editors clarified that they did not pull their endorsement, but were evaluating the work of elected officials in an “active, ongoing process.”

The doubts from Texas Republicans invariably play out behind closed doors. They do not fear Mr. Cruz’s personal wrath, but that of his supporters and the possibility of a primary fight if they criticize him. Mr. Cruz won his Senate seat by defeating one of the most powerful Republicans in Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a victory that exposed the ideological split between moderate establishment Republicans and the younger, more aggressive and conservative movement of grass-roots activists and Tea Party supporters."

Bill Richardson said Sunday that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father was a Cuban immigrant, should not be ""defined as a Hispanic"" because of his stance on immigration legislation.

Richardson, a former Democratic presidential candidate who also is Hispanic, criticized the freshman Texas senator during the web portion of the ABC ""This Week"" program on Sunday.

Asked for his thoughts on Cruz, Richardson said, ""I'm not a fan.""

""I know he's sort of the Republican latest flavor. He's articulate. He seems to be charismatic, but I don't like his politics,"" Richardson said. He alleged that Cruz adds a ""measure of incivility in the political process,"" though he is a ""force"" in the GOP.

Richardson was then asked if Cruz represents most Hispanics with his political views. Richardson said, ""No, he's anti-immigration.""

""Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don't think he should be defined as a Hispanic,"" Richardson said. ""He's a politician from Texas, a conservative state. And I respect Texas' choice. But what I don't like is when you try to get things done -- it's okay to be strong and state your views, your ideology, but I've seen him demean the office, be rude to other senators, not be part of, I think, the civility that is really needed in Washington.""

Richardson later said that controversy surrounding his comments was a ""misunderstanding."" He told Fox News that he was ""misinterpreted"" and that he was trying to say Cruz should not be defined ""just"" as a Hispanic.

Cruz's father came to the United States from Cuba in the 1950s; his mother is of Irish-Italian ancestry.

Cruz's rising political star in the Republican Party has stoked talk of a possible 2016 presidential run.

In his four months in the Senate, the Texas senator has repeatedly made headlines -- with his tough questioning of Chuck Hagel during his confirmation hearing for Defense secretary, and with his participation in Sen. Rand Paul's 13-hour filibuster over drones.

He also has been critical of newly released immigration legislation, objecting to the bill's pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants already in the country."

(CNN) - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz is accusing critics of smear tactics after they attacked his father for saying President Obama should go ""back to Chicago, back to Kenya"" at an event last year.

Even as he dismissed his father’s comments as a “joke” and ill-advised, he said critics were motivated as much by politics as by genuine outrage.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Speaking to CNN affiliate WFAA on Friday, the first-term Republican senator from Texas said, ""sadly, those who are trying to play the politics of personal destruction are trying to smear him and use that to attack me. That's a shame.""

""I love my father,"" said Cruz. ""He is a pastor. He is a man of deep integrity. And he made a joke.""

Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, is an influential figure in his own right and is known for his outspoken conservative positions. He has attracted a following among tea party activists and social conservatives, and he has campaigned alongside his son on many occasions.

The controversial remarks were captured in a video first posted on the left-leaning news website Mother Jones on Thursday. The website posted that video, along with several other videos of Rafael Cruz addressing conservative groups, and the comments quickly circulated online, drawing criticism from liberals.

Sen. Cruz's statement to WFAA marks his strongest reaction so far to his father's critics.

A spokeswoman for the senator previously declined to offer comment about the elder Cruz's statements, instead referring CNN to a statement that Cruz Communications Director Sean Rushton gave to Mother Jones.

""These selective quotes, taken out of context, mischaracterize the substance of Pastor Cruz's message. Like many Americans, he feels America is on the wrong track,"" Rushton said in the statement, adding, ""Pastor Cruz does not speak for the Senator.""

Rafael Cruz's remarks are reminiscent of the so-called birther movement, led by influential figures such as Donald Trump, who have suggested that Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore ineligible to be president.

Obama responded to those critics in 2011 by releasing his long-form birth certificate, which shows that he was born in Hawaii."

Poor Republicans are stuck with him.

As part of the Growth and Opportunity Project’s effort, focus groups were conducted in Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, to listen to voters who used to consider themselves Republicans. These are voters who recently left the Party. Asked to describe Republicans, they said that the Party is “scary,” “narrow minded,” and “out of touch” and that we were a Party of “stuffy old men.” This is consistent with the findings of other post-election surveys.

The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.

From the Republican National Committee's post-mortem Sounds like a real problem! So what should the GOP do about it?Translation: ""Our conservative media bubble is killing us"". And it is. But there's nothing the RNC can do about it, because rather than shrinking, the conservative media machine is. The likes of Breitbart and the Tea Party News Network exist because the conservative base considers Fox News too liberal. Saxby Chambliss was too liberal for these crazies. CPAC won't allow any gays in, or Chris Christie, the one guy who might make 2016 interesting.

That ever-expanding search for ideological purity is shrinking the GOP tent and further radicalizing conservatives to the point that they can no longer function in polite society. Meanwhile, they further alienate every growth demographic while costing them easy Senate holds and pickups.

It's quite the quandary! But if the solution is forcing Rush Limbaugh off his soapbox, then there is no solution. They built this monster, now they live with it."

Last week, RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on The Wilkow Majority with guest host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and said Levin was one of the people who should be asking questions at the debates instead of mainstream media journalists.

After Breitbart News reported on the interview, the movement to allow conservatives like Levin to potentially moderate a debate picked up momentum and “took on life.”

Levin, in comments picked up by The Right Scoop, said he was of two minds after reading the Breitbart News report about Spicer’s comments. He said he believed the RNC was either “sucking up” to him so he does not criticize them or actually serious.

“I accept,” Levin said. “Yes, I’ll do it.”

He said he would like to ask Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, if he were to run, why he refused to sign a brief opposing Obamacare. Levin said he would also like to ask Christie why he was weak on border security, soft on the Ground Zero Mosque, favored gun control, and supported environmentalists.

Levin said he would like to ask former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, if he were to run, if he felt there should be a “two Bush limit on the presidency” and why he “supports anarchy on the border” by promoting comprehensive immigration reform so fervently.

The talk radio host said he still did not fully believe the RNC would actually extend an offer to him because the Republican establishment “buffoons” who are “destroying the Republican Party from within” loathe him.

“You know how much they despise me,” Levin said. “I think I am hated more [at the Republican National Convention] than at the Democrat convention.”

“So yeah, I’m available [to moderate the debates],” Levin said. “I don’t believe it for two seconds.”"

Don Young (R-Alaska) on Friday for his use of the slur ""wetbacks"" to refer to Latino farm workers, with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) issuing statements rebuking the congressman's use of the term.

""Congressman Young’s remarks were offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds,"" Boehner said. ""I don’t care why he said it -- there’s no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology.""

Cornyn issued a similar comment.

""Migrant workers come to America looking for opportunity and a way to provide a better life for their families,"" Cornyn said. ""They do not come to this country to hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials. The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity.""

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Young's words ""emphatically do not represent the beliefs of the Republican Party.""

Young made the remark on Thursday during a radio interview with KRBD-FM when speaking about the agricultural industry.

""My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,"" Young said. ""It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.""

He offered an apology of sorts later, saying the term was used commonly in his youth. ""I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect,"" he said.

DREAM Action Coalition, a group of undocumented youth advocacy group, urged Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), members of a bipartisan ""gang of eight"" drafting immigration reform legislation, to speak out against Young's comments.

""As senators that come from states with large latino and immigrant communities, Sen. Schumer and Sen. Rubio must condemn these insensible remarks to demonstrate their commitment to fixing our broken immigration system and demonstrate neither party will tolerate insulting remarks against Latinos, immigrants, or any community in our country,"" the group said in a statement.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas) had urged Boehner and his fellow Republicans earlier Friday to denounce Young's comments.

""As the Republican minority outreach efforts develop, I'd advise their strategists to list 'don't say racial slurs like ""wetback""' as a bedrock for their messaging,"" Hinojosa said in a statement. ""Our country needs reform that can only be achieved with a bipartisan effort. I am urging Republican leaders, including Speaker Boehner, to condemn this behavior and ask members in their party to act responsibly.""

UPDATE: 1:50 p.m. -- Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the gang of eight, tweeted a condemnation of Young's remarks later on Friday.

Don Young's comments were offensive and have no place in our Party or in our nation's discourse. He should apologize immediately — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) March 29, 2013

UPDATE: 2:15 p.m. -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) piled on later, also apparently not viewing Young's semi-apology as adequate.

""Congressman Young's comments were deeply hurtful, offensive and inappropriate for anyone to utter, let alone a Member of the United States Congress,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Congressman Young should fully apologize for deeply offensive comments that were not appropriate in his youth or now.""

UPDATE: 4:00 p.m. -- Young issued an apology on Friday afternoon.

""I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan, Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform."""

(CNN) – New York's attorney general accused Donald Trump in a lawsuit Saturday of defrauding students who studied at the billionaire mogul's investment institute, though Trump's representative said a large majority of the school's alumni were satisfied with their experience.

The $40 million civil suit alleges Trump made false claims about the school, including that he was personally involved in selecting instructors and creating the curriculum.



Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said Trump had crafted a ""bait and switch"" with his school, using his well-known name.

""Trading on his celebrity status, Mr. Trump personally appeared in advertisements making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got,"" he wrote in a statement. ""No one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hard working New Yorkers. Anyone who does should expect to be held accountable.""

The suit names both Trump, the chairman of the school, and Michael Sexton, its former president, as defendants. Schneiderman is seeking $40 million to repay customers who have enrolled in the school, as well as additional penalties and fines.

On Twitter, Trump called Schneiderman a ""lightweight"" and said the attorney general was ""trying to extort me with a civil law suit.""

He also linked to a website that claims 98% of Trump University's former students were satisfied with their experience.

Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and a lawyer for the billionaire, said the suit ""has no merit and is nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt to deflect from (Schneiderman's) weak job performance.""

""I am shocked he didn't leak it to the Kris Kardashian show,"" Cohen continued. ""Maybe his office should focus more of their attention and the use of our tax dollars on bringing to justice those responsible for the financial meltdown.""

Cohen also pointed to the website citing an approval rating of 98% for the Trump investing classes, saying the figure was derived from questionnaires submitted by students upon completing the course of study. He said the website was created in anticipation of the lawsuit.

Trump University became the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010 after the New York State Education Department said the company could not use the term ""university"" without its consent. In 2011, the attorney general began investigating it, along with several other for-profit educational institutions.

Former students in California have also sued Trump's school, saying its advertising misled them into spending thousands of dollars on workshops and ""mentorships."" In a class-action suit filed in 2010, the former students say Trump University is ""like an infomercial"" that lures customers with the Trump name but fails to deliver on its promises of success in real estate.

The Trump school offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship and wealth creation. The courses ranged in price from $1,495 for a three-day workshop to $34,995 for a ""full education.""

Unlike other for-profit schools, Trump's outfit relies heavily on the brand of its namesake.

Trump made his money by investing in New York real estate, casinos and golf courses around the world. But he is perhaps best known in popular culture for his long-running reality television show, ""The Apprentice.""

More recently, Trump made headlines for suggesting that President Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen, part of Trump's public mulling of a presidential bid. He eventually declined to run for the White House.

Video doesn't seem to be available yet, but a tweet from Todd gives a hint: Tune in on @nbcnightlynews for a look at the conservative engine inside the House GOP At the moment the comments seem to show a leaning towards blue sentiments, with a few red stater types weighing in, plus some who are too disgusted to even think about it.

The quick version as best I can recall, is, roughly 80 House Republicans were tagged as using the budget as a hammer to force concessions on Obabmacare, in a letter they signed back in August sent to the House leadership. A look at them shows they come from districts where they won by large majorities and President Obama lost by a big margin. In other words, they expect to feel no political heat back home for shutting down the government.

Two of them (whose names escape me) were interviewed briefly. My impression is that they were both quite pleased with having shut down the government, because they believe Obamacare is just too ""onerous"". They were elected in 2010, after the bill creating the ACA passed into law; they didn't get to vote on it so they're taking it upon themselves to stop it any way they can.

Charles P. Pierce has their number right here:

In the year of our Lord 2010, the voters of the United States elected the worst Congress in the history of the Republic. There have been Congresses more dilatory. There have been Congresses more irresponsible, though not many of them. There have been lazier Congresses, more vicious Congresses, and Congresses less capable of seeing forests for trees. But there has never been in a single Congress -- or, more precisely, in a single House of the Congress -- a more lethal combination of political ambition, political stupidity, and political vainglory than exists in this one, which has arranged to shut down the federal government because it disapproves of a law passed by a previous Congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court, a law that does nothing more than extend the possibility of health insurance to the millions of Americans who do not presently have it, a law based on a proposal from a conservative think-tank and taken out on the test track in Massachusetts by a Republican governor who also happens to have been the party's 2012 nominee for president of the United States. That is why the government of the United States is, in large measure, closed this morning.

While Todd's report doesn't get as colorful as that of Pierce, it does make very clear that the government of the United States has been shut down at the behest of a minority of the House Republican Party, representing a fraction of the United States and and even smaller fraction of the voting public.

This may be as close as we get to seeing a major news outlet lay this on a bunch of GOP ideologues. It will be interesting to see if anyone else picks up on this, or it sinks back into the ""one hand - other hand"" school of reporting.

If NBC puts the video clip up, I'll try to link to it.

Meanwhile, the next report up was about how the first day of the Healthcare Exchanges opening up was marked by huge numbers of people crashing websites as they tried to find out more and sign up for insurance...

UPDATE: HERE'S THE VIDEO (thanks to Phil S 33 for finding it) It's a remarkable report from a mainstream news organizations that for once doesn't waffle about what's really behind the government shutdown. This is one to Facebook and share as widely as possible.

UPDATE 2: Tip to Jacoby Jonze, who links to this Ryan Lizza New Yorker article that is the apparent source for Todd's report. Names, map, and a lot more detail. Lizza calls the GOP extremists ""The Suicide Caucus""; let's hope this doesn't turn into one of those murder-suicide stories. These people, it should be said, are determined to deny millions of their fellow Americans access to health care, and they don't care what the body count will be.

UPDATE 3: While there are some complaints that Todd didn't push his two interview subjects hard enough on their stand or otherwise explain what's happening in as great detail as might be desired, the issue is now out there and the rest of the media just might start to run with it.

The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, most assuredly crushing this already shaken child.

According to ProgressivePopulist.org:



Josie's father is currently in deportation proceedings and she is undergoing therapy to deal with the anxiety.

The whooping and cheering of this Tea Party crowd must have been devastating to Josie. I want to cry for her. I want to hold her. I want to tell her how frightened I would be if I were in her shoes. I want to square off with everyone who cheered her family's demise, and ask them, ""Have you no compassion???"". And I want her Congressman to care. But clearly he doesn't, so I want to do everything I can to help a Democrat win that seat in Congress.

As it turns out, Congressman DesJarlais is quite embattled with scandal. According to Raw Story:



Desjarlais is a former physician and anti-choice crusader who was fined $500 by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners after it came to light that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs with female patients. When one woman became pregnant, the staunch anti-abortion conservative pressured her into terminating the pregnancy. Another patient charged that Desjarlais prescribed narcotic painkillers to her for recreational use and frequently smoked marijuana with her.

But court transcripts released the week after last November's election revealed that he admitted under oath to eight affairs, encouraged a lover to get an abortion and used a gun to intimidate his first wife during an argument.

Enter State Senator Eric Stewart.

According to The Murfreesboro Post:



Less than a week after winning the Democratic Party primary, state Sen. Eric Stewart is pushing for his Republican opponent to participate in three debates... ...As of Tuesday afternoon, DesJarlais had not yet commented on whether he has decided to participate in the debates...

""When nursing mothers are torn from their babies, when children come home from school to find their parents missing ... when all this is happening, the system just isn't working and we need to change it,"" Obama declared during his first run for president in 2008. A year ago, he told a Texas audience that deportation should target ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes; not families, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.""

My first question for Senator Eric Stewart: How would he respond to young Josie Melina? Let's hope it would be a compassionate response. Something like what Obama might say Which brings us back to the plight of Josie Melina and her family.

I began to search for answers for this young girl and her family. I came away from my research even more despondent for Josie than when I began. I ran across an AP article written almost exactly a year ago titled, ""Parents Deported, What Happens to US-Born Kids?"" In heart-wrenching detail it describes what can happen to these families.



Nearly 45,000 such parents were removed in the first six months of this year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Behind the statistics are the stories: a crying baby taken from her mother's arms and handed to social workers as the mother is handcuffed and taken away, her parental rights terminated by a U.S. judge; teenage children watching as parents are dragged from the family home; immigrant parents disappearing into a maze-like detention system where they are routinely locked up hundreds of miles from their homes, separated from their families for months and denied contact with the welfare agencies deciding their children's' fate. At least 5,100 U.S. citizen children in 22 states live in foster care, according to an estimate by the Applied Research Center, a New York-based advocacy organization, which first reported on such cases last year. And an unknown number of those children are being put up for adoption against the wishes of their parents, who, once deported, are often helpless to fight when a U.S. judge decides that their children are better off here.

This is the easy part of the story, as this part is filled with statistics and data. The rest contains anecdotal stories that will tear your heart out. I encourage everyone to read this article, as hard as it is.

I leave you with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network's video of the entire exchange between a very brave Josie Melina, her despicable Congressman, and the horrendous Tea Party response. I'm sure this video will work wonders for the Republicans as they reach out for the Hispanic vote:"

No warning was given — nothing posted days before or announced on the radio. Traffic backed up to the outskirts of Omaha (an approximation), reasonable people went mad, children were appropriately traumatized and the residents of Fort Lee, the New Jersey town at the western end of the bridge, got the gift of air pollution of the type that will, studies have shown, strike them down in later years as they venture out for the Early Bird Special. Their last words, you can be almost certain, will be, “Damn you, Chris Christie.”

The New Jersey governor has asserted that he had nothing to do with the totally capricious lane closings. As for his aides who instigated the mayhem, they insisted they were not — as alleged — getting even with the mayor of Fort Lee, the Democrat Mark Sokolich, who had failed to endorse the Republican Christie’s reelection, as some 60 other Democratic officials had prudently done. They said the lane closings — which lasted four days — were imposed to conduct a traffic study that, oddly enough, no one knows anything about and, furthermore, cannot find. It might prove that if you close lanes, traffic will back up.

The bridge is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The governors of both states make the necessary appointments. (It’s not entirely inconceivable that New York’s Andrew Cuomo will wind up facing Christie somewhere down the road.) Inside the authority, Christie’s guys were widely viewed as his political operatives. One of them was David Wildstein, the governor’s friend since high school and former mayor of their home town of Livingston, N.J . The governor parked Wildstein at the authority at $150,000 per year and apparently gave him a year’s supply of traffic cones.

Another Christie friend and political ally, Bill Baroni, was also placed at the authority. He is a former state senator and was given a salary of $290,000. In the wake of the lane closings, both he and Wildstein have resigned, apparently hoping to end the matter. But New Jersey Democrats, a creative bunch, have come to call the affair “Bridgegate” and, armed with subpoena power in the legislature, are determined — for strictly good-government reasons — to get to the bottom of this.

The suffix “-gate” has been much abused since 1972 when, in the dead of night, Republican operatives, in gloved hands, merely sought to find the truth at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters. For instance, “-gate” was misapplied to the recent IRS scandal, which, a good deal of GOP hyperventilating notwithstanding, has gone nowhere. That’s because “-gate” implies that the scandal will lead to the top, as it eventually did with Richard Nixon. Few outside the House Republican caucus thought that Barack Obama had anything to do with inappropriate IRS investigations. In contrast, no one would put Bridgegate past Christie’s guys.

The governor has learned from history. Rather than wait for the legislature to lay a path of subpoenas to his door in Trenton and let the story build and build like Ravel’s “Bolero,” his aides swiftly resigned, even though it’s a hard market out there for gridlock-makers. Still, the damage has been done. Christie’s all-but-declared presidential campaign has taken a hit. His Joisey bona fides — a certain swagger and cocksureness — have been highlighted. (No one would cast Jimmy Stewart for this role.) Christie is a man of rare political ability, but he has a short temper and the affect of a bully. Worse, he unaccountably lacks affection for the media and sometimes shows it. Lots of politicians play hardball. Christie plays beanball.

Still, he would not be so reckless as to clog up a bridge but his aides — as in the mother of all gates — might be a different story. The facts remain that the lanes were indeed closed, no credible reason has been given and two Christie appointees left high-paying patronage posts for which their chief qualification apparently was friendship with the governor. This does not look good. It is, to say the least, not presidential.

The toll for the George Washington Bridge during peak hours is $11 for cars with an E-ZPass, but certain types of large trucks can pay as much as $84. That’s high, but it’s nothing compared to the toll Christie may pay for the lane closings. The traffic jam could keep him in New Jersey.

On one side is the Tea Party. On the other side stand Karl Rove and his establishment team, posing as tacticians while quietly undermining conservatism.

Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the “biggest donors in the Republican Party” have joined forces with Karl Rove and Steven J. Law, president of American Crossroads, to create the Conservative Victory Project. The Times reports that this new group will dedicate itself to “recruit seasoned candidates and protect Senate incumbents from challenges by far-right conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts who Republican leaders worry could complicate the party’s effort to win control of the Senate.” The group points to candidates like Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Richard Mourdock in Indiana as examples of Tea Party primary picks going sideways in major Senatorial battles.

But it is American Crossroads and its ilk that have run the GOP into the ground. Spending millions of dollars on useless 30,000-ft. advertising campaigns during the last election cycle, training candidates to soften conservatism in order to appeal to “moderates,” blowing up the federal budget under George W. Bush as a bipartisan tactic – all of those strategies led the party to a disastrous defeat in 2012. The Tea Party, which may nominate losers from time to time, also brought the Republicans their historic 2010 Congressional victory. If Tea Party candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good candidates; if GOP establishment candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good conservatives. The choice for actual conservatives should be easy.

But it isn’t. The Bush insider team that helped lead to the rise of Barack Obama insists that they, and only they, know the path to victory. As the Times reports, Conservative Victory Project won’t merely protect incumbents – it will challenge sitting Congresspeople of the Tea Party variety, including six-term Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who may run for Senate. “We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Law told the Times – with whom he seems far too friendly. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.”

Law claims he’s acting under the rubric of William F. Buckley, supporting the most conservative candidate who can win. But Law is no judge of that. Neither is Rove. Their advice led to the epic Romney defeat, in which conservatives were told to vote for Romney in the primary since he was the only candidate who could win.

Grover Norquist correctly points out that the Rove mission is nonsense. “People are imagining a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Norquist. “We’ve had people challenge the establishment guy and do swimmingly.” In truth, conservatism wins elections so long as the messenger doesn’t implode. Rove’s view, however, is that conservatism takes a back seat to the best quasi-conservative messenger.

But victory for conservatives isn’t Rove’s goal. He’s a political insider par excellence, and he’s playing for his political life in the aftermath of 2012. If that means declaring war on the Tea Party, so be it.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/12/christie-defends-wife-against-sandy-relief-criticism/,2013-03-12 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Christie defends wife against Sandy relief criticism,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is defending his wife against criticism that the charity she helms is not distributing money fast enough to help victims still suffering after superstorm Sandy.

The governor's comments are raising eyebrows for what some see as an unfortunate irony: earlier this year Christie blasted Congress for not acting fast enough to provide relief funds for New Jersey's affected communities and businesses.



On Monday, the Republican governor addressed a weekend report in the Asbury Park Press that said out of millions of dollars raised by the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, not a penny has yet helped victims over four months after the storm tore through the Garden State. The governor's wife – Mary Pat Christie – chairs the nonprofit organization.

A spokesperson for the fund told CNN it has raised $32 million. When it does disburse its funds, the money will only go to non-profit relief groups and not to individuals. The spokesperson insisted $1 million has been disbursed already, but could not vouch for whether or not the money has actually helped victims.

The governor was asked about the report during a Monday press conference in North Brunswick. His office provided CNN a transcript of the governor's remarks.

""What I can tell you is I know in broad strokes they raised somewhere between $32 and $33 million, was the number I had, was given. I know that they've approved grants for over a million dollars,"" Christie said.

""Whether those grants have gone out the door yet, I don't know. It seemed the story over the weekend seemed to indicate they haven't gone out the door. But I know they've been approved because Mary Pat told me they were approved."" Christie added that he is ""really proud"" of his wife's helming the fund.

""I think she's been very clear and was very clear over the weekend that her concept of this fund from the beginning, which all the donors were told, was that this would be a long-haul organization, not one that would jump in and throw a lot of money at the problem early, but one that would be there for the next two years or so.""

Mary Pat Christie is not part of the fund's panel that awards grants. But as chair of the overall group, she defended its pace of financial disbursements in an interview with the Asbury Park Press.

The wife cited groups like the American Red Cross and Robin Hood that have provided immediate relief to those hit hard in New Jersey.

""They've been out there already executing their relief strategy,"" the wife said. ""And I think that, especially Robin Hood has been really wonderful at helping us bridge this gap.""

Mary Pat Christie cited another reason for the slow pace of disbursement from her group.

""Admittedly we're learning how to do this. But I also was willing to take our time and be careful because I knew the Red Cross was there,"" she said.

""Non profit money is out there,"" she added. ""I actually think that we're going to, you know, be distributing this money at a really opportune time because some of those organizations will have moved on.""

""We're going to be here until, you know, the state's recovered,"" the wife added.

She also cited challenges of starting a charity from the ground up and designing processes to ensure no money is wasted.

Yet some feel the hurricane relief fund needs to move faster.

Comments on the group's Facebook page vary in intensity.

""Release the money…we are desperate down here for food and shelter for many!!!"" wrote a poster named Cyndi Laughlin.

Frank Riehl, another frustrated poster, wrote: ""Really more than half of the town of Ocean Gate was destroyed during the storm. You raised millions of dollar in relief aid for victims of the storm. But some one in one of the most heavily damaged town is not eligible for aid. Okay so what you are saying is that you have Millions of Dollars and you are NOT handing it out? Since you are NOT handing it out. What are you doing with it?""

The fund's pace of distribution is also receiving scrutiny in light of the governor previous blasting of Congress for not providing aid to affected residents fast enough.

In January, just over two months after Sandy, a frustrated Christie criticized House Speaker John Boehner and Congress for not allowing a vote on Sandy Relief. The governor also alleged a double standard: saying that much faster relief had been given to victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Andrew.

Shortly after, Congress passed a $50 billion aid package for Northeastern states hit hard by the storm.

With $1 million disbursed so far, the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund moves next to doling out $5 million in grants to non-profit relief groups. The fund hopes to get out that money by the end of March, the group's spokesperson said."

Gilmore said Parrish can provide the ethics panel documentary evidence that Sorenson was paid $7,500 a month to work on Bachmann's campaign, money that was funneled to him indirectly through C&M Strategies, a Colorado-based company controlled by Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short.

Parrish's willingness to go public against his former employer and political mentor is likely to send shock waves through Minnesota GOP circles, where both he and his attorney are well-known figures. Parrish served as deputy campaign manager of last year's unsuccessful effort to pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Gilmore is a well-known conservative blogger.

Parrish is the former CoS. Gilmore is his lawyer. The money came from Bachmann's independent PAC, which makes it almost impossible for her to claim innocence - not that reality and logic have much to do with her speech.The Minnesota GOP has some problems, oh yes they do. And that's what happens when one of the leading figures in the state party is a lunatic grifter ... come to think of it, that really doesn't narrow it down to Minnesota.

Michele has other problems than making illegal payments to Mr. Sorenson. Sorenson allegedly stole a proprietary mailing list from a volunteer's computer, and the police are investigating that. Congressional investigators are looking into her conflating her book tour and her Presidential campaign - good thing Newt Gingrich is no longer in Congress.

It will be a sad day for Kossacks when Michele Bachmann retires from Congress. Who will take her place as the March to Madness champion of the GOP? Only time will tell! There are certainly no shortage of candidates in the party for which facts are optional.

And somehow, this reminds me of Ms. Bachmann's modus operandi.

Donald Trump was reportedly booed off the stage at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, according to various reports and attendees. The 66-year-old businessman attended the April 6 event as an inductee into the organization's 2013 Hall of Fame.

He was introduced by WWE CEO Vince McMahon, a longtime friend of the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" creator. According to Bleacher Report, McMahon said Trump has helped the WWE and would have made a great U.S. president, but even this endorsement wasn't enough to quell the audience.

“Donald will soon find out this is a very partisan crowd,"" McMahon said in response to the booing. Later adding, “You’re not even going to let him come out here before you boo him?”

When Trump appeared, the heckling only continued.

""Trump was booed for most of his speech and eventually cut it short after the abuse,"" according to a Wrestling Online recap. His son was also apparently booed, but his daughter, Ivanka, was not. ""Trump noted that at least there is a member of the Trump family that the MSG crowd liked!""

Others noted the negative response.

But Trump himself seemed unfazed by the incident. On Sunday he posted a cheery tweet that made no mention of his icy reception from WWE fans.

My induction last night at Madison Square Garden into the WWE Hall of Fame was amazing-I met some great people, including Bruno. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2013

Prior to Saturday, Trump had expressed excitement about the event being held in Manhattan.

“I’ve always enjoyed and respected WWE’s brand of entertainment and look forward to the ceremony in my hometown at Madison Square Garden,” the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization said in a statement released by the WWE ahead of the ceremony.

Jim Varsallone of the Miami Herald was disappointed by the audience's behavior and penned an op-ed defending the would-be conservative pundit. ""How about Donald Trump,"" he wrote Monday. ""Long before others did, The Don lauded Mr. McMahon’s vision ... and instead of thanking him or just watching quietly, you heckle him.""

And this isn't the first time Trump has faced a disgruntled crowd. He was booed by members of the press at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, which he attended as a guest of the Washington Post."

During a tense hearing on Capitol Hill held shortly before lawmakers headed out for summer recess, acting IRS chief Danny Werfel weathered tough questioning from Republicans including Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Issa claimed the IRS has been slow to produce documents, and that the documents it does produce are so thoroughly blacked out, they are useless to investigators.

""When you eliminate search terms unilaterally you are obstructing us by limiting the scope of discovery. Do you understand that, Mr. Werfel?"" Issa said, complaining that the IRS had narrowed the date range for the requested documents.

Though Werfel repeatedly denied that his agency was being uncooperative, Issa subsequently issued a statement saying he had issued a subpoena to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

More On This...

A Treasury spokesman said the department has received the subpoena and is ""committed"" to cooperating with the committee's review.

The committee is trying to force the department to hand over a series of documents pertaining to the program in which IRS agents subjected Tea Party and other conservative groups to additional scrutiny as they applied for tax-exempt status. Issa is asking for ""all communications"" to and from embattled IRS agent Lois Lerner, the first IRS official to publicly acknowledge the program, as well as other high-level personnel including White House appointee William Wilkins.

""While the Committee is willing to work with the IRS to guide the agency in responding to oversight requests, it is patently unacceptable for the IRS to unilaterally revise the scope or search terms used to identify responsive material,"" Issa wrote.

Issa and other Republicans have been evidently agitated by White House attempts to label the IRS controversy as a ""phony scandal."" Issa referenced this rhetoric in his letter to Lew, accusing the administration of trying to ""thwart"" congressional oversight.

Tensions boiled over in the hearing room.

""You are slow-rolling us,"" Issa told Werfel in a heated exchange. ""There are important facts to get out, and you are obstructing.""

""That is not true,"" Werfel fired back.

Werfel said that by the end of the day Friday, the IRS will have given more than 16,000 pages of documents to Issa's committee and more than 70,000 pages to Congress as a whole. Werfel said documents are blacked out to protect confidential taxpayer information.

Issa's committee does not have legal authority to receive confidential taxpayer information. In Congress, that authority is reserved for the chairmen of the two tax-writing committees, House Ways and Means and Senate Finance, and their designated staff.

Werfel said the two tax-writing committees are receiving full documents. However, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, has also complained that the IRS is producing documents too slowly.

Werfel rejected the accusation that he's limited the scope of the document search.

""We are prioritizing searches in order to get you more documents more quickly and that's having an impact,"" he said.

He said: ""The notion that we're impeding or obstructing is completely false. In fact the opposite is true. We are involved in a thorough comprehensive effort to fully cooperate with all the congressional committees that are asking questions, asking for witnesses, asking for documents, and there's substantial facts and evidence that demonstrate our full cooperation.""

More than 100 IRS employees are working to produce documents for Congress, including 70 lawyers who are reviewing documents full time, Werfel said.

In addition, 19 employees have been made available for interviews by congressional investigators, and IRS officials have appeared at 15 congressional hearings since the scandal broke, Werfel said. He also said the agency has offered to make Wilkins available for meetings with committee members.

For here is his response today to the newly-struck ""fiscal cliff"" deal:



I increased donations to charity in 2012. This deal limits my deductions so I, & many others, will likely donate less in 2013. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 1, 2013

Now, I don't know if he's correct about the deductions limits, and frankly, I don't care. Because at issue here is that Fleischer, in a moment of oblivious candor, admitted that he and ""many others"" like him will donate less to charity in the coming years. Why? Because it will no longer be in their financial interest to do so.

So much for empathy. So much for genuine compassion. So much for this: What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?

Not that any of this is surprising, for today we got plenty of reminders that empathy is not a Republican value. After all, just today Peter King (rabid Islamophobe) went apoplectic over Boehner's refusal to bring a Hurricane Sandy relief package up for a vote. Oh, and the House GOP allowed the 18-year-old Violence Against Women act to expire because ""the bill is too supportive of immigrants, the LGBT community, and Native Americans.""

Yes, we know callousness to be a contemporary Republican value. And Fleischer's Tweet merely admitted this fact.

However, he was appalled to have done so, for after pulling back the curtain today, Fleischer tried to yank it shut, tried to walk back what he had already revealed:

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/the-final-insult-in-the-bush-cheney-marriage.html,2013-10-13 00:00:00,['Peter Baker'],The Final Insult in the Bush-Cheney Marriage,"By the second term, though, as that vision came under fire with the deterioration of Iraq and the failure to find the weapons that led to the invasion, Bush moved away from Cheney and turned increasingly toward Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who supplanted Cheney as the president’s most influential lieutenant. No one in the White House had the relationship with Bush that Rice had. She worked out with him, talked sports with him, dined with him and Laura in the residence and spent weekends with them at Camp David. Over lunch one day in the first term, Rice told Christine Todd Whitman, then the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, “I can count on one hand the days when I have not spoken to the president over the last three years.” As Whitman later reflected: “She didn’t have a life. Her life was all about that.”

Bush turned to Rice to help repair the damage done by the administration’s aggressive response to the Sept. 11 attacks. “We had broken a lot of china,” Rice told me. “But at that point, you have to leave something in place. That is true with allies. It is true with the Middle East. It is true in putting together an international consensus on North Korea and international consensus on Iran. And I don’t think that is how the vice president saw it. I think he would have liked to have kept breaking china.”

Only by the end of his sixth year did Bush finally conclude that Rumsfeld had to go, a decision that represented the most fundamental break with Cheney, who was informed, not consulted. “It wasn’t open for discussion by the time he came to me,” Cheney told me. Cheney managed to preserve much of the national-security architecture he helped create, but he was now on defense more than offense, fending off changes that he thought would weaken the country or unravel the policies he had urged. “Perhaps my clout was diminished,” Cheney said in a 2011 television interview. “That’s possible. I wouldn’t quarrel about that.” Indeed, by the time they left office, Bush and Cheney disagreed on a long list of significant issues and policies. Where Bush was willing to pursue international diplomacy, empty secret C.I.A. prisons, sign an agreement to withdraw from Iraq and cut deals with Congress on military tribunals and warrantless eavesdropping, Cheney resisted any compromise as a sellout of the principles they once shared.

And then there was the Scooter Libby pardon.

A few weeks before Barack Obama’s inauguration, Joshua Bolten invited all of his predecessors to his office in the West Wing to meet with his successor, Rahm Emanuel. Thirteen of the living 16 men to have served as chief of staff attended, including Cheney, who was Gerald Ford’s top assistant. They went around the table one by one, offering advice. When Cheney’s turn came up, a devilish look crossed his face. “Whatever you do,” he said, “make sure you’ve got the vice president under control.”

As Bush’s final days in the White House approached, he did not exactly have his vice president under control. Cheney’s lobbying campaign on behalf of Scooter Libby had become deeply disconcerting to the president. To Cheney, it was a simple matter of justice. As he saw it, Libby had been pursued by an unprincipled prosecutor bent on damaging the White House. Neither Libby nor anyone else had been charged with the actual leak that precipitated the investigation, only with not testifying truthfully about how he learned about Wilson’s identity. Years later, it would be revealed that the special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, knew from nearly the start that Richard Armitage, Colin Powell’s deputy, was the original source of the leak, not Libby. Cheney believed that Fitzgerald’s relentless investigation in spite of this fact was proof that Cheney was the real target, and that Libby was caught in the cross-fire. Libby had loyally served his country, Cheney argued, only to be made into a criminal. And Powell and Armitage stayed quiet as it happened. “The Powell-Armitage thing was such a sense of betrayal,” Cheney’s daughter Liz told me. “They sat there and watched their colleagues in the White House — Scooter and everyone else — go through the ordeal of the investigation, and all that time they both knew Armitage was the leaker.” Armitage and Powell said they were simply following investigators’ instructions to keep silent.

As Cheney pressed Bush for the pardon, the president put him off by saying he would wait to issue controversial pardons until near the end of his term, which the vice president took as an indication that Libby would be among them. Bush had already commuted Libby’s prison sentence of two and a half years after it was handed down in 2007. As a result, Libby never had to spend a minute behind bars, a decision that inflamed critics on the left, who argued that Bush was interfering with justice, and on the right, who felt he had not gone far enough in quashing a bogus prosecution.

At the time, Bush said publicly that he was not substituting his judgment for that of the jury. So how would he explain a change of mind just 18 months later? That was the argument Ed Gillespie, the president’s counselor, made to Cheney when he came to explain why he was advising Bush against a pardon. “On top of that, the lawyers are not making the case for it,” Gillespie told Cheney, referring to the White House attorneys reviewing the case for Bush. “We’ll be asked, ‘Did the lawyers recommend it?’ And if the lawyers didn’t, it’s going to be hard to justify for the president.”"

THE Supreme Court’s momentous decisions last week on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage overshadowed a disturbing trend: in the final two weeks of its term, the court ruled in favor of big business and closed the courthouse doors to employees, consumers and small businesses seeking remedy for serious injuries. A majority of the justices seem to believe that it is too easy to sue corporations, so they narrowly construed federal laws to limit such suits. These decisions lack the emotional resonance of the cases involving race and sexuality, but they could have a devastating effect on people who have been wronged by companies.

Long-term unemployment and long-term unemployment benefits both hit record lengths during this Lesser Depression. The average length of unemployment hit a postwar high of 40 weeks, and unemployment insurance did too, getting extended to 99 weeks (though it's fallen significantly the past two years). But there's no evidence that long-term unemployment benefits have discouraged the long-term unemployed from taking jobs -- because they can't get jobs to begin with. They can't even get interviews. As Ghayad showed before in a field experiment, employers largely ignore the resumes of people who have been out of work for six months or longer. Firms assume there must be something wrong with people who have unemployed that long, and don't want to spend time finding out what it is, not when they have a stack full of resumes to get through. But the long-term unemployed have kept looking, at least in part because of benefits.

The Senate is currently considering five nominees for the National Labor Relations Board. All five are experienced, highly qualified candidates, and last month the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved their nominations. But Senate Republicans are refusing to allow a floor vote on the nominees. By blocking the confirmation of new board members, Republicans have rendered the NLRB dysfunctional. It now lacks the quorum necessary to issue decisions.

This is an unprecedented attack on the NLRB, which has long been an area of bipartisan agreement. As Senate Republicans block these nominees, it is worth considering the history of the NLRB and the crucial role in our country it has played over the past three-quarters of a century.

Climate change is surely the looming disaster of our time. Scientists say it’s inevitable that sea levels will rise 2 1/2-6 1/2 feet — sufficient to endanger or wipe out many cities. One scientist believes that in the long-term, 69 feet of sea level rise is inescapable. And the source of the swelling oceans — rising temperatures — will stress the nation’s food system, while the increasing number of devastating storms will place an economic burden on a nation reeling from disaster to disaster, patching its wounds without effecting meaningful change. It’s tempting to dismiss these projections as hysterical. That life as we know it could change so dramatically, so quickly, seems impossible. But on this topic, the scientific community (if not the political one) speaks with one voice.

What does it look like when seven men ignore seventeen thousand of their constituents?

It looks like this: Ohio’s Republican Governor John Kasich, flanked by six other men, signing the state’s new budget into law and, by doing so, catapulting the Buckeye State to the number one spot on the Nation’s Most Restrictive Abortion Laws list.

The budget strips funding from Planned Parenthood, the nation’s leading provider of reproductive healthcare, and gives that money to Crisis Pregnancy Centers, the pseudo-clinics that lure pregnant women with the promise of free ultrasounds and can then misinform them about abortions. That’s just the beginning.

A Kaiser poll found that just one in five Americans are aware of the health insurance exchanges. And, in a larger sense, the new system falls apart if too few healthy Americans (like, young, football-watching men, for instance) are brought in to offset the increased cost of covering all of those who have pre-existing conditions. And that, in fact, seems to be the point of what the GOP is doing. The more dysfunctional the health care law is, the more Republicans can claim to have been right about it all along. It's the same strategy that is at work in GOP efforts to underfund the financial reform law or a host of federal agencies: render government ineffective by not giving it adequate resources to do its job, then argue for more cuts on the grounds that government is ineffective.

Last month, I pleaded for an end to the breathless comparisons between Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg. News that the present-day intelligence leaker has asked the Russians for asylum should put it to rest. Sure, Snowden made the same request of other nations. But flirting with Moscow is a credibility killer. I’m all for whistleblowers revealing what government is doing, especially if it stretches the bounds of legality or if it’s flat-out illegal. What we know of what Snowden has released of interest to the American public has been known for a while. But what has stuck in my craw from the outset was Snowden fleeing the country.

Poor Republicans are stuck with him.

As part of the Growth and Opportunity Project’s effort, focus groups were conducted in Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, to listen to voters who used to consider themselves Republicans. These are voters who recently left the Party. Asked to describe Republicans, they said that the Party is “scary,” “narrow minded,” and “out of touch” and that we were a Party of “stuffy old men.” This is consistent with the findings of other post-election surveys.

The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.

From the Republican National Committee's post-mortem Sounds like a real problem! So what should the GOP do about it?Translation: ""Our conservative media bubble is killing us"". And it is. But there's nothing the RNC can do about it, because rather than shrinking, the conservative media machine is. The likes of Breitbart and the Tea Party News Network exist because the conservative base considers Fox News too liberal. Saxby Chambliss was too liberal for these crazies. CPAC won't allow any gays in, or Chris Christie, the one guy who might make 2016 interesting.

That ever-expanding search for ideological purity is shrinking the GOP tent and further radicalizing conservatives to the point that they can no longer function in polite society. Meanwhile, they further alienate every growth demographic while costing them easy Senate holds and pickups.

It's quite the quandary! But if the solution is forcing Rush Limbaugh off his soapbox, then there is no solution. They built this monster, now they live with it."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

By refusing to negotiate with the union regarding pay and working conditions, and hiring replacements (i.e., scabs) to take their jobs, he set the stage for the ongoing eradication of unions and the working middle class. As The New York Times noted in 2011:

More than any other labor dispute of the past three decades, Reagan’s confrontation with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco, undermined the bargaining power of American workers and their labor unions. It also polarized our politics in ways that prevent us from addressing the root of our economic troubles: the continuing stagnation of incomes despite rising corporate profits and worker productivity. By firing those who refused to heed his warning, and breaking their union, Reagan took a considerable risk. Even his closest advisers worried that a major air disaster might result from the wholesale replacement of striking controllers. Air travel was significantly curtailed, and it took several years and billions of dollars (much more than Patco had demanded) to return the system to its pre-strike levels. [...] By 2010, the number of workers participating in walkouts was less than 2 percent of what it had been when Reagan led the actors’ strike in 1952. Lacking the leverage that strikes once provided, unions have been unable to pressure employers to increase wages as productivity rises. Inequality has ballooned to a level not seen since Reagan’s boyhood in the 1920s.

This event was and is rightfully considered a watershed moment in the Republican Party's attempts to destroy unions and the union movement. Since Reagan took on PATCO, unions have seen their membership number decline precipitously, and most working class Americans have seen their wages and salaries stagnant, even as the individuals (CEO's, Senior executives, and people like Mitt Romney and his former firm Bain Capital) who control major corporations and industries have seen their pay and income soar to levels once though unimaginable.

What many may not know, however, is that Ronald Reagan in the last days of the 1980 election campaign, sent a letter to the President of PATCO, Robert E. Poli, promising he understood the many numerous concerns air traffic controller had with their pay, outmoded equipment and working conditions. Specifically, he promised to provide them with the most up-to-date equipment and to work with them to provide more staffing and less brutal work schedules in the interest of public safety. Here's a image of Reagan's letter to Pioli, dated October 20, 1980:

For those having difficulty reading the content of that letter from the image, here is a transcription of the text in full:

Dear Mr. Poli: I have been briefed by members of my staff as to the deplorable state of our nation's air traffic control system. They have told me that too few people working unreasonable hours with obsolete equipment has placed the nation's air travelers in unwarranted danger. In an area so clearly related to public policy the Carter administration has failed to act responsibly. You can rest assured that if I am elected president, I will take whatever steps are necessary to provide our air traffic controllers with the most modern equipment available and to adjust staff levels and work days so that they are commensurate with achieving a maximum degree of public safety. As in all other areas of the federal government where the President has the power to appoint, I fully intend to appoint highly qualified individuals who can work harmoniously with Congress and the employees of the governmental agencies they oversee. I pledge to you that my administration will work very closely with you to bring about a spirit of cooperation between the president and the air traffic controllers. Such harmony can and must exist of we are to restore the people's confidence in their government. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan

[N]ewly elected PATCO president Robert Poli—who’d succeeded the more irenic incumbent John Leyden in a surprise insurgent challenge—was keen to demonstrate his clout before the union’s restive rank and file. He presumed to be bargaining from a position of strength because during the run-up to contract negotiations, PATCO had sought to secure firm Washington backing with another surprise move: it endorsed Reagan in the 1980 election, partly as a matter of heeding the shifting national mood, and partly out of sheer exasperation with the Carter administration’s handling of key controller concerns.

Based in part on this this letter Poli and other senior PATCO officials had PATCO endorse Reagan for President. PATCO was one of only four AFL-CIO affiliated unions to endorse Reagan over Carter.

Never has a Union leader made a more serious mistake in judgment. The Reagan appointed head of the FAA failed to negotiate in goof faith, reacting to PATCO's demand for pay raises, improved equipment and less arduous working hours with a counteroffer equal to approximately 1/7 of the cost of the union's offer. Poli accepted the offer, but did so with little enthusiasm. Reagan had doubled crossed him and put his position with PATCO's membership at risk. The administration's hard line only encouraged those at PATCO to strike, which was Reagan's goal all along.

He immediately invoked the Taft-Hartley act and fired all the striking air controllers on August 5, 1981, a total exceeding 11,000. Reagan then hired 5.500 scabs as the FAA head, Drew Lewis claimed that there had been a ""surplus of controllers."" The FAA also reduced flights by 25% and also brought in 370 military controllers. Though the FAA promised to have staffing levels up to pre-1981 levels within two years, in fact it took almost a decade before those levels were again achieved. This was due partly to Reagan's ban on rehiring any of the fired PATCO controllers.

Reagan never had any intention of working with the union. This can be best demonstrated by the fact that in February, the Reagan Department of Justice, aided by the FAA, had complied a list of air traffic controllers to arrested and prosecuted in the event of a strike. One Federal District Judge in Denver threw out all the criminal indictments against local PATCO officials, labeling the Reagan DOJ's actions as creating a ""hit list"" at a time when the government was supposed to be negotiating with the union in ""good faith.""

Today, of course, the Republican candidates feel free to openly demonize unions and seek to destroy the right to collectively bargain. We've seen the actions of Republican governors elected in 2010 as proof of that. The nation's political landscape is vastly changed by what Reagan accomplished in his showdown with PATCO. Reagan gambled that he could get away with his lies back then, and he succeeded. Now Republicans can lie on a daily basis and no one in the media even bothers to check the claims they make, the numerous falsehoods and prevarications they promulgate. Now the unions are shrinking, and they more often than not refuse to strike our of fear. Now Democrats govern as 1990's era Republicans, catering far to often to the wealthy elites and multinational corporations and failing to support unions.

And it all started with Ronnie Reagan's sweet little lie to the air traffic controllers. He wasn't concerned about the safety of air travel. He wasn't willing to work with PATCO to improve working conditions or modernize our air traffic control system. He wanted an easy target to make the case that unions are bad for America, and he hoodwinked PATCO into believing he would act honorably and treat them fairly. He lied, and we have been paying the price for it ever since."

By a 22-point margin (53 percent to 31 percent), the public blames the Republican Party more for the shutdown than President Barack Obama – a wider margin of blame for the GOP than the party received during the poll during the last shutdown in 1995-96. It was true that blame was more evenly distributed at the beginning of the crisis, but this poll marks the second showing a precipitous drop in GOP support (Gallup was the first). People may have spent the first few days of the crisis taking stock of the situation, but they're now coming off the sidelines.

By opposing an unpopular law, Republicans will rally the public behind them

Just 24 percent of respondents have a favorable opinion about the GOP, and only 21 percent have a favorable view of the Tea Party, which are both at all-time lows in the history of poll. No one could've predicted that being unmitigated assholes would backfire. Actually, everyone did outside of their rightwing bubble. Indeed, the trendlines of the polling aggregates are unmistakable:



[O]ne year until next fall’s midterm elections, American voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress to a Republican-controlled one by eight percentage points (47 percent to 39 percent), up from the Democrats’ three-point advantage last month (46 percent to 43 percent). Remember, Democrats need to win the generic congressional ballot by about seven points to take back the House. GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey may get his wish after all.

Phil Gingrey may get his wish after all. Republicans might suffer, but so will Obama and Democrats as voters and the media put a pox on both houses.

Obama’s political standing has remained relatively stable since the shutdown, with his approval rating ticking up two points since last month, and with the Democratic Party’s favorability rating declining just three points (from 42 percent to 39 percent). So much for the ""both houses"" theory. If only someone had suggested the past five years that standing firm against Republican intransigence wouldn't just be good policy, but good politics. I mean, someone inside the White House and congressional leadership offices. Because outside of the Beltway, the roar was deafening. Feels good to be proven right. Too bad it had to happen this way.

Republicans can do anything they want since the public doesn't like Obamacare

[T]he health-care law has become more popular since the shutdown began. Thirty-eight percent see the Affordable Care Act (or “Obamacare”) as a good idea, versus 43 percent who see it as a bad idea – up from 31 percent good idea, 44 percent bad idea last month. The Republican intransigence appears to be the best thing that ever happened to the law. You know how Republicans oppose anything that President Barack Obama does? Well, Republicans are now so hated, that the public seems to be rallying around the things Republicans oppose. I've gotta admit, I didn't see that one coming.

Well, Republicans are now so hated, that the public seems to be rallying around the things Republicans oppose. I've gotta admit, I didn't see that one coming. The American people want Republicans to fight for smaller government

And by a 52-percent-to-44 percent difference, respondents believe the government should do more to solve problems. Back in June, the public was split, 48 percent to 48 percent, on whether the government should do more or less. Republicans have somehow managed to make government more popular. Without the shutdown, they might've focused on Obamacare implementation problems and the absurd cost of the Canadian-built non-working federal exchanges website. That shit pisses even me off. But nope. By acting like total dicks, Republicans have reminded the public about the benefits of having a functional government.

So just how disastrous has this shutdown been for Republicans? They've rebranded in the wrong direction, hitting their all-time highs in unpopularity and bringing down the Tea Party (21/47), John Boehner (17/42) and Ted Cruz (14/28) down in the process. Fitting, since those are the masterminds of this genius plan which wasn't just doomed to obvious failure, but has made both Obamacare and the government more popular.

He Left The Post In April']","Politics is a team sport, but not for House Republicans","Politics is a team sport. Except the way House Republicans have played it for the past few years.

At the root of the problems that afflict the majority party in the House is that there are simply too few members willing to occasionally set aside personal interests and ambitions for the broader goals of the party. They just won’t take one for the team.

“The founders’ vision of seeing consensus and compromise in a party conference, let alone on the floor of Congress, appears to be a thing of the past,” said Tom Reynolds, a former congressman from New York who spent two elections as chairman of the House GOP’s campaign arm.

“It is every man for himself,” added another Republican former lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about internal party differences. “House Republicans need to recognize their destinies are intertwined.”

Examples of this go-it-alone approach are everywhere. The surprise failure of the farm bill last month was a result of the rebellion of five dozen Republicans who thought the legislation cut too little. The collapse of House Speaker John Boehner’s alternative proposal during the “fiscal cliff” negotiations late last year was caused by conservative Republicans’ unwillingness to get behind it. (Worth noting: While Boehner (R-Ohio) eventually voted for the compromise deal that averted the fiscal cliff, neither House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) nor House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did.) Then, of course, there was the quasi-rebellion against Boehner at the start of the 113th Congress, when he barely avoided being pushed to a second ballot in his quest for a new term as speaker.

The farm bill was perhaps most illustrative of the lack of team spirit in the House GOP. Among the 62 Republicans who voted against the bill, five were committee chairmen — positions they hold thanks to the very party leaders they bucked in voting “no.”

“We have younger members [who] seem incapable of following and who constantly make the perfect the enemy of the good,” explained one GOP lawmaker, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. “We have chairmen . . . who seem to think they have no obligation to the majority that gave them gavels or even to their fellow chairmen.”

House Republicans’ lack of cohesion on important votes is made all the more clear when you compare it with the recent unity displayed by Democrats in the House and the Senate. On the farm bill, for example, just 24 Democrats — primarily from agriculture-heavy states — voted for it, while 172 voted against it. On the Senate side, not a single Democrat opposed the comprehensive immigration proposal put forward by the “Gang of Eight” last week.

House Republicans’ unwillingness to play team ball is beyond dispute. But the reasons for that lack of unity — and who is to blame for it — are a more open question.

Conservatives who make up the rump group in the House insist that they were elected to be true to their principles and their constituents, not to a party leadership that many believe is responsible, at least in part, for the current state of affairs in Washington. Their reluctance to go along with the GOP team, then, is a natural outgrowth of strongly held beliefs — which, after all, is what voters always say they want in their elected officials.

Others point to the effects of redistricting, the decennial drawing of congressional lines across the country that, over the past several decades, has made the vast majority of House members untouchable in general elections because of the clear partisan lean of their districts. The only thing they fear, politically speaking, is a challenge from the ideological right in a primary, and they protect against that possibility by hewing as closely as they can to the desires of the conservative base. “For survival in a primary, voting against the leadership is a badge of honor back home,” explained Dan Mattoon, a longtime senior adviser to former speaker Dennis Hastert.

The end of earmarks — the plums, usually involving federal dollars spent in a certain district, that Republicans banned when they retook the House in 2010 — also is cited as a reason for the every-man-is-an-island attitude among GOPers. In years past, an earmark dropped into the farm bill here or there would usually persuade a wavering lawmaker to get on board with his party’s leadership. That tool is gone, and with it some of the persuasive powers of people like Boehner and Cantor.

Viewed more broadly, the Republican Party finds itself in a bit of a political wilderness. By 2016, the GOP will have controlled the presidency for only eight of the past 24 years, a streak — and not the good kind — reminiscent of the one Democrats experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s. Why does that matter? Because it’s much easier to stay on the same team when there’s a single captain or coach pointing the way. Republicans lack that presence now and won’t have anything approximating that sort of leader until the 2016 presidential primary process concludes — at the earliest.

In short: Don’t expect an increase in team play from House Republicans — on immigration, the debt ceiling or any of the other contentious fights that will come before Congress in the coming months. There will be lots of (political) isolation plays for the foreseeable future.

“Wrestlers and golfers don’t see the value of a sacrifice fly, but sometimes it’s what the team needs,” said another GOP lawmaker."

Mr. Williams, 57, who until recently paid himself $1 million a year as a chief executive of Star Scientific, which has lost money for a decade, has a history of promoting over-the-counter treatments and a parallel history of running afoul of regulators. Two decades ago he was ordered to pay $300,000 for pumping up a stock with false claims about an anti-wrinkle cream named Lacramore.

In March, Star Scientific, which sells two dietary supplements and two face creams, revealed it was the target of a federal investigation into its stock.

A lawyer for Mr. Williams, Jerry Kilgore, did not respond to requests for comment.

Another friend of Mr. Williams’s is Virginia’s attorney general, Mr. Cuccinelli. Mr. Cuccinelli has reported $18,000 in gifts from Mr. Williams, including regular vacations at a house on Smith Mountain Lake, near Roanoke, and a catered $1,500 Thanksgiving dinner. He also received a box of Anatabloc.

Mr. Cuccinelli, 44, bought stock in Star Scientific, which at one time was worth more than $20,000, although he failed to disclose his holding as required by law for nearly a year. Last October, he filed an updated statement of economic interest to include the stock, his only substantial investment.

The Cuccinelli campaign declined to answer questions about Mr. Williams and Star Scientific. Chris LaCivita, a strategist for the campaign, has said Mr. Cuccinelli did not realize his stock’s value had passed $10,000, the threshold for reporting. Once he did, he corrected the record. He has since sold all of his shares, his campaign has said, the last in mid-April."
http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27398089/,2008-10-27 11:30:34+00:00,[],"Stevens convicted, says he'll stay in Senate race","A defiant Sen. Ted Stevens, convicted of corruption charges, said Monday he will fight the verdict ""with every ounce of energy I have."" He added he will not give up his bid for re-election.

""I am innocent,"" the Alaska Republican said in a statement that indicated he will appeal. ""This verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial. I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights. I remain a candidate for the United States Senate.""

A jury on Monday found Stevens guilty of seven corruption charges, throwing into limbo the 40-year career of Alaska's political patriarch.

There is no automatic Senate punishment for Stevens. The most severe potential consequence in Congress is expulsion by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. That normally would follow an investigation by the Senate ethics committee.

""I am obviously disappointed in the verdict but not surprised given the repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct in this case. The prosecutors had to report themselves to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility during the trial for ethical violations,"" Stevens' statement said.

""Exculpatory evidence was hidden from my lawyers. A witness was kept from us and then sent back to Alaska. The government lawyers allowed evidence to be introduced that they knew was false. I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have.""

Prison time?

Stevens, 84, was found guilty of lying about free home renovations and other gifts he received from a wealthy oil contractor. Jurors began deliberating last week.

Visibly shaken after the verdicts were read, Stevens tried to intertwine his fingers but quickly put his hands down to his side after noticing they were trembling. As he left the courtroom, Stevens got a quick kiss on the cheek from his wife, Catherine, who testified on his behalf during the trial. He declined to talk to reporters waiting outside.

Stevens faces up to five years in prison on each count when he is sentenced, but under federal guidelines he is likely to receive much less prison time, if any. The judge originally scheduled sentencing for Jan. 26 but then changed his mind and did not immediately set a date.

The jurors left the court without comment.

Said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan: ""The jurors have unanimously told me that no one has any desire to speak to any member of the media.""

The verdict, coming barely a week before Election Day, increased Stevens' difficulty in winning what already was a difficult race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich. Democrats hope to seize the once reliably Republican seat as part of their bid for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.

""It's a sad day for Alaska, and a sad day for Senator Stevens and his family,"" Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, said in Richmond, Va., where she was campaigning.

""The verdict shines a light though on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company up there in Alaska that was allowed to control too much of our state. And that control was part of the culture of corruption that I was elected to fight.""

She added: ""As governor of the state of Alaska, I'll carefully monitor now the situation and I'll take any appropriate action as needed. In the meantime I do ask that the people of Alaska join me in respecting the workings of our judicial system, and I'm confident that Senator Stevens, from this point on, will do the right thing for the state of Alaska.""

She ignored a question on whether she would vote for Stevens next week as she climbed the stairs to catch a plane to Roanoke.

Career in jeopardy

The monthlong trial revealed that employees for oil services company VECO Corp. transformed the senator's modest mountain cabin into a modern, two-story home with wraparound porches, a sauna and a wine cellar.

The Senate's longest-serving Republican, Stevens said he had no idea he was getting freebies. He said he paid $160,000 for the project and believed that covered everything.

Stevens had asked for an unusually speedy trial, hoping he'd be exonerated in time to return to Alaska and win re-election. He kept his campaign going and gave no indication that he had a contingency plan in case of conviction.

Despite being a convicted felon, he is not required to drop out of the race or resign from the Senate. If he wins re-election, he can continue to hold his seat because there is no rule barring felons from serving in Congress. The Senate could vote to expel Stevens on a two-thirds vote.

In the event Stevens resigns, Alaska's governor cannot appoint a successor and a special election would be held between 60 and 90 days of his vacating his Senate seat, according to Alaska state rules.

""Put this down: That will never happen — ever, OK?"" Stevens said in the weeks leading up to his trial. ""I am not stepping down. I'm going to run through and I'm going to win this election.

Democrats have invested heavily in the race, running television advertisements starring fictional FBI agents and featuring excerpts from wiretaps.

Old friend's testimony crucial

Stevens' conviction hinged on the testimony of Bill Allen, the senator's longtime drinking and fishing buddy. Allen, the founder of VECO, testified that he never billed his friend for the work on the house and that Stevens knew he was getting a special deal.

Stevens spent three days on the witness stand, vehemently denying that allegation. He said his wife, Catherine, paid every bill they received.

Living in Washington, thousands of miles away, made it impossible to monitor the project every day. Stevens relied on Allen to oversee the renovations, he said, and his friend deceived him by not forwarding all the bills.

Prosecutors used a barrage of witnesses to question how Stevens could have been in the dark about VECO's work on the project. VECO employees testified to seeing Stevens at the house. One left him a company business card. Stevens sent thank you notes to others.

Stevens' conviction is the highlight of a lengthy FBI investigation into Alaska corruption, but prosecutors noted that it is not the end. Stevens' longtime Republican colleague, Rep. Don Young, remains under investigation for his ties to VECO. Stevens' son, Ben, a former Alaska lawmaker, is also under investigation.

Stevens is a legendary figure in Alaska, where he has wielded political influence since before statehood. His knack for steering billions of dollars in federal money to his home state has drawn praise from his constituents and consternation from budget hawks.

Call for resignation

There was no immediate word on Stevens' campaign plans. His spokesman, Aaron Saunders, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether Stevens would stay in the race.

In Alaska, the Democratic Party issued a statement calling for Stevens to resign immediately. ""He knew what he was doing was wrong,"" the party said. ""But he did it anyway and lied to Alaskans about it.""

Stevens is the sixth senator convicted of criminal charges. The last previous one was Republican David Durenberger of Minnesota, who was indicted in 1993 on charges of conspiring to make fraudulent claims for Senate reimbursement of $3,825 in lodging expenses. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and was sentenced to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine."

Don Young rebuked over slur,"WASHINGTON - One of the House of Representatives’ longest-serving Republicans now says he meant “no disrespect” when he used the term “wetbacks” to describe migrant workers his family once employed.

His comment, which drew a strong rebuke from the House speaker, flies in the face of his party’s effort to improve outreach to minority groups.

In an interview with a local radio station Thursday, Alaska Rep. Don Young was discussing how advances in technology have reduced the need for some types of employment and referred to farming his family once did in California.

“My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,” he told KRBD. “It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.”

Young, a 40-year veteran of Congress, also told the station that former GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was correct in saying that 47% of Americans are dependent on government, according to a story posted by the station.

House Speaker John A. Boehner strongly denounced Young’s comment Friday.

“Congressman Young’s remarks were offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds. I don’t care why he said it – there’s no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology,” Boehner said.

Young’s office did issue a clarification, though not an apology, in the congressman’s name.

“During a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio this week, I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California. I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays, and I meant no disrespect,” he said.

Rep. Ruben Hinojosa (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called it “deeply disheartening” that a member of Congress would use “such hateful words and racial slurs.”

“Rep. Young says that he was just using the language he was accustomed to as he grew up, but there is no excuse for ignorance. He has served alongside Hispanics in Congress since 1973, so he should know terms like ‘wetback’ have never been acceptable,” he said. “As the Republican minority outreach efforts develop, I’d advise their strategists to list ‘don’t say racial slurs like ‘wetback’’ as a bedrock for their messaging.”

On twitter, Greg Sargent linked to a Jennifer Rubin piece that shockingly appears to be well-researched and detailed, and strongly suggests Rand Paul repeatedly violated physician advertising laws in Kentucky by holding himself out as board certified.

We probably know the story that Rand Paul made up his own ophthalmology board (the National Opthalmology Board, which despite its name, was mainly a Kentucky thing) in 1997. I just thought that it just sounded like bullshit and left it at that, but it turns out the board was defunct in 2000, revived in 2005, and defunct again in 2011. During the time it was out of business, no board was certifying Dr. Paul, and after 2005, it was not recognized as a licensing board by the state of Kentucky.

Now, one does not need board certification to practice medicine or to obtain admitting privileges, but it is a factor in physician advertising rules for consumer protection purposes. If there is no board to enforce compliance or regulate continuing education, then board certification is utterly meaningless, so the board has to, first of all, exist, and second of all, perform some function other than advance the interest of younger ophthalmologists upset that older ones could be grandfathered into certification rules.

This is likely because you can't just have doctors making up their own licensing boards and call themselves board certified! Of course, this is what Dr. Paul would call ""big government,"" because what does freedom mean if quacks can't cut open your eyeballs.

Paul may not be a quack, but by holding himself out as board certified despite not being that in reality, he in effect holds himself out as a quack.

So, it sounds like Paul's ethical problems may not stop with plagiarism. And ask yourself - what would a real medical board do with the plagiarism story, anyway?

Of course, take anything Jennifer Rubin says with an ocean of salt, but I think at the very least, Paul has some questions to account for (and Rubin reports his staff in no way did). And in the meantime, bask in the delicious joy that is R-on-R violence."

Blow'],Diversity and the Political Right - The New York Times,"Many on the political right simply can’t get this diversity thing right — and I deeply doubt that they want to. Theirs is a bone-deep contempt for otherness, a congenital belief in the superiority-inferiority binary, a circle-the-wagons, zero-sum view of progress, prosperity and power.

This became apparent yet again Wednesday when it was revealed that one of the co-authors of a much maligned Heritage Foundation “study” about “The Fiscal Cost of Unlawful Immigrants and Amnesty to the U.S. Taxpayer,” Jason Richwine, had written a Ph.D. dissertation at Harvard in 2009 titled “IQ and Immigration Policy.”

Dylan Matthews of The Washington Post summarized Richwine’s dissertation thusly:

“Richwine’s dissertation asserts that there are deep-set differentials in intelligence between races. While it’s clear he thinks it is partly due to genetics — ‘the totality of the evidence suggests a genetic component to group differences in I.Q.’ — he argues the most important thing is that the differences in group I.Q.s are persistent, for whatever reason. He writes, ‘No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach I.Q. parity with whites, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-I.Q. children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against.’ ”

Matthews continues:

“He does caution against referring to it as I.Q.-based selection, saying that using the term ‘skill-based’ would ‘blunt the negative reaction.’ ”"

Video doesn't seem to be available yet, but a tweet from Todd gives a hint: Tune in on @nbcnightlynews for a look at the conservative engine inside the House GOP At the moment the comments seem to show a leaning towards blue sentiments, with a few red stater types weighing in, plus some who are too disgusted to even think about it.

The quick version as best I can recall, is, roughly 80 House Republicans were tagged as using the budget as a hammer to force concessions on Obabmacare, in a letter they signed back in August sent to the House leadership. A look at them shows they come from districts where they won by large majorities and President Obama lost by a big margin. In other words, they expect to feel no political heat back home for shutting down the government.

Two of them (whose names escape me) were interviewed briefly. My impression is that they were both quite pleased with having shut down the government, because they believe Obamacare is just too ""onerous"". They were elected in 2010, after the bill creating the ACA passed into law; they didn't get to vote on it so they're taking it upon themselves to stop it any way they can.

Charles P. Pierce has their number right here:

In the year of our Lord 2010, the voters of the United States elected the worst Congress in the history of the Republic. There have been Congresses more dilatory. There have been Congresses more irresponsible, though not many of them. There have been lazier Congresses, more vicious Congresses, and Congresses less capable of seeing forests for trees. But there has never been in a single Congress -- or, more precisely, in a single House of the Congress -- a more lethal combination of political ambition, political stupidity, and political vainglory than exists in this one, which has arranged to shut down the federal government because it disapproves of a law passed by a previous Congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court, a law that does nothing more than extend the possibility of health insurance to the millions of Americans who do not presently have it, a law based on a proposal from a conservative think-tank and taken out on the test track in Massachusetts by a Republican governor who also happens to have been the party's 2012 nominee for president of the United States. That is why the government of the United States is, in large measure, closed this morning.

While Todd's report doesn't get as colorful as that of Pierce, it does make very clear that the government of the United States has been shut down at the behest of a minority of the House Republican Party, representing a fraction of the United States and and even smaller fraction of the voting public.

This may be as close as we get to seeing a major news outlet lay this on a bunch of GOP ideologues. It will be interesting to see if anyone else picks up on this, or it sinks back into the ""one hand - other hand"" school of reporting.

If NBC puts the video clip up, I'll try to link to it.

Meanwhile, the next report up was about how the first day of the Healthcare Exchanges opening up was marked by huge numbers of people crashing websites as they tried to find out more and sign up for insurance...

UPDATE: HERE'S THE VIDEO (thanks to Phil S 33 for finding it) It's a remarkable report from a mainstream news organizations that for once doesn't waffle about what's really behind the government shutdown. This is one to Facebook and share as widely as possible.

UPDATE 2: Tip to Jacoby Jonze, who links to this Ryan Lizza New Yorker article that is the apparent source for Todd's report. Names, map, and a lot more detail. Lizza calls the GOP extremists ""The Suicide Caucus""; let's hope this doesn't turn into one of those murder-suicide stories. These people, it should be said, are determined to deny millions of their fellow Americans access to health care, and they don't care what the body count will be.

UPDATE 3: While there are some complaints that Todd didn't push his two interview subjects hard enough on their stand or otherwise explain what's happening in as great detail as might be desired, the issue is now out there and the rest of the media just might start to run with it.

Pete Sessions (R-Texas) who allegedly told President Obama he could not bear to look at him at a meeting earlier this month.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) let his Democratic caucus know last week in a private meeting that a top House Republican told President Barack Obama, ""I cannot even stand to look at you,"" according to two Democratic senators who were present, and confirmed by two Senate Democratic aides who said they independently learned of the exchange from two other senators.

One of the two Democratic senators who spoke to HuffPost said that Reid told the caucus about the incident last Tuesday and named Sessions. He also told the caucus that he was ""sorry"" to have to tell them about it, per this senator, but gave Obama credit for his ""dignified"" response to Sessions. Reid reportedly told the caucus that Obama responded to Sessions by saying he understood they disagreed on many issues and he respected their differences.

More:Sessions' office is denying the charge and the WH is attributing the kerfuffle to a ""miscommunication"" made during the reading back of the meeting's transcript.

UPDATE 2: Hmmmm...now Chad Pergram of FOX is tweeting that he contacted Durbin's office and the Senator is sticking with his story:

Durbin's office says the sen stands by his comments that Hse ldrshp R said they can't stand to look at Obama, even after Carney debunked it

But two Democratic aides, both of whom requested anonymity, told The Huffington Post that the incident was relayed to members during a Senate Democratic Caucus meeting shortly after it allegedly happened. And Durbin isn’t backing down from the claims he originally made on his Facebook page on Sunday. “Sen. Durbin stands by his comments,” Durbin spokesman Max Gleischman told The Huffington Post.

TPM has it, too (h/t eztempo) as does Huffington Post, which included this tidbit in an article earlier this evening:Thanks for the find, PorridgeGun. The fact that Durbin discussed the incident with others just after it happened seems to indicate the story is legit.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Thanks to hulibow and Paleo for pointing out WH spokesman Jay Carney denied Durbin's account at today's briefing. Here is the text:



QUESTION: Just to follow up on that. In terms of the president talking to Republicans, can you rule out -- there was the number two Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said on his Facebook page that someone in recent exchange with the president said he can't even stand, this member of Congress, that he can't even stand to look at the president. Can you say whether that happened? JAY CARNEY: I will say this, I spoke with somebody who was in that meeting and it did not happen. QUESTION: Did the White House speak to Senator Durbin about this? CARNEY: I don't know. My understanding is that, again, from participants in the meeting that that didn't happen. QUESTION: Did anything like it happen that would -- CARNEY: Not that I'm aware of, Jackie.

This is just a quick diary to call attention to a story published tonight on The Hill 's blog site.

To put it short, this story, if true, turns my stomach, and says a lot about why Obama needs to continue to stand strong against House Republicans and FOR Democratic priorities. And why we all need to stand with him.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/11/ig-report-finds-questionable-payments-to-former-us-rep-heather-wilson/,2013-06-11 00:00:00,[],IG report finds 'questionable' payments to former US Rep. Heather Wilson,"Former U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson collected nearly half a million dollars in questionable payments from four federally funded nuclear labs after she left office, the Energy Department's inspector general says in a new report.

Wilson failed to provide documentation for the work she did to earn $20,000 a month from the Los Alamos and Sandia national labs in New Mexico from January 2009 to March 2011, the report said. Officials at the Nevada Test Site and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee acknowledged there ""were no deliverables"" associated with $30,000 the two labs paid Wilson. Sandia had Wilson lobby for more defense dollars, an apparent violation of her contract, the report said.

In total, nearly $450,000 in questionable payments were identified, the bulk from Los Alamos and Sandia.

The contractors that run the labs have paid the money back to the federal government but an investigation continues, the report said.

In a statement emailed Tuesday to The Associated Press, Wilson said the report ""confirms that the labs were satisfied with my work. The work was done in full compliance with the contracts we signed and under the direct supervision of lab sponsors.""

The report called Wilson's agreements with the labs unusual and in some cases ""highly irregular."" And it said the agreements and the lab operators failed to include or enforce ""even minimum"" invoicing standards.

Wilson, a Republican who represented New Mexico's 1st Congressional District, collected much of the money in between two unsuccessful runs for the U.S. Senate. She was defeated last year by Democrat Martin Heinrich during a campaign that highlighted her connections to Los Alamos and Sandia. The labs conduct classified research on nuclear weapons.

Wilson, a former Air Force officer, has a doctorate in international relations and is a former staffer for the National Security Council. She campaigned as an expert on defense, arms control, and intelligence matters.

During the 2012 Senate campaign, the AP sought copies of Wilson's contracts with the labs after she disclosed income from Los Alamos, Sandia and Oak Ridge. And all three labs called the documents confidential.

Saying much of her work was classified, Wilson's campaign declined to release the contracts. But it said her work included helping Oak Ridge establish a senior advisory group on intelligence; providing advice to senior managers at Los Alamos on nuclear deterrence and threat reduction programs, and serving on the Intelligence Advisory Panel for Sandia National Labs.

""Her relationship with our national labs goes back over 20 years and she has worked on a wide range of projects with different groups of scientists and engineers over time,"" her campaign said in an e-mail.

The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the national labs, requested the DOE review of whether the agreement between the contractor that runs Los Alamos and Wilson was properly administered.

In addition to problems with the contracts and documentation of services provided by Wilson, the report said an agency contract officer was ""subjected to pressure""' when Los Alamos National Security, LLC, which runs Los Alamos, requested approval to enter an agreement with Wilson. The report said inspectors were unable to identify any evidence of that pressure.

It noted that the separate investigation continues. The report was issued by the civil division. The office also conducts criminal investigations.

The report is the latest in a string of reprimands from government oversight agencies for a lack of oversight of contracts and projects at the nation's nuclear facilities.

Congress has appointed a special committee to study a potential overhaul of the NNSA. Last month, the agency's acting director suddenly announced she is stepping down after less than six months in the top spot.

Wilson gave up her seat five years ago to run for the nomination to replace her mentor, longtime New Mexico Republican Sen. Pete Domenici. She lost in a tight primary, but ran again last year against Heinrich in a race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat.

Wilson called herself a consultant and said she turned down a top spot at Sandia to make her second run for Senate."
