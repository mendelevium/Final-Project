By a 22-point margin (53 percent to 31 percent), the public blames the Republican Party more for the shutdown than President Barack Obama – a wider margin of blame for the GOP than the party received during the poll during the last shutdown in 1995-96. It was true that blame was more evenly distributed at the beginning of the crisis, but this poll marks the second showing a precipitous drop in GOP support (Gallup was the first). People may have spent the first few days of the crisis taking stock of the situation, but they're now coming off the sidelines.

People may have spent the first few days of the crisis taking stock of the situation, but they're now coming off the sidelines. By opposing an unpopular law, Republicans will rally the public behind them

Just 24 percent of respondents have a favorable opinion about the GOP, and only 21 percent have a favorable view of the Tea Party, which are both at all-time lows in the history of poll. No one could've predicted that being unmitigated assholes would backfire. Actually, everyone did outside of their rightwing bubble. Indeed, the trendlines of the polling aggregates are unmistakable:



[O]ne year until next fall’s midterm elections, American voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress to a Republican-controlled one by eight percentage points (47 percent to 39 percent), up from the Democrats’ three-point advantage last month (46 percent to 43 percent). Remember, Democrats need to win the generic congressional ballot by about seven points to take back the House. GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey may get his wish after all.

Phil Gingrey may get his wish after all. Republicans might suffer, but so will Obama and Democrats as voters and the media put a pox on both houses.

Obama’s political standing has remained relatively stable since the shutdown, with his approval rating ticking up two points since last month, and with the Democratic Party’s favorability rating declining just three points (from 42 percent to 39 percent). So much for the ""both houses"" theory. If only someone had suggested the past five years that standing firm against Republican intransigence wouldn't just be good policy, but good politics. I mean, someone inside the White House and congressional leadership offices. Because outside of the Beltway, the roar was deafening. Feels good to be proven right. Too bad it had to happen this way.

Republicans can do anything they want since the public doesn't like Obamacare

[T]he health-care law has become more popular since the shutdown began. Thirty-eight percent see the Affordable Care Act (or “Obamacare”) as a good idea, versus 43 percent who see it as a bad idea – up from 31 percent good idea, 44 percent bad idea last month. The Republican intransigence appears to be the best thing that ever happened to the law. You know how Republicans oppose anything that President Barack Obama does? Well, Republicans are now so hated, that the public seems to be rallying around the things Republicans oppose. I've gotta admit, I didn't see that one coming.

Well, Republicans are now so hated, that the public seems to be rallying around the things Republicans oppose. I've gotta admit, I didn't see that one coming. The American people want Republicans to fight for smaller government

And by a 52-percent-to-44 percent difference, respondents believe the government should do more to solve problems. Back in June, the public was split, 48 percent to 48 percent, on whether the government should do more or less. Republicans have somehow managed to make government more popular. Without the shutdown, they might've focused on Obamacare implementation problems and the absurd cost of the Canadian-built non-working federal exchanges website. That shit pisses even me off. But nope. By acting like total dicks, Republicans have reminded the public about the benefits of having a functional government.

So just how disastrous has this shutdown been for Republicans? They've rebranded in the wrong direction, hitting their all-time highs in unpopularity and bringing down the Tea Party (21/47), John Boehner (17/42) and Ted Cruz (14/28) down in the process. Fitting, since those are the masterminds of this genius plan which wasn't just doomed to obvious failure, but has made both Obamacare and the government more popular.

Epic."

Jack Ohman's cartoon of April 25 made a strong statement about Gov. Rick Perry's disregard for worker safety, and his attempts to market Texas as a place where industries can thrive with few regulations. It is unfortunate that Gov. Perry, and some on the blogosphere, have attempted to interpret the cartoon as being disrespectful of the victims of this tragedy. As Ohman has made clear on his blog, he has complete empathy for the victims and people living by the plant. What he finds offensive is a governor who would gamble with the lives of families by not pushing for the strongest safety regulations. Perry's letter is an attempt to distract people from that message.

California has seen Perry's touting of his state's pro-business prowess firsthand. In February, a public-private Texas marketing firm ran radio ads featuring Perry denigrating California's taxes and regulation, and then Perry traveled there to recruit jobs. He made a similar trip , this time backed by a print-media ad buy , to Chicago this past week.

The AP story by Weissert has additional details which adds some perspective on Perry's 'outrage'.

Notably absent from Perry's display of outrage is any sense of shame for the consequences of the policies Perry has actively promoted as governor, or his own responsibility as head of the state government that failed so badly to protect its citizens. Republicans bill themselves as a party that strongly supports the idea of personal responsibility - yet they take none when their ideological pigeons come home to roost.

To be sure, there are damn few politicians who want to be labeled ""anti-business"" these days - but Perry and his ilk have gone so far to the opposite extreme, the cartoon is if anything understated in its criticism. The ideology of money is producing devastation on a global scale that conventional terrorists can only envy. Corporate whores like Perry are killing us, piecemeal as in West, Texas and on a planetary scale as well.

The video below shows how we are systematically being put at risk in service to the pro-business ideology, an ideology which is proving to be the greatest challenge of the 21st century. If we don't manage to rein it in, it may well be Game Over for America and the rest of the planet.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/25/Whos-Afraid-of-Michele-Bachmann,2013-01-25 00:00:00,['Anita Moncrief'],Who's Afraid of Michele Bachmann?,"Who’s afraid of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann? The entire range of far-left activists, apparently.

Bachmann (R-MN) is currently the target of an aggressive campaign sponsored by a leftist organization, People for the American Way. Its immediate objective is to get House Speaker John Boehner to strip her of her Intelligence Committee seat.

According to the Watchdog Wire, the group–affiliated with ACORN, George Soros, and United for Peace and Justice–has taken a rather vocal stance against Bachmann.

People for the American Way (PFAW) has launched a new campaign against Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who, after her recent re-election to Congress, has been re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).

A PFAW-sponsored petition with 178,000 signatures is to be presented to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) on Monday 21 January 2012 to protest Bachmann’s HPSCI appointment.

Citing what PFAW calls “ugly Islamophobic fear mongering,” the petition decries what it alleges are Bachmann’s “unfounded and irresponsible attacks on dedicated public servants.”

Michele Bachmann has represented the people of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District since 2007. She is the Chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Bachmann’s supporters consider her a staunch conservative who is a champion of the cause of limited, constitutional government. They admire her for her commitment to low taxes and fiscal discipline, as well as her opposition to socialized medicine.

In matters of national defense, Bachmann is a stalwart advocate of Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of Peace through Strength. Rep. Bachmann has spoken many times regarding the threat of radical Islam and Obama administration policies that are exacerbating it.

The petition was not PFAW’s first assault on Bachmann, as the group spent most of 2012 producing propaganda to make people distance themselves from the Congresswoman and her startling revelations.

Bachmann is credited with leading a 2012 effort to launch official investigations into the activities of federal employees in five executive branch agencies allegedly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.

From FrontPage Magazine:

Last June, Rep. Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues sent letters to the Inspectors General at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, asking them to investigate whether the Muslim Brotherhood–the ideological wellspring from which such terrorist outfits as al Qaeda and Hamas first emerged–might be gaining undue influence over high-level U.S. government officials. One letter, for instance, noted that Hillary Clinton’s closest aide, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, “has three family members… connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.”

Critics viciously attacked Bachmann for asking these questions. Many on the right consider her treatment unwarranted, ad hominem criticism from left-leaning establishment media and Islamist organizations–and even from some fellow Republicans–and that it decreased the margin of her very narrow reelection in 2012.

Why the special interest from PFAW? According to Discover the Networks:

People for the American Way (PFAW) was established in 1981 as a Tides Foundation project designed to counteract the allegedly growing influence of what its founder, television producer and political activist Norman Lear, denounced as the ‘religious right.’

In July 2011, PFAW published a Right Wing Playbook on Anti-Muslim Extremism, whose theme is that: “Under the guise of defending freedom and American values, right-wing anti-Muslim activists are campaigning to prevent Muslim-Americans from freely worshiping and practicing their religion, curtail their political rights, and even compel their deportation.”

Bachmann is also despised on the left because of her role in taking down ACORN. Bachmann went after ACORN for its role in the federal census before the group received national media attention, and the far left has never forgotten it. ACORN received over $100,000 from the foundation started by the wife of PFAW founder Norman Lear. PFAW also shares other funders with ACORN and has worked with Project Vote for years on “election protection.” PFAW boasts celebrity board members like Alec Baldwin and Seth McFarlane. The board also consists of several members with connections to the Communist Party of the USA and the usual suspects of radical millionaires.

Would PFAW’s interest have anything to do with Deborah Rappaport and her husband Andrew?

Discover the Networks provides a very clear profile:

A committed Democrat and a socialist, Rappaport has established himself (along with his wife, the philanthropist and political activist Deborah Rappaport) as one of the largest donors to Democratic Party candidates and causes. Between 1999 and 2008, he contributed $340,139 to candidates and political action committees at the national level. In addition, he and his wife have given millions of dollars to organizations that promote Democrat objectives and policies…

Andrew Rappaport is secretary of the Rappaport Family Foundation (RFF), which he and his wife established in 2002 as a vehicle by which to administer their charitable donations. Between 2004 and 2008, RFF gave $850,000 to People for the American Way, $700,000 to the Center for American Progress, and $323,000 to the anti-war group Project Billboard. In 2006 RFF sent $100,000 to the Tides Center, which in turn (on instructions from RFF) funneled the money to Allied Media Projects, an anti-corporate community-media organization where ACORN founder Wade Rathke sits on the board of directors. As of 2006, RFF’s assets totaled $7.6 million.

Other ACORN connected board members of PFAW include the well-connected radical Margery Tabankin, the Executive Director of both Steven Spielberg’s Righteous Persons Foundation and The Streisand Foundation.

Bachmann’s enemies at PFAW even originate from her own backyard. Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie is not only connected to several of the PFAW board members’ radical organizations but he is also a friend of Bachmann’s old foe ACORN.

How close of a friend? While at ACORN, I remember several efforts working with local Democrats to raise money for the Franken versus Coleman efforts. This included a 2008 meeting between Secretary of State Ritchie, ACORN, Project Vote. The subject of the meeting? Ritchie was actively providing fundraising help for Project Vote and ACORN.

PFAW has a long history of partisan political activity that is ignored by the very same mainstream media that have funded–yes, funded them in the past. CBS, NBC, ABC and even the New York Times have failed to note what the Capital Research Center (CRC) pointed out in 2002. During the height of PFAW’s work to stymie all Bush judicial nominees, CRC wrote:

People for the American Way and its affiliates work together as a powerful lobby for leftist ideology and Democratic party politics. Whatever its tax lawyers may say, the scandal of PFAW is that foundations and corporations inflate its budget and pay for its politics. Every dollar contributed to PFAW advances a profoundly political agenda.

To recap, PFAW’s board is comprised of a who’s who of far-left radicals, socialists, and communists. They are tied to ACORN and Project Vote, and the bulk of their funding comes from far-left foundations like Tides. In addition, the Capital Research Center reported that in 2003 and 2004, 98 percent of the organization’s political contributions went to left-wing Democratic candidates.

Do PFAW and its allies aim to inflict further damage in the Alinsky style to one of our country’s most courageous and visionary leaders, to defeat her next year as part of the left’s determined bid to return the House to Democratic control?

Speaker of the House John Boehner and the rest of the country should stand strong behind Michele Bachmann. With those kind of enemies, Bachmann appears to be one of the few in Congress on the right path. We must not allow the Islamists and their allies on the left to deprive our country at this critical moment of Michele Bachmann’s leadership on national security, limited government, and conservative values at a moment when they are needed more than ever. If one woman can bring the entire wrath of the left down on her, one must examine her statements and remember the old adage “the truth hurts.” Well, look who’s howling now."

No warning was given — nothing posted days before or announced on the radio. Traffic backed up to the outskirts of Omaha (an approximation), reasonable people went mad, children were appropriately traumatized and the residents of Fort Lee, the New Jersey town at the western end of the bridge, got the gift of air pollution of the type that will, studies have shown, strike them down in later years as they venture out for the Early Bird Special. Their last words, you can be almost certain, will be, “Damn you, Chris Christie.”

The New Jersey governor has asserted that he had nothing to do with the totally capricious lane closings. As for his aides who instigated the mayhem, they insisted they were not — as alleged — getting even with the mayor of Fort Lee, the Democrat Mark Sokolich, who had failed to endorse the Republican Christie’s reelection, as some 60 other Democratic officials had prudently done. They said the lane closings — which lasted four days — were imposed to conduct a traffic study that, oddly enough, no one knows anything about and, furthermore, cannot find. It might prove that if you close lanes, traffic will back up.

The bridge is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The governors of both states make the necessary appointments. (It’s not entirely inconceivable that New York’s Andrew Cuomo will wind up facing Christie somewhere down the road.) Inside the authority, Christie’s guys were widely viewed as his political operatives. One of them was David Wildstein, the governor’s friend since high school and former mayor of their home town of Livingston, N.J . The governor parked Wildstein at the authority at $150,000 per year and apparently gave him a year’s supply of traffic cones.

Another Christie friend and political ally, Bill Baroni, was also placed at the authority. He is a former state senator and was given a salary of $290,000. In the wake of the lane closings, both he and Wildstein have resigned, apparently hoping to end the matter. But New Jersey Democrats, a creative bunch, have come to call the affair “Bridgegate” and, armed with subpoena power in the legislature, are determined — for strictly good-government reasons — to get to the bottom of this.

The suffix “-gate” has been much abused since 1972 when, in the dead of night, Republican operatives, in gloved hands, merely sought to find the truth at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters. For instance, “-gate” was misapplied to the recent IRS scandal, which, a good deal of GOP hyperventilating notwithstanding, has gone nowhere. That’s because “-gate” implies that the scandal will lead to the top, as it eventually did with Richard Nixon. Few outside the House Republican caucus thought that Barack Obama had anything to do with inappropriate IRS investigations. In contrast, no one would put Bridgegate past Christie’s guys.

The governor has learned from history. Rather than wait for the legislature to lay a path of subpoenas to his door in Trenton and let the story build and build like Ravel’s “Bolero,” his aides swiftly resigned, even though it’s a hard market out there for gridlock-makers. Still, the damage has been done. Christie’s all-but-declared presidential campaign has taken a hit. His Joisey bona fides — a certain swagger and cocksureness — have been highlighted. (No one would cast Jimmy Stewart for this role.) Christie is a man of rare political ability, but he has a short temper and the affect of a bully. Worse, he unaccountably lacks affection for the media and sometimes shows it. Lots of politicians play hardball. Christie plays beanball.

Still, he would not be so reckless as to clog up a bridge but his aides — as in the mother of all gates — might be a different story. The facts remain that the lanes were indeed closed, no credible reason has been given and two Christie appointees left high-paying patronage posts for which their chief qualification apparently was friendship with the governor. This does not look good. It is, to say the least, not presidential.

The toll for the George Washington Bridge during peak hours is $11 for cars with an E-ZPass, but certain types of large trucks can pay as much as $84. That’s high, but it’s nothing compared to the toll Christie may pay for the lane closings. The traffic jam could keep him in New Jersey.

During what passed for debate, the citizens in the gallery sat silent, some with duct tape over their mouths. The gallery was lined with Capitol Police, whose job it is to oversee the increasingly detailed and labyrinthine sets of rules of conduct and laws restricting assembly that have been put in place during the last two years. It has been clear that signage is no longer allowed in the gallery, nor is photography, nor recording devices of any kinds. I don't know that we were cognizant that silence would not be allowed. That's right: in Wisconsin, our silence has been silenced!

According to the twitter stream of Madison writer and activist Rebecca Kemble's eyewitness account:



Women with tape over their mouths silently protesting #gynogovt in Assembly Gallery told to take it off. Some of them ejected. #WarOnWomen

Rep. Pasch on AB 216: ""The author of this bill is seriously out of touch with the reality of women."" #gynogovt #WarOnWomen

Clapping spontaneously erupted after Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch spoke of the importance of access to birth control for women:One woman was handcuffed and marched out due to her unwillingness to leave the gallery when Rep. Kramer cleared the first two rows due to clapping.I'll end with that chilling image. A radical bill of serious consequence was fast-tracked through legislature and now waits to be signed by Governor Walker. He's already said that he has no problem with ultrasounds, and will readily sign. The Senate allowed no debate, insisting on a rapid and violent roll-call vote. The House allowed the performance of debate and voted along party lines. The citizens watching from the galleries above were surrounded by police. There were no outbursts, no incivility, only one instance of clapping. The first two rows were immediately ejected, without warning, by the order of the Republican Speaker.

Women sitting silently with duct tape on their mouths were given the ultimatum: take off your tape, or face arrest. They took off their tape, and sat silently with their hands over their mouths. No talking allowed. No clapping allowed. No noise allowed. No silence allowed.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/17/congressmen-letter-GM-closures,2013-05-17 00:00:00,['Alexander Marlow'],Congressmen: Were Conservative Car Dealers Targeted for GM Closures?,"Two Congressmen are asking the Treasury Department if it inappropriately scrutinized conservative-owned businesses the same way it targeted Tea Party groups filing for tax-exempt status.

Republicans Mike Kelly (PA-03) and Jim Renacci (OH-16) circulated a letter Thursday requesting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to release documents detailing the process and methodology the Automotive Task Force used to shut down General Motors dealerships in 2009 during the automotive industry crisis.

Renacci’s Northeast Ohio Chevrolet dealership was closed in 2010 after losing a battle with General Motors. Congress loaned General Motors $50 billion in 2009 after GM declared bankruptcy, which resulted in the federal government owning a majority share of the company. Roughly 2000 dealerships received “wind-down” agreements, and while hundreds were able to survive an exhaustive arbitration process, Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth did not. Renacci, then a Congressional candidate challenging incumbent John Boccieri, placed the blame squarely on President Obama.

Mike Kelly has a similar story. He decided to run for Congress when it was announced that Obama’s Automotive Task Force slated Wayland Chevrolet in Butler, Pennsylvania for closure. The dealership was started by Kelly’s father in 1953.

Now that it has been confirmed that the Treasury Department unfairly profiled conservatives around that time, the Congressmen are wondering if that could have been a factor in the selection of certain dealerships for closure.

The IRS scandal “raises serious questions about past decisions made by the [Treasury] Department regarding auto dealership closures that occurred in 2008 and 2009,” reads the letter. “We formally request that the Treasury Department provide all e-mails, phone records, notes, memoranda, reports, and other communications regarding the decision-making process for dealership closures from the Automotive Task Force headed by Car Czars Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom.”

The letter also notes that while the Automotive Task Force claimed to have objectively evaluated each dealership, a Special Inspector General Report found that there was “little or no documentation” that proves objective criteria were used.

Moral Monday #6: 89 arrested; Charlotte Observer reporter detained,"U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (Dem., N.C. District 1) and former U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge were among the speakers at the protest and rally on the rain-soaked and muddied Halifax Mall that lies between the General Assembly and the Legislative Office Building in downtown Raleigh. Other speakers included representatives from the NAACP-North Carolina, clergy members from around the state, and members of other coalition partners sponsoring the weekly Moral Monday gatherings.

Butterfield called the avanlanche of nearly 2,000 GOP- and Tea Party-sponsored bills put forward in this legislative session ""absolutely disgusting"" and ""devastating to low-income people."" The list of bills, many of which were put forward verbatim from the playbook of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), is exhaustive and clearly indicative of a concerted effort to gut public education, suppress voter rights, encourage gun ownership, deter public transparency of governance and corporate workings, and overhaul the state's tax system to encourage regressive sales taxes. You can read an abbreviated listing of the key bills here.

But Butterfield also noted that his colleagues in Washington and the U.S public are taking notice of what's being done under the cover of ALEC-funded ""reform"" in the Tar Heel State.

""It is a widespread movement that is gaining momentum,"" Butterfield said to the crowd of hundreds huddled under umbrellas taking refuge from a stormy downpour. ""The nation is watching.""

After the main speeches, the crowd of protesters accompanied the 84 people sporting green armbands to designate their willingness to enter the General Assembly building and refuse to disperse when ordered to do so by law-enforcement officers. We walked to the second-floor hallway in between the N.C. Senate and N.C. House chambers and gathered near the fountains while singing ""Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round."" Clergy members from all around the state led us in prayer and words of support and encouragement.

The G.A. and Raleigh police allowed us to sing and pray for 15-20 minutes, then made an announcement that we had five minutes to disperse or we would be arrested. At that point, a few people peeled away and moved up to the third floor to support us, but most of those gathered outside the House Chambers remained, holding up signs (a prohibited act in the legislative building), singing, and praying.

Police were without except gentle and kind as they approached us, one by one, and asked each of us whether we were aware that if we did not leave, we would be arrested. When we acknowledged that we understood this, the officers respectfully encircled our wrists with plastic zip-ties, documenting each arrest carefully with videocameras. Each of us was gently guided to a nearby elevator and taken to a basement cafeteria, which is converted each Monday afternoon to an ersatz detention intake station. We sat quietly, some a little nervous, some in physical discomfort from the handcuffs, all buoyed by the determination that we've lawfully asserted our constitutional right to peaceably assemble and make our grievances known to our legislators.

As the room filled with arrestees, we were walked through the steps of the process and then taken to waiting buses. Quietly and surreptitiously, many of the detention and police officers let us know they supported what we were doing. It was a little difficult to hold back tears as they gently guided us into the buses while whispering their support.

Our five buses pulled out of the loading docks of the NCGA building to the cheers and claps of hundreds of supporters. Those of us whose hands were cuffed in front of us waved as best we could; others pressed their heads against the windows and shouted thanks for the encouragement. It was a great morale boost to be greeted by the voices of those who stood by us.

It was at the Wake County Detention Center (WCDC) where we noticed the small signs that our weekly protests are making a difference in North Carolina. With the arrests of nearly 400 protesters (not 400 arrests but 400 arrested protesters, as once you're arrested for failure to disperse, you're not permitted back into the General Assembly until your case is adjudicated in 2-3 months), the WCDC has tweaked its processes to more easily accommodate the growing number of arrests each Monday. Last week, for instance, the 151 people arrested on ""Mega Moral Monday"" were submitted to the usual fingerprinting process, but detention officials have eliminated that step for the Moral Monday arrestees to speed up the process and decrease the strain and discomfort of those of us who are charged and processed.

This and many quietly supportive statements by detention and police officers let us know that Moral Mondays are no longer being taken as flashes in the pan, that state and county officials understand that Moral Monday has become a movement, not just a moment.

Our five buses arrived at the WCDC around 6:30-7:00, and by 10 p.m., the last of us who were on the first bus were heard before the County Magistrate and signed the papers acknowledging the three charges against each of us:

Fail to disperse on command;

Second-degree trespass;

violation of Legislative Building policy, ""willfully creating a disturbance in the N.C. State Legislative Building with loud singing and yelling, and/or displaying unauthorized signs in violation of G.S. 120-32.1(B).""

I was a little nervous when I was held for a few minutes alone in the magistrate's vestibule. Unlike the others in my group, I was accompanied by not just one officer but three. My name was carried on a Post-It Note to the G.A. police officers outside and brought back with a fourth officer. I admit I got a little shaky and my eyes began to tear up, wondering whether something was wrong.

But the fourth officer who accompanied me turned out to be Wayne, the G.A. Police officer who's been a constant support for me in these past four months of regular ""GA sanity inspections"" as a citizen lobbyist 2-3 days a week at the General Assembly. Wayne always makes sure I have access to a private area to recharge my electronic devices after I return to the GA building from a morning of meeting with legislators and staff and take up my place in one of the indoor courtyards to write and blog. He stops by my ersatz courtyard ""office"" each time to check on how I'm doing, make sure I have water, and joke about my not drinking coffee to support my ""mad manic typing skillz.""

Without saying anything, Wayne and one of his colleagues led an increasingly nervous me out of the magistrate's offices and into the release area, and as we turned a corner and the three of us were alone in a hallway, Wayne leaned in and said with a wink and a smile, ""I just knew you were going to be here one Monday. Thank you for all you've been doing these past weeks and months, and thanks to all of you for what you're doing tonight. It matters."" Teary-eyed, I leaned into his hug as we entered the release area and I was given back a large envelope with my water bottle, cell phone, keys, and identification. Wayne and I shook hands as I headed toward the door and freedom.

Outside, I was greeted with claps and cheers. I got a big hug from N.C. Sen. Earline Parmon, who's been one of my constant supporters each and every day I spend as a citizen lobbyist at the NCGA. One of the leaders of the N.C. Black Legislative Caucus and an ordained minister, Sen. Parmon comes to the WCDC every Monday night to greet every single arrestee, staying until the very last person is processed and released -- even last week, when 151 civil-disobedience participants were arrests and processing took until 5 a.m.



Once released from the Wake Co. Detention Center, I was presented with buttons commemorating the Moral Monday civil-disobedience arrests and protests.

Bedraggled and a little stiff from the handcuffs, we were nonetheless exuberant about our release and the quiet words of support from the various law-enforcement and detention personnel who processed us.

There was a little more paperwork (decidedly less somber) from the NAACP regarding its legal-defense system for the Moral Monday arrests, and then we all joined the growing number of those released who stayed to clap and cheer for those who were released after us.Sen. Parmon joined me on one of the benches and we discussed the effects of the growing Moral Monday movement and how we can move forward. So far, N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory has refused to meet with any of us who are opposed to the odious raft of ALEC-sponsored legislation. He refused again on Monday when asked to meet with clergy members who came from all over the state to bring the voices and appeals of their parishioners to the capital. Sen. Parmon suggested one next step might be to camp out at the governor's mansion. Those of us who've been arrested are prohibited from stepping foot into the General Assembly building and the Legislative Office Building until our cases are fully adjudicated (although we can make appointments with individual legislators and have them or their staff escort us from the reception area to their offices and back). But we are not prohibited from the grounds of the governor's mansion and offices, just a couple blocks away.

By midnight, all of us had been processed and released. Throughout the evening, NAACP volunteers shuttled processed arrestees back to the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, where we'd started the afternoon with legal briefings by the NAACP legal-defense team, for welcome food and water. We talked about the Moral Monday movement and how it is taking root in North Carolina, how the whole nation is starting to notice what we're doing and why we're doing it, how we have a long and tough slog ahead of us.

And then, exhausted and sore but buoyed by the spirit of ""peaceably assembling"" together, we went home to our families, our kittehz, our beds. And we knew we are moving forward together taking not one step back.

Please join us for a Moral Monday at the N.C. General Assembly. You will not be asked to join those who risk arrest (but you will be well-supported and cared-for if your conscience prompts you to volunteer), and your support and claps and cheers will matter a great deal to those who do make that choice. Even if you can't come to Raleigh, you can support our civil disobedience movement by making a contribution of food or funds for legal defense.

Forward together! Not one step back!

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/19/recall-effort-against-morse-deemed-sufficient/,2013-06-19 00:00:00,[],Colorado lawmaker who supported gun control to face recall election,"The Colorado secretary of state's office on Tuesday declared that organizers behind a recall petition against a Colorado lawmaker who supported gun control had enough valid signatures to set up the first potential recall of a state lawmaker in Colorado history.

The secretary of state said opponents of Senate President John Morse, D-Colorado Springs, gathered more than 10,000 valid signatures. They only needed 7,178 valid signatures, equaling 25 percent of all the votes cast in the previous state Senate election.

The recall election would likely in occur in September, though legal challenges could drag the process into October.

Lawyers for Morse are challenging the recall effort. They argued that the petition fails to use language defined in the Colorado constitution that ""expressly include a demand for the election of a successor to the recalled official,"" The Denver Post reported.

""The constitution is clear, just as the courts are clear: no recall petition is valid without this specific language,"" Mark Grueskin, an election lawyer representing a Morse constituent who filed the legal challenge Tuesday told The Post.

The campaign to unseat Morse has become a national flashpoint in the gun control debate. Gun-rights activists from across the country have vowed to defeat Democrats who steered through laws that made Colorado the first state outside the East Coast to curb gun rights in the wake of mass shootings at an elementary school in Connecticut and a movie theater in suburban Denver.

The gun rights supporters were especially unhappy with new laws to expand required background checks for gun purchases and to limit the size of ammunition magazines. The laws take effect next month.

Jessica Kerns, spokeswoman for the group behind the recall, told the Colorado Springs Gazette her group plans to defend the petition against legal challenges from Morse supporters.

""We were expecting the most frivolous legal challenges to this and we're prepared to fight this,"" Kerns told the newspaper. ""We're prepared to defend every single petition so that the peoples' voices can be heard.""

Morse, a second-term incumbent who would be leaving office because of term limits after next session, has vowed to fight the recall. He didn't immediately return a call Tuesday after the recall petition was deemed sufficient.

Earlier this summer, Morse told reporters that the gun control measures were imperative after a bloody 2012.

""Keeping Coloradans safe from gun violence is very worth your political career,"" Morse said.

Morse's attorneys are asking that the validation of the signatures be reversed. A hearing will be scheduled for arguments at the Secretary of State's Office within two weeks. If there's an appeal there, it goes to Denver District Court.

A spokeswoman for the recall effort, Jennifer Kerns, called the Morse challenge part of the ""normal crop of frivolous legal challenges.""

""We are not surprised by their attempts to thwart this recall effort, and we will do everything we can to ensure that the voices of the people are heard,"" she wrote in an email.

If Morse resigns, the seat remains in Democratic hands because the party would appoint a senator to the vacancy. Democrats hold a five-seat advantage in the state Senate.

Democratic Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo is awaiting word from the secretary of state about a similar petition filed against her. A decision in that recall effort was expected by the end of next week.

Recall efforts against two other Democratic lawmakers who supported the gun control measures fizzled. Democrats control both chambers of the state Legislature, as well as the governor's office.

Social media have transformed Congress’s younger generation. (While much of the Senate is arguably too old to know how to use the TV remote, three of the four leaders of this week’s faux filibuster are 42.) Twitter in particular makes politicians even more self-obsessed than they used to be. “Talking about tomorrow’s #DefundObamacare vote tonight on Hannity. Be sure to tune in!” twittered Senator Ted Cruz on Thursday.

Cruz kept demanding that the Senate “listen to the American people,” but he really meant that they should listen to his Twitter followers. A politician riding on a wave of tweets feels as if the nation is cheering his every word, even when the nation is actually reading the sports page while a select splinter of hard-core supporters manically pound away on their smartphones. A hundred thousand people cheering you on in the social media feels like a mass movement. But this is a gigantic country. You can find 100,000 people who believe in a secret plot by Belgium to corner the market on beetroot.

Richard Baker, the co-author of “The American Senate,” says the late Senator Robert Byrd waged a war against cellphones on the Senate floor: “When he entered the room, there was this whooshing under the desks.” But Byrd is gone, and now we have Ted Cruz.

3. Zombie apocalypse. Only possible explanation.

On Friday, the Senate finally managed to vote to keep the government running until mid-November, when we’d get to do this all over again. It’s now up to the House, which will be having an unusual working weekend while the Republicans decide whether to pass the Senate bill and move on, or festoon it with anti-Obamacare amendments.

The majority whip, Kevin McCarthy, suggested that his colleagues might want to join him for an evening showing of the movie “Prisoners.” One Republican aide worried that the media might read too much into the title, what with the country being held hostage to the House’s current psychosis and all. The media are actually disappointed that McCarthy passed up “Insidious” and “Despicable Me.”

Cynics would say that keeping the government going for a few more weeks is just the kind of modest, uncontroversial proposal that automatically vanishes into the black hole that is the current House of Representatives. But maybe there’s hope. After all, on Friday the House members did show they could pass legislation in a purposeful, bipartisan fashion. They approved a bill naming a building in Virginia after a deceased federal worker."

(CNN) - Gov. Paul LePage, known for making controversial comments, reportedly said President Barack Obama ""hates white people,"" according to two Maine newspapers citing unnamed sources.

""I never said that. And you guys are all about gossip,"" he told reporters as he walked out of the Maine State House in Augusta. His comments were recorded by CNN affiliate WCSH.



The Portland Press Herald reported late Monday night that two state lawmakers said LePage, a Republican, made the comment at a Maine GOP fundraiser on August 12.

The Bangor Daily News also reported that LePage made the comment, citing an unnamed attendee.

The Portland Press Herald wrote that LePage argued Obama would be the best president ever if he would highlight his biracial heritage, but he doesn't do so because of his negative feelings towards white people.

The governor's office and the state Republican Party declined to answer questions from CNN about the incident. And a senior political adviser to LePage refused to even speak to the issue, but sent a prepared statement criticizing the Press Herald and noting that the governor had raised a Jamaican teenager.

""It seems farfetched for anyone, even a newspaper, to make an insinuation the Governor is racist given his life history,"" said Brent Littlefield, LePage's political adviser. ""He and his family made a choice and sacrifice when they offered Devon the opportunity to join their family many years ago. Paul and Ann call him their son. Paul LePage recognized many people helped him make it out of poverty and he has been determined to help others succeed.""

LePage took in Devon Raymond Jr., in August 2002 to live with his family. LePage refers to him as his son, though they did not formally adopt him.

Lisa Fortier, who hosted the fundraiser with her husband, told CNN: ""I never heard it. I never heard anybody mention it.""

LePage's reported comment about Obama marks the latest in a string of off-color remarks by the first-term governor, who plans to run for re-election next year. Earlier this month, LePage joked that he wanted to blow up the headquarters of the Press Herald.

According to the Sunlight Foundation, the paper's majority owner is Donald Sussman, a billionaire manager of boutique hedge funds and a major political donor to Democratic super PACs in 2012, as well as other Democratic campaigns over the years. Sussman is married to Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine.

Just a few weeks ago, sitting in a flight simulator, LePage was asked where he wanted to fly to.

""I want to find the Portland Press Herald building and blow it up,"" he replied, according to video posted on the website of the Daily News.

Later, LePage explained on Twitter he was making a joke.

The governor also caused a stir in June when he made a crude sexual reference to describe a Democratic state lawmaker.

""Sen. Jackson claims to be for the people but he's the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline,"" LePage told the television station WMTW, referring to state Sen. Troy Jackson.

And last year, he apologized for referring to the Internal Revenue Service as the ""Gestapo"" in his weekly radio address.

""It was not my intent to insult anyone, especially the Jewish Community, or minimize the fact that millions of people were murdered,"" the governor said in a statement.

LePage was elected in 2010, after first winning a crowded GOP primary, then narrowly winning the general election with 38% of the vote. In addition to the Democratic candidate, LePage also ran against two independents. The three candidates caused a wide split in his opposition.

USA TODAY

Bachmann ran for the Republican presidential nomination last year

Move comes amid an FEC complaint against her former presidential campaign

She did not reveal her future plans

WASHINGTON — Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann, a GOP conservative who ran for president last year, made a surprise announcement Wednesday and said she will not seek re-election to a fifth term in Congress.

The Minnesota Republican was facing inquiries into her 2012 presidential campaign and a potential 2014 rematch with Democrat Jim Graves, a wealthy hotel executive who came within about 4,300 votes of defeating her in November. She had already bought airtime in Minnesota to begin running campaign ads.

""My decision was not influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected,"" Bachmann said in a video posted on her website.

Bachmann added, ""This decision was not impacted in any way by the recent inquiries into the activities of my former presidential campaign.""

Former Bachmann aide Peter Waldron in January filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming the congresswoman made improper payments to an Iowa state senator who was the state chairman of her presidential campaign. Waldron accused Bachmann of other FEC violations.

Bachmann, 57, made a name for herself in Congress by staunchly opposing President Obama's health care law. In 2006, she became the first Republican woman elected to represent Minnesota in the U.S. House. Bachmann later co-founded the House Tea Party Caucus, a group dedicated to the anti-tax, small government principles that sparked the movement, and set out to repeal the health care law.

Her outspoken critique of Obama and frequent TV appearances, along with support from the Tea Party, invariably led to comparisons with Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican Party vice presidential nominee. Palin had backed Bachmann during her 2010 re-election bid, when she faced a tough fight against Democrat Tarryl Clark. Bachmann said she viewed Palin as a friend and not a competitor.

In her presidential campaign, Bachmann tried to tap into her support from Tea Partiers — who also felt political kinship with candidates such as Rick Santorum and Rick Perry — in her bid for the GOP nomination. She made a number of gaffes on the campaign trail, such as the time she suggested the Revolutionary War battles at Lexington and Concord occurred in New Hampshire.

Bachmann blasted Perry, the Texas governor, in one televised GOP debate over mandating the HPV vaccine for schoolgirls and suggested it would lead to retardation. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other doctors spoke out to correct Bachmann, saying that the HPV vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer, would not cause mental retardation.

It was a quick rise — and fall — on the national scene for Bachmann, who declared her intention to seek the White House during a televised debate in June 2011. The Iowa native later that summer won the Ames Straw Poll, a state Republican Party fundraiser that is viewed as a gauge of grass-roots support for the first-in-the-nation caucuses. But Bachmann had trouble consolidating support among the Tea Party faithful and social conservatives, and dropped out the morning after the Iowa caucuses.

Months after some of her presidential rivals had already done so, Bachmann endorsed Mitt Romney for the GOP nomination.

Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, praised Bachmann as a ""tireless advocate and dedicated representative for the people of Minnesota's 6th District."" He said Bachmann ""has worked hard each day to ensure that her constituents' voices are heard in the halls of Congress.""

Bachmann routinely was among the House's top fundraisers and her 2012 race against Graves, the former CEO of the AmericInn chain, was one of the most expensive in the country. She raised nearly $15 million last year to about $2.3 million for Graves, and wasted no time cranking up her fundraising machine for the 2014 elections.

In one such e-mail pitch, Bachmann proclaimed that the ""Pelosi-Obama campaign machine"" was taking aim at her.

Democrats hailed Bachmann's decision to retire from Congress and held her up as an example of what is wrong with the Republican Party.

""Michele Bachmann's Tea Party brand of extremism and obstruction have infected the entire Republican Congress and her influence shows no signs of waning,"" said Emily Bittner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

The House Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats to Congress, promised to help Graves win the seat based in the Twin Cities suburbs. ""We are confident that we would have helped defeat her next November, but Bachmann voluntarily removing herself from Congress is a victory we can all celebrate today,"" said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC.

Bachmann promised in her video to ""continue to work overtime for the next 18 months in Congress defending the same Constitutional conservative values we have worked so hard on together.""

As for her plans beyond Congress, Bachmann said, ""There is no future option or opportunity, be it directly in the political arena or otherwise, that I won't be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation.""

Stickyfingers (R-KY)

Sen. Stickyfingers (R-KY)

A top aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been dealing with a series of plagiarism allegations in recent days, acknowledged Tuesday that Paul's staff in some cases failed to properly attribute and quote content pulled from other sources. ""In the thousands of speeches and op-eds Sen. Paul has produced, he has always presented his own ideas, opinions and conclusions,"" senior adviser Doug Stafford said in a statement. ""Sen. Paul also relies on a large number of staff and advisers to provide supporting facts and anecdotes—some of which were not clearly sourced or vetted properly.""

""Adherence to a new approval process implemented by Sen. Paul will ensure proper citation and accountability in all collaborative works going forward,"" he said.

While Sen. Rand Paul is off challenging people to fisticuffs or worse , one of his senior advisers has finally admitted the obvious: Yes, there’s been a bucketload of copying going on in the Paul camp. That doesn’t even count as a faux apology, and I’m not sure how well the whole sorry if you could not see our invisible spoken footnotes routine works out for others caught lifting other people’s work. But Stafford promises—and this is real—that from now on footnotes to Paul’s speeches or op-eds will be available “on request.” And:So from here on in, America, if a Rand Paul op-ed contains entire passages lifted from an old Eddie Murphy movie, it’s because Rand Paul himself signed off on it. Good to know.

The belated acknowledgement of insufficient-footnote-gate comes after a particularly egregious pair of new examples. This weekend BuzzFeed identified three entire pages of Paul’s latest book that were lifted wholesale from a Heritage Foundation paper; that was soon followed by the discovery that portions of a September Rand Paul op-ed in the Washington Times were copied from an op-ed written by a The Week editor just one week earlier.

Now the word has come down; it’s the fault of unnamed staffers, and it’s more the fault of you, the reader, for not being able to magically discern when Rand Paul and his staff are speaking their own words and when they’re lifting entire pages of content from somewhere else because hey, that’s what faux-libertarian Republicanism is all about, baby. I somehow do not think this will satisfy Sen. Stickyfingers’s critics, and somehow I doubt we’re going to be hearing the name of the staffer responsible for those three full pages of lifted text in the book Paul “wrote.”

Rand Paul, for his part, weighs in with the requisite amount of Paul family lunacy:



Acknowledging that his office had “made mistakes,” he said he was putting a new system in place to ensure that all of his materials are properly footnoted and cited. “What we are going to do from here forward, if it will make people leave me the hell alone, is we’re going to do them like college papers,” he said.

Yes, yes. It's all about your hurt feelings. The stupid reporters with their stupid finding things out."

A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:

The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy Gilmore Jr.

The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home address in Houston, The Hill reported.

It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”

The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S. Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a street wise [sic] lesson.”

In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.”

Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad.

After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?

We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture.

But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.

Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

“While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill,” the Washington Post‘s Scott Wilson and Zachary Goldfarb reported on Sunday.

Even though the Gang of Eight–Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez–has allowed the White House into meetings, ICE officers union president Chris Crane notes that his group has been kept completely out of the discussion on immigration reform.

“We have tried for weeks, unsuccessfully, to get a meeting with the Gang of 8 in order to share our deep concerns about the breakdown of interior enforcement in America,” Crane said in the statement released on Sunday.

“ICE’s political leadership, specifically Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton, have repeatedly and dangerously undermined the ability of ICE officers and agents to do their jobs and ensure the constitutionally established rule of law is upheld. Yet, while the Gang of 8 has, as reported for months, worked extensively with powerful interest groups, ICE officers–like the public–have been shut out. Now we understand from media reports that the Gang of 8 is preparing to drop a 1,500 page bill on Tuesday, and pass it as quickly as possible, without having received any input from rank-and-file ICE officers.

“If the Gang is truly committed to enforcement and public safety they should be eager to provide our officers with an opportunity to review this legislation and offer detailed input before it is introduced,” Crane added. “I would therefore respectfully request that the introduction of the bill be delayed so that ICE officers and others in the law enforcement community can be fully briefed on this 1,500 page bill and offer detailed input regarding some of our nation’s most urgent interior enforcement needs that this proposal seemingly does nothing to address.”

Even though the Gang of Eight has refused meeting requests with ICE officers to discuss real law enforcement reform in the immigration debate, Rubio–the GOP members’ de facto leader–says he wants an open and transparent discussion on this issue. He has still not forced multiple hearings on the legislation, as he previously promised, and has not set up a meeting with ICE officers.

During his Sunday show charm offensive, Rubio continued saying he supports an open and transparent debate."

But you have the question mark: How is this person going to adjust to being on the other side?”

But, he added, “What struck me was how quickly and effectively Jay plunged into his new role, his ability and the energy he put into in defending the vice president.”

In early 2011, when Robert Gibbs, a longtime aide to Mr. Obama, resigned as White House press secretary, Mr. Carney was picked to succeed him.

Until now, Mr. Carney’s admirers and his detractors have given him credit him for avoiding the classic missteps often made by a spokesman forced to volley each day with the press on a range of topics — from the war in Syria to the federal budget to the president’s personal habits — in an hourlong televised event often peppered with preening reporters who seem to relish the opportunity to rough up the press secretary before the cameras.

White House press secretaries tend to come in two models: There is the consummate insider, like Mr. Gibbs; Jody Powell, who served during the presidency of Jimmy Carter; and James C. Hagerty, who served under Dwight D. Eisenhower — all men who had known and worked with their bosses for years. The other type, like Mr. Carney, Mr. Nessen or Larry Speakes, who worked for President Ronald Reagan, is often less involved in the development of policy or its packaging, but rather in selling it.

“Access is a two-edged sword,” said Bill Plante, a White House correspondent for CBS News. “If you are really in the inner circle, you are very guarded about what you give up. If you’re not in the inner circle, you are not going to have as much context for what you do say. Frankly I think the latter is preferable.”

Yet there also appears to be an unspoken expectation in the White House that Mr. Carney can somehow control the news-hungry animals with which he once shared the zoo, which is largely untrue."

Editor’s Note: Margaret Hoover is the author of “American Individualism: How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party.”

(CNN) —

Dean Obeidallah, John Avlon and I kick off this week’s episode of “The Big Three” podcast by tackling Congress’ Benghazi hearings from three distinct perspectives.

Ever the centrist, my beloved husband John questions whether the hearings are an earnest search for the truth or a hyperpartisan GOP political witch hunt aimed at embarrassing the Obama administration while derailing Hillary Clinton’s potential 2016 presidential bid. Dean and I duke it out from opposite perspectives, and we all agree on a surprising point at the end.

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah John Avlon, Margaret Hoover, Dean Obeidallah

Then, on to a discussion of the dramatic fractures within the GOP on immigration reform – a split between former Sen. Jim DeMint’s Heritage Foundation and his protégé Sen. Marco Rubio – which give Dean cause for celebration. But I’m not sure he will ultimately like the outcome of these GOP growing pains, which I suspect reveal a realignment of Republican reformers from old guard thinking.

Cracks in what had been GOP monolithic thinking on issues ranging from immigration to gun control to gay rights – in a week where Delaware became the 11th state to pass marriage equality with a genuine bipartisan majority – could reinvigorate the GOP brand and lead to a more competitive party nationally.

John thinks renewal and competition in any party orthodoxy is healthy for America, but Dean is clearly rooting for DeMint’s success, even if it means the end of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act. To be fair, Dean’s a comedian, so maybe his partisanship is good for laughs, but it will give way to a desire for good policy to win the day – even if the Republicans get some credit. We’ll let you decide.

Finally, was Gov. Chris Christie’s lap band surgery motivated by political ambition or personal health? One of us thinks Americans are too obsessed with weight to elect an obese president. Another worries that the act of losing weight will obscure Christie’s record in New Jersey if he decides to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016. Is it possible for aspiring elected officials to make decisions independent of their political future?

We hope you have as much fun hearing us analyze these issues as we had laughing it out over them.

I'm imagining Boehner standing in an empty hallway here. ""Guys? The government is kinda collapsing here. I don't mean to alarm anyone, but if we don't pass a reasonable budget by the end of the month the folks at the National Zoo say they're going to have to let all their animals go, and they're threatening to personally drive them to my office before releasing them.""

""Screw you, let the government fall!"" yell the anarchists from one room. ""No deal, but you can have your FAA controllers back,"" shout the pragmatists from another, ""but in exchange we're passing a bill next month banning the use of human fetal tissue as lawnmower lubricant. And you're standing up giving a press conference telling America that's a thing now.""

And scene. The buffoonery would be great fun to watch, if it weren't for that whole screwing-Americans-over-on-a-weekly-basis thing. Tell you what, guys, let's get the government running again and then you can have your little power war afterwards. We all promise we'll still pay attention to you.

No luck, though. The House GOP is so hamstrung that they've devolved into legislative thumb-twiddling:



The inability to find unifying principles is sometimes in plain view: House Republicans spent two days last week passing legislation that extended the authority of the government’s helium reserves, which Democrats would’ve allowed them to pass by unanimous voice vote.

Given the number of off days they've given themselves, I suppose we should be happy they still show up for work at all."

On the October 2 edition of AM 560's The Big John & Amy Show, co-hosts John Howell and Amy Jacobson interviewed Fox Business' Stuart Varney and asked him about the government shutdown and its effect on workers and the economy. Varney stated, incorrectly, that the shutdown was not having an impact on financial markets or the greater economy before launching into a tirade against federal employees.

HOWELL: Do you think that federal workers, when this ends, are deserving of their back pay or not? VARNEY: That is a loaded question isn't it? You want my opinion? This is President Obama's shutdown. He is responsible for shutting this thing down; he's taken an entirely political decision here. No, I don't think they should get their back pay, frankly, I really don't. I'm sick and tired of a massive, bloated federal bureaucracy living on our backs, and taking money out of us, a lot more money than most of us earn in the private sector, then getting a furlough, and then getting their money back at the end of it. Sorry, I'm not for that. I want to punish these people. Sorry to say that, but that's what I want to do. JACOBSON: But it's not their fault. It's not the federal employees' fault. I mean, that's what I'm sick of, I hate and it makes me anxious, to see people who are victimized because of a political fight. VARNEY: I take your point Amy, it is not directly their fault, but I'm looking at the big picture here. I'm getting screwed. Here I am, a private citizen, paying an inordinate amount of money in tax. I've got a slow economy because it's all government, all the time. And these people are living on our backs, regulating us, telling us what to do, taxing us, taking our money, and living large. This is my chance to say ""hey, I'm fed up with this and I don't miss you when you're on furlough."" Sorry if that's a harsh tone, but that's the way I feel.

I am frankly at a loss for words. Not since Rick Santelli launched his famous diatribe at the government bailout program on CNBC has a right-wing nutjob been so publicly and completely clueless, insensitive and ignorant as Mr. Varney.

Born in England in 1949, he came to the US in 1974. He has worked for Fox, CNN and CNBC and lives in Franklin Lakes, NJ which, according to Wikipedia, has the 18th highest income of the state's 566 municipalities and 146th in Forbes listing of ""America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes"", with a median home price of $1,306,546

I am sure we can all understand the incredible pain and suffering Mr. Varney has had to endure living in these kinds of conditions and how much better off he would be if all federal and state workers simply quit their jobs to make his life happier.

There must be a special place in the Callousness Hall of Fame for Mr. Varney. Perhaps Kossacks can suggest some fitting consequences for his brutal and totally uninformed diatribe."

Pssst. Michele. You might want to pay your staff before they spill even more of your dirty little secrets.

Michelle [sic] Bachmann's high-profile debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, developed an ""unnatural"" and ""Rasputin-like"" relationship with his candidate during her failed 2012 presidential campaign, another former aide told BuzzFeed, a charge O'Donnell denies.

Peter Waldron, her controversial former national field coordinator, told Salon the dispute started when former Iowa straw poll staffers refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would bar them from discussing any “unethical, immoral, or criminal activity” they witnessed on the campaign with police or reporters. [...] Waldron said the staffers are owed a mere $5,000, and that Bachmann has more than $2 million in her campaign account, but has refused to pay unless the staffers sign the agreement.

""He prohibited her husband, Dr. Marcus Bachmann, from sleeping in the same room with wife while on the campaign trail,"" Waldron said in an email to BuzzFeed.

Today in why you shouldn't treat your staff badly, then refuse to pay them when they refuse to retroactively agree to aid and abet your potentially criminal activities , we have this juicy little nugget from Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed:The former aide who's keeping us entertained with the trash-talking is Peter Waldron—the same Peter Waldron who's had an awful lot to say lately about his former employer:Of course, that whole refusing-to-pay-staff thing was last week's news. This week, Waldron is regaling us with tales of how easily Bachmann was apparently brainwashed by her debate coach who, Waldron says, had an ""unusual power over Mrs. Bachmann."" How powerful was he? This powerful:Marcus was no doubt heartbroken about that.

Too bad Michele Bachmann is so busy still trying to repeal Obamacare instead of keeping her former campaign staffers happy. Probably a bad idea to screw them over when they're obviously sitting on a goldmine of gossip—and potentially criminal activities—about the queen of batshit crazy.

Tell the FEC to investigate the alleged crimes of Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign."

Biden:Yes I do. I want to stand by the comment I made. The reason I made the comment was as a warning. I don’t say those things lightly, Chris, you’ve known me for a long time. I was chairman of the judiciary committee for 17 years or its ranking member. I teach separation of powers and constitutional law. This is something I know. So I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I’m going to deliver to the whole United State Senate pointing out the President has no constitutional authority…to take this nation to war against a county of 70 million people unless we’re attacked or unless there is proof we are about to be attacked. And if he does, if he does, I would move to impeach him. The House obviously has to do that but I would lead an effort to impeach him.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Speaker John Boehner

According to the CBO, 1.7 million people would be forced off the rolls in the coming year if the state waivers are repealed as proposed by Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Another 2.1 million would be dropped in 2014 as a result of the tighter eligibility rules backed by the GOP. In both cases, the impact would decline as the economy improves and more jobs become available. But on average, CBO estimates that a total of 2.8 million people would lose their benefits over the next decade, and another 850,000 households will see an average reduction of about $90 a month in benefits.

Yes, the Republican proposal for $40 billion in food stamp cuts over the next 10 years would have horrific effects on millions of people , the dirty hippies over at the Congressional Budget Office confirm:That's 1.7 million people going hungry or being forced onto severely restricted diets, with millions more to come. A $90 cut in the groceries a family can buy in a month is also a Big F'ing Deal, especially for a family that's already pinching every penny to get enough to eat. Taking $90 out of a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program allotment that already only lasts most families two and a half weeks is in itself cruel—and, from the most coldly financial perspective, shortsighted, since forcing people to eat more cheaply means increased risk of diabetes and other chronic conditions that will raise health care costs for the nation.

But this is what Eric Cantor and the starvation caucus of his party want. And even if they can't actually get $40 billion in cuts through the Senate or signed by the president, the farm bill—which nutrition assistance is usually part of and which House Speaker John Boehner isn't sending to conference with the Senate until these cuts get a vote—sure makes a nice hostage to take in the effort to force deeper cuts than either the Senate or the president would want to make.

Please send an email to your member of the House of Representatives, telling him or her to oppose all cuts to food stamps."

The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine places the last version of the Keep America Safe website as June 30, 2013, several weeks prior to Cheney’s announcement, but at a time when buzz was surrounding the chance she’d enter the primary field. Its Twitter account—@KeepAmericaSafe—likewise appears to have had its last tweet around the same time, as the last manual retweet of the account was June 26. The group’s Facebook page has also gone missing, but ThinkProgress is currently unable to tell when that page went dark. Even their Ning, a little used social media connection site, has been taken down.

Hayes Brown points out that the website of Keep America Safe, a lightweight effort to keep alive the legacy of neoconservative Project for a New American Century, has been recently shuttered, along with the organization's Twitter account and Facebook page. The organization was primarily a project of Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol set up in 2009. Cheney announced she will run in the 2014 Wyoming Republican primary against incumbent Mike Enzi. That hasn't made the Wyoming GOP establishment all that happy. But the handwriting was on the wall when Cheney bought a $1.9 million residence in Jackson Hole last year:But the group's YouTube site is still operating if you're eager to see the flavor of what the group is, or was, all about. One of the group's leaders, Debra Burlingame, told Dave Weigel that “we succeeded in accomplishing what we wanted to accomplish.” Other than some generic ultra-hawkish sputtering, it's hard to see what those accomplishments were unless it was to give Cheney another platform from which to hiss the same message dear old dad laid out of us.

At the time Cheney and Kristol launched this project nearly four years ago, I wrote:



Aided by Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot of Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and that old neoconservative standby William Kristol, Keep America Safe will devote itself to persuading us that using waterboarding, building missile umbrellas, keeping detainees at Guantánamo Bay and following an overtly aggressive foreign policy are good things. Dad Cheney must be proud. And mom, too, she of the ahistorical approach to U.S. history. Not that the Cheneys invented American exceptionalism—that deep-seated and self-righteously justified operating perspective that the United States makes the global rules, enforces them but need not follow them when it decides its interests are at stake. Those interests being, most prominently, the bottom-line of corporadoes. That exceptionalist philosophy long preceded the Cheneys' appearance on the world stage.

Why the site would get scrubbed at this juncture is a bit hard to understand. Is young Cheney going to cut herself free of her dad's philosophy that had her just short of calling President Obama a traitor: “I think in fact what President Obama is doing is something that America’s enemies—the Taliban and Al Qaeda—have been unable to do, which is to decimate the fighting capability of this nation.”

Some stuff just can't be scrubbed. But given that the conservative Enzi's not a tea party fire-breather, perhaps Cheney's consultants are urging her to adopt a more moderate stance, at least temporarily. All for the prize: a Senate seat representing fewer citizens than any other state in the nation.

The reason, Boortz said, would be the GOP’s tendency to run on issues related to social conservatism.

Boortz explained the importance to the republic for a GOP win next year while guest hosting Sean Hannity’s Thursday radio show:

This whole thing about Phil Robertson and what have you – it speaks a lot to what we have coming up in the election next year. We desperately need to get the Democrats out of control of the United States Senate. The survival of our republic may depend on getting the Democrats out of control of the Senate, sending Harry Reid into the position of minority leader in the U.S. Senate – the survival of the republic may depend on that. And the Democrats are afraid that is indeed what is going to happen. That is why Harry Reid pulled the nuclear option a couple of weeks ago – because they were afraid we may lose the Senate.

However, Boortz admitted he did not think the Republican Party would succeed in saving the republic because it could not resist the temptation to run on social issues in the upcoming midterms.

Let me tell you what I think is going to happen – I don’t think the Republicans are going to take the Senate next year. They’ll keep the House, but they’re not going to get the Senate and I’ll tell you why – because they simply cannot resist the urge, the impulse to get into this social conservatism. The Republicans can’t run on fiscal responsibility. The Republicans, they can’t get out there and say, ‘Look, we are trillions of dollars in debt.’ They can’t stick to that. They can’t say, ‘We need private sector options to ObamaCare that can give people choices in the private marketplace.’ They can’t do that. They can’t stick to fiscal conservatism. They can’t stick to the small government message. The Republicans have this drive, this maniacal, this obsessive drive to get into social conservatism.

Boortz pointed to the race for the seat currently occupied by outgoing Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA). He noted that it could be a loss for the GOP should they nominate Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) in a contest that might have Michelle Nunn, daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA), as the Democratic opponent.

Memories...

Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, has infuriated Democrats this week by commandeering the Senate floor, demanding a vote on his amendment repealing federal contributions to help pay for lawmakers’ health care coverage. But Democratic senators are preparing a legislative response targeting a sordid Vitter episode. If Vitter continues to insist on a vote on his proposal, Democrats could counter with one of their own: Lawmakers will be denied those government contributions if there is “probable cause” they solicited prostitutes. According to draft legislation obtained by POLITICO, Democrats are weighing whether to force a Senate vote on a plan that would effectively resurrect Vitter’s past if the conservative Republican continues to press forward with his Obamacare-bashing proposal.

Recall the latest GOP game to embarrass Democrats over Obamacare and threaten shutting down the government? Central to this effort is a Republican senator who should know something about public embarrassment, Louisiana's David Vitter. He's held up Senate work for a week, as it's tried to pass an energy bill, by insisting on his Obamacare amendment. For once, Democrats are playing some hardball in return, and have decided to show the good senator that the game works both ways.One word: diapers.

That'd be a nice reminder for everyone, as Vitter contemplates a run for governor of Louisiana in 2015. For right now he's all bluster, saying this is Harry Reid ""acting like an old-time Vegas mafia thug, and a desperate one at that."" But all that bluster might not be backed up by Vitter's fellow Republicans, who might not want to champion their sleazy colleague on the Senate floor.

Stand with Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in denouncing Republicans and their childish Obamacare games."

Wow, that was quick.

It took Sen. John McCain, the straight-talking maverick from Arizona, eight long years—between the presidential campaigns of 2000 and 2008—to be transformed from media darling to media target. But for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the process was completed in a political nanosecond.

Less than two months after his landslide reelection, in which he beat Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by a 21-point margin, the Republican governor is undergoing the sort of media metamorphosis that sometimes befalls popular statewide politicians who dare to think of themselves as future presidents.

To paraphrase Franz Kafka, Christie awoke one morning last week and, reading the front page of The New York Times, discovered that he’d been changed into a giant bully. In his new media incarnation, he was suddenly a politician who wreaks petty revenge and humiliation on any poor soul who is unwise enough to cross him, and who countenanced the closure of two local access lanes of the George Washington Bridge, causing vehicular chaos for four days in Fort Lee, N.J., where the Democratic mayor had declined to endorse him.

This, for a public official who previously had been portrayed in the national media as a truth-telling, tough-talking executive who was willing to reach across the aisle to get things done.

Arguably worse, Double Down, a book about the 2012 campaign released in early November, just as Christie was racking up his 60-percent vote total, depicted the governor previously celebrated for uncompromising honesty as a possibly shady New Jersey pol who’d done lucrative backroom favors for political allies, lobbied for the business interests of Bernie Madoff and his ilk, lacked that ineffable quality called “presidential temperament,” and freely spent the taxpayer’s dime for his own personal aggrandizement, among other disturbing details reportedly uncovered by Mitt Romney’s vice presidential vetting team.

He was also, Romney’s vetters are said to have concluded, alarmingly obese—although the governor has been noticeably slimming down since his lap-band surgery in June.

Story continues

The good news for Team Christie is that the media’s alterations on Christie’s portrait have yet to make a dent in his popularity among voters. The latest CNN poll has the governor running well ahead of other likely contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination, even beating Hillary Clinton by a sliver in a hypothetical head-to-head. That fact alone permits Christie loyalists to greet the new negativity with a healthy degree of sangfroid.

“The governor is not a complete stranger to intense scrutiny and coverage and is not surprised by it,” says a Christie aide, noting that the boss has had the national spotlight trained on him from the moment he campaigned for fellow Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, through the endless speculation about his 2012 plans and his much-analyzed keynote speech to the GOP convention in Tampa. “The other thing he’s not surprised by is when media outlets and Democratic organizations make him a target.”

The Christie aide added: “When you’ve had success like he has had, there comes a degree of scrutiny and also attacks from outside forces with political motivations. The fact that there is already a greater degree of scrutiny isn’t a surprise either. The governor himself said recently, ‘We’re not in Kansas anymore.’ ”

Christie made his little quip, acknowledging the intrusion of presidential politics, during a news conference at which the bridge snafu was front and center. He was suspected but never quite implicated in the nasty business, and the smoking traffic cones were instead laid at the feet of Christie appointees who couldn’t be shown to have consulted the governor, let alone taken orders from him, before acting possibly on their own.

“It’s all a setup,” says Michael Steele, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee when Christie first ran for governor in 2009. “It plays itself out in a variety of ways, sometimes aided by the main target, sometimes by subordinates or opposition camps. There’s a tendency to reach that turning point so that the knives come out and the new narrative begins.”

In what amounts to Steele’s political-literary analysis, the current storyline began in November 2012, when Christie disappointed the Romney campaign and enraged fellow Republicans—but charmed the East Coast media establishment—by embracing President Obama in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. “The political leadership on the left, and even some on the right, were enamored of this man and his style and his ability to cut through the BS and tell it like it is,” Steele says. “How saucy, how sexy, how wonderful for politics!”

Then came Christie’s universally predicted reelection victory, which the media treated as big news portending bright prospects for higher office. And then…

“Since this past November, you have seen the slow and steady drumbeat of degradation,” Steele says. “It’s the media’s and the Democrats’ effort to take down that which they summarily have built up and to begin to carve into bite-size chunks a narrative that will unfold itself over the next year in preparation for the 2016 cycle.”

The irony, Steele says, is that “Chris Christie is the same guy today as he was when he sat in my office when I was national chairman during his first bid for the governorship of New Jersey…He’s still the same breath of fresh air, the same guy who can create a new narrative for the Republican Party and the country, which is longing and starving for it. So, for me, this is just unbelievable bullshit, and it says to me that there are interests in the media and in politics who don’t want the status quo to change, and who actually like this red/blue politics crisis-management model.”

Democratic media consultant Jimmy Siegel, who is no fan of Christie and believes that he probably is a bully, concurs with a central theme of Steele’s analysis—that much of the recent unflattering coverage is being influenced, if not orchestrated, by Democratic operatives.

“Now they’re going after him,” Siegel says. “I think they read the polls like everyone else, and they want people to see him as something different from the straight-talking lung-to-tongue guy who tells it the way it is and is willing to reach across the aisle. So now they’re portraying the more unsavory aspects of his character.”

Siegel theorizes that Christie, who has handled the bridge flap with admirable restraint, might ultimately revert to form and damage himself in an angry explosion. “If there is any politician who is susceptible to an ‘A Few Good Men’ moment—the Jack Nicholson character who is put under so much pressure that he will lash out at any moment—it’s Christie. And his opponents are hoping that will happen. It hasn’t so far.”

Steele, too, cautions that Christie should exercise discipline and not do anything that could fuel new headlines. “You can become your own worst enemy in these narratives to prove a point, and come out on the other end not smelling or looking as good as you think you should,” Steele says. “You’ve got to be careful you don’t create new negative narratives going forward.”

Republican consultant E. O’Brien Murray, who argues that Christie’s Sandy embrace of Barack Obama will be featured in far more GOP primary attack ads than charges of bullying, says there might even be an upside to the current negative portrayals of the governor in the so-called “lamestream media.”

For conservative primary voters in, say, Iowa—who might be naturally suspicious of a middle-of-the-road Northeastern Republican—unfavorable media coverage “might create a halo over his head,” Murray says. “It certainly helped Ronald Reagan, who always said that when The New York Times agreed with him, it was a bad day.”

He used to almost cast himself as the conservative alternative. But I don't think Boehner is seriously threatened. He won't be threatened so long as he goes along with conservatives in the House. He listens to them. He follows their advice. He’s often led by them. And as long as that’s true, how will there ever be a coup attempt? Boehner got so burned by the fiscal cliff that he’s been defanged. There’s no talk now about mounting a coup against him because he never goes against the right. The other candidates you hear about, like Tom Cole or Paul Ryan or Eric Cantor or Kevin McCarthy, you don't hear them clamoring for the job, because they'd have to handle the same situation."

Palin said Obama promised the most transparent administration ever but has been mired in crony capitalism and has not even passed a budget. She said refusing to pass a budget is not “just bureaucratic bungling,” it is “refusing to declare what” Obama intends to do with the people’s money.

“Barack Obama, you lie!” Palin said of Obama’s transparency claims.

On background checks for guns, Palin said, “Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.”

She said “bad guys who ignore the laws” will not follow new laws when it comes to gun control legislation Democrats want enacted. She blistered liberals for over-simplifying the causes of gun-related crimes.

“Saying a chunk of metal did the crime is like saying the fork made me fat,” Palin said.

She mocked the mainstream media for gathering again to write their “conservatives in crisis” stories.

Palin had some harsh words Obama’s lack of leadership and the lack of leaders in Washington.

She said there is a “direct correlation between the Senate’s stubbornly refusing to pass a budget and selfishly agreeing to spend our children’s and our grandchildren’s money.”

“No budget is no leadership,” Palin said. “It’s time for America to be more outraged about this.”

She said America faces challenges “so big” while its leaders are so small.

Palin called Obama a campaigner who makes promises he can’t keep and seeks to divide and conquer while orchestrating crisis after crisis to exploit for political gain.

“We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television,” Palin said.

Palin said everything coming out of Washington, D.C. feels put-on and every event feels calculated to fool Americans.

She blistered the permanent political class for focusing too much on the process of politics instead of the purpose of politics, which is to lead and serve. She resoundingly mocked Obama as a permanent campaigner even though he is not up for reelection anymore.

“Now step away from the Teleprompter, and do your job,” Palin said to Obama."

Um, me? I wonder how many folks within the White House, gaming out whether Republicans might not just call the bluff, bothered to consider the fact that an embrace of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs is a key component of hardcore conservative ideology. [...] Did anyone in the White House notice how many conservatives, including ones in positions of governmental power, after Mitt Romney’s recorded back-room admission that he couldn’t get elected because 47 percent of the electorate is addicted to suckling on the federal teat, responded that what he said was absolutely correct? [...] And what could the White House have predicted conservatives would say to those who point out that pulling the rug out from under huge chunks of federal spending will spur a recession? They could have predicted that many would say exactly what they have said: that since it’s excessive federal spending that causes recessions, what’s wrong with cutting excessive federal spending?

Bottom line: didn’t anyone whose job it is to think about such things consider that at least some powerful Republicans—not all, it is true—would relish sequestration as a marvelous thing, a historic opportunity, a gift from Obama to help further the cause they’d been proclaiming as sacred for generations: to shrink the federal government small enough so they could someday drown it in Grover Norquist’s proverbial bathtub? “Once these cuts take effect, thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off and tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids,” said Obama. Did he ever consider that to a lot of Republicans, that would sound like a wish list?"

Abortion has to be made funny, the thinking goes, because funny sells on social media, and that’s where one goes to court young people. “You can engage with sarcasm, it’s hard with the abortion issue, but you have to,” said Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins at a breakout panel at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington today on how to win millennial voters. “Unfortunately we have to, because this is the generation that we’ve been dealt.”

So the way to convince young Americans to join the Republican Party is to make abortion hilarious. Or at least be sarcastic about it. Your abortion-related humor will then get the young folks these days to realize that you are hip and with it and that they really want on board with that whole Gilead-patterened premise of social conservative religious rule, aka Jesus Sharia.

You know something? Screw it. You go for it, folks. I would have paid solid pay-per-view prices to see Mitt Romney standing at the Republican National Convention plastering the audience with some truly top-notch abortion jokes. How many abortions does it take to change a light bulb? A priest, a rabbi and an abortion walk into a bar, and the priest says hey pal, you're an abomination, I can't believe they let you in here. You know, humor.

The premise apparently extends to being anti-gay-marriage as well; nothing attracts the young folks like treating gay people like dirt while also making jokes about it on Twitter. Unfortunately, those ""young people"" are about 12 years old, so they'll have to figure out a way to keep them occupied until voting age. Maybe some fetus-related puppet shows or something.

In the meantime, I think we all need to start preparing an escape plan. The moon is far too boring, and Mars might take a long, long time to terraform, but we've got to at least start considering our options. We're nearing maximum crackpot. This thing's about to go supernova."

Left in place, however, are measures that restrict early voting and absentee ballots, as well as a requirement that all voters must sign the poll book. These measures increase the amount voters who must vote in person as well as increase the actual amount of time poll workers need to spend with each voter. Of course, this increases the lines of people who vote, further discouraging those with busy schedules or in crowded voting precincts. And that's the intent of those laws - to suppress the vote in Democratic areas.

That wasn't enough for Republicans, though. Their brand new shiny voter suppression bill removes ALL weekend voting (their limitation to 1 weekend from 3 in 2011 wasn't restrictive enough to prevent electoral wins by Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama in 2012) and restricts early voting to ONE WEEK and ONLY during the hours of 7:30 AM - 5 PM (that'll show those folks who try to vote before or after work).

Not only that, but anyone without that ID needs to sign an affidavit that they're indigent and their ""vote"" is not guaranteed to be counted. A person who doesn't have the time to go during work hours to get that ID, has no transportation to a DMV for that ID, or who can't obtain the documents necessary for the ID will have to declare their indigent and possibly get their vote tossed if they aren't.

So, here we go again.

On top of all of this, they want to make the Chief Justice position based on the election of the fellow justices (currently it's the most senior Justice and has been done that way for more than 100 years). Naturally, they want to impose the will of the RW 4 of 7 justices who have bought their seats instead of having moderate Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson as the Chief based on her long history of service on the State Supreme Court.

And they've also succeeded in changing the reasons for recall to the reasons Scott Walker cited during his own recall. There has been no reason necessary other than the will of the voters. Now the recalled official must be charged and/or convicted of a felony or ethics violation. This would make it impossible for Walker to have politically profited from the voter anger that made him Milwaukee County Executive had it been in effect 15 years ago. It would also make it impossible for us to recall anyone for malfeasance in office or anything outside of criminal behavior.

I think we be ""safe"" from them for the next year. They're done with their extremism until after the next election because they can't count on the poor memories of Wisconsinites or the power of their massive money to ensure their re-election.

They know no bottom and know no shame.

(CNN) - Sen. Ted Cruz has hired lawyers to help him get rid of his Canadian citizenship, the Republican from Texas told the Dallas Morning News in an interview published online Saturday night.

""I have retained counsel that is preparing the paperwork to renounce the citizenship,"" he said, adding he expects the process to be completed in 2014.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

His office also confirmed the decision to CNN.

Cruz has said in the past he planned to renounce his citizenship, but his latest remarks represent concrete steps he's taking to actively do so.

The first-term senator has said before that he wasn't aware he was still legally tied to Canada until the Dallas newspaper raised the issue in August, quoting legal experts who said the potential presidential candidate was technically a dual citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.

United States law states that anyone born to a U.S. parent in another country is born as a U.S. citizen.

But, like in the U.S., Canada's laws state that anyone born inside its borders automatically becomes a Canadian citizen.

""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said in a statement in August.

Cruz told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley at the time he would attempt to renounce his Canadian citizenship.

""Serving as a U.S. senator, I think it's appropriate that I be only an American,"" he said.

Cruz told the Dallas Morning News that the topic came up when he met last month with real estate titan Donald Trump, who was known as one of the leading voices in the ""birther"" movement that questioned whether President Barack Obama was a U.S. citizen.

Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011, proving that he was born in Hawaii and largely putting to rest speculation about his citizenship.

Cruz did not go into detail about the meeting with Trump, saying only that the topic was not discussed in ""any significant respect.""

A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately return a request for comment about Trump's conversation with Cruz."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/john-boehner-right-wing-groups_n_4445626.html,2013-12-14 00:00:00,['Senior Congressional Reporter'],John Boehner's Budget Outburst Shows Right-Wing Groups Have Jumped The Shark,"WASHINGTON -- With an emphatic ""Are you kidding me?!"" aimed at right-wing Washington groups, House Speaker John Boehner this week may have finally pronounced the verdict that activist outfits, prosperous amid the tea party movement, have jumped the shark.

The Ohio Republican lashed out twice at organizations that have invited themselves to the tea party since 2009, blasting groups like Club for Growth, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks and others on Wednesday as ""ridiculous"" for opposing a bipartisan budget deal before they even saw it.

And Thursday he declared, albeit two months after the fact, his stunned disbelief that some of their leaders admitted they knew their bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government last fall would fail. Boehner accused them of ""misleading their followers,"" and using House Republicans and the American people to promote themselves.

""Frankly, I just think they've lost all credibility,"" Boehner told reporters at his weekly news conference.

Maybe they have, and maybe they haven't. But Boehner was at least declaring war on the well-funded agitators who have given him agita for three years. And he marked the 16-day government shutdown showdown as the moment they hopped over the line to absurdity -- much the way the aging TV show ""Happy Days,"" stretching for fresh plot lines, infamously put the leather-jacketed character ""Fonzie"" on water skis to leap a man-eater.

The question now is whether Boehner's outburst -- and more importantly the subsequent overwhelming vote for the budget deal -- means the influence of such outside groups will simply collapse, or whether it will limp along for years like the old '70s sitcom did.

Few senators leaving the Capitol Friday (the House already had recessed for vacation) were willing to answer that question directly, but some seemed to suggest that such organizations would no longer have as easy a time reaching out to scuttle key deals, as they did during the October shutdown battle.

""I think many people are realizing that many of the outside groups exist for one reason, and that is to raise money,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told HuffPost, echoing Boehner's charge. ""They have nothing to do with policy -- never did. If the goal posts are set, they'll move 'em … There's almost nothing that can be done to satisfy some of the groups.

""I think that people have begun to see through the antics of many of these groups,"" Corker added.

The issue is especially relevant -- and fraught -- for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who runs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which could win back the Senate by netting six seats in 2014. The NRSC can fairly blame tea party candidates for costing them at least five seats in the previous two election cycles, including Nevada in 2010 and Indiana in 2012. To avoid a replay, it must deal with primary challenges in seven or eight contests, and secure candidates with crossover appeal against the many red state Democrats they've targeted.

On the one hand, Moran wants the energy the tea party brought in 2010. On the other, he doesn't want all-or-nothing candidates who embrace the shutdown model.

""Hard for me to ever complain that Americans get involved in our government and encourage us to do things, one way or the other. I'm for more participation, not less,"" Moran said. But he added that while lawmakers should listen to outside interest groups, ""we need to make certain that we don't make decisions based upon that alone.""

For the 2014 contests, that means Moran will do what he can to ensure tea party purity is not the litmus test. ""What I'm hoping is that people will decide that they are interested in supporting a candidate that can win not just a primary, but also a general election,"" he said.

He doesn't believe -- and neither apparently does Boehner -- that most voters want absolutist politicians.

""I think there's a large group of American people, voters, who are interested in seeing this place work, seeing the Senate and House function, who dislike the constant political bickering that goes on here,"" Moran said. ""We at every opportunity -- without foregoing our principles -- ought to demonstrate that we can govern.""

Moran said he didn't like the budget deal that made the GOP strife so prominent this week, but he also did not say that he would try to obstruct the deal the way many Republicans -- led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- did during the October showdown.

Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action -- the campaign arm of the Heritage Foundation -- denied it was more interested in itself, asserting that the organization's efforts were indeed about promoting conservative policy.

""We just want to make sure lawmakers are having an honest, fact-based discussion with their constituents,"" Holler said.

And he argued the influence of groups like his merely suffered a dip during the House passage of the budget bill they robustly oppose. ""I do think there was an element of fatigue here in Washington, where people were tired, and that tends to happen, but then the American people are tired of Washington,"" Holler said.



He predicted that the conservative base would come around to the organization's way of thinking on the budget agreement, and that Republican lawmakers would have trouble explaining why they were willing to trade across-the-board spending cuts in 2014 and 2015 for proposed cuts in 2022 and 2023.

""If they can explain that to their constituents, then they're in good shape. If they can't explain it to their constituents, chances are they're going to have a little bit of trouble,"" Holler said.

A more telling moment than this week's House budget vote (and next week's in the Senate), he said, would come in January when lawmakers have to pass the $1.012 trillion spending bill the budget prescribes.

""It'll be an interesting dynamic, and I think when this comes to a head will be in January,"" Holler said. ""That sort of massive bill rolling through a Republican-controlled House is going to be really painful for a lot of these guys.""

And he predicted that if the GOP leaders ignored the disapproving opinions of the outside groups, conservative voters would see that as a betrayal they would remember next fall.

""The reason what we say matters, the reason what Club (for Growth) says matters, the reason why FreedomWorks has influence is because people outside of Washington trust us. And those conservative activists are also voters and constituents,"" Holler said.

""These conservative activists are smart, and they tend not to forget when they're cast aside,"" he added. ""There's a whole lot of open questions here about how is this going to play out in 2014.""

At least some outside Republican consultants think Boehner essentially answered those questions by declaring Republicans would no longer be slaves to self-appointed guardians of conservative doctrine and their vote scorecard. The speaker had to go along with the fall shutdown strategy to show once and for all that the path of the outside groups leads to a dead end, they said.

""I think that once they headed down that road in September, that [Boehner] decided the only thing he could do was give them all the rope he could,"" said long-time GOP operative Rich Galen, with the implicit idea that the groups hung themselves in what turned out to a deeply unpopular gambit.

Boehner's dramatic denunciation served not just to say he was back in charge, but also to tell the broader spectrum of voters and major donors that they could trust the GOP again, Galen said.

""I think it's less Fonzie, and I would look at it more as a Sister Souljah moment,"" Galen said, referring to then-Arkasas Gov. Bill Clinton's calculated denunciation of rap artist Sista Souljah in 1992 when he wanted to reassure moderates he wasn't a left-wing ideologue.

But Galen also suggested the ""Happy Days"" comparison is correct, in that there's no un-jumping the shark of the government shutdown.

""It's the peak of their influence, not just with the tea party members,"" Galen said. ""Their influence over legislation is probably permanently damaged.""

Editor’s Note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, “Patriots,” and a post-election e-book, “Why Romney Lost.” Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.

(CNN) —

“Do the Republican and Democratic parties do an adequate job of representing the American people, or do they do such a poor job that a third major party is required?”

A record 60% of Americans now yearn for a third major party, according to Gallup. Independents, unsurprisingly, are most likely to favor a third party, but a majority of self-described Republicans say yes, too. But what do they mean by that “yes”?

Obviously, they mean many different things. Some yearn for a third party representing the Michael Bloomberg center: fiscally conservative and socially liberal like the New York City mayor.

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

But here’s a caution about third parties in American history: They are much more likely to arise on the fringes of the political system, not the center. America has seen third-party efforts by socialists and segregationists; by right-to-lifers and libertarians.

This is why you now hear so much “third party” talk coming from tea party Republicans rather than (as you might expect) the party’s subordinated pragmatists. The sensible center is much more likely to exert itself inside existing parties, as Dwight Eisenhower did for Republicans in the 1950s and as Bill Clinton did for the Democrats in the 1990s.

Pragmatists want to change the GOP so that it can win elections and govern effectively. Tea party Republicans prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences, which is why the Pew survey in September found that 71% of them favored a government shutdown even though nearly 40% of them expected that shutdown to have a “major” impact on the economy.

Third-party threats frighten Republican leaders. They remember that Ross Perot’s independent challenge badly hurt George H.W. Bush’s re-election campaign in 1992.

Canadian conservatives were locked out of power for nearly 15 years by a party split in the 1990s. British Conservatives fear that a rise in support for the United Kingdom Independence Party could drain support from Britain’s Conservative-Liberal governing coalition.

Yet politics is a complicated business, and it’s not always true that a party is weakened by the departure of its most extreme supporters.

Consider, for example, the case of the Democratic Party in the election of 1948. That year, the Democrats faced two groups that bolted.

To protest President Harry Truman’s turn to support civil rights, southern Democrats coalesced as a “States’ Rights” party and nominated South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond for president.

Left-liberal Democrats angered by Truman’s tough Cold War foreign policy created an “American Labor” party and nominated former vice president Henry Wallace.

Together, Thurmond and Wallace took almost 5% of the vote in 1948. Thurmond carried four Deep South states and 7% of the Electoral College.

Yet Truman survived. In fact, there’s a reasonable argument that Truman was actually helped by these third- and fourth-party challenges.

In 1948, African-Americans remained very much a swing constituency. Hundreds of thousands of black Americans had moved north and gained voting rights in the 30 years between 1917 and 1948. As a group, they tended to prefer the New Deal policies of the Democratic Party, but they deeply distrusted that party’s Southern white supremacist wing.

Truman was a card-carrying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans who had adopted the civil rights cause late in his career. Could he really be trusted? Truman’s willingness to face down Thurmond convinced many Northern blacks that he could be. He carried an estimated 77% of the black vote in the North, and those votes provided the margin of victory in the three crucial states of California, Illinois and Ohio. Those three states provided 73 electoral votes in total, and they were each won by Truman with a margin of less than 1%.

Meanwhile, the Wallace challenge helped Truman with more conservative voters. Truman had initiated the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift, yet some questioned whether the Democrats were tough enough on communism – an important question among voters of eastern European origin in states like Wisconsin and Michigan.

With Wallace vehemently denouncing Truman as too tough on the Soviet Union – sometimes in speeches that echoed the editorials of the newspaper of the American Communist Party – Truman gained the same kind of political cover on his right flank that Thurmond had provided him on his left.

The result, everybody knows.

Right now, tea party extremism contaminates the whole Republican brand. It’s a very interesting question whether a tea party bolt from the GOP might not just liberate the party to slide back to the political center – and liberate Republicans from identification with the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles.

It’s worth repeating over and over again. Add Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Joe Miller in Alaska – and you have half a dozen Senate races lost to the GOP by extremist nominations.

Maybe the right answer to the threat, “Shut down the government or we quit” is: “So sad you feel that way. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”

The House has listened to the American people.”

That’s what Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said at the GOP’s victory rally Friday after the House voted to pass a spending bill that cut all funding for the president’s healthcare law — and took the country one step closer to a government shutdown on Oct. 1.

The American people, alas, weren’t in the room to speak for themselves. But was Boehner right about their desires? Polls show that most Americans are, not surprisingly, divided.

Yes, a majority doesn’t like Obamacare. They’re unsure about what it will do and worried that it might make their healthcare worse. But do they really want to defund the law, and risk the chaos of a government shutdown to do it? Probably not, most polls suggest.

As one Republican pollster told me, though a majority of voters don’t like Obamacare, they’re not angry enough about it to risk a fiscal crisis that could hurt the economy.

So why are Republican lawmakers hearing a different message? Because most of them represent districts so conservative that they are listening only to their own choir. “It’s clear where the public in my district is,” said Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), a tea party firebrand. “They want Obamacare repealed. They want it defunded. They want it dismantled.”

Bridenstine, a Navy Reserve pilot from Tulsa, is probably right. In his solidly Republican district, Mitt Romney won two-thirds of the vote in the last presidential election.

A visit to the House side of Capitol Hill these days feels a bit like an excursion to an alternate universe, where the voters are all conservative, the will of the American people is crystal clear and the only mystery is how that Obama fellow ever got reelected.

“This is all a result of redistricting,” a Republican strategist told me. “The only election these guys have to worry about is the Republican primary. The only danger they face is from the right.”

According to ratings compiled by Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, only 28 of the House’s 233 Republicans have even a theoretical chance of losing their seats to a Democrat next year; the other 205 are safe as long as they win their primaries. (The same is true of most House Democrats, of course.)

Outside the conservative bubble of the House GOP conference, the politics of the budget standoff look different. Karl Rove, former political advisor to George W. Bush, has warned that the only winner in a government shutdown would be Obama. “This is one thing that can rescue him,” Rove said on Fox News.

In the Senate, Republicans acknowledge there is almost no chance of passing legislation to defund Obamacare, the president’s most cherished achievement. Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the loudest champion of the defund Obamacare movement, agreed on that last week, landing him in hot water with the House conservatives he was urging to plunge ahead.

The entire strategy, warned Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is “a box canyon” for Republicans — a trap with no way out but retreat.

Cruz and other tea party senators have vowed to filibuster to block the Senate from approving a spending bill that doesn’t defund Obamacare, but Senate rules make that difficult. So the Senate is expected to strip the Obamacare provision and kick the bill back to the House, where Boehner and his Republicans will consider their next move.

They might make a dignified retreat and pass the Senate version before the Sept. 30 deadline. Or, more likely, they might engage in another round of legislative pingpong, in which doomed proposals bounce between the two branches of Congress as the clock runs out. One veteran budget guru, Stan Collender of Qorvis Communications, puts the chances of a government shutdown at 70%.

And that’s not even the worst possible outcome. Boehner and his lieutenants have told House members that the current battle over the spending bill is only a preliminary bout. The real fight, they’ve said, will be over the debt ceiling — the government’s authority to borrow money to pay its bills, which is expected to run out in October or November,

Once again, conservatives have begun telling one another that the American people would welcome the crisis if it resulted in less federal spending and the end of Obamacare. They argue that a debt-ceiling standoff wouldn’t force the federal government to default on its debts and throw the world economy into crisis; the Treasury, they say, could keep paying bondholders and stop most of its other checks. Even if that were possible (and the Treasury Department says it isn’t), the world’s lenders would almost certainly downgrade Uncle Sam’s credit rating, imposing higher interest costs on the federal budget for years to come.

This may sound like just another round of Washington’s recurring impasse, but this time the prospects for a quick solution look worse. The Republicans have chosen to demand the one concession Obama is least likely to make: the crippling of Obamacare. And the GOP’s chief deal maker, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is battling a primary challenge on his right, which means he’s not eager to play the role of middleman this year.

When Boehner described what the American people want from Congress, he left one thing out: They also want their government to solve problems, even if that sometimes requires an uncomfortable dose of compromise. They aren’t seeing much of that from the House of Representatives this year.

House speaker%2C GOP chairman say language is %27offensive%27

GOP trying to improve standing with Hispanics%2C who strongly supported President Obama

Congressman said he used %27poor choice of words%27

WASHINGTON — GOP Rep. Don Young of Alaska apologized Friday for using a racial slur to describe migrant farmworkers after being denounced by top Republicans for ""offensive"" language as the party tries to boost its standing with Hispanics.

""I apologize for the insensitive term,"" Young, a House member since 1973, said in a statement. ""There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words.""

In an interview this week with an Alaska radio station, Young used the word ""wetbacks"" and said the term had been commonly used when he was growing up on a ranch in central California. He issued a statement late Thursday saying he had ""meant no disrespect,"" but the reaction throughout the day had been heated from both parties — particularly from his own Republican leadership.

House Speaker John Boehner, Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn and Sen. John McCain, a leader in the Senate's efforts to rewrite immigration laws, all chided Young for his language and said it had no place in the Republican Party. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Xavier Becerra of California were among the Democratic leaders to criticize Young.

Boehner in particular was incensed, saying Young's remarks were ""offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds."" The House's top Republican said there was ""no excuse,"" and the language warranted ""an immediate apology.""

Young, 79, said Friday the word he used ""and the negative attitudes that come with it should be left in the 20th century.""

His timing was bad. A bipartisan group of senators and House members plans to unveil bills in April that would dramatically revamp the nation's immigration laws and include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the USA.

The Republican National Committee (RNC) is spending $10 million starting this year on outreach efforts to minorities, women and gay voters as the party seeks to become more inclusive and welcoming. The new outreach is the result of the GOP's scathing post-election ""autopsy"" report, which noted that much work needs to be done to attract Hispanics. In the last election, President Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote.

Earlier in the day, Priebus said Young's original words ""emphatically do not represent the beliefs of the Republican Party.""

""As I have continued to say, everyone in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,"" he said. ""Our party represents freedom and opportunity for every American and a beacon of hope to those seeking liberty throughout the world.""

Cornyn, R-Texas, noted that migrant workers come to America looking for ways to improve their lives and those of their families.

""They do not come to this country to hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials,"" Cornyn said. ""The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity.""

Members of Congress drafting immigration legislation are considering the number of work visas granted to immigrants in several areas of the economy, including high-tech workers, agricultural workers and lower-skilled fields. Many of those visas would end up going to people from Mexico, Central and South America.

Young said he was ""sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.""

Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said an immigration overhaul will be possible only through bipartisanship. He noted that Young, who has served beside many Hispanics in his decades in Congress, ""should know terms like 'wetback' have never been acceptable.""

""Now, more than ever, we must resolve the many issues of our broken immigration system,"" Hinojosa said. ""But as we move forward, it's important that our Republican colleagues are mindful of how words have consequences. When elected officials use racial slurs, it sets back our nation and sets back legislators who are seriously working toward real, bipartisan solutions.""

Lisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group, said she is heartened that GOP leaders were quick to denounce Young. She said the use of such a slur coming from a Republican in this day and age highlights the challenge for the GOP.

""It's an education issue,"" she said. ""It's not a matter of being nicer. They've got some fundamental work to do to educate their party.""

Critics of a possible U.S. military intervention in Syria say any potential campaign would be a serious gamble for American interests. But for John McCain, the high stakes were apparently centered on his iPhone after McCain was photographed playing a game of video poker during Tuesday’s Senate hearings on Syria.

“Scandal! Caught playing iPhone game at 3+ hour Senate hearing - worst of all I lost!” McCain wrote to his 1,822,263 Twitter followers after the photo, taken by the Washington Post, began making the rounds on social media.

Despite laughing off the incident, McCain’s poker moment has made him the target of criticism from war opponents and landed him front and center on the Drudge Report.

McCain has quickly become the most prominent supporter of President Barack Obama’s call for military action against the Syrian regime after the government of Bashar Assad allegedly used chemical weapons against civilians.

On Monday, McCain said a vote against Obama’s military proposal would be “catastrophic” for U.S. interests.

McCain is no stranger to card games. A 2008 report from The New York Times noted McCain’s long-standing ties to the gambling industry.

And with his support for a congressional resolution authorizing military action already a given, it’s perhaps understandable why McCain was easily distracted during Tuesday’s testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey.

It’s unclear exactly when McCain was caught playing the video poker game. But it wouldn’t be a shock if his attention were diverted during Hagel’s testimony. After all, Hagel and McCain publicly feuded in January when Hagel was confirmed to his post.

McCain's poker playing has already resulted in some humorous responses on social media, including a photo illustration placing the Arizona senator in one of the famous “dogs playing poker” paintings.

USA TODAY

GOP party leaders%2C moderates vow %22never again%22

Sen. Ted Cruz says his party caved too soon

Battles over taxes%2C spending%2C immigration loom

WASHINGTON — Republicans began a new week pointing fingers at each other Sunday following a 16-day government shutdown and near-default that left the nation worse off and the GOP taking most of the blame.

If there was a theme to the round of Sunday morning talk shows looking back at the fiasco, it was the determination of most Republicans — from Senate leaders to past and potential future presidential candidates — to move on rather than focus on this month's failed battles.

Sen. John McCain called the effort to defund President Obama's health care expansion ""a fool's errand."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed there will be no more government shutdowns. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush accused the party of stepping on its message.

""There will not be another government shutdown. You can count on that,"" McConnell said on CBS' Face the Nation. ""Shutting down the government, in my view, is not conservative policy.""

""What we need to do is move forward with immigration reform, get a positive agenda for America,"" said McCain, the party's 2008 presidential candidate, on CNN's State of the Union.

""Obamacare, flawed to its core, doesn't work,"" said Bush, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, on ABC.'s This Week. ""But we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message.""

That left Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who instigated the government crisis by demanding an end to Obamacare and getting the Tea Party faction among House Republicans to go along, in a somewhat lonely position — at least in the nation's capital.

Appearing on CNN and on ABC, the freshman senator blamed fellow Republicans for dooming the effort by speaking out against it rather than uniting behind it.

""I think it was unfortunate that you saw multiple members of the Senate Republicans going on television attacking House conservatives, attacking the effort to defund Obamacare, saying it cannot win, it's a fool's errand, we will lose, this must fail,"" Cruz said. ""That is a recipe for losing the fight, and it's a shame.""

Neither Cruz nor McConnell went after each other personally, but their sentiments were clear. McConnell, as he has done before, compared a second government shutdown following the one engineered by upstart Republicans in 1995-96 to a second kick of a mule. Cruz defended it as a valuable weapon in a tactical war.

There was little support for Cruz among other Republicans appearing on TV Sunday. Two fellow conservatives, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Roy Blunt of Missouri, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should testify before Congress on Obamacare but should not – at least not yet — be forced to resign, as Cruz and some other Republicans have suggested.

And Bush said the GOP needs to ""show a little self-restraint"" and let Obamacare play out, particularly since its government website has left thousands of Americans unable to sign up for health coverage."

Mr. Christie wanted Mr. Rosenthal to vote for the map put forward by the Republicans on the commission, but instead he chose the Democrats’ plan, saying it offered more stability.

She has since deleted the tweet, but the Sunlight Foundation’s “Politwoops,” which preserves tweets politicians have deleted, has the retweet on its website:

“RT @PaulSteel4: @nancymace we support you here in Florida. Nancy Mace vs Nancy boy graham.”

“Nancy boy” is a derogatory term used to describe “an effeminate or homosexual man.”

Mace is the first female graduate of The Citadel, where her father, Ret. Brigadier General J. Emory Mace, also attended. Mace’s father is the most decorated living graduate of The Citadel.

Graham, a member of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” that wrote the controversial immigration reform bill passed in late June, has long faced criticism for being less ideologically pure than his conservative constituents desire.

Carolina Conservatives United (CCU), a political group created by former GOProud co-founder and conservative activist Bruce Carroll, launched the website defeatlindseygraham.org shortly before Mace announced her candidacy. CCU’s site attacks Graham for what it deems are his “Beltway Republican” values.

“The truth is Lindsey Graham only panders with conservative language once every six years,” CCU states. “But every day he shows his true stripes by bashing small government conservative activists and ‘voting wrong’ on many of the most important issues before us.”

Former South Carolina Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint was asked on Tuesday’s “Daily Rundown” on MSNBC, “Do you think Lindsey Graham is a Jim DeMint conservative?”

DeMint simply answered, “I don’t think he would want to be called a Jim DeMint conservative. We’re all different. People will have to decide that for themselves.”

Host Chuck Todd then asked, “Is it fair to call him a conservative?”

DeMint replied: “Lindsey can tell you what he is himself. I’m not speaking for him.”"

But he lies. And he knows that he lies. That’s pathetic.”

Putin has always been a bare-knuckles political brawler with a penchant for saying politically incorrect things about enemies — he once said of Islamist terrorists in Chechnya, for example, “If you are willing to become a radical Islamist and be circumcised, I invite you to Moscow. I will recommend that they perform the operation so that nothing can sprout there again.” Now, however, he’s directly challenging the authority of the United States – and he’s winning. President Obama has always wanted to be perceived as a global leader. Instead, it’s his chief international rival, quasi-dictator Putin, who has seized the reins.

Obama has been left to complain. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues?” Obama asked in Sweden on Wednesday. “I’m always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him.” Just a few weeks ago, Obama mocked Putin’s posture during their meetings, likening it to a “bored kid in the back of the classroom.”

But it is Obama being schooled. Putin has stated that he would be open to action against Syria if shown proof that Assad ordered the chemical attack there. But on Wednesday, he said of John Kerry, “Of course he lied. And that’s not pretty.”

The G20 summit has been set not around national security issues, but on tax issues and economic recovery. Nonetheless, it will be Putin setting the agenda on his home turf, especially given that the visiting team is led by a floundering quarterback.

Washington (CNN) - The rude comment that might or might not have happened just isn’t going away, with sources telling CNN that word of the remarks came from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors.

Allegations of the remark, which supposedly happened during an October 10 government shutdown meeting with House Republicans, first surfaced when Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, posted on his Facebook page that an unnamed senior House Republican told President Barack Obama that “I cannot even stand to look at you.”



White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied on Wednesday that the remark was ever made. Durbin has stuck to his story, though he refuses to say who made the alleged comment or how he learned of it.

Sources, however, tell CNN that Durbin learned of the alleged comment from Nabors, a longtime Hill insider.

According to the sources, Nabors told the story to four Senate Democrats – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, New York’s Chuck Schumer, Washington’s Patty Murray, and Durbin – on October 15, near the end of the shutdown.

Reid then told the story to the entire Senate Democratic caucus, identifying the Republican in question as Texas Rep. Pete Sessions.

Sessions denies the story. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner has demanded Durbin retract his allegation and apologize.

“Senator Durbin’s accusation is a serious one, and it appears to have been invented out of thin air,” spokesman Brendan Buck said. “The Senator should disclose who told him this account of events, retract his reckless allegations immediately, and apologize.”

Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who attended the White House meeting, told CNN that Durbin's account ""never happened.""

""It's irresponsible and divisive of him because it never happened and he ought to apologize for saying it. He ought to just man up and say 'You know what, I said something foolish I shouldn’t have said, it didn’t happen’ and apologize.""

The White House’s denial has upset Senate Democrats, since they had heard the story from the Nabors. The White House is now accusing Durbin of sharing an untruthful story.

But on Thursday a White House official accepted some blame for the story.

“While the quote attributed to a Republican lawmaker in the House GOP meeting with the President is not accurate, there was a miscommunication when the White House read out that meeting to Senate Democrats,” the official said. “We regret the misunderstanding.”

Senior administration officials tell CNN that, according to those White House officials who were in the room, Sessions’ comments at the October 10 meeting were expressing frustration with the shutdown standoff, not with President Obama.

White House officials would not comment on whether Nabors misunderstood what Sessions said, or whether he just miscommunicated the story to Senate Democrats.

Nabors could not be reached for comment.

Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, are battling a 14-count public-corruption indictment that alleges they lent the prestige of the governor’s office to a Richmond area businessman in exchange for gifts and loans.

Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead, the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer, keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.

Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead, the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer, keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.

Federal prosecutors told Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell last week that he and his wife would be charged in connection with a gift scandal, but senior Justice Department officials delayed the decision after the McDonnells’ attorneys made a face-to-face appeal in Washington, according to people familiar with the case.

Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, told the McDonnells’ legal teams that he planned to ask a grand jury to return an indictment no later than this past Monday, people familiar with the conversations said.

McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, would have been charged with working together to illegally promote a struggling dietary-supplement company in exchange for gifts and loans from its chief executive, the people said.

The plan to seek the felony charges this week changed, however, after attorneys for the state’s first couple met with Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on Dec. 12.

The attorneys argued that the governor had done nothing improper to assist businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. In particular, they focused on the credibility of a key witness, said a person familiar with the presentation. They also argued that if prosecutors proceeded with charges, they should wait until after McDonnell left office Jan. 11 to allow a smooth transition of power to Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D).

Some element of the lawyers’ arguments apparently persuaded the Justice Department to delay, according to people with knowledge of the case. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.

On Friday, the day after the meeting, McDonnell’s attorneys were told that the decision would be put on hold, the people said. A final decision about whether to press charges is now not expected before Jan. 2 and could come as late as February, they said.

Jason Miyares, a spokesman for McDonnell’s legal team, and William A. Burck, an attorney for McDonnell’s wife, declined to comment. Boente and a spokesman for the Justice Department also declined to comment. McDonnell has maintained that he has done nothing wrong.

It is not unusual that a high-profile target, especially a sitting governor, would be allowed a chance to appeal a U.S. attorney’s charging decision to top officials of the Justice Department. It would be very rare, however, for the Justice Department to ultimately overturn a decision made by a U.S. attorney.

Relationship probed

Federal prosecutors have been investigating the McDonnells’ relationship with Williams for most of this year. Williams provided more than $165,000 in gifts and loans to the governor and his family. The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Williams’s company, Star Scientific Inc., including hosting a lunch at the Executive Mansion to mark the launch of a new product. The McDonnells also helped company executives secure meetings with state officials.

McDonnell has apologized for the relationship, but he insisted that he treated Star just as he would have any other Virginia-based business. The company received no state grants, contracts or board appointments.

He has said in several recent interviews that he would like to see the investigation concluded as quickly as possible.

“I’m hoping it will all be resolved in the very near future,” he told The Washington Post last month.

But privately, as prosecutors signaled their intent to file charges, McDonnell’s attorneys have been pressing Justice Department officials to reconsider or delay — at least long enough for McDonnell to complete his four-year term and avoid becoming the first sitting governor in state history to face criminal charges.

The investigation has focused on whether McDonnell violated the Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime for a public official to receive payments or other financial gifts, knowing that those payments are in return for the official’s promise to take action in his government role.

To prove the crime, it is not necessary to show that the public official actually took the steps or that any of the official acts resulted in benefits to the person making the payments. Private citizens can also be charged under the law if they caused the public official to take actions or make such promises.

McDonnell is also the subject of a state investigation into whether his annual financial disclosures complied with Virginia law. It is a misdemeanor under Virginia law for an elected official to knowingly submit false or incomplete information on annual financial disclosure forms.

McDonnell has said he complied with state law, which allows elected officials to accept gifts of any value provided they disclose those worth more than $50; they are not required to disclose gifts to their families or loans to their businesses.

Attorneys working for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) learned in March 2012 of allegations that McDonnell’s forms might be incomplete. As required by law, Cuccinelli designated a local prosecutor to conduct a full investigation, turning the case over to Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring in November 2012.

But Virginia law requires prosecutors to press charges within a year of being alerted to possible legal violations. That statute of limitations is expiring, which has become a factor in both the state and federal investigations.

Herring had reached an agreement with McDonnell’s attorneys to extend the statute of limitations into this month, said a person familiar with its terms. But the state probe has been on hold while federal prosecutors decided whether to proceed with more serious felony charges, and federal prosecutors felt pressured by the looming state deadline, the person said.

On Friday, all sides agreed to extend the deal on the state charges — known as a tolling agreement — into early February. That allows more time for federal authorities to make a final decision.

Herring would not comment on the federal probe other than to say that he is “awaiting a final decision from the Justice Department.”

“But,” he added, “I have to plan for other contingencies as well, such as the matter being returned back to my office.” Herring would not provide information on the tolling agreement.

Witnesses at issue

The McDonnells’ attorneys argued to the Justice Department last week that key witnesses were problematic, a person close to the case said.

Among other issues, the attorneys have been telling federal prosecutors that there could be weaknesses in the testimony of Mary Shea Sutherland, the former chief of staff to Maureen McDonnell.

E-mails obtained under a freedom of information request show that Sutherland was intimately involved in the planning of an event held at the governor’s mansion in August 2011 that marked the launch of a Star Scientific dietary supplement called Anatabloc.

Prosecutors believe that the luncheon event was one way the couple helped Williams’s company, people with knowledge of the case said.

Attorneys for the McDonnells have argued that they could convince a jury that Sutherland was trying to curry favor with Williams, including by helping to organize the mansion event, according to a person close to the case.

Sutherland corresponded with Star Scientific executives before the company issued a news release touting the event. She also urged the governor’s scheduler to ensure that the governor attended. When the scheduler suggested that McDonnell might be busy, Sutherland wrote back, “The [first lady] isn’t going to be happy about it.”

In that same time frame, Sutherland was given an expensive dress by Williams on a New York City shopping trip during which Williams also bought $15,000 in high-end clothing for the first lady, the people said.

The defense attorneys also point to a draft of a 2011 contract they said shows that Williams and Sutherland were in negotiations for Sutherland to leave her government job and work for Williams through an independent event planning firm.

The employment contract was never executed. Ted Bruns, an attorney for Sutherland, declined to comment. He has previously said Sutherland never worked for Williams and has called the idea that Sutherland attended a Star event without the first lady’s knowledge “curious.”

The event was held at the governor’s 200-year-old official residence, and the first lady served as host. The governor attended as well. It was paid for by the governor’s political action committee.

Asked about the Star Scientific mansion event in March, a spokesman for the governor said all requests for use of the mansion are approved by the governor’s chief of staff. “The decision to have the event was based solely on the benefit to the Commonwealth,” spokesman Jeff Caldwell said in a statement then.

Don Young rebuked over slur,"WASHINGTON - One of the House of Representatives’ longest-serving Republicans now says he meant “no disrespect” when he used the term “wetbacks” to describe migrant workers his family once employed.

His comment, which drew a strong rebuke from the House speaker, flies in the face of his party’s effort to improve outreach to minority groups.

In an interview with a local radio station Thursday, Alaska Rep. Don Young was discussing how advances in technology have reduced the need for some types of employment and referred to farming his family once did in California.

“My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,” he told KRBD. “It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.”

Young, a 40-year veteran of Congress, also told the station that former GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was correct in saying that 47% of Americans are dependent on government, according to a story posted by the station.

House Speaker John A. Boehner strongly denounced Young’s comment Friday.

“Congressman Young’s remarks were offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds. I don’t care why he said it – there’s no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology,” Boehner said.

Young’s office did issue a clarification, though not an apology, in the congressman’s name.

“During a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio this week, I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California. I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays, and I meant no disrespect,” he said.

Rep. Ruben Hinojosa (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called it “deeply disheartening” that a member of Congress would use “such hateful words and racial slurs.”

“Rep. Young says that he was just using the language he was accustomed to as he grew up, but there is no excuse for ignorance. He has served alongside Hispanics in Congress since 1973, so he should know terms like ‘wetback’ have never been acceptable,” he said. “As the Republican minority outreach efforts develop, I’d advise their strategists to list ‘don’t say racial slurs like ‘wetback’’ as a bedrock for their messaging.”

First was the release from Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley recusing herself from a potential discipline hearing against the ""man"" accused of choking her, fellow Justice David Prosser. Bradley said that when Prosser attacked her

what happened in my office on June 13, 2011 was not an isolated event. Rather, it is one event in a history of abusive behavior in our workplace that has escalated from tantrums and rages, to threats, and now to phyiscal contact.

Bradley went on to say that she and Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson have taken to locking themselves in their offices out of fear of their safety, as they find Prosser unstable.

The Walker Administration tried to run interference and claim that they couldn't find a record of such a request, no doubt to try to feed the Charles Sykeses and Mark Bellings a meme that Bradley was lying. But former Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs backed up Bradley's account Friday afternoon, saying that Capitol Police were indeed contacted by a ""Supreme Court official,"" and put in a security plan soon thereafter.

But hey, maybe Bradley was overreacting. I mean, look at the grace in which Prosser handled being interviewed on the incident.

That doesn't look like an unstable maniac, does it?

What kept Prosser from facing criminal charges for the incident was the fact that the other 3 right-wing members of the Court - Michael Gableman, Annette Ziegler and Pat Roggensack - claimed the incident did not happen or that Prosser was somehow provoked and threatened by Bradley (who is significantly shorter and smaller than Prosser), so there wasn't enough unquestioned evidence against Prosser to charge him.

Roggensack was also called out by Bradley in her complaint, as Bradley said Roggensack deceived investigators about what happened that June day, and was lying when Roggensack claimed earlier this month that things really aren't that bad between the justices. Given that a key attack against Roggensack in the upcoming Supreme Court election will be that she is part of the problem with the Court's embarrassing dysfunction (along with her partisan, conservative record), you can see why she might want to say something like that.

But an ethics case remains from the incident, with Franklyn Gimbel as the head prosecutor for the state's Judicial Commission. That was also in the news this week because the Journal-Sentinel had a story where Gimbel said he had been told not to add any new evidence or scopes to the Prosser investigation by the state's Judicial Commission."

He is ""outspoken ally"" of Speaker John Boehner, writes Molly Ball at The Atlantic. That may be so, however comments he made in a post-retirement interview does not do any favors for the Speaker of the House. Ball asked LaTourette, why ""Boehner decided not to hold a vote on the bill to fund relief money for victims of Hurricane Sandy""?



During the roll call on the tax bill, I walked into the cloakroom, and Boehner was sitting there. I said, 'This Sandy thing is really important. We've got to do something.' He said, 'Not tonight.' I asked if we were going to do it tomorrow, and he said no. He said, 'After this mess, I just can't do it tonight.'

Q: I don't understand. Was he just exhausted? Was he afraid the votes wouldn't be there?

LaTourette: He had expended a lot of political capital to get the 85 votes [on the fiscal-cliff deal], and he felt a little betrayed that the other members of the elected leadership walked on him. And the last piece was, as you saw during the Speaker election [Thursday], this sort of insurrection was forming against him. There was a fear that if he put $60 billion, no matter how worthy, of unpaid-for emergency spending on the floor, the insurrection would become bigger than it was."

He served as president of the Gallup Organization from 1979 to 1989.

In my decades of polling, I recall only one moment when a party had been driven as far from the center as the Republican Party has been today.

The outsize influence of hard-line elements in the party base is doing to the GOP what supporters of Gene McCarthy and George McGovern did to the Democratic Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s — radicalizing its image and standing in the way of its revitalization.

In those years, the Democratic Party became labeled, to its detriment, as the party of “acid, abortion and amnesty.” With the Democrats’ values far to the left of the silent majority, McGovern lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon in 1972.

While there are no catchy phrases for the Republicans of 2013, their image problems are readily apparent in national polls. The GOP has come to be seen as the more extreme party, the side unwilling to compromise or negotiate seriously to tackle the economic turmoil that challenges the nation.

View Graphic A 20-year low for the GOP

It is no surprise that even elements of the Republican leadership that had been so confident of a Mitt Romney victory — including when it was clear that he was going to lose the election — are now looking at ways to find more electable candidates and cope with the disproportionate influence of hard-liners in the GOP. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus only scratched the surface this past week when he dissected the party’s November defeat: “There’s no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game was insufficient; we weren’t inclusive; we were behind in both data and digital; and our primary and debate process needed improvement. So there’s no one solution. There’s a long list of them.”

A long list, but one that doesn’t address the emergence of a staunch conservative bloc that has undermined the GOP’s national image.

The Republican Party’s ratings now stand at a 20-year low, with just 33 percent of the public holding a favorable view of the party and 58 percent judging it unfavorably, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Although the Democrats are better regarded (47 percent favorable and 46 percent unfavorable), the GOP’s problems are its own, not a mirror image of renewed Democratic strength.

Americans’ values and beliefs are more divided along partisan lines than at any time in the past 25 years. The values gap between Republicans and Democrats is now greater than the one between men and women, young and old, or any racial or class divides.

But while members of the Republican and Democratic parties have become more conservative and liberal, respectively, a bloc of doctrinaire, across-the-board conservatives has become a dominant force on the right. Indeed, their resolve and ultra-conservatism have protected Republican lawmakers from the broader voter backlash that is so apparent in opinion polls.

For decades, my colleagues and I have examined the competing forces and coalitions within the two parties. In our most recent national assessments, we found not only that the percentage of people self-identifying as Republicans had hit historic lows but that within that smaller base, the traditional divides between pro-business economic conservatives and social conservatives had narrowed. There was less diversity of values within the GOP than at any time in the past quarter-century.

The party’s base is increasingly dominated by a highly energized bloc of voters with extremely conservative positions on nearly all issues: the size and role of government, foreign policy, social issues, and moral concerns. They stand with the tea party on taxes and spending and with Christian conservatives on key social questions, such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

These staunch conservatives, who emerged with great force in the Obama era, represent 45 percent of the Republican base. According to our 2011 survey, they are demographically and politically distinct from the national electorate. Ninety-two percent are white. They tend to be male, married, Protestant, well off and at least 50 years old.

Knowing how this slice of the electorate came together is key to understanding why GOP lawmakers have been able to withstand the public backlash seen in polls — and why the party will face great difficulty in reinventing itself.

According to our polling, three factors stand out in the emergence of the GOP’s staunch conservative bloc: ideological resistance to President Obama’s policies, discomfort with the changing face of America and the influence of conservative media.

The Obama backlash

The Obama backlash: The conservative response to Obama was fast and furious as he began his first term. While Republicans wished him well for a month or two after his 2008 victory — as many as 59 percent reported a favorable opinion of him in January 2009 — their disapproval of the new president soon rose sharply. By the 100-day mark of Obama’s first term, 56 percent of Republicans disapproved of the president. And by January 2010, 61 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of conservative Republicans strongly disapproved of the president.

On a host of issues — gun control, abortion rights and global warming — national opinion quickly veered right. For the first time in more than a decade of polling, a Pew Research survey in April 2009 found nearly as many people saying it was more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns (45 percent) than to control gun ownership (49 percent). The same poll found that the share of the public saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases had declined to 46 percent from 54 percent just eight months earlier. In the fall of 2009, those saying they believed that the Earth was warming fell to 57 percent from 71 percent a year earlier.

The abortion shift proved to be short-lived — 54 percent once again believe it should be legal in most or all cases. But the public’s change of heart on gun control continues, even after Newtown. And belief in global warming has rebounded somewhat, but it remains significantly lower than it was before Obama took office.

Perhaps the most far-reaching change we observed in 2009 concerned the size and role of government. A growing plurality of Americans said they preferred a smaller government that offered fewer services (48 percent) rather than an activist government that offered more (40 percent), compared with a virtually even split on this question a year earlier. At the same time, a clear trend of increasing public support for the social safety net that we’d seen during the George W. Bush presidency reversed itself within months of Obama taking office.

These trends kicked in before health-care reform became such a dominant political issue, but the charged political debate over Obamacare only reinforced them.

This conservative tide of opinion — strengthened with the emergence of the tea party — showed its power in 2010, with a dramatic midterm election victory for the GOP that Obama himself called a “shellacking.” As the election approached, conservatives accounted for 68 percent of the Republican base, compared with 60 percent eight years earlier.

The changing face of America

The changing face of America: The nation’s demographic and social shifts have also played a role in galvanizing the new bloc. Conservative Republicans are more likely (33 percent) than the public at large (22 percent) to see the growing number of Latinos in America as a change for the worse. Similarly, 46 percent of conservatives see increasing rates of interracial marriage as a positive development, compared with 66 percent of the public overall.

During Obama’s first term, ethnocentric attitudes — on immigration, equal rights and interracial dating — grew by 11 percentage points among conservative Republicans but did not increase significantly among any other political or ideological grouping. Some academic surveys found similar partisan polarization on racial measures over the course of Obama’s first term.

Race has loomed larger in voting behavior in the Obama era than at any point in the recent past. The 2010 election was the high mark of “white flight” from the Democratic Party, as National Journal’s Ron Brownstein called it — the GOP won a record 60 percent of white votes, up from 51 percent four years earlier.

To the conservative base, Obama, as an African American in the White House, may be a symbol of how America has changed. Unease with him sets conservative Republicans apart from other voting blocs — including moderate Republicans, who have hardly been fans of the president. For example, a fall 2011 national survey found 63 percent of conservative Republicans reporting that Obama made them angry, compared with 29 percent of the public overall and 40 percent of moderate Republicans.

The conservative media

The conservative media: If a values backlash and racial-political polarization helped forge the staunch conservative bloc, the conservative media has reinforced it.

The politicization of news consumption is certainly not new; it’s been apparent in more than 20 years of data collected by the Pew Research Center. What is new is a bloc of voters who rely more on conservative media than on the general news media to comprehend the world. Pew found that 54 percent of staunch conservatives report that they regularly watch Fox News, compared with 44 percent who read a newspaper and 30 percent who watch network news regularly. Newspapers and/or television networks top all other news sources for other blocs of voters, both on the right and on the left. Neither CNN, NPR or the New York Times has an audience close to that size among other voting blocs.

Conservative Republicans make up as much as 50 percent of the audiences for Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’ Reilly. There is nothing like this on the left. MSNBC’s “Hardball” and “The Rachel Maddow Show” attract significantly fewer liberal Democrats.

I see little reason to believe that the staunch conservative bloc will wither away or splinter; it will remain a dominant force in the GOP and on the national stage. At the same time, however, I see no indication that its ideas about policy, governance and social issues will gain new adherents. They are far beyond the mainstream.

Any Republican efforts at reinvention face this dilemma: While staunch conservatives help keep GOP lawmakers in office, they also help keep the party out of the White House. Quite simply, the Republican Party has to appeal to a broader cross section of the electorate to succeed in presidential elections.

This became apparent last fall. Voters generally agreed with the GOP that a smaller government is preferable to a larger, activist one, and therefore they disapproved of Obamacare. However, exit polls showed popular support for legalizing same-sex marriage and giving illegal immigrants opportunities for citizenship.

This combination of conservative and liberal views is typical. To win, both parties must appeal to the mixed values of the electorate. But it will be very hard for the Republican Party, given the power of the staunch conservatives in its ranks.

Of course, the Democrats of the 1970s were able to overcome their obstacles. All it took was Watergate, an oil embargo and a presidential pardon of Nixon for Jimmy Carter to secure a thin victory in 1976. Not even the most frustrated Republicans could hope for a similar turn of events.

I support a House in which most of its members do their jobs and are rarely known to anyone other than their constituents. Of course, that’s impossible but when a candidate puts their political aspirations above their people (which is all-too-common on both sides of the aisle), they will be put on blast. When regression, not progression, is the ultimate goal; they will deserve a spot here.

So who signifies that better than Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. Representing Minnesota’s 6th district since 2006, Bachmann probably deserves no introduction for all the headlines she has very proudly generated. Yet, let’s take a look at the legislative, electoral and overall career of Michele Bachmann.



-Bringing up, for the 34th time, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

If there could be anything that will automatically earn you a place on this spot, it’s actions like these. The ACA is the law of the land and slowly become more integrated into our health care system. The fact that this cannot essentially get repealed until 2017 is noteworthy. This is a bill that’s created to throw “red meat” to national conservatives and to generate some early headlines. It’s a waste of time that could be used to well….stonewall other bills and make John Boehner weep but time nonetheless.

-The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act

This Bachmann’s other signature piece of legislation, another one that is advocating a repeal and another one that was not enacted. The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act would signify the repeal of the government ban of incandescent light bulbs.

Headlines:

-Founder of the Tea Party Caucus

-Notably went on Hardball With Chris Matthews and encouraged investigations to determine if members of Congress were “anti-American”.

-Won Ames Straw Poll in 2011 which would lead to her collapsing in polls and dropping out of the presidential race the day after the Iowa Caucus.

-Claimed President Obama wanted to enact Sharia Law in America.

-Claimed Huma Abedin was part of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence even though she has no foreign policy credentials.

Electoral History:

2006: Bachmann (R): 50.1%, Patty Wetterling (D): 42.1%, John Binkowski (I): 7.8%

2008: Bachmann (R): 46.4%, Elwyn Tinklenberg (D), 43.4%, Bob Anderson (I): 10%

2010: Bachmann (R): 52.5%, Taryl Clark (D): 39.8%, Anderson (I): 5.8%

2012: Bachmann (R): 50.5%, Jim Graves (D): 49.5%

Cook PVI:

R+10

Prospects:

I would say that this list should begin with Jim Graves, who gave Bachmann the closest run for her seat. Graves is a small-business owner and a local Minnesotan who nearly won even by being outspent from 10:1 margin. To learn more about Graves, check out his bio on his website here.

I believe that he is the best contender though I would like to hear what somebody from Minnesota might know.

Why We Can Do This:

The district is pretty significantly Republican but Bachmann has barely crossed over 50% of the vote, even in the tidal wave that was 2010. Now, she is an amazing fundraiser but her reputation is so well-known that I don’t think money can erase all the obstruction she has done in the House. Bachmann has reached her ceiling, it appears, so what the DFL of Minnesota might have to do is make this a very local race considering Bachmann is a highly national figure.

The fact that Bachmann has difficulties staying north of 50% gives us hope in 2014. Fundraising for the opponent could be a national exercise and if started early enough, we could see some good results.

Remember if Bachmann is out of politics, it would be a huge blow to the Tea Party and would help us regain our sanity.

To sort of paraphrase her, “Repeal and Replace Bachmann”.

(Note on this feature: We cannot sit idly as the majority Republican House does nothing. Can we guarantee that a Democratic majority would change things? Not at all. But we can try.

Hence why I’m also putting this in your hands. Share this on your Facebook, “like” candidate’s (which we will tout) Facebook pages, retweet posts from here and maybe even send it to your local Democratic Party. If we are going to take back the House, with a fairly sizable Republican majority, then it’s going to take us. The grassroots.

All campaigns are national, but stay local. It would be great to have a Democratic Party that goes back to the “50-state strategy”.

But it all starts with us, the voters. Us, the netrooters. Us, the people. Let’s start this project now and see what we are capable of.)

Dan Bongino, who was a Secret Service agent under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Breitbart News that his appearance to speak on Bashir’s program about his book, Life Inside the Bubble, “was booked in advance of his unfortunate comments,” and he could not in good faith appear on the program.

“In light of these comments I felt it only appropriate to cancel my appearance on the show. Governor Palin took a principled chance on me during my U.S. Senate campaign when few would,” Bongino told Breitbart News. “She put herself out there for me, risking her political capital, and chose to endorse me because she believed in me.

“In a political arena filled with bad actors it was refreshing to know that Governor Palin was willing to fight for the underdog. She deserves better than the treatment she received by Mr. Bashir and I cannot, in good faith, appear on the show, regardless of the number of books it may or may not sell.”

Bongino is the author of Life Inside the Bubble, which is getting bipartisan interest thanks to recent scandals and the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination. As of this writing, it is No. 39 on Amazon.com’s bestsellers list. Bongino, a candidate for Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District who has said he would go to Washington and not let the city change him, turned down a chance to promote himself and his book on Bashir’s show during a week in more people may be watching due to the controversy surrounding Bashir’s comments.

Bashir apologized on Monday for his remarks, saying they were “offensive” and wholly inappropriate,” but MSNBC has not taken any action against him despite the network’s past history of disciplining its on-air talent for “offensive remarks.” Palin’s political action committee SarahPAC sent a letter to MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness, which Breitbart News exclusively obtained, that asked the network what action it would take against Bashir, especially given that the network suspended Alec Baldwin for anti-gay comments he made off of the air.

“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter concludes, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”"

Only later did I realize that God had a plan for me with that episode.

In my office is a devotional book on leadership by John Maxwell that I read for its daily message. The day we learned the call had been a prank, we had been so busy that I never had a chance to pick it up. After my press conference, when I had a moment to catch my breath, I opened up the book.

The title for that day was: 'The power of humility, the burden of pride.'

I looked up and said, 'I hear you, Lord.'

Up to that point the national media had been all over our story. Conservative circles were writing and saying some pretty nice things about my political future. We were getting all sorts of abuse from the protesters and the mainstream media, so the accolades we were getting nationally were certainly encouraging. But it got to the point where I was reading many of the columns each night and getting pretty caught up in it all. Slowly, it was becoming too much about me."

(CNN) - Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used an analogy about rape Friday to blast this week’s decision by the Senate's Democratic majority to change the chamber’s filibuster rules despite the unanimous opposition of minority Republicans.

The so-called “nuclear option” will allow a bare majority of senators – as opposed to 60 - to approve most judicial and executive branch nominations. The Democratic caucus controls 55 of the chamber’s 100 seats.



""Let's say, let's take 10 people in a room and they're a group. And the room is made up of six men and four women. The group has a rule that the men cannot rape the women. The group also has a rule that says any rule that will be changed must require six votes, of the 10, to change the rule,"" Limbaugh told listeners.

""Every now and then, some lunatic in the group proposes to change the rule to allow women to be raped. But they never were able to get six votes for it. There were always the four women voting against it and they always found two guys.”

Limbaugh continued: “Well, the guy that kept proposing that women be raped finally got tired of it, and he was in the majority and he was one that (said), 'You know what? We're going to change the rule. Now all we need is five.""

“And well, 'You can't do that.' 'Yes we are. We're the majority. We're changing the rule.' And then they vote. Can the women be raped? Well, all it would take then is half of the room,” Limbaugh said.

“You can change the rule to say three. You can change the rule to say three people want it, it's going to happen. There's no rule. When the majority can change the rules there aren't any.""

Friday’s analogy isn’t Limbaugh’s first inflammatory comment about women. Last year, the radio host apologized for a comment he made on his show about Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, calling her a ""slut"" after she testified about contraception on Capitol Hill."

Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said he would insist on a 60-vote threshold, which has happened just twice before with Cabinet nominees. Inhofe denied that he was “anxious to try to string this out” but said it was important for Hagel to face that higher threshold given the opposition.

“I’m entitled to it, and I’m sure there are many Republicans who want a 60-vote margin,” he said. “I feel a responsibility because of all the things we’ve been talking about to do what I can to see that Chuck Hagel is not confirmed as secretary of Defense.”

But in a closed-door meeting Monday night, Sen. John McCain of Arizona -- who was the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee until Inhofe replaced him -- warned the panel’s other Republicans against any delaying tactics. McCain said he has not decided whether he will vote for or against Hagel, a Republican and a former senator from Nebraska who was once a close friend and supporter of McCain.

“Someday, we will have a Republican president. Someday, we may even have a majority in the United States Senate,” McCain told reporters afterward. “It sets, I think, a wrong precedent.”

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, announced Monday that he would call a vote on Hagel’s nomination Tuesday afternoon, hours before President Obama’s State of the Union address. He rejected the requests of Republicans, including Inhofe, for further delays. He said Hagel’s disclosures of financial and other information “far exceed the standard practices.”

Barring a surprise defection among the majority Democrats, Hagel should have the votes on the committee to move forward. But final confirmation could be delayed by his GOP opponents.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he would place a hold on Hagel’s nomination unless the White House answered further questions about the raid on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya on Sept. 11 that left four Americans dead. Graham said he would send the White House another letter Tuesday seeking specific details about President Obama’s actions after learning of the attack and would tie Hagel’s nomination to Obama’s response.

The situation has revealed a divide between Republicans who want to preserve Senate traditions and those who want to use the situation to advance their political agendas.

According to a Senate historian, counting how many Cabinet nominees have been filibustered is difficult because the opposition can take many forms.

But only twice has a Cabinet appointee faced a cloture vote in the Senate, or a 60-vote requirement to proceed to a final confirmation vote. Both were Republican appointments -- C. William Verity Jr. by President Reagan to be Commerce secretary and Dirk Kempthorne by President George W. Bush to be Interior secretary. Both were eventually easily confirmed.

Graham said Democrats also successfully blocked the nomination of John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. The U.N. post is not formally part of the Cabinet but is considered a Cabinet-level position.

“This is the way the system works around here,” Graham said, calling it his only leverage “against a White House who just basically won’t respond to anything.”

“My Democratic colleagues had no problem holding Bush’s feet to the fire in Iraq, and they should, quite frankly. But you got to play the game the same way.”

Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, another senior Republican, said he too had concerns about Hagel and the raid in Libya. He said some in his party are worried that Obama “is appointing second-tier yes people.”

“In the case of Sen. Hagel, a lot of them feel like he’s being appointed because he’ll cut back on the military at a time we need to be strong,” Hatch said.

But he said he would not filibuster the nomination.

“I haven’t been an enthusiastic filibusterer of Cabinet appointments ever. So I start out with the idea that he shouldn’t be filibustered,” Hatch said.

During the closed GOP meeting, McCain also sought to prevent a symbolic protest by some Republicans on the Armed Services Committee who were considering walking out when the vote was called.

A Republican aide said he believed that was now unlikely and said those who supported further delaying tactics were in the minority.

“There was limited support in the room for moving forward with the filibuster,” said to the aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. But he added: “Everybody was not there, and it only takes one member” to place a hold.

VOICEOVER: Yet two days later, Secretary Clinton and others blamed protesters and ... CLINTON (9/14/12): ... an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with.

CLINTON (9/14/12): This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable.

The video editing is seamless between the voiceover and Clinton, making it appear as though she was finishing his sentence, putting an exclamation point on the claim that she blamed a YouTube video for what happened in Benghazi. But, as with the video's first clip, it turns out that this is just another slice and dice editing job, because as the transcript makes clear, Clinton wasn't talking about Benghazi—she was talking about protests out our embassies in Cairo and other places around the world.Clinton's comments about the video were clearly referring to protests and violence at our embassies. Not only was Benghazi not an embassy, Clinton referred to the attack there separately, in the preceding sentence.

At this point in the video, Rove has now told two big whoppers. His goal is to convince viewers that Hillary Clinton was blaming America for what happened in Benghazi and that she refused to stand up to religious extremists simply because they were Muslims. But immediately after the attack, Clinton did exactly that, saying:



Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It’s an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm.

What could Rove possibly find objectionable in that statement? The answer is obvious—nothing, because he didn't include it in his video. Instead, he took a statement Clinton had made linking the protest in Cairo to an internet video and falsely claimed she was talking about Benghazi.

Rove wasn't done with his deceptions, however. After the Clinton clip, his video claimed that Hicks was shocked and angered by what Clinton had said:



VOICEOVER: Deputy Hicks was shocked. HICKS: I was stunned. My jaw dropped. I was embarrassed.

Just one problem: Hicks wasn't talking about his reaction to Hillary Clinton. He was describing his reaction to Susan Rice's Sunday talk show comments. This isn't a surprise: After all, Clinton didn't say what Rove claims she said, so how could he have been?

Rove's video continues:



VOICEOVER: But when Hicks dared to question why Secretary Clinton and others were contradicting the facts he told her, Clinton's Chief of Staff ordered him not to talk to Congress.

A 22-year diplomatic veteran, intimidated for daring to blow the whistle—all under Hillary Clinton's watch. How could this happen? Why did she blame a video? Was she part of a cover up?

Again, this is not true. Hicks says he was told not to talk with Congress without a State Department lawyer present—not that he was told he couldn't talk to Congress. After overlooking that crucial piece of information, the video then makes its closing argument:The best thing I can say about the closing argument is that by framing its points as rhetorical questions rather than asserting falsehoods as truth, it falls closer to the category of ""bull"" than ""lie.""

Really, the one and only question that is potentially troubling is the question of whether Hicks did face any political repercussions for meeting with Jason Chaffetz without a State Department employee. He says he believes he's been effectively demoted, but the State Department says he hasn't and promised that he won't be. The State Department notes that Hicks asked to end his Libya assignment early and hasn't had his pay reduced by one dime. Hicks, meanwhile, says he still hasn't been reassigned.

It's important to make sure that Hicks is not intimidated for speaking his mind. The fact that he hasn't said anything particularly new or damaging is beside the point. The good news is that he's still employed by the State Department and his salary hasn't been cut one dime. In that respect, he's gotten much better treatment than Shirley Sherrod got after she became the target of a maliciously edited Andrew Breitbart video. But while the administration might not be as trigger happy with Hicks as they were with Sherrod, one thing is clear: If a right-winger puts out a video that's hard to believe, it's pretty damn good bet the video is nothing but lies."

The (Louisville, Ky.) Courier-Journal

Several sources have accused Paul of plagiarism in speeches%2C an article and one of his books

Paul has accepted responsibility for material included in his speeches by his staff and advisers

Paul first said he was a victim of %22haters%2C but now says he was sloppy

WASHINGTON — After facing accusations of plagiarism in speeches, an article and one of his books, Sen. Rand Paul said Tuesday through a spokesman that he made mistakes in crediting sources and has set up a new system for vetting his work.

The Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 presidential contender has been buffeted since last week by a steady stream of allegations that he copied the works of others.

On Tuesday, Buzzfeed said it uncovered a new passage in Paul's book, ""Government Bullies,"" that is nearly identical to a portion of a Forbes magazine article. Buzzfeed also reported earlier that three paragraphs Paul wrote in an op-ed in September for The Washington Times were nearly identical to a piece in The Week magazine.

Although he previously had said he was being targeted, Paul told CNN on Tuesday that he accepted responsibility.

""Ultimately, I'm the boss, and things go out under my name, so it is my fault,"" he said. ""I never had intentionally presented anyone's ideas as my own.""

Paul spokesman Doug Stafford said the office intends to be more careful.

""In the thousands of speeches and op-eds Sen. Paul has produced, he has always presented his own ideas, opinions and conclusions,"" Stafford said in a statement. ""Sen. Paul also relies on a large number of staff and advisers to provide supporting facts and anecdotes — some of which were not clearly sourced or vetted properly.""

Stafford said footnotes on sources ""were not always used.""

""Going forward, footnotes will be available on request,"" he said. ""There have also been occasions where quotations or typesetting indentations have been left out through errors in our approval process. From here forward, quoting, footnoting and citing will be more complete.""

Stafford added: ""Adherence to a new approval process implemented by Sen. Paul will ensure proper citation and accountability in all collaborative works.""

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Politico and Buzzfeed all have found cases in which Paul used wording similar or identical to other sources without making it clear that the work was not his.

Maddow first found that Paul's speech recounting the plot line from the film ""Gattaca"" used wording similar to a Wikipedia entry.

Buzzfeed reported that a speech the senator gave in June 2012 contained similar language from a Wikipedia entry on the film ""Stand and Deliver.""

Paul's response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address earlier this year used words identical to those in an Associated Press report from 2011, Politico reported.

The Kentuckian also used nearly identical phrases from a Focus on the Family magazine article in part of a speech he gave earlier this year at Howard University, Politico found.

Buzzfeed reported Saturday that ""Government Bullies"" contained three pages that borrowed heavily from a 2003 Heritage Foundation study, and a passage from a Cato Institute report.

Paul first said he was a victim of ""haters."" But on Sunday, he said he was sloppy. ""The footnote police have really been dogging me for the last week,"" Paul said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I will admit that. And I will admit, sometimes we haven't footnoted things properly.""

He also said that, among ""thousands of things I've written, yeah, there are times when they have been sloppy or not correct or we've made an error.""

But Paul distinguished between the kind of plagiarism that results in students getting ""F's"" on papers or being kicked out of school and giving a speech.

""I think the spoken word shouldn't be held to the same sort of standard that you have if you're giving a scientific paper. I've written scientific papers. I know how to footnote things,"" he said.

""I take it as an insult, and I will not lie down and say people can call me dishonest, misleading or misrepresenting,"" Paul said on ABC. ""I have never intentionally done so.""

Paul also suggested he would have a remedy if this was an earlier century.

""If dueling were legal in Kentucky, if they keep it up, you know, it would be a duel challenge,"" the senator said. ""But I can't do that, because I can't hold office in Kentucky then.""

Jonathan Bailey, founder of the blog plagiarismtoday.com, said the instances uncovered in Paul's book, speeches and an article fit the definition of plagiarism.

""This is dealing with different types of work, and it definitely indicates a much broader problem,"" he said.

Bailey added that the plagiarism would be treated seriously in schools: ""Even in quantities less than this, it can result in disciplinary action against a student.""

Noting that Paul is a former medical school student, Bailey said ""I'm sure he would be aware that in an academic environment, this would not be acceptable."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/opinion/sunday/a-victory-against-dark-money.html,2013-11-03 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],A Victory Against Dark Money - The New York Times,"A group of wealthy donors wanted to give millions to two right-wing California political campaigns last year, but didn’t want anyone to know their identities. They came up with a scheme that any money-launderer would be proud of, funneling the cash through a convoluted series of independent spending groups that were allowed to collect unlimited dollars. By the time the donations had been used to buy advertising, the original money trail had been erased.

Or so they thought. California has one of the best laws in the country requiring disclosure of political donations, and officials at the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission suspected that the bulk contributions were obscuring the true donor groups. A yearlong investigation revealed the nature of the scheme, and the groups were accused of violating state law.

A few days ago, as part of a civil settlement, the state imposed $16 million in penalties and fines on the groups, a record in a campaign finance case. Though it’s not clear how much of those penalties will ever be collected, or even who many of the original donors were, the effort demonstrates the importance of state disclosure laws and aggressive enforcement, particularly since Congress has refused to pay attention to abuses on a national level.

The California commission, in fact, has done the political world a favor by exposing the secretive network of conservative groups that have aggressively taken advantage of the unlimited donations allowed by the Supreme Court, as well as the ability to hide donors that is permitted by the Federal Election Commission and lower courts. The network centers on groups with close ties to the Koch brothers, whose huge donations have played such a large role in electing Tea Party candidates around the country."

USA TODAY

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says he'll block a vote on President Obama's nominees until the White House provides more information about the survivors of last year's deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya.

Graham, a vocal critic of what happened at Benghazi, posted on Twitter that he'll block ""every appointment"" from getting a vote in the U.S. Senate.

Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Graham's threat comes a day after CBS' 60 Minutes aired a report that included an eyewitness account from a former British soldier.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said all presidential nominees should move through the Senate process ""expeditiously,"" and noted the Obama administration has cooperated with seven congressional committees looking into Benghazi.

While declining to call out Graham directly, Carney said too many Republicans are ""playing politics"" with the deadly attack. ""I think in general that has been the case,"" Carney said. ""It's unfortunate to hold up any nominee.""

It's not uncommon for senators to place a ""hold"" on a presidential nominee to extract information on another issue or topic. Ultimately 99% of presidential appointees are confirmed by the Senate, according to a Congressional Research Service report released earlier this year.

There are several judges awaiting a Senate vote on confirmation as well key deputies at the Defense, Interior and Energy Departments and members of the Federal Communications Commission. A lengthy delay by Graham could also affect two of Obama's high-profile nominees — Janet Yellen at the Federal Reserve Board and Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security — who are awaiting their confirmation hearings.

Graham's opposition will not affect the nomination of Richard Griffin to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Griffin's nomination, which has long been opposed by Republicans, will be voted on later Monday as scheduled.

Who knows?

The juicy tale of how batshit crazy Rep. Michele Bachmann screwed over her presidential campaign staff is fast becoming the greatest soap opera EVER!

First, we learned that Bachmann is refusing to pay five staffers unless they sign a nondisclosure agreement that prohibits them them from talking to any reporters or police about any ""unethical, immoral, or criminal activity"" they may have witnessed during the campaign. And it seems they did witness some, um, questionable activities—including stealing an email list from a home-schooling group.

Then, because leaking that story did not motivate Bachmann to open the checkbook and just pay her damn staff, her especially bitter former field coordinator, Peter Waldron, started dishing the dirt about how Bachmann was basically mind-controlled by her debate coach, whose ""Rasputin-like"" relationship was so powerful, he even forbade her own husband from sleeping in the same room with her on the trail. Which, as we all know, must have been just devastating for poor Marcus.

In today's episode of why you should probably not refuse to pay staffers who know an awful lot of juicy things about you and your potentially illegal campaign activities:



A top adviser in Michele Bachmann's 2012 White House bid has filed a complaint with federal election officials alleging campaign finance violations involving her presidential campaign and the independent political action committee she leads. [...] Waldron, formerly Bachmann's national field coordinator, is accusing the campaign of improperly dipping into money from MichelePAC to pay longtime fundraising consultant Guy Short for presidential campaign work he performed in the critical final weeks ahead of Iowa's caucuses last year. Waldron also alleges that the campaign concealed payments to Iowa state campaign chairman Kent Sorenson, a state senator who abruptly left the Bachmann camp to join then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul's insurgent campaign.

Call me Bachmann-crazy, but I don't think Waldron is going to shut up until he gets a check in his hands. Here's hoping, anyway. Tune in tomorrow ...

GOP has been Rush Limbaugh's bellhop ever since he got influential, he says

LZ: Rush throws around half-truths and insults. Some are disgusted, others entertained

LZ: But it's destructive when people, politicians make him some sort of spokesman

If you want to know why there's little cooperation in Washington these days, I'd start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate George H.W. Bush.

""Read my lips: No new taxes.""

So, when he raised taxes two years later, quite naturally, voters, particularly conservatives, were upset.

If you want to know why so little is being accomplished in Washington these days, I'd start with that broken promise and what Bush did in an attempt to get those conservatives back.

He carried Rush Limbaugh's bags.

They were not friends.

LZ Granderson

In fact, Limbaugh didn't care for Bush that much , and ""41"" knew it. But Bush was seeking re-election. He was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot.

He believed he needed Rush Limbaugh.

The party has been carrying Limbaugh's bags ever since.

So, if you want to know when Washington became so polarized, maybe we should circle August 1, 1988, exactly 25 years ago. That was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and, in the process, made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in American politics today.

""Have any of you heard of an individual by the name of LZ Granderson?"" Limbaugh asked on his show in June 2012. ""Snerdley? He has not heard of LZ Granderson. Dawn, have you? Brian, have you heard of LZ Granderson? Prior to last night I had not heard of LZ Granderson.""

JUST WATCHED Limbaugh: Conservatives lost gay marriage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Limbaugh: Conservatives lost gay marriage 00:52

Which isn't true.

In June 2011, Limbaugh brought me up on his show as well, going so far as to say, ""You can blame me, LZ Granderson, all you want, and I'll take it.""

It only takes a few seconds on ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" website to find out those facts. But Limbaugh isn't on the air to provide facts, he's there to entertain. Many of his listeners understand that.

And many of them don't.

A 1994 New York Times article leading into the midterm election called Limbaugh ""a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994"" and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the Mahi Rushie -- he calls himself that on occasion -- for guidance.

Not much has changed.

During the Affordable Health Care Act debate, callers were actually asking Limbaugh, a shock jock in the mold of Howard Stern, what was in the bill. He even threatened to move to Costa Rica if it was implemented , which seemed counterintuitive, considering Costa Rica has universal health care.

But it's moments like that when you remember that Limbaugh's purpose isn't to provide thoughtful political discourse. It's to vent on his listeners' behalf, to appeal to their censored side. The side that wants to hear a white man say ""nigga"" in public or call a woman a ""slut"" without getting fired.

If that makes you laugh, then he's doing his job.

If that disgusts you, well that's his job, too.

Limbaugh has had us on this yo-yo since the moment he assumed the role of Gabriel in the Kingdom of Reagan 25 years ago. Back then, it was only offensive, because he was the party's megaphone, warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half-truths. It became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman: a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything.

Like use facts.

In rebutting the legitimacy of climate change, Limbaugh once told listeners the United States had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the Constitution was written. That wasn't true, of course, but it sounded good

Not too long ago, he read what he believed to be passages from Obama's senior thesis, passages that expressed a disdain for the U.S. Constitution. Sadly, the whole thing was made up by a blogger. And while Limbaugh did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false, the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying, ""We know he thinks it.""

Some folks eat that kind of stuff up.

Some get riled up about it.

And the folks in Washington? Well, after 25 years, they're still not quite sure what to do with it or him. If you're a Democrat, do you ignore him? If you're a Republican, do you carry his bags? I imagine it's like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you can't determine is a joke or not. You just stand there half-smiling like an idiot.

So, if you want to know what the folks in Washington are doing about the economy, I'd start there."

Cash,"The fragmentation threatens not only the position of Mr. Rove and Crossroads as the dominant Republican players in the world of outside spending, but also the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of business that has flowed from Crossroads to a small circle of consultants and advertising buyers. In 2012, those consultants — many of them sharing the same floor of an office building in Alexandria, Va. — handled much of the media spending by the two Crossroads groups and Restore Our Future, a super PAC that spent $153 million to bolster Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

Mr. Law said Crossroads’ scale and its financial controls help maximize the amount of money that flows to actual advocacy. Because of the volume of advertising the Crossroads groups buy, they have been able to negotiate media buyers’ commissions down to 3 percent or less, far below the traditional rate.

Until recently, Crossroads’ deep ties to the Republican establishment were a source of authority and legitimacy, not controversy. Mr. Rove’s stature provided entree to prominent Republican donors around the country; Mr. Law and other officials there had long résumés with the party’s campaign committees, offering a kind of semiofficial imprimatur with donors and candidates.

But this year, Crossroads announced that it was financing a new effort, the Conservative Victory Project, to intervene in next year’s Republican primaries. Some conservative leaders accused Mr. Rove of trying to squelch anti-establishment candidates.

Now Crossroads appears to be testing a new approach. The group has so far stayed out of Kentucky, for example, where Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, is facing both a Tea Party challenger in the primary and a strong Democratic opponent. Instead, Mr. McConnell is backed by a new group called Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. Although it is legally separate from Crossroads, most of its cash came from Crossroads donors, Mr. Law sits on its board, and the two organizations share a treasurer.

Crossroads has lobbied to help set up similar groups in races where its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors, according to two Republicans with knowledge of the conversations. But Mr. Rove has grown so controversial among some conservatives, the Republicans said, that candidates worry that donors will not contribute to a super PAC if it is connected to Crossroads.

In West Virginia, Mr. Law warned supporters of Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who is a top prospect to win a Senate seat next year, that if they formed their own super PAC, Ms. Capito would not be able to count on significant support from Crossroads, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions."

McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) took strong exception to the filibuster, saying they support the possible use of drones to prevent terrorist attacks anywhere in the world. Some Republicans have privately worried that the high-profile stand, while garnering a lot of positive attention, will ultimately be bad for the party.

""You know, I think he's just on the wrong side of history, and on the wrong side of this argument, really,"" Paul responded in a radio interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee Friday afternoon. He said he respected McCain's service and record, but that that experience didn't mean his colleague was always right: ""I treat Sen. McCain with respect. I don't think I always get the same in return.""

McCain himself was unrepentant, telling Michael Medved Friday that Paul's concerns about a drone attack on U.S. civilians not engaged in violent activity were ""ludicrous"" and ""inappropriate,"" as well as a waste of time.

""We spent 13 hours talking about a scenario that won't happen and can't happen,"" McCain said. He subsequently told Fox News that he does think there should be ""more congressional oversight"" of the drone program, which should be brought under the Department of Defense -- but argued that Paul's filibuster was merely a distraction.

Amash, who has sparred with McCain on Twitter before, replied:

If the Republican Party were a profit-seeking corporation, the current management would be tossed.

A post-election study conducted Dec. 12 by Resurgent Republic, a conservative think tank, concluded that the market for right-wing ideologues is just not there anymore:

Republicans have run out of persuadable white voters. For the fifth time in the past six presidential elections, Republicans lost the popular vote. Trying to win a national election by gaining a larger and larger share of a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate is a losing political proposition.

Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, released findings on Jan. 16 from a Democracy Corp survey that echoed that conclusion:



The Republican Party brand has steeply eroded since Election Day. Half of all voters (51 percent) now give the Party a negative rating and a third rate the party very negatively (under 25 on our 100-point scale).

Even more threatening to conservatives, according to Greenberg, “Strong majorities of voters view the Republican Party’s positions on critical economic and social issues as extreme.”

If you’re a Republican, the evidence on the party’s near-term prospects is pretty grim:

On a host of issues, the Republican Party is perceived as out of the mainstream:

Photo

Republicans traditionally defer to rank, but in 2016 the party will need a presidential candidate who understands his (or her) party’s ideological and demographic liabilities and can pull it out of a nosedive — no small task. The last candidate to manage this feat? Bill Clinton.

An item that should go on the top of the priority list: dump the party’s super PACs and the men and women who run them, including Karl Rove.

The monied wing of the Republican Party suffers from what political scientists call a “resource curse” — the same “paradox of plenty” that blocks the advancement of oil-rich countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. Too much cash flowing from big donors to super PACs and tax-exempt organizations is the Republican curse.

In the 2012 election, major Republican-leaning independent expenditure committees, including Restore Our Future and American Crossroads, spent $579 million, more than three times the $168 million spent by pro-Democratic groups like Priorities USA and the Service Employees International Union.

Despite losing, a network of favored Republican consultants and contractors emerged from the election richer than before: Mentzer Media Services, Inc. collected fees of $141 million; Crossroads Media LLC, $90.8 million; Target Enterprises, $15.2 million; Arena Communications, $12.8 million. For the Republican operatives running these companies, 2012 was hardly a defeat. It was a business bonanza.

William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, wasn’t happy after last year’s presidential election and not just because of the results:

Reading about some conservative organizations and Republican campaigns these days, one is reminded of Eric Hoffer’s remark, “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.” It may be that major parts of American conservatism have become such a racket that a kind of refounding of the movement as a cause is necessary. A reinvigoration of the Republican Party also seems desirable, based on a new generation of leaders, perhaps coming ​— ​as did Ike and Reagan​ — ​from outside the normal channels.

Three presidential campaigns earlier, Kristol and David Brooks (who was then a senior editor for The Weekly Standard) were convinced that the McCain 2000 campaign for president offered a “refounding.” Kristol and Brooks wrote:

The two great Republican general-election victories of the recent past grew out of intraparty insurrections. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, fresh from challenging a sitting Republican president in 1976, ran against a party establishment represented in various ways by Howard Baker, George Bush, and John Connally. A decade later, Newt Gingrich led an insurrection, first against the Bush budget deal and then against Bob Michel and the Republican congressional establishment, which culminated in the Republican landslide of 1994. Now we are witnessing a third insurrection. John McCain is taking on the Republican establishment. In New Hampshire, he crushed it.

In practice, the McCain insurgency in 2000 was short-lived, posing a serious threat to George W. Bush for less than three weeks — from the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, 2000, to the South Carolina contest on Feb. 19. The brief life of the McCain campaign suggests that future reform efforts will face intense hostility.

I asked Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia how parties can change direction after defeat. Sabato responded by e-mail:

The hardest thing for a party to do is to make painful choices that require a break-up within the old coalition in order to create a new, more competitive coalition. Usually, only repeated losses —being hit over the head with a two-by-four — will motivate a party to try something truly different.

After the disastrous 1964 presidential bid of Barry Goldwater, Sabato pointed out, Richard Nixon and others

grasped that the old moderate-liberal Republican establishment was history. J.F.K. and L.B.J. had converted African-Americans almost wholly, and white liberals too, with the New Frontier-Great Society and civil rights. What was left? Homeless Southern conservatives, who gravitated toward the G.O.P. and pushed out of power the congressional and gubernatorial moderates. The liberal G.O.P. wing had to die to make way for a much larger trove of conservative Southern votes.

At the moment, reactionary forces have a death grip on the Republican Party, and their power has been cemented by the party’s institutionalization of closed primaries and caucuses (neither independents nor Democrats can participate) in more than half the states.

Republican opponents of change also hold on to the hope that the American economy will be mired in a period of slow growth, damaging to whichever party is in power. The premise of this strategy is that hard-pressed voters will turn on the Democrats.

The rate of growth since the 2007-8 collapse has been about half the average rate in past post-recession periods. Take a look at this chart from the Congressional Budget Office:

Still, for Republicans to gamble on a listless economy is inherently risky. Jan Hatzius, chief economist for global investment research at Goldman Sachs, argues that in economic terms, “2013 might feel a little friendlier than 2012,” picking up steam after the Obama administration and Congress resolve their fiscal and budgetary disputes.

Favorable reports on housing and employment last week boosted the stock market as well as Obama’s approval ratings, which on Jan. 17 stood at 52 percent, among his highest since early 2009.

The major factor encouraging Republican inertia is that the party’s setbacks have not reached the crisis stage; it still controls the House 233 to 200 (there are two current vacancies).

That majority rests on the weak reed of gerrymandering, however, and on the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas. Democratic House candidates actually won the popular vote by one million more votes than Republicans, 56 million to 55 million.

In North Carolina, Bloomberg news found that Democrats won 2.22 million votes to 2.14 million cast for Republican candidates, but Republicans won 9 of the state’s 13 House seats. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Democrats won 2.7 million votes to the Republicans’ 2.6 million, but Democrats ended up with only 5 of the state’s 18 districts.

The fast-approaching budget and sequestration fights have created a dilemma for Republican House leaders. If the party backs its conservative wing and allows the country to go into default later this year or submits to the draconian cuts mandated by sequestration, Republicans in swing districts could turn the House over to Democrats in 2014. If Republicans go in the opposite direction and compromise, significant numbers of House members will face primary challenges from the right.

With more and more Republicans aware that their party is on the ropes, how will its core constituencies respond, especially the Christian right and the Tea Party, which appear likely to lose power in an intra-party realignment? Will they passively accept diminished influence or will they lash out against their fellow Republicans?

If the conservative movement continues on its downward trajectory, the American business community, which has the most to lose from Republican failure, will be the key force arguing for moderation.

The problem that faces business leaders pressing for reform is not just the normal reluctance of a political party to change. Instead, it is the fact that much of the Republican electorate, as presently constructed, is profoundly committed — morally and ideologically — to “traditional values.” You’re asking groups of people to change who were brought together by their resistance to change. Their opposition to change is why they are Republicans.

The right coalition includes a subset of conservatives determined to preserve white hegemony. Add to that social conservatives who oppose both the women’s rights and gay rights movements, and the religiously observant who are dead set against burgeoning secularism and what they see as the erosion of faith in public life.

These voters see the breakneck speed with which big business alters familiar patterns of life — innovation, but also joblessness, foreclosure and broken communities — as laying waste to much they hold dear. Business — that is, capitalism — drives a “perennial gale of creative destruction,” as the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously put it. This gale, by definition, is anti-conservative.

Survey data reveals the profound resistance on the right to cultural disruption. Poll after poll shows that Republicans believe politicians should stand firmly against compromising core principles, by much higher margins than either Democrats or independents.

An indirect but important reflection of partisan attitudes to change is visible in the higher percentage of Republicans, 58 percent, who believe in creationism – defined in this survey as the belief that God created human beings in their present form within the last 10,000 years – than Democrats, 41 percent, and independents, 39 percent.

In effect, for many cultural and social conservatives, being a Republican is not just an allegiance to one of two major political parties but a deeply held belief system, an ideology with a strong religious core.

The Tea Party and the Christian Coalition exist in an inevitably fraught alliance with high finance, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable.

The center-right coalition, in fact, needs more than new management. Over time, its leadership and candidates face the task of breaking up irreconcilable factions and merging the most viable parts with new constituencies, including suburbanites angry over rising tax burdens and increasingly affluent Hispanic and Asian voters.

Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at M.I.T. who studies the evolution of American parties, responded by email to my query about partisan restructuring. Republicans, he said,

need to figure out what the settled parts of American politics are these days — settled matters that they, in their heart of hearts would like to change, but which they agree not to change. That probably includes a much more tolerant society and a dedication to a certain level of social insurance as an obligation embraced by the federal government. The Tea Party leaders won’t be able to do that, unless they change their spots thoroughly.

The success of the Republican Party in rural areas, exurbs and in the South has come at a cost. Socially conservative voters will resist changing their spots. When, and if, Republican leaders determine that the demands of these voters for “massive resistance” to abortion, contraception and immigration are futile, they will have to decide whether to cut them loose. No matter what happens, social conservatives are unlikely to become Democrats. It may not be too long before they find themselves with a choice of their own: withdraw from party politics or hold their noses and stick with the Republicans."

Washington (CNN) - The government shutdown showdown is getting ugly.

Republican Rep. Peter King said Friday that his Republican colleague in the Senate, Ted Cruz, ""is a fraud"" who will ""no longer have any influence in the Republican Party"" after the House votes on a measure that could potentially lead to a government shutdown.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

King made his comments while on his way to a Republican meeting, shortly before the House was set to begin debating, then voting on the bill. The legislation provides funds for the government to stay afloat past the end of the fiscal year on September 30, but only if money for Obamacare is cut out.

Ted Cruz: Obamacare fight 'just beginning'

The idea to tie the president's health care law to the government funding bill was aggressively pushed by Cruz and other Senate conservatives, including Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee, this summer.

The House is expected to pass the bill, which will then go to the Democratic-controlled Senate where the Obamacare amendment will likely be killed. The bill would then be sent back to the House, which would have to decide whether to pass it and keep the government running, or defeat it and possibly see a government shutdown.

King, who's been strongly opposed to the bill, has essentially compared the strategy to a suicide mission.

""I hope people will get the message this guy is bad for the party,"" King said Friday, talking about Cruz, a potential 2016 presidential candidate. King is also a potential White House contender, as he has said he's thinking about running for president.

Asked if the House vote was more of a message to conservatives than to Obama, King said the vote is a signal that the GOP has ""to take more realistic and practical approaches.""

The congressman has said before that he can start ignoring the senator from Texas after the vote. He reiterated Friday he hopes that's still the case.

""We can't be going off on these false missions that Ted Cruz wants us to go on. The issues are too important. They're too serious, they require real conservative solutions, not cheap headline-hunting schemes,"" he said.



Read: Cruz tries to make amends with angry conservatives

Cruz angered House conservatives earlier this week when he admitted in a statement that he doubts the Senate has enough votes to pass a government funding measure that also defunds Obamacare. He has nonetheless vowed to keep fighting in the Senate to generate support for the measure.

But with some Senate Republicans already saying they won't support Cruz in the effort, the chances of him succeeding so far appear unlikely.

Jennifer Carroll resigned amid fallout from a probe into Internet cafes that are fronts for gambling

Carroll proposed a bill when she was in the Legislature that would benefit Internet cafes

Authorities refused to discuss any ties between Carroll and the investigation

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida's lieutenant governor resigned and nearly 60 other people were charged in a widening scandal of a purported veterans charity that authorities said Wednesday was a $300 million front for illegal gambling.

Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll's resignation came a day after she was questioned in the investigation. Her public relations firm did work for the St. Augustine, Fla.-based charity Allied Veterans of the World, but she has not been accused of wrongdoing.

Authorities said the probe involved 57 arrest warrants and 54 search warrants issued at gambling operations in 23 Florida counties and five other states: Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said charges, which will be formally filed next week, include racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and possession of slot machines.

""It's callous and it's despicable,"" Bondi said of the alleged scam, which she said ""insults every American who ever wore a military uniform.""

Authorities refused to discuss any ties between Carroll, a 53-year-old Republican, and the investigation. Her aides had no immediate comment.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday he has no knowledge on whether Carroll had broken the law but said she resigned so her former ties to the company would not be a distraction for the administration..

Carroll, a Navy veteran who served in the Gulf War, appeared in a TV ad in 2011 promoting the organization's charitable work on behalf of veterans and their families.

Her resignation letter to Scott offered no details about her reason for leaving, and the Republican governor would not say whether he asked her to resign.

""I will not elaborate on the details of her resignation further, other than to say that she resigned and she made the right decision for the state and her family,"" Scott said.

Allied Veterans evolved from a charitable organization that ran bingo games and held bake sales for veterans beginning in 1979 to a group suspected of operating more than 40 illegal gambling locations around Florida, according to an Internal Revenue Service affidavit. The veterans' charity was a fraud, according to the IRS.

""In an effort to mislead the public into believing that it is not profiting from an illegal gambling enterprise, Allied Veterans and others have engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to defraud,"" the affidavit said.

One of those arrested, Jacksonville, Fla., lawyer Kelly Mathis, is the alleged mastermind of the scheme, authorities said. Mathis is accused of making about $6 million alone from the gambling operation.

From 2007 to early 2012, investigators found evidence of more than $6 million in what appear to be charitable donations by Allied Veterans. However, that amount was only about 2% of more than $290 million made from gambling operations during that period. Instead of going to veterans, the vast majority of the money went to for-profit companies and the individuals who operated Allied Veterans and its so-called ""affiliates.""

Authorities said they seized about 300 bank accounts containing $64.7 million and assets including such exotic vehicles as Maseratis, Porsches and Ferraris.

To play games at one of the Internet cafes, a customer gets a prepaid card and then goes to a computer to play ""sweepstakes."" The games, with spinning wheels similar to slot machines, have names such as ""Captain Cash,"" ""Lucky Shamrocks"" and ""Money Bunny,"" according to the IRS.

Winners go back to a cashier with their cards and cash out.

The games have been the subject of much debate in Florida, and some are legal as long as most of the profits are donated to charity.

Each of the locations had a big sign prominently displayed that read: ""This is not a gaming establishment."" Inside were rows of computers where patrons could play the various games.

At most of the sites, employees wore shirts emblazoned with an ""Allied Veterans"" logo. On the walls were photos of company executives making donations on its behalf and letters of recognition from some of the charities that received donations.

In Anadarko, Okla., the owner of International Internet Technologies, which was accused of supplying the cafes with software, was arrested along with his wife.

Chase Egan Burns, 37, and his wife, 38-year-old Kristin Burns, faced charges including racketeering and conspiracy in Florida. International Internet Technologies made $63 million from the Florida operation from 2007 to 2010, according to the IRS affidavit.

Burns' wife's role in the company was not immediately clear.

Chase Burns was released from Caddo County jail on a $500,000 bond. He denied any wrongdoing.

""What we do is legal,"" he told The Oklahoman on Monday.

His father, Tony Burns, also serves as his lawyer. Tony Burns told the newspaper that his son broke no laws.

""What Chase was doing was he was actually selling the Internet time,"" Tony Burns said. ""That's was what his business was — providing the software. And there's nothing illegal about providing software to any business.""

Calls to the Burnses on Wednesday were not immediately returned.

A telephone number listed for Allied Veterans was disconnected. Multiple e-mails to an address listed on the group's website weren't returned.

Former Florida state Rep. Scott Plakon, a Republican, said he filed bills to shut down the gaming sites in 2011 and 2012.

""I found that this is gambling, happening right next door to our Publix (grocery store) and dry cleaner, and it just didn't seem right,"" he said.

Carroll, an immigrant from Trinidad, served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, working as a jet mechanic before retiring as a lieutenant commander. Elected to the state House in 2003, she's served as deputy majority leader and majority whip. She's also a former executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs. She moved to Florida in 1986.

A married mother of three, Carroll has a son who plays defensive back for the Miami Dolphins.

Carroll was the brunt of late-night talk show hosts last summer after she apologized for offending lesbians when she said black women who engage in those relationships don't look like her.

Carroll, who was implying that black lesbians aren't attractive, made the remarks when she was asked about court documents in which a fired staffer claimed that she walked in on Carroll and a female travel aide in a compromising position. Carroll denies that claim.

The former staffer is charged with violating state law for allegedly giving a recording of a conversation with Carroll's chief of staff to a newspaper reporter.

Fitzsimmons'],Christie Ally Resigning From Port Authority,"A Port Authority official with close ties to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is resigning after state lawmakers questioned whether lane closings on the George Washington Bridge that led to extensive traffic backups in September were politically motivated.

The official, David Wildstein, will resign as the director of interstate capital projects at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on Jan. 1, according to a letter he wrote to the agency’s deputy executive director, Bill Baroni. The resignation was first reported by The Record newspaper, of northern New Jersey. Mr. Wildstein said in the letter that the lane closing issue had become “a distraction.”

The agency reduced the number of access lanes to the bridge without prior notice, causing traffic delays in Fort Lee, N.J., from Sept. 9 to 13. Mr. Baroni told a panel of lawmakers last month that Mr. Wildstein had ordered the lane closings as part of a traffic study.

But Democrats raised concerns that the decision could have been political because Fort Lee’s mayor, Mark Sokolich, declined to endorse Governor Christie for re-election. Mr. Christie has denied any involvement in the closings."

""The policies have been arbitrary, inconsistent, and ever-changing,"" Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said.

He alleged the National Park Service is trying to make the partial shutdown ""as painful and as visible as possible.""

GOP lawmakers sharply questioned a string of recent NPS moves, as Director Jonathan Jarvis claimed his agency was trying to comply with the law and make do with limited resources. They questioned why the park service tried to shutter some private businesses on federal land, closed off open-air memorials in D.C. to most public viewing, and even blocked off parking lots.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said ""punitive measures were taken at no savings to the American people.""

Reacting to a reported internal claim that the park service directed workers to make the cuts as difficult as possible, Issa said, if true, ""it is indeed disgusting and despicable that the Park Service would do this.""

Jarvis later called that claim ""hearsay.""

Jarvis was compelled with a subpoena to testify on Wednesday. He said he was willing to appear, but wanted to wait until his staff returned from furlough.

In a series of feisty exchanges, Jarvis defended his agency's actions.

""Turning away visitors is not our culture or our DNA,"" he said.

He said that in Washington, D.C., the agency typically has 300 employees on duty to manage and patrol the District's famed monuments and sites. All but a dozen were furloughed, he said.

Explaining the decisions to close off memorials, including open-air sites like the World War II Memorial, he said the agency took ""prudent and practical steps."" He said the agency has worked ""diligently"" to ensure ""honor flights"" of WWII veterans were not turned away from the memorials despite the restrictions -- allowing them access on the basis of their First Amendment rights.

""With very few employees available, we are endeavoring to fulfill our mission the best we can,"" Jarvis said.

He denied politics were involved, and said all monuments have to be staffed to protect them from vandalism and other harm.

Democrats, meanwhile, took turns lambasting the GOP majority for holding the hearing in the first place, claiming their party was responsible for the partial government shutdown which triggered the parks cuts.

Six of the most vulnerable Republicans:

Dan Benishek, Kerry Bentivolio, Gary Miller, Mike Coffman, Tim Walberg, and Bill Young

Last week, the progressive activist group MoveOn commissioned Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling to conduct surveys in two dozen individual House districts held by Republicans, in order to gauge how the ongoing federal government shutdown might affect the 2014 midterm elections. They released the data on Sunday, and they offer positive news for Democrats. (You can find a table summarizing the key findings below the fold.)

MoveOn selected an array of potentially vulnerable seats across the nation, but because not all of these races feature challengers as yet (though most do), they tested the incumbents against the proverbial ""generic Democrat."" Before even addressing any questions about the shutdown, 17 of these 24 Republicans trail their hypothetical opponents. (Two are tied.) These results appear closely correlated with job approval ratings, as all but two of these 17 congressmen sport negative scores—that is, more voters disapprove than approve of their performance in office.

PPP then asked a trio of questions to elicit voters' feelings about the GOP's attempts to derail the implementation of Obamacare by holding the federal budget and, potentially, the debt hostage:



Do you support or oppose Congress shutting down major activities of the federal government as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place? Do you support or oppose Congress holding back on increasing the nation’s borrowing limit, which could result in a default, as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place? Would you be less likely or more likely to support Congressman X if you knew he

voted to support shutting down major activities of the federal government as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place, or does it not make a difference?

In almost every district, respondents said they opposed both tactics on the budget and debt, and they also said they'd be less likely to vote for their congressman if he support a shutdown to block ""the health care law"" (i.e., the Affordable Care Act). PPP then asked a so-called ""informed ballot"" question, again pairing each incumbent against a generic Democrat. As you might expect, the messaging contained in the prior three questions helped move the needle against Republicans in almost every case, by an average of 3 net points."

Don Young (R-Alaska) on Friday for his use of the slur ""wetbacks"" to refer to Latino farm workers, with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) issuing statements rebuking the congressman's use of the term.

""Congressman Young’s remarks were offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds,"" Boehner said. ""I don’t care why he said it -- there’s no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology.""

Cornyn issued a similar comment.

""Migrant workers come to America looking for opportunity and a way to provide a better life for their families,"" Cornyn said. ""They do not come to this country to hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials. The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity.""

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Young's words ""emphatically do not represent the beliefs of the Republican Party.""

Young made the remark on Thursday during a radio interview with KRBD-FM when speaking about the agricultural industry.

""My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,"" Young said. ""It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.""

He offered an apology of sorts later, saying the term was used commonly in his youth. ""I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect,"" he said.

DREAM Action Coalition, a group of undocumented youth advocacy group, urged Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), members of a bipartisan ""gang of eight"" drafting immigration reform legislation, to speak out against Young's comments.

""As senators that come from states with large latino and immigrant communities, Sen. Schumer and Sen. Rubio must condemn these insensible remarks to demonstrate their commitment to fixing our broken immigration system and demonstrate neither party will tolerate insulting remarks against Latinos, immigrants, or any community in our country,"" the group said in a statement.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas) had urged Boehner and his fellow Republicans earlier Friday to denounce Young's comments.

""As the Republican minority outreach efforts develop, I'd advise their strategists to list 'don't say racial slurs like ""wetback""' as a bedrock for their messaging,"" Hinojosa said in a statement. ""Our country needs reform that can only be achieved with a bipartisan effort. I am urging Republican leaders, including Speaker Boehner, to condemn this behavior and ask members in their party to act responsibly.""

UPDATE: 1:50 p.m. -- Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the gang of eight, tweeted a condemnation of Young's remarks later on Friday.

Don Young's comments were offensive and have no place in our Party or in our nation's discourse. He should apologize immediately — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) March 29, 2013

UPDATE: 2:15 p.m. -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) piled on later, also apparently not viewing Young's semi-apology as adequate.

""Congressman Young's comments were deeply hurtful, offensive and inappropriate for anyone to utter, let alone a Member of the United States Congress,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Congressman Young should fully apologize for deeply offensive comments that were not appropriate in his youth or now.""

UPDATE: 4:00 p.m. -- Young issued an apology on Friday afternoon.

""I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan, Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform."""

Mitt Romney speaks with Chris Wallace on FOX News Sunday in Manchester, N.H. Wallace said on Sunday, Feb. 24, 2013, that he has landed the first post-election interview with Romney and his wife, Ann. The interview will air on his show next week (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)

WASHINGTON -- The bartender who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's infamous ""47 percent"" remarks at a Boca Raton fundraiser last May had an idea of what the former Massachusetts governor and GOP presidential nominee was really like. The two had crossed paths before.

The filmmaker tells The Huffington Post that he had actually met Romney at a previous fundraiser, held months before at the home of private equity manager Marc Leder. At that event, which included drinks and a quick speech by the presidential candidate, the would-be filmmaker also tended bar.

He and Romney shared a typical bartender-to-patron moment.

""I handed him a diet Coke with lemon on it,"" the filmmaker recalled, ""because I was told that that's what he drank.""

Romney didn't acknowledge his server at all.

""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" the filmmaker explained. ""I presented him the exact right drink that he wanted ... Had it there, sitting there on a napkin. He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a 'thank you' or anything else.""

HuffPost has agreed to withhold the name of the surreptitious filmmaker until he breaks his silence on MSNBC's ""The Ed Show"" Wednesday evening, followed by an appearance on HuffPost Live Thursday morning. In interviews over the last several months, he laid out his thinking before and after Romney's speech.

The filmmaker had worked in the service industry for years, starting out after high school as a club doorman in Boston. He slowly worked his way up to bartender and then operations manager and general manager at a downtown nightclub. He had wanted to be a cop and hoped to get a degree in criminal justice from Northeastern. When he couldn't afford to complete his degree, he still had his night-club jobs.

He moved to Florida about 10 years ago. He told HuffPost that former President Bill Clinton had partly inspired him to release the video: He had worked at a Clinton event at which the politician had made an effort to greet the cooks and waiters. Romney had been the opposite.

""You can tell a lot about someone the way they take a drink from you,"" he said. ""[Romney] took it and just turned his back."""

Her father, Paul Laxalt, was himself a U.S. senator from Nevada from 1974 to 1987 and served as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He is still active in politics; the 90-year-old worked behind the scenes to build support in Nevada for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Laxalt declined to comment.

In her own statement to the paper, Michelle Laxalt said she asked Domenici to ""agree that this remain private between the two of us."" She raised the son, Adam Paul Laxalt, as a single mother. According to past Virginia voter registration records, he was born in August 1978, 35 years ago. Michelle Laxalt would have been 24 at the time; Domenici would have been 46.

""Given the fact that both my father and the father of my child were United States senators, I felt strongly that I would make this choice according to my values and would not seek advice, input or permission,"" she said. Laxalt's sister Kathleen (Neena) Laxalt was clueless.

Adam Laxalt is not commenting on his parents' relationship.

""I have lived my entire life as a private citizen and intend to remain one,"" he said. ""I plan to address personal issues privately and will not be commenting or joining any public discussion.""

The 80-year-old Domenici retired in 2008 after six terms, citing a degenerative brain disease. He and his wife, Nancy, have eight children. He told the Albuquerque Journal that his family has known about his affair for several months.

“I have apologized as best as I can to my wife, and we have worked together to strengthen our relationship,” he said.

Adam Laxalt is a lawyer working in Las Vegas, who served five years in the Navy. After a troubled adolescence that included a battle with alcoholism, he got a bachelors and law degree from Georgetown University. He provided legal counsel on detainee operations in Iraq. He also served as a law clerk for the U.S. Air Force general counsel; as an aide to John Bolton in the State Department; and as a staffer for former senator John Warner (R-Va.). He has written op-eds on health-care reform and Don't Ask Don't Tell, among other issues. Michelle Laxalt is the founder of a Washington lobbying firm who served in the Reagan administration.

Domenici is not the only lawmaker (or former lawmaker) to have hidden a child. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who is unmarried, recently disclosed that he has a 24-year-old daughter whom he learned about three years ago. A 2008 drunken driving incident led former congressman Vito Fossella (R-N.Y.) to acknowledge his long-running affair and out-of-wedlock daughter. Essie Mae Washington-Williams, the mixed-race daughter whom Strom Thurmond kept secret for 70 years, died earlier this month. She revealed her parentage only after her father, a former senator from South Carolina, died in 2003."

After letting his listeners know that Bashir said on his MSNBC show that Palin deserved this “dose of discipline” a Jamaican slave master leveled on his slaves, Levin said Bashir likely had delivered the “most disgraceful rant” yet against Palin.

“Hey tough guy. You like picking on women? You like picking on a mother and a grandmother?” Levin said to Bashir. “You strike me as not tough at all, if you get my drift.”

Levin then blasted the “pathetic little carbon footprint called MSNBC” for being so “offended with Palin” comparing the federal debt to slavery that they would allow such rants. He said the network should be called the “animal channel” or the “comedy channel.”

Levin said Palin was exactly right to compare the federal debt to slavery and nothing was offensive about it, since she was not making a comparison to chattel slavery.

Levin then said “his people,” the “Jewish people,” were slaves, and he did not for one minute think Palin’s comparison was made to “diminish Jewish people or the early days of the nation.”

Levin then called out women’s group like the National Organization for Women (NOW) for “never” coming to the defense of conservative women like Palin.

Levin said these groups never defend conservative women from misogyny, even when it takes a turn towards the vile and filthy, because “they are not feminist groups. They are left-wing groups. They don’t care about women. They care about left-wing women.”

He said groups like NOW would “worship” Palin if she were a left-wing politician."

It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced

Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, part of the Republican whip team responsible for marshaling support for legislation, said the current makeup of House Republicans could be divided roughly into a third who voted in favor of the bill because they wanted it to pass, a third who voted against the bill because they wanted it to fail, and a third who voted against the bill but had their fingers crossed that it would pass and avert a fiscal and political calamity. One lawmaker, Mr. Cole said, told him that while he did not want to vote in favor of the bill, he also did not want to amend it and send it back to the Senate where it might die and leave House Republicans blamed for tax increases. “So I said, ‘What you’re really telling me is that you want it to pass, but you don’t want to vote for it,'” recalled Mr. Cole, who voted yes.

Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and once the top spokesman for the former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican, described the phenomenon thusly: “These are people who are political realists, they’re political pragmatists who want to see progress made in Washington, but are politically constrained from making compromises because they will be challenged in the primary.”

Congressman Cole is adamant that he will not accede to President Obama's unequivocal demand to raise it without any spending cuts tied to it. “I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that,"" Cole told me in a phone interview. ""We didn’t downgrade our credit [in 2011] because of the debt ceiling fight. We downgraded in my view because when we had the fight we didn’t cut enough,"" Cole said. ""Just raising the debt ceiling with no compromise sends the wrong message—that we think we can willy-nilly go on forever."" ""If there are not serious cuts, the Republican votes are not going to be there,"" Cole continued.

Even as Republican officials maintain the GOP majority is safe, several lawmakers and longtime activists warn of far-reaching political ramifications if voters perceive Republicans as botching consequential talks on the debt ceiling, sequestration and a possible government shutdown. “Majorities are elected to do things, and if they become dysfunctional, the American people will change what the majority is,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a House deputy majority whip and a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, told The Hill.

So far in 2013, House Speaker John Boehner has relied on Democratic votes to overcome overwhelming Republican opposition on back-to-back pieces of legislation: the Hurricane Sandy relief aid package on Tuesday night and the tax cliff deal from two weeks earlier. But if you think this proves that most Republicans have marginalized themselves and that Democrats are now an essential part of making the House function, House Majority Deputy Whip Tom Cole of Oklahoma says you're wrong. Why? Because, he says , secretly about half of Republicans who voted no actually wanted the legislation to pass:And why would a Republican vote no while secretly hoping for yes?In other words, about half of Republicans who vote with the hardline reactionary fringe aren't actually devoted wingnut true believers—they are actually just cowards, afraid of standing up to their political base. Whatever you think of the ethics of that, it's an invaluable insight for Democrats to remember as we move forward on issues like the debt limit. Take, for example, what the aforementioned Tom Cole said yesterday about the debt limit:Tough talk, except this is the guy who just said half of Republicans who voted no on the tax cliff deal actually supported it. And given that Cole voted for the tax cliff deal and the Hurricane Sandy package, it's not a shock that he might vote no on a clean debt deal, passing the responsibility to another one of his colleagues. But when you listen to a third interview with Cole , also from yesterday, it seems clear that he knows Republicans need to let the debt limit go up, no matter how he votes.So basically we're looking at a House Republican Conference in which members want to (a) develop a voting record that protects them from primary challenges while (b) not actually having that voting record influence the final outcome, because if it does, then they worry they will lose the majority in the general election. And if that's not a golden opportunity for Democrats to put House Republicans on defense throughout the 113th Congress, then nothing is."

Corzine, for using “one-shot gimmicks” to balance the budget, called it “unconscionable” to take away property tax rebates and railed against issuing more debt for transportation projects, promising to “start saying no to spending.”

But in four years in office, Governor Christie, a Republican, has relied on the same kind of short-term strategies, diverting money for things like affordable housing and property tax rebates to balance the budget, and tapping funds intended for development of new sources of energy to keep the lights on in state buildings.

Mr. Christie made headlines when he declared he was canceling construction of a tunnel under the Hudson River to halt runaway costs, but he has issued more debt for transportation projects than any of his predecessors. Overall spending has risen 14 percent, and while state surpluses nationwide are growing, New Jersey’s has shrunk to its lowest percentage in a decade. The state’s bond rating is among the worst in the country.

Mr. Christie’s record is drawing scrutiny now, not only because he is emphasizing that he “restored fiscal sanity” to the state as he seeks re-election next week, but also because of his possible presidential candidacy: As a Northeastern Republican, he needs a way to connect with the party’s conservative base, and a strong message of fiscal management could help him offset skepticism about his positions on social issues."

With some ingenuity, he might even be able to lead and keep his speakership.

We tend to think of John Boehner as the helpless pawn of an ungovernable caucus, under the thumb of ideologues who prevent the otherwise sane speaker from being the dealmaker he is at heart.

In this view, Boehner has little choice — he must capitulate to the anarchists’ demands or lose his speakership.

Two responses:

First, so what? Is the title worth the hassle? Does Boehner want to be remembered as the speaker who led his party — or, more accurately, followed it — over the cliff of shutdown and default? Let Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz be speaker if he wants the job.

Boehner has been practicing the tantrum theory of leadership: letting the crazies in his caucus have their meltdown until they’ve gotten it out of their system and are ready to listen to reason.

In the current situation, you could imagine that having the tantrum over funding the government could be usefully cathartic, clearing the decks for more reasonable behavior over the debt ceiling. Except that Boehner has been ginning up his caucus for a debt-ceiling fight, where he believes Republicans will have more leverage with the president (maybe) and suffer less political damage (doubtful).

Perhaps the fallout from a shutdown — among voters and in the market — would be chastening enough to convince Republicans to back away from the far more cataclysmic prospect of leaving the government unable to borrow enough money to cover its debts.

But as every parent eventually discovers, sometimes you have to step in and tell the kids to cut it out. Now. Because if you don’t, you will lurch from tantrum to tantrum, forever at the mercy of tiny terrorists. And these tiny terrorists have nuclear weapons in the form of a default on the debt.

Which brings me to the second response: Maybe Boehner has more power than he seems to believe. What if Boehner brought his proposed solution for funding the government to the House floor — even if it would require giving up relying on only Republican votes and instead relying on Democrats to help it pass?

Let Boehner dare his caucus not to follow him. How naïve, you’re thinking. He’d be out as speaker before you could say Eric Cantor.

Maybe not. In the history of the House, no speaker has been forcibly removed from office. The closest things came, according to Catholic University political scientist Matthew N. Green, an expert on the speakership, occurred in 1910, when Republican Speaker Joe Cannon faced a revolt from a group of progressive Republicans and the Democratic delegation, which ended up stripping the heavy-handed speaker of some powers.

Ann Telnaes animation: Countdown to government shutdown (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Notably, when Cannon requested a vote to remove him from office, the rebels caved, with Republican insurgents unwilling to accept a Democratic speaker and Democrats feeling similarly. “I was given more votes than at the beginning of Congress,” Cannon observed in his autobiography.

Likewise, when Speaker Newt Gingrich faced a brewing coup in 1997, he simply refused to resign his speakership and warned the plotters (among whom was one John Boehner) that they risked ending up with a Speaker Dick Gephardt, the Democrats’ leader. That was not likely to happen, or if it did, to last for very long, but the insurrection quickly evaporated.

In the current situation, there’s no doubt that House Republicans seeking to oust Boehner could bring that effort to the floor; under House procedures, it would be a privileged motion entitled to speedy consideration.

But even if it were to succeed — presumably with a combination of Democrats and tea party Republicans — Republicans would have to worry about what happens next. Under House practice, the speaker is chosen by a majority of those present and voting.

If Democrats voted present, Boehner could regain the speakership with a mere majority of his caucus — not a majority of the entire House.

If Democrats voted for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, it’s unclear that traumatized, fractured Republicans would be able to summon a majority of the whole House for one of their own — Majority Leader Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy or Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.

Challenging the speaker is risky business. Which is why it’s time for this speaker to start taking some risks — for his country as well as his legacy.

During his successful 2010 campaign for Florida governor, Republican Rick Scott adopted a rescue Labrador retriever and named the pooch Reagan. Scott won the election, but the dog isn't living it up in the governor's mansion.

So where the heck is Reagan? Has the dog entered the witness protection program?

[Related: Lucky the dog reunited with owners after 5 months, 380 miles]

The Tampa Bay Times vowed to find out—and eventually did.

Reporters who noticed that Reagan hadn't been seen since early 2011 asked members of the governor's staff for answers, but were rebuffed. The paper then conducted a Woodward and Bernstein-style investigation into the missing dog, and the resulting article is definitely worth a read, especially for the passive-aggressive back and forth between the governor's director of communications and the reporters.

Reporters doggedly pursued the story, and Brian Burgess, who served as communications director during the Scott campaign and now works for the Florida GOP, dodged questions.

""At one point an exasperated reporter asked Burgess if he had killed the dog,"" wrote the paper, ""and Burgess denied ever killing a dog, but still wouldn't say where Reagan was.""

And then comes the money quote:

Late Wednesday, Burgess testily emailed that he was working on an answer and recognized ""the potential for a PR nightmare if the Tampa Bay Times doesn't receive a photo of Reagan next to today's copy of the Tampa Bay Times. So take it to the bank I'm getting you every bit of info I can lay my hands on.""

At last, the reporters asked Gov. Scott about Reagan. The governor said, ""He was a rescue dog, and he couldn't be around anybody that was carrying anything, and so he wouldn't get better."" Scott said that Reagan ""scared the living daylights"" out of people at the governor's mansion. A kitchen employee, he added, threatened to quit and a photographer was scared of the pooch's barking.

[Related: Dog who wouldn't die home after surgery]

So Reagan was sent back. The Scott family now has a new dog, Tallee, who comes with his own set of challenges.

""This dog is the neediest dog,"" said Scott. ""When I worked out this morning, he wants to be right next to you the whole time. If you do a pushup, he wants to be underneath you as you do a pushup. He's a sweet dog."""

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-infighting-fierce-even-western-strongholds-132911234--election.html,,[],GOP infighting fierce even in Western strongholds,"MONTPELIER, Idaho (AP) — Republicans have made the Mountain West a stronghold, which is why brewing party brawls in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah are bedeviling loyalists who yearn for GOP unity.

Closely watched elections this month in Virginia and New Jersey did little to resolve the growing struggle between tea partyers and the Republican establishment. Now, some of the sharpest infighting is shifting to the rugged Big Sky region, where the tea party scored its first major victory, ousting a veteran Republican U.S. senator in a Utah party convention three years ago.

""We have to have this fight,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican facing a tea party challenger next May as he seeks a ninth House term. The struggle will continue well into the next presidential race, he said.

Simpson and three-term U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi from neighboring Wyoming are chief targets of tea party and anti-establishment groups that prize ideological purity above all, even if it leads to legislative defeats. It's not enough, these groups say, that both men hold top ratings from conservative organizations such as the National Rifle Association.

Republicans run little risk of losing congressional races to Democrats in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. But if longtime incumbents such as Simpson and Enzi can fend off their GOP challengers next year, the results conceivably could lessen the tea party's zeal and reputation nationwide. That might encourage mainstream Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who are considering running for the White House in 2016.

On the other hand, a new string of tea party victories could ignite a full-blown Republican civil war and embolden anti-establishment champions such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

All across the country, Republicans are watching to see where big donors, especially from the business world, will put their money and energy.

In Idaho, the Club for Growth is backing Simpson's challenger, lawyer Bryan Smith. The group helped topple GOP incumbents last year, including longtime U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whose seat eventually fell to a Democrat.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sometimes spars with the Club for Growth, has yet to say which candidates it will support. Simpson, however, was a featured speaker at a chamber event this month in Washington, D.C.

If nothing else, next year's congressional elections in the Rockies hold the potential for fierce, even nasty confrontations between elected Republicans and their challengers.

In Wyoming, ""it's time for a new generation of leaders,"" says Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her differences with Enzi, 69, seem largely stylistic and generational. She calls Barack Obama the ""most radical"" president ever. The soft-spoken Enzi rarely employs such bombast, even if he routinely opposes Obama's initiatives.

Cheney's decision to oppose Enzi has dismayed many prominent Republicans and opened painfully personal rifts. Her father is a hero to many Wyoming conservatives. But many other well-known Republicans, including U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, have rallied to Enzi's side.

Enzi's supporters call Cheney, who lived for years in Virginia, a carpetbagger and opportunist. They gleefully point to her early missteps, including a late property tax payment and a $220 fine involving her application for a fishing license reserved for longtime state residents.

Cheney is airing a TV ad that calls her five children ""fifth-generation Wyomingites.""

In Idaho, Mike Simpson is a burly, cigarette-smoking dentist whose district sprawls eastward from Boise to the Wyoming-Utah border, nearly 300 miles away. Snow-streaked mountains tower above hard-pressed former railroad towns and tourist-driven ski and snowmobile resorts. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama here by a 2-to-1 margin in 2012.

Simpson, a more gregarious talker than Smith, likes to say, ""I'll put my conservative credentials against anybody's."" He notes that he voted 40 times to halt or delay Obama's health care law.

But unlike Idaho's other three members of Congress, Simpson didn't vote to continue last month's partial government shutdown beyond 16 days. Tea partyers insisted the shutdown go on, even though it was hurting the Republican Party's image.

They also note that Simpson joined House GOP leaders 11 months ago in backing a resolution that raised taxes on the rich, but not on the remainder of Americans.

Those were common-sense agreements that averted worse outcomes, Simpson said at a suburban coffee shop in Boise, the state's biggest city.

Because nearly all Republicans strongly oppose higher taxes, increased regulations and the president's health care law, he said, the party's split ""is over strategy, not philosophy."" The next two elections, Simpson said, will determine ""whether the Republican Party is going to be a governing majority, or whether we're going to resign ourselves to be an ideologically pure minority.""

That sounds like surrender to Smith.

The incumbent, he says, is part of Washington's ""go along to get along"" crowd.

In interviews and public settings, Smith sticks to tea party talking points. On a recent blustery night in a bare-bones meeting hall in southeastern Idaho, Smith told a small gathering it's impossible to defund the health law as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. Nonetheless, he said, he proudly sides with those ""who are willing to stand up and fight for conservative principles,"" even if their efforts have no legislative chance.

Smith, whose speaking style is earnest and deadpan, has yet to prove he can raise enough money and excitement to beat Simpson. But some conservative state legislators, including Idaho Rep. Janet Trujillo, support him.

Trujillo rejects claims that Republicans can't win presidential elections unless they temper their rhetoric on social issues, especially when addressing minority, female and young voters. ""The party is going to have to get back to its conservative roots,"" she said, and candidates such as Smith can help do that.

The GOP's internal angst in the West also reaches U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. He's the one who rocked Republican circles in 2010 by ousting U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett in a state party convention. Lee accused Bennett of being too conciliatory with Democrats.

Establishment Republicans, including big fundraisers for Romney, are openly criticizing Lee's recent take-no-prisoners tactics, including his doomed efforts to bar money for what Republicans call ""Obamacare.""

Lee's Senate website now depicts a bridge symbolizing efforts to close ""the gaping hole"" in the Republican Party ""that separates the grass roots from establishment leaders.""

Trent Clark, a former Idaho GOP chairman, says the loss of manufacturing and ranching jobs in many Western areas contributes to social unease and an openness to the tea party's ""throw out the hierarchy"" message. Many Idahoans detest a $17 trillion federal debt, he said, and they ""feel there is no more room for compromise"" in Washington's budget talks.

But Republicans who refuse to cut the best possible deals with Democrats, Clark said, ""are not being strategic."" He said he backs politicians such as Simpson ""who can make some headway on these issues.""

That's the idealism vs. pragmatism decision that millions of Republican voters must make in upcoming primaries. It already troubles Dennis Turner, one of the 18 people who showed up for Smith's public forum in Montpelier this month.

At 81, Turner's face is as craggy as the land he ranched and farmed until two years ago. His conservatism is just as deeply etched. He told Smith that the United Nations ""is trying to take over, with the help of our president, and ruin the Second Amendment and take our guns from us.""

That makes Turner a true-blue tea partyer and Smith supporter, right? Maybe not.

In an interview, Turner said he generally likes Smith's politics, but he thinks Simpson has done a good job in Congress. If Smith replaces Simpson as the Republican nominee, Turner said, Democrats might have a chance to win the seat, even in Idaho.

Asked whether he prefers Simpson or Smith, Turner thought a moment and said, ""I wouldn't make that call just now.""

They didn’t use that word, of course. Republican leaders frown on such labeling because it makes the House majority look, well, crazy.

It is, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said from the dais, “the word that we don’t like to say in this committee, and I’m not about to utter here in this particular hearing.”

One of the majority’s witnesses, Georgetown law professor Nicholas Rosenkranz, encouraged the Republicans not to be so shy. “I don’t think you should be hesitant to speak the word in this room,” he said. “A check on executive lawlessness is impeachment.”

This gave the lawmakers courage. “I’m often asked this,” said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) “You got to go up there, and you just impeach him.”

Dana Milbank offers a few answers for the reasons, as he characterizes it , that the Kenyan born Muslim raised in a madrassa president somehow attracts lies and rumors that are far from the truth. As for the rumors themselves, we have compiled a list that aren't the most outrageous but have a surprising base of believers. Win McNamee/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.

Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), who has said there are enough votes in the House to impeach Obama, added: “We’ve also talked about the I-word, impeachment, which I don’t think would get past the Senate in the current climate. . . . Is there anything else we can do?”

Why, yes, there is, congressman: You can hold hearings that accomplish nothing but allow you to sound fierce for your most rabid constituents.

The Republicans in the House know there is no chance of throwing this president from office. Yet at least 13 of the 22 Republicans on the panel have threatened or hinted at impeachment of Obama, his appointees or his allies in Congress. They’ve proposed this as the remedy to just about every dispute or political disagreement, from Syria to Obamacare.

Tuesday’s hearing was titled “The President’s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws.” The unanimous view among Republicans was that Obama had not done his duty, and it’s true that this president has stretched the bounds of executive authority almost as much as his predecessor, whose abuses bothered Republicans much less (and Democrats much more).

But what to do about it? They’ve failed at cutting off funding, they’ve had difficulty suing Obama in court and they lost the 2012 election. That basically leaves them with the option of making loud but ineffectual noises about high crimes and misdemeanors.

In recent days, Rep. Steve Stockman (Tex.), one of the more exotic members of the Republican caucus, has distributed proposed Articles of Impeachment to his colleagues. Last month, 20 House Republicans filed Articles of Impeachment against Attorney General Eric Holder. Around that time, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) accused Obama of “impeachable offenses.”

Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.), before his cocaine arrest and guilty plea, invoked the prospect of impeaching Obama over gun policy. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) raised the specter of impeachment over Obama’s threat to bomb Syria without congressional approval. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-Mich.) said it would be his “dream come true” to write the Articles of Impeachment, and Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.) said that if “the House had an impeachment vote it would probably impeach the president.”

Sen. Jim Inhofe said Obama could be impeached over the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, while fellow Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn said in August that Obama was “getting perilously close” to meeting the standard for impeachment (though he called Obama a “personal friend”). Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) thought it would have been an impeachable offense if Obama unilaterally raised the debt ceiling. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) branded Obama “lawless.”

On the House Judiciary panel, impeachment has been floated by GOP Reps. Jason Chaffetz (over Benghazi), Louie Gohmert and King (default on the debt), Darrell Issa (presidential patronage), Trent Franks (Defense of Marriage Act enforcement) and Lamar Smith (who said Obama’s record on immigration comes “awfully close” to violating the oath of office). Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) gets creativity points for proposing the impeachment of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

At Tuesday’s hearing, the committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), accused Obama of “picking and choosing which laws to enforce” and of being “the first president since Richard Nixon to ignore a duly enacted law simply because he disagrees with it.”

Contributed Smith: “The president has ignored laws, failed to enforce laws, undermined laws and changed laws, all contrary to the Constitution.”

The majority’s witnesses added to the accusations. George Washington University’s Jonathan Turley said Obama had “claimed the right of the king to essentially stand above the law.”

This excited Franks, who embraced impeachment back in 2011. Obama’s actions, he said, “could be considered royal prerogatives, which is, if my history’s right, what we had that little unpleasantness with Great Britain about.”

Yikes! Why bother with impeachment? They need a revolution.

As the immigration issue moves front and center in Congress, a chorus of GOP voices is warning that if immigrants—and, let’s face it, the debate is focused mostly on those from Mexico, Central America, and South America—are provided a path to citizenship, Republicans will never again win a national election. The same people also argue that Republicans would find it much harder to win statewide races in places such as Texas that now routinely fall into the GOP column. Implicit in both arguments is the notion that Republicans will remain a competitive party nationally and stay dominant in certain states if they can prevent Hispanic immigrants from becoming citizens and gaining voting rights. But that position ignores the fact that the 45.5 million Hispanics already in this country legally are registering to vote and are seeing the Republican Party as distinctly hostile. The more the GOP comes to be seen as fighting immigration reform, the more difficult it will be for Republican candidates to compete for this group of voters. Remember, 50,000 Hispanic citizens reach voting age every month.

Oops. The GOP forgot to do something about the ones already here.

This question of leakers v whistleblowers has frequently been conflated in the public reporting about the NSA leak (and many others). But this is a crucial error. As Tara Lee, a lawyer at the law firm DLA Piper, with expertise in defense industry and national security litigation said to me there is an important distinction between leakers and whistleblowers, ""One reports a crime; and one commits a crime.""

What is surprising is how sloppy and irresponsible it was. Then again given that this man’s irresponsibility in unnecessarily delaying voting on a Continuing Resolution to keep the government running, it should be expected.

During Ted Cruz faux-libuster he referenced John Connelly, a 22 year old Rutgers University student. Cruz said,

John Connelly thought he was on the right track in life. The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in his family to go to college when he enrolled in Rutgers in 2009,” … “Four years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn. [Source]

Turns out Cruz or one of his aides did a botch job in their research and took Connelly out of context based on a Wall Street Journal article in which he was mentioned.

John Connelly thought he was right on track in life. The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in his family to go to college when he enrolled at Rutgers in 2009. Four years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn. ""I hear a lot of stuff that people in my generation aren't buying cars or houses, and I'm a step beyond that—I can't even pay rent on time,"" Mr. Connelly says. ""I have a hard time planning 10 years in the future when I can hardly plan three months in the future."" At Rutgers, Mr. Connelly was an honors student and president of the student assembly. But wary of taking on more debt, he ended up withdrawing from school with three credits to go until graduation. After a summer spent living with friends while working a temporary job at a Brooklyn nonprofit, he found a grant that allowed him to re-enroll in school this fall. But he still doesn't know what he'll do when he graduates at the end of the semester. ""I kind of did everything I was quote-unquote 'supposed' to be doing,"" he says. [Source]

Cruz should have done more research as Connelly’s beliefs are diametrically opposed to those of Cruz and his immoral sect.

In fact, he grew up in a working-class union household and describes his politics as “left of most of the people in the Democratic Party on social and economic issues.” He thinks a single-payer system would be preferable to the Affordable Care Act but appreciates the provisions of the law that have helped him out already. His father’s union-provided health insurance still covers him, thanks to the provision of the ACA that allows children to stay on their parents’ plan until the age of 26. Private insurers are no longer allowed to deny his younger sister coverage, even though she suffers from a seizure disorder that qualifies as a pre-existing condition. [Source]

John Connelly was interviewed by Ed Schultz on Friday. He thinks it is bizarre that Cruz is blaming President Obama and the Affordable Care Act for his plight. He said his story is likely the worst story Cruz could have used for his free market dystopia as his is a poster family benefitting from Obamacare. His sister has a pre-existing condition and he is able to remain on his fathers union insurance because he is not yet 26 years old.

Connelly said what is holding students back has nothing to do with Obamacare. He said both he and his generation were grossly misrepresented by Cruz to push his agenda. His closing statement was a zinger. He said if his example is the best example Cruz could come up with of people suffering under Obamacare, then Obamacare is in fact a sweet deal. Check out the interview below.

Cruz and his party more so than any other party or organization are infamous for using truthful tidbits and surrounding them with untruthful narratives. They generally get no pushback from the traditional media. After-all, according to some of the ‘most respected journalists’, it is not their job to validate truth from these Right Wing lying hacks.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/conservative-hispanic-group-tells-gop-avoid-amnesty-label-173408974--election.html,,[],Conservative Hispanic group tells GOP to avoid ‘amnesty’ label,"A conservative pro-immigration reform group has issued talking points to Republican lawmakers, telling them to avoid referring to the U.S. citizen children of illegal immigrants as ""anchor babies"" or calling for the construction of an ""electric fence"" on the border, among other things.

The talking points, published by BuzzFeed, went out to Republican lawmakers on the Hill as momentum builds for an immigration bill that would legalize most of the country's 11 million illegal immigrants. The memo urges lawmakers to call them ""undocumented immigrants"" and to avoid terms such as ""aliens"" or ""illegals,"" which are seen as offensive and dehumanizing. Another phrase to avoid? ""Send them all back.""

""Conservatives get a bad rap when it comes to immigration reform because of a few people who say things that can be taken to be offensive,"" said Jennifer Korn, executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, the center-right group that sent the talking points on Monday. ""It all means the same thing, but the way you say it matters.""

Korn worked in the White House when President George W. Bush attempted to get immigration reform passed in his second term. Two bills—one in 2006, the other in 2007—died after a vocal grass-roots movement emerged in opposition to what it called ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. The amnesty tag stuck, even though both bills would have required any applicant to go through a lengthy legalization process that required him or her to meet certain requirements, like paying back taxes and a fine and learning English. Lawmakers received thousands of phone calls about the bill, Korn remembers, almost all of them strongly against reform.

Korn hopes theses talking points will help avoid the ""pitfalls"" she saw then.

""Right now what's really giving me heartburn is people saying 'pathway to citizenship,'"" she said. ""It's not a pathway to citizenship. It's 'earned legal status.' If you want conservative support you have to explain what it is so there's not this knee-jerk reaction of 'No amnesty!'""

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who's part of a bipartisan group of senators pushing for immigration reform, has used ""earned residency"" at times in interviews with conservative talk show hosts to describe what immigration reform would provide to qualifying illegal immigrants. Democrats, including Obama, often use ""pathway to citizenship"" to describe the bill."
http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-obama-gop-see-no-205914262.html,,[],"Analysis: Obama, GOP see no need to stop the cuts","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unlike in earlier rounds of budget brinkmanship, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans both seem content to fight out their latest showdown on the current terrain, let across-the-board spending cuts take effect on March 1 and allow them to stay in place for weeks if not much longer.

This time, there is no market-rattling threat of a government default to force the two sides to compromise, no federal shutdown on the short-term horizon and no year-end deadline for preventing a tax increase for every working American.

The rhetoric is reminiscent, for sure.

""So far at least, the ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or the biggest corporations,"" Obama said this week as he campaigned to pin the blame for any negative effects on his political opponents. ""So the burden is all on the first responders, or seniors or middle class families,"" he said in comments similar in tone to his re-election campaign.

Republicans, standing on political ground of their own choosing, responded sharply to the president's fresh demand for higher taxes.

""Spending is the problem, spending must be the focus,"" said House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, while Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declared, ""There won't be any easy off-ramps on this one. The days of 11th hour negotiations are over.""

A crisis atmosphere could yet develop this spring, when hundreds of thousands or even millions of threatened government furloughs begin to take effect and the spending cuts begin to bite. Already, Republicans are considering legislation to give the administration greater flexibility in making the cuts, a step that could minimize the impact on the public. It's a step the White House says it opposes, although the depth of that conviction has yet to be tested.

At heart, the standoff is yet another indication of the political resistance to a compromise curbing the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and possibly Social Security, a step that both Obama and Republicans say is essential to restoring the nation's fiscal health. It is the last major remaining challenge in divided government's struggle, now in its third year, to reduce deficits by $4 trillion or more over a decade.

Story continues

Counting the across-the-board cuts now beginning to command the nation's attention — at a 10-year cost of $1.2 trillion — the president and Congress have racked up more than $3.6 trillion in savings. Much came from spending, although legislation that Republicans let pass at year's end raised taxes on the wealthy to generate an estimated $600 billion for the Treasury over a decade.

The so-called sequester now approaching was never supposed to happen. It was designed as an unpalatable fallback, to take effect only in case a congressional super-committee failed to come up with $1 trillion or more in savings from benefit programs.

Now, more than a year later, Republicans are fond of saying that the idea itself originated at the White House.

That skips lightly over the fact that their own votes helped enact it into law.

Also that they decided a month ago that it marked the moment of most leverage in their struggle to maneuver Obama and Democrats into curtailing benefit programs. To accomplish that objective, they already have raised the debt limit without winning any cuts in exchange, a step they once vowed not to take. And within two weeks, they are likely to launch legislation making sure the government operates without interruption when current funding authority runs out for most agencies on March 27.

Republicans aren't the only ones partial to verbal sleights of hand.

In a letter to lawmakers earlier this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sounded a series of alarms. The spending cuts ""could compromise"" the health of more than 373,000 mentally ill or emotionally disturbed individuals, ""could slow efforts to improve"" health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, she wrote, and admissions to inpatient addiction facilities ""could be reduced.""

Could or could not. Soon or later. Nothing pinned down.

The administration hopes to win over the public and bring Republican lawmakers to heel, and it dispatched Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to the White House briefing room on Friday.

""Come to the table and start talking"" to find a way to avert the cuts, the former GOP lawmaker urged members of his own Republican Party.

Peppered with skeptical questions, LaHood directed reporters to his department's website, with a listing of more than 300 air traffic facilities where overnight shifts could be eliminated or perhaps closed entirely.

Asked if his office was receiving unhappy calls from the public, he got to the political point.

""My phones will ring from members of Congress (asking) 'why is my control tower being closed?'"" he said.

An Iraq War combat veteran is hoping for a pardon from Gov. Scott Walker so he can become a police officer. But Walker is refusing to budge from his practice of not issuing any pardons.

That's right. No pardons. Ever.

Eric Pizer returned from Iraq in 2004 after serving 2 tours with the Marines. 2 days after his return he went to the help a friend involved in a fight by trying to break it up and wound up being charged with battery. He pleaded no contest, served 2 years of probation and paid over $7000 in medical bills after punching a man in the nose.

Now, 9 years later and with an associate degree in criminal justice, he wants to become a police officer. His felony conviction prevents that.



A pardon would not erase the conviction but it would restore Pizer's right to possess a firearm, which he needs to become a police officer.

Scott Walker, when asked about the pardon request, suggested Pizer find another career (sorry, I saw it this weekend on the tee vee machine, but for the life of me can't find it today).

Another more in depth article can be found here.

It's interesting that Walker, who never put on a uniform to serve his country and currently hides behind the most massive security detail in Wisconsin history while pretending to be ""unintimidated"", would refuse to aid a decorated Marine veteran. Also interesting to note is that one of his associates is getting out of prison early after stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a veterans fund put under his care and supervision by Scott Walker while he was Milwaukee County Executive. Interesting to note that this early release was ordered by the state Department of Corrections headed by a Walker appointee.

This one case is being highlighted in the press because this man seems to be someone who qualifies to have a pardon considered. A one-time offense which, he pled ""no contest"" to in order to avoid the expense and difficulty of a trial isn't part of a pattern of criminal or violent behavior. That the incident occurred 2 days after his return from his second deployment after a night of drinking.

Walkers ""no pardon"" policy, regardless of merit, is the problem here. There are people who deserve consideration and this man is only one of them.

Stay tuned for further episodes of Cruelty and Heartlessness, starting Scott Walker, a show continuously running in Wisconsin since January 2011. We're hoping for a cancellation at the end of 2014.

Happy Holidays all!

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/us/politics/judge-overturns-suspensions-for-stevens-prosecutors.html,2013-04-08 00:00:00,['Charlie Savage'],Judge Overturns Suspensions for Stevens Prosecutors,"WASHINGTON — An administrative judge has overturned the suspensions of two federal prosecutors whom the Justice Department had tried to discipline for failing to turn over evidence that might have helped the defense in the botched corruption trial against Senator Ted Stevens.

Last year, the department found that the two prosecutors had engaged in reckless — though not intentional — professional misconduct and ordered them to be suspended without pay. One, Joseph Bottini, was suspended for 40 days, and the other, James Goeke, was suspended for 15 days.

The legal team that defended Mr. Stevens, Republican of Alaska, called those suspensions “pathetic” and inadequate, saying the department had “demonstrated conclusively that it is not capable of disciplining its prosecutors.” But the two prosecutors contended that the discipline was too severe and appealed to the federal Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency that hears disciplinary cases involving career civil servants in the federal government.

In a 29-page ruling released late Friday night, the administrative judge, Benjamin Gutman, overturned the suspensions. He ruled that the Justice Department had violated its own procedures, under the Professional Misconduct Review Unit, which called for a rank-and-file lawyer to decide whether professional misconduct had occurred."

Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.

Fort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.

""On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,"" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. ""Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.""

Despite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.

The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were ""punitive,"" although he later backed off that accusation.

Baroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.

""Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,"" Baroni said in November.

But he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.

According to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, ""that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.""

Wildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.

In a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.

Still, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John ""Jay"" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee.

""While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,"" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.

The inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.

Last week, Christie said the controversy was ""not that big a deal"" even though reporters were ""obsessed"" with it."

A group representing more than a dozen Tea Party groups now suing the IRS released a sample of one of the letters overnight, after the official Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave. According to one lawmaker, she was only placed on leave after she refused to resign.

Jay Sekulow, chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice, said the March 2012 letters show a ""paper trail"" that reveals her ""direct involvement in sending intrusive and harassing questionnaires.""

""It appears Lerner did nothing to stop the abusive conduct. And our evidence suggests she was actively participating in the improper targeting in March 2012,"" he said in a statement.

It was no secret that Lerner, as head of the exempt organizations division, was aware of the program that had developed in the Cincinnati office under her watch. A timeline provided in the inspector general's report on the practice showed she was first briefed in June 2011.

But while she apparently raised concerns at that briefing over the criteria used, the ACLJ said the March 2012 letters show she was still involved in carrying out the policy.

At the time, the program itself was in flux. Lerner had earlier ordered the criteria to be changed in June 2011. The criteria was then broadened, but somehow it was changed again in January 2012 ""without executive approval,"" according to the IG report.

After that, the unit in question sent out a new round of letters requesting additional information, while giving groups that had not responded to the prior requests an additional 60 days to comply. These appear to be the letters that, in some cases, Lerner signed.

A letter posted online by the ACLJ was sent March 16 to the Ohio Liberty Council Corp. Signed by Lerner, the letter gave the group 60 days to respond to a prior letter seeking information on the group's social media accounts, sponsored events, communications with lawmakers and other material.

Sekulow said their records show Lerner sent 14 other letters to 14 of his group's clients in March and April of that year. He said it's unclear why her signature is on some letters but not others.

Lerner, meanwhile, has maintained she did nothing wrong. She asserted her innocence in a brief statement at a House committee hearing Wednesday, before claiming her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said. ""I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.""

Committee leaders are trying to recall Lerner, claiming she waived her Fifth Amendment right by delivering an opening statement.

Sekulow said there are many questions she should answer, including why the letters were sent under her name in March 2012."

Robert F. McDonnell (R) delivers his State of the Commonwealth address.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Washington Redskins and her husband.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell bought nearly $9,800 in clothing with money from her husband’s political action committee and tapped into his campaign and inaugural funds to buy $7,600 in mostly unspecified items, according to records and a representative for the PAC.

The spending is legal under Virginia’s lax campaign finance laws, which prohibit the conversion of political funds for private use only when a PAC or campaign committee disbands — not while it is operating.

But the purchases are unusual in Virginia, where campaign finance records indicate that candidates do not routinely dip into political funds to buy personal items such as clothing for themselves or their spouses.

Maureen McDonnell’s use of political donations comes to light at a time when she and her husband, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), are under intense scrutiny for accepting luxury items and $120,000 in loans from wealthy Virginia businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. Federal and state investigators are probing the Star Scientific executive’s ties to the McDonnells, who promoted his firm’s nutritional supplement, Anatabloc. Last week the governor apologized for embarrassing the commonwealth and repaid the loans.

Several gifts that have drawn investigators’ attention seem aimed at polishing Maureen McDonnell’s image as first lady. They are looking into whether the former Washington Redskins cheerleader and mother of five received free cosmetic dental work from a Richmond-area dentist, jewelry from a state delegate and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree from Williams.

Using political money for clothes helped McDonnell step up her style while her family’s finances were hit by the plunging real estate market.

Bob McDonnell won the 2009 governor’s race as several properties that he and his family bought for a combined $3.84 million at the height of the real estate boom had lost value. Maureen McDonnell complained to officials at Opportunity Virginia PAC that she didn’t have the wardrobe or resources necessary for her new role as first lady, according to a person familiar with the PAC’s operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain a relationship with the McDonnells.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card, according to that person. A representative of the PAC confirmed Friday that the card was provided to the first lady, but he added that she no longer has it. The representative answered questions on behalf of the committee on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigations.

Rich Galen, a private spokesman for the governor and first lady on matters related to the investigations, said that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the clothes, which would be donated to charity after Bob McDonnell completes his term in January. The PAC also said that the items will be returned to the committee and then donated to charity.

Asked in a brief phone interview whether the committee spent money on department-store clothing, Phil Cox, director of the PAC and executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said: “All of the PAC expenditures are publicly available. What’s there is there.” Cox does not sign off on the PAC’s expense reports.

Outfitting herself

Maureen McDonnell has charged about $9,800 in clothing to the PAC, but that is not obvious from campaign finance reports filed by the committee.

None of the items the first lady put on the PAC credit card was identified as clothing in public records available online through the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The purchases are billed as “event expenses” and “travel expenses.” At times, however, the vendor listed suggests clothing: Nordstrom, Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Ann Taylor. In all, the PAC spent $6,300 at those stores.

In those cases where the stores are identified, nothing in the public record links the purchases to Maureen McDonnell.

Her name is listed on three additional PAC expenses totaling about $3,500. But in those instances, the records do not indicate what was bought or where. Instead of clothing stores, the vendor listed is “Maureen McDonnell.” The purchases are identified as “travel expenses” and “event expenses.”

But the PAC representative confirmed that $9,800 in purchases — all of those publicly linked either to the clothing stores or to the first lady — were clothing for her. He said they were bought for official gubernatorial or political events.

She spent $2,379 at Nordstrom over two days in March 2012 and another $535 there a month before that, all to prepare for a trip to California to market Virginia products and attend a Republican Governors Association meeting.

She spent $1,121 in July 2012 at Saks to buy clothes for a gala celebrating the bicentennial of the governor’s mansion.

She spent about $6,000 around the time of McDonnell’s January 2010 inauguration, about half of that for clothing charged to the PAC. The other half: $3,087 that Bob McDonnell’s inaugural committee paid to her for unspecified “event expenses.”

The PAC representative said it was not clear what she bought with the inaugural funds. With the committee now closed and original receipts and other records in storage, he said the answer was not readily available.

Maureen McDonnell also received payments from two other committees associated with her husband. The Bob McDonnell for Governor committee paid her $2,369 in unspecified “event” and “travel” expenses in July and September 2009. Bob McDonnell for Attorney General reimbursed her $1,021 for a camera in August 2007 and $1,104 that December for unspecified “event supplies.”

The representative said he did not know what the camera was for. The nature of the other reimbursements also was unclear because records from those now-closed committees also are in storage, he said. Also unexplained was the $1,100 that Bob McDonnell for Governor spent at Dick’s Sporting Goods over three days in late October 2009.

‘No restriction’

When a campaign committee or PAC is being disbanded, candidates are prohibited from converting any surplus funds to personal use for themselves or immediate relatives. But while a political committee is running, “there are no restrictions,” said Nikki Sheridan, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Board of Elections.

“If they wanted to use the money to send their kids to college, they could probably do that,” she said. “There is no restriction on clothing, grooming or legal fees unless you’re shutting down your PAC.”

The law is one of the nation’s most lax. Most states restrict personal use at any stage in the life of a political committee, according to Karen Shanton, a legislative studies specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But it is in keeping with Virginia’s no-limits, full-disclosure approach to campaign finance generally. The state has no caps on political contributions. And officeholders are allowed to take personal gifts of any value as long as they report those worth more than $50.

State elections officials said it is not unusual for candidates to call asking if they can charge their campaigns for the clothing they wear in the course of running for office. They are told that it is not illegal.

Whether it is a wise public relations move is another matter.

Del. Onzlee Ware (D-Roanoke) drew attention in 2009 for using campaign funds for personal items, including a YMCA membership.

State Board of Elections officials reviewed his spending but concluded there was no violation of the law after the attorney general’s office advised them in writing that the law “does not prohibit the personal use of campaign contributions by candidates or office holders unless or until” they disband their committees.

Even so, it appears to be more the exception than the rule that Virginia politicians use political funds to fill their closets.

U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has had one clothing expense paid for with campaign funds — $708 at Nordstrom — since he ran for governor in 2004.

State Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond), charged a $794 tuxedo from Franco’s Fine Clothier to his campaign account in early 2009 but refunded his campaign in mid-2010. McEachin said he had meant to pay personally for the tuxedo, which he was buying for an Urban League dinner, but accidentally pulled out his campaign credit card. He said he made the refund after discovering the error.

At least a handful of other Virginia candidates have billed their campaigns for relatively modest clothing or tailoring services.

The man Bob McDonnell defeated in 2009, state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath) charged $42 at Macy’s, $38 in Kohl’s and $84 at Dick’s Sporting Goods in the course of his campaign. All of the purchases were identified on his reports as clothing. He also billed his campaign for more than $500 in dry cleaning charges while he was on the campaign trail.

Deeds said he couldn’t recall what any of the clothing purchases were for, but said they were small and probably related to the difficulties of the hectic campaign pace.

“You’re out and you spill coffee on a necktie in the morning and you have big things to do the rest of the day,” he said, speaking hypothetically. “You’ve got to go out and buy a new necktie.”

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s gubernatorial campaign spent $182 at Macy’s in May after the Republican showed up to shoot a TV commercial with two blue shirts.

“[W]e needed the AG in various color shirts, so a staffer went to Macy’s and purchased what was needed,” campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix said via e-mail. “As a practice, the AG does not believe [in using] nor use campaign funds for personal use.”"
http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/the-decline-of-the-tea-party/,2013-11-05 00:00:00,['Bruce Bartlett'],The Decline of the Tea Party,"Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of the forthcoming book “The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform – Why We Need It and What It Will Take.”

There is an apocryphal story about the origins of neoconservatism in the 1960s. Some liberal professors at Harvard were sympathetic to the New Left and such radical groups as Students for a Democratic Society. But one day one of these professors heard the radicals suggest burning down the Harvard library as an act of protest, and the professor suddenly realized that he had nothing in common with them at all. He organized some other professors into a vigil to protect the library at all cost.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.

Today, the problem isn’t the New Left, but the radical right, which has dominated American politics at least since the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2009 following the election of Barack Obama. It’s too soon to say for sure, but recent events suggest that some of those previously supporting the Tea Party have had their Harvard library moment. There are signs of a pushback among the wealthy, conservative elites and the business community that may see the political pendulum begin to swing back toward the middle.

No one particular event seems to have created this moment. The government shutdown is one, the impending Republican loss in the Virginia governor’s race is another, and so is the dawning recognition that the right-wing war on the poor and glorification of profits and wealth may have gone too far.

One sign is the widely discussed essay published on Nov. 1 by the managing director of Pimco, William H. Gross, on “Scrooge McDucks.” McDuck, the cartoon character noted for his vast fortune and miserly ways, was ranked first by Forbes among the fictional wealthy, with a fortune estimated at $65 billion.

Mr. Gross, ranked 252nd on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans, said in his essay that having become wealthy in part because of the tax cuts carried out by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, as well as the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve that facilitated leveraged borrowing, he had become concerned about the plight of labor. That is, the declining share of national income going to workers and the rising share going to capital, which is a growing topic of concern among economists.



He calls this era the “gilded age of credit.” The Gilded Age was a period of American history in the 1870s and 1880s not dissimilar to today, when wealth was glorified and such intellectuals as the Yale economist William Graham Sumner and the philosopher Herbert Spencer justified the pursuit of riches and rising income inequality on grounds that have come to be called “social Darwinism.” That is, survival of the fittest.

Mr. Gross now thinks that labor has suffered too much from excessive gains by the wealthy. “Those who borrowed money or charged fees on expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the big tent than those who used their hands for a living,” he laments.

He thinks the wealthy ought to support higher taxes on themselves. Mr. Gross favors higher statutory tax rates, taxing capital gains as ordinary income – they are now taxed about half – and abolition of the “carried interest” loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay capital gains rates on their ordinary income.

Another growing concern of the wealthy and business groups is the recognition that they lack any control over the Tea Party. A major problem is that Tea Party people are only interested in nominating Republicans based on their rigid adherence to right-wing principles, even if they make such candidates unelectable in the general election.

A number of Senate elections have been lost in recent years because Tea Party insurgents upset in primaries or party conventions some mainstream candidates who probably would have won their races. This appears to be happening again in the Virginia governor’s race, where Republicans nominated for governor and lieutenant governor two candidates who are very far to the right in a state that is trending left.

The business community is especially upset by having the Tea Party repeatedly throw away winnable races and is trying to inject more political realism into the nominating process. Some business groups are even reaching out to Democrats. The Fairfax Chamber of Commerce in Virginia, for example, endorsed the Democratic candidate for governor this year for the first time since 2001.

It isn’t only rich people feeling guilt over their riches and pragmatic business groups that are dissenting from the Tea Party orthodoxy. Some Republicans and conservative intellectuals are now saying that cuts to the welfare state have gone too far as well.

On Oct. 28, the Republican governor of Ohio, John R. Kasich, blasted his party for its “war on the poor.” He said that the G.O.P. implicitly believed that “if you’re poor, somehow you are shiftless and lazy.” Against Tea Party opposition, Governor Kasich recently expanded Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act – an act of virtual treason against Tea Party dogma.

On Oct. 31, Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a prominent think tank in Washington, said the conservative war against the social safety net was “just insane.” He urged his fellow conservatives to “declare peace on the safety net.”

James Pethokoukis, a scholar at the institute, seconded that olive branch to the poor, saying the social safety net had performed well during the economic crisis, contrary to the Tea Party view that programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance only subsidize idleness. He says conservatives should work to mend the welfare state, not end it.

It is ironic that that A.E.I. should be leading the charge toward a more sympathetic approach to the poor; another of its scholars, Nicholas Eberstadt, wrote a book last year, “A Nation of Takers,” which blasted growth of the welfare population and was widely credited with inspiring Mitt Romney’s attack on the 47 percent of the population who are “dependent on government.”

I have long believed that the Tea Party is a populist movement with no staying power. When it was at its peak, conservatives and Republicans sought to harness its energy to achieve long-held ideological, electoral and legislative goals. But the Tea Party has proved to be a double-edged sword that now threatens those goals more than it aids them. A pushback has clearly begun.

Republican hopes in 2016 may depend on how well it succeeds."
http://news.yahoo.com/bush-cheney-friends-210240367.html,,[],"Bush, Cheney 'never quite friends,' new book reveals","President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were ""never quite friends,"" Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, writes in his upcoming book, “Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House.""



In an excerpt published on the Times website Thursday, Baker details what he describes as the ""final insult in the Bush-Cheney marriage"": the president's decision not to pardon ""Scooter"" Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, who had been convicted of lying to federal officials investigating the leak of the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson.



When Bush informed Cheney of the decision, Cheney snapped: “You are leaving a good man wounded on the field of battle.""



“The comment stung,” Bush wrote in his 2010 memoir, ""Decision Points."" “In eight years, I had never seen Dick like this, or even close to this. I worried that the friendship we had built was about to be severely strained, at best.”



But according to Cheney, there really wasn't a friendship to strain.



“It was professional, more than personal,” Cheney told Baker shortly after leaving office. “We weren’t buddies in that sense.”



While Bush called Cheney “Dick,” Baker wrote, Cheney always called Bush “Mr. President” and referred to him with others as “the Man.”



Even more telling, according to Baker, is the new George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Texas:

There were exhibits featuring the first lady and their daughters, videos narrated by [former Secretary of State Condoleezza] Rice, [former White House chief of staff Joshua] Bolten and Andy Card, and even statues of the presidential dogs. There was little sign of Dick Cheney.





Baker's book also looks to dispel the notion that Cheney was pulling the strings behind the curtain.



“This whole notion that the vice president was the puppet master, I find laughable,” Gen. Richard Myers, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Baker. “He was an active vice president because I think he was empowered, but he wasn’t a dominant factor. The alpha male in the White House was the president.”



Cheney's reputation as the administration's ""evil genius"" was fueled, in part, because he embraced it:





Story continues

Once his friend David Hume Kennerly greeted him teasingly by saying: “Hi, Dick. Have you blown away any small countries this morning?” Without missing a beat, Cheney replied, “You know, that’s the one thing about this job I really love.” At another point, he tried on a Darth Vader mask his aides had bought and posed for a picture. When he later tried to put the picture in his memoir, his wife, Lynne, talked him out of it.





In reality, Baker writes, it was Rice who became Bush's top lieutenant:





No one in the White House had the relationship with Bush that Rice had. She worked out with him, talked sports with him, dined with him and Laura in the residence and spent weekends with them at Camp David.



Cheney says he wasn't even consulted on the decision to remove Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary. “It wasn’t open for discussion by the time [Bush] came to me,” Cheney said."

On twitter, Greg Sargent linked to a Jennifer Rubin piece that shockingly appears to be well-researched and detailed, and strongly suggests Rand Paul repeatedly violated physician advertising laws in Kentucky by holding himself out as board certified.

We probably know the story that Rand Paul made up his own ophthalmology board (the National Opthalmology Board, which despite its name, was mainly a Kentucky thing) in 1997. I just thought that it just sounded like bullshit and left it at that, but it turns out the board was defunct in 2000, revived in 2005, and defunct again in 2011. During the time it was out of business, no board was certifying Dr. Paul, and after 2005, it was not recognized as a licensing board by the state of Kentucky.

Now, one does not need board certification to practice medicine or to obtain admitting privileges, but it is a factor in physician advertising rules for consumer protection purposes. If there is no board to enforce compliance or regulate continuing education, then board certification is utterly meaningless, so the board has to, first of all, exist, and second of all, perform some function other than advance the interest of younger ophthalmologists upset that older ones could be grandfathered into certification rules.

This is likely because you can't just have doctors making up their own licensing boards and call themselves board certified! Of course, this is what Dr. Paul would call ""big government,"" because what does freedom mean if quacks can't cut open your eyeballs.

Paul may not be a quack, but by holding himself out as board certified despite not being that in reality, he in effect holds himself out as a quack.

So, it sounds like Paul's ethical problems may not stop with plagiarism. And ask yourself - what would a real medical board do with the plagiarism story, anyway?

Of course, take anything Jennifer Rubin says with an ocean of salt, but I think at the very least, Paul has some questions to account for (and Rubin reports his staff in no way did). And in the meantime, bask in the delicious joy that is R-on-R violence."

It was striking not because of the content made public by the Fair Political Practices Commission -- it mimicked what California Democrats have been saying for years -- but because of the author, Republican consultant and fundraiser Jeff Miller.

True, his memo was written the day after November’s dual losses, when Miller and his team failed to defeat Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax measure and also failed to supersede it with one of their own. And Miller has in the past criticized the party, so insiders might not find his comments startling.

But they remain a bleak, and now public, assessment for the state party.

“Over the last two decades, California’s working class has slowly migrated out of the state and Latino and women voters are completely disenfranchised with the Republican Party. There are only a few pockets of conservative voters left in the state and they are only able to help carry the day for Republicans in ultra-low turnout elections on issues where campaign spending is at parity or to the Republican advantage, and where the Democratic and union grass-roots apparatus is not activated,” Miller’s memo said.

“There is no good way to sugarcoat this. ... The Republican label is anathema to younger voters, women and Latinos -- growing voter blocs with real significance to future elections.”

“We are going to be on permanent defense in California for the foreseeable future,” the memo went on, “and even then, we will need to pick our battles wisely and not spread ourselves too thin. While playing defense, we’re going to have to try and force the Democrats into making mistakes that we can use to score small victories and build momentum.”

Miller, who could not be reached for comment Friday, noted that as Republicans have weakened in the state, labor unions have remained a potent pro-Democratic force. And the GOP traditional funding base, the corporate world, “has been little help in the overall fight” due to its desire to work with the dominant Democrats, he wrote.

Miller intended the memo to be seen by clients -- at the bottom is a notation indicating it is to be considered confidential -- but the document was included in paperwork for the FPPC investigation that resulted in state officials levying a record $16 million in penalties on conservative groups that funneled money into the 2012 state elections.

Part of the payment is a combined $1 million in fines agreed to in a settlement with two Arizona nonprofits, one linked to billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch. The rest of the money is equivalent of the donations they received, which regulators said had been improperly reported.

As far as the future for California Republicans goes, the party continues to try to grapple with the dilemma that has confounded it for two decades: how to appeal to new blocs of voters without alienating its mostly white, mostly conservative base.

Miller, for his part, voted with his feet. He moved to Austin, Texas, where he has been working with Gov. Rick Perry to recruit California businesses to his new home state.

Along with Perry, he attended the state Republican party convention earlier this month in Anaheim. Perry, a once-and-future presidential prospect, has focused on economic development as a playable card for the GOP nationally, a strategy that avoids some of the cultural issue disputes that have driven Californians from the party.

Perry declined when asked to dissect the California party’s troubles, but alluded to opposition to comprehensive immigration reform.

“The California Republican Party needs to take a look at their policies, the words that they use,” he said. “I would suggest that that matters.”

No, really.","I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.

I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.

On Friday, GOP congressional candidate Ian Bayne went all in, comparing [Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson] to civil rights icon Rosa Parks. ""In December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians,"" Bayne said in an email to supporters. ""What Parks did was courageous,"" he added. ""What Mr. Robertson did was courageous too.""

The ""stand"" Robertson took was to compare homosexuality to bestiality , also lumping them in with ""the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes"" and so forth, which makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think gay Americans are going to hell. (Really, though, has their been a dearth of good conservative Christians willing to pipe up about that? Not seeing the pioneer status of this particular reality TV star, myself.) Oh, and Robertson also had said that black Americans had it Just Fine Thank You during the Jim Crow era, which also makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think Rosa Parks didn't have anything to complain about in the first place.

Bayne is running to challenge Democratic Rep. Bill Foster in Illinois' 11th District next year, presuming he makes it through the primary. That primary being the reason he's sending out emails about Duck Dynasty stars and what they can teach us about being like Rosa Parks, of course.

I'll say this again: Congress is already very full of crackpots and frothing nutcases, thank you. We don't need any more. I don't know what letter went out in Republican circles that encouraged yet another raft of these loons to come sailing down the ol' wingnut river, but we are full up already.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote a series of legal opinions from 2002 to 2005 concluding that the methods were not torture if used under strict rules; all the memos were later withdrawn. News organizations have wrestled with whether to label the brutal methods unequivocally as torture in the face of some government officials’ claims that they were not.

In addition, the United States is a signatory to the international Convention Against Torture, which requires the prompt investigation of allegations of torture and the compensation of its victims.

Like the still-secret Senate interrogation report, the Constitution Project study was initiated after President Obama decided in 2009 not to support a national commission to investigate the post-9/11 counterterrorism programs, as proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and others. Mr. Obama said then that he wanted to “look forward, not backward.” Aides have said he feared that his own policy agenda might get sidetracked in a battle over his predecessor’s programs.

The panel studied the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and at the C.I.A’s secret prisons. Staff members, including the executive director, Neil A. Lewis, a former reporter for The New York Times, traveled to multiple detention sites and interviewed dozens of former American and foreign officials, as well as former detainees.

Mr. Hutchinson, who served in the Bush administration as chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration and under secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said he “took convincing” on the torture issue. But after the panel’s nearly two years of research, he said he had no doubts about what the United States did.

“This has not been an easy inquiry for me, because I know many of the players,” Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview. He said he thought everyone involved in decisions, from Mr. Bush down, had acted in good faith, in a desperate effort to try to prevent more attacks.

“But I just think we learn from history,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “It’s incredibly important to have an accurate account not just of what happened but of how decisions were made.”"

For nearly two decades, even Republicans supported the Violence Against Women Act, because what kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being would publicly take issue with that?

Well, on Tuesday, when the Senate voted, again, to re-authorize the VAWA, 22 senators—all Republicans, all men—raised their hands to proudly proclaim, ""I am that kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being!""

Let's take a look at some of these brave defenders of the sacred right to rape and beat the shit out of women:

There's Marco Rubio of Florida, the savior du jour of the Republican Party. He's the guy Republicans think will make them seem reasonable and not at all the party of old white guys because, hey, his parents are from Cuba and he speaks Spanish. Which is why, of course, he should have even greater sympathy for immigrants, and yet, for some reason, he has a real problem with VAWA protecting immigrants. Huh. Go figure.

There's Dr. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who never shies away from invoking his medical expertise to justify, say, opposing reproductive health care for women. See, when he supports laws to strip women of their rights, it's because he's a doctor, and he's simply acting out of concern for women. As a doctor. Funny that in all his years of practice, he apparently never encountered a victim of rape or domestic violence. Hell of a ""doctor,"" that guy.

There's Rand Paul of Kentucky, who thinks the government doesn't have the right to do a single thing except crawl up inside your vagina and regulate the hell out of it. Oh, and there was that one time in college when he kidnapped a woman—you know, as a joke. But hey, he probably has a really good reason for standing up for the rights of woman-beaters. Besides self-interest.

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the very model of chivalry, so it's hard to understand his opposition. After all, he so generously offered to mansplain how math and numbers and budgets work to his fellow Wisconsinite, Tammy Baldwin, when she was elected to the Senate in 2012. Guess he's fickle that way. He'll help the girls with their math homework, but if they get beaten, they're on their own.

James Inhofe of Oklahoma doesn't want to lift a finger to combat violence against women, but that's probably because he knows it isn't a real problem. Just like he knows climate change isn't a real problem. Just like he knows properly training and protecting women who are already in combat in the military isn't a real problem. In fact, the only real problem that concerns Inhofe is how to stop The Gays from taking over the world with their big gay agenda.

You can go below the fold for the full list of Republicans who don't give a damn about women. And be sure to sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/29/1212417/-Tea-Party-ties-to-Koch-Brothers-Ignored-by-Media-in-IRS-Scandal,2013-05-29 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Tea Party ties to Koch Brothers Ignored by Media in IRS Scandal,"10 out of 11 Tea Party spokespeople quoted in major news outlets regarding the IRS scandal have ties to the Koch funded Americans for Prosperity.

The Internal Revenue Service, not the most popular government agency to begin with, has been in the midst of a scatological squall for the past 3 weeks over their treatment of tea party groups. According to an agency spokesperson, organizations garnered additional scrutiny of their applications for non-profit status for having “Tea Party, Patriot, or 9/12” in the application materials. Non-profit status is granted by the IRS for “social welfare organizations” and federal law puts legal limits to the amount of overtly political things you can do if you are applying to be a non-profit, and thus tax-exempt.

In the coverage of this story, now a scandal, there are a couple of important facts that some of the reporting has missed.

First is the fact that the tea party is a creation of enterprising political and public relations professionals, constructed to accomplish a political purpose. A study published in the Tobacco Control Journal actually traced the origins of the tea party to “free-market” groups founded by tobacco corporations and the oil industry billionaires David and Charles Koch.

According to researchers at UC San Francisco:

“Rather than being a grassroots movement that spontaneously developed in 2009, the Tea Party organizations have had connections to the tobacco companies since the 1980s. The cigarette companies funded and worked through Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), the predecessor of Tea Party organizations, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, to accomplish their economic and political agenda.”

Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), was founded in 1984 by the Koch brothers.

There is even a tea party website registered to a Koch group in 2005, long before the conservative outcry we now know as the tea party began.

The second thing to keep in mind is that the tea party is still controlled by enterprising political and public relations professionals, funded by the David and Charles Koch. In coverage of the IRS scandal, there were 11 people who were involved in tea party groups quoted about IRS scrutiny. Of those 11, 10 have substantial ties to Americans for Prosperity (AFP). AFP (also founded and funded by the Kochs), is the direct descendent of CSE - one of the groups who registered a tea party site in 2005. Of those 10 with ties to AFP, 2 actually work for the organization currently. All 10 have received aid from AFP which included help with messaging and communication.

The tea party groups that were scrutinized by the IRS are not just separate grassroots citizen groups unfairly accused of political shenanigans, as the Koch associated spokespeople in the media would have you believe. They are one part of a wider political strategy, funded and managed by a very wealthy few. they have uniform and coordinated messages, such as attacking climate science andopposing environmental regulations.

As this IRS scandal progresses, it is important to keep in mind that many of the tea party groups in question deserve to have their non-profit, tax-exempt status questioned. The New York Times has already found that several tea party groups investigated by the IRS were engaged in activities that are illegal for tax exempt groups.

For the record, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network experienced expensive and debilitating audits by the IRS during George W Bush’s presidency. Those audits were most likely at the behest of an Exxon funded front group.

The Justice Department said it would file paperwork to become a co-plaintiff in an existing lawsuit brought by civil rights groups and Texas lawmakers against a Texas redistricting plan. Separately, the department said, it filed a new lawsuit over a state law requiring voters to show photo identification.

In both cases, the administration is asking federal judges to rule that Texas has discriminated against voters who are members of a minority group, and to reimpose on Texas a requirement that it seek “pre-clearance” from the federal government before making any changes to election rules. In June, the Supreme Court removed the requirement by striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.

“Today’s action marks another step forward in the Justice Department’s continuing effort to protect the voting rights of all eligible Americans,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement, adding, “This represents the department’s latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last.”"

(CNN) – Roger Ailes has never been known to keep his opinions to himself.

So perhaps it's no surprise the powerful boss of Fox News Channel revealed candid opinions of top political figures – including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich – during conversations and meetings that were recorded by his biographer Zev Chafets.



In excerpts of Chafets' upcoming book ""Roger Ailes: Off Camera"" that were published in this month's Vanity Fair, the Fox News president is shown fiercely criticizing Obama, who he calls ""lazy.""

The remark came amid an analysis of CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's claims that Ann Romney had ""never worked a day in her life"" (Rosen later apologized.)

""Obama's the one who never worked a day in his life,"" Ailes said in an exchange with his spokesman, according to the excerpt in Vanity Fair. ""He never earned a penny that wasn't public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He's lazy, but the media won't report that.""

When Ailes noticed Chafets' surprised reaction, the television executive added: ""I didn't come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.""

He was referring to an interview when the ABC anchor asked Obama for ""the trait you most deplore in yourself.""

""Laziness,"" the president responded, explaining ""There is a deep down, underneath all the work that I do, I think there's a laziness in me. It's probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii and it's sunny outside, and sitting on the beach.""

Ailes was no less forgiving in his assessment of Obama's deputy Joe Biden. During a meeting with staff discussing vice presidential politics, Ailes remarked, ""I have a soft spot for Joe Biden…I like him. But he's dumb as an ashtray.""

Also on the receiving end of Ailes' blunt appraisal? Newt Gingrich, the former house speaker, who gave up his contributor role at Fox to make a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.

In the waning days of his presidential campaign, Gingrich was quoted saying ""Fox has been for Romney all the way through,"" adding that he thought CNN's coverage of the GOP primaries was less biased.

""We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact,"" Gingrich said at an event in Delaware, according to a report from Real Clear Politics.

""He's a sore loser and if he had won he would have been a sore winner,"" Ailes said, according to Chafets' biography.

""Newt's a prick,"" Ailes succinctly concluded.

CNN reached out to the White House and to a representative of Gingrich for reaction to Ailes' comments."

http://news.yahoo.com/national-review-back-warning-white-people-black-people-220330124.html,,[],National Review Is Back to Warning White People About Black People,"Fifteen months after The National Review ended its relationship with longtime writer John Derbyshire for an essay he wrote for TakiMag.com in which he instructs his children to be afraid of black people, the conservative magazine has published Victor Davis Hanson's version of the same article. It is unlikely Hanson will meet the same fate as his former colleague.

RELATED: Why John Derbyshire Hasn't Been Fired (Yet)

What's changed? Well, all the attention on the killing of Trayvon Martin and the trial and acquittal of George Zimmerman and the hardening of stances on the merits of racial stereotyping. Derbyshire's piece was a response to several essays written in the aftermath of Martin's death about ""The Talk"" that black parents give their sons about how to deal with with white police officers and other authority figures. In ""The Talk: Nonblack Version,"" Derbyshire wrote, ""There is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too."" In his talk, he said, he told his children that they should ""Avoid concentrations of blacks"" who are strangers, ""Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods,"" ""Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in apparent distress,"" and ""If accosted by a strange black in the street, smile and say something polite but keep moving.""

RELATED: John Derbyshire Has (Finally) Been Fired

In The National Review on Tuesday, Hanson notes that Attorney General Eric Holder told the NAACP that George Zimmerman's acquittal meant he had to give his son ""The Talk,"" about how black people are assumed to be violent by some white people and thus at great risk for harm. Hanson says, ""Yet I fear that for every lecture of the sort that Holder is forced to give his son, millions of non-African-Americans are offering their own versions of ensuring safety to their progeny."" Hanson does not try to be funny, the way Derbyshire did, and he doesn't make the same kind of vague warnings about a simmering race war. (Derbyshire said about 5 percent of blacks were ""ferociously hostile to whites,"" and another 50 percent or so of them would go along out of solidarity and becaue they think white people have it coming.) But his basic idea is the same: watch out for black kids.

Story continues

RELATED: Racist Writers Are Right to Feel Threatened

Hanson says his father — a Democrat! — told him once, ""When you go to San Francisco, be careful if a group of black youths approaches you."" Hanson continues:

Note what he did not say to me. He did not employ language like “typical black person.” He did not advise extra caution about black women, the elderly, or the very young — or about young Asian Punjabi, or Native American males. In other words, the advice was not about race per se, but instead about the tendency of males of one particular age and race to commit an inordinate amount of violent crime. It was after some first-hand episodes with young African-American males that I offered a similar lecture to my own son.

When he was a grad student, Hanson says, two black guys tried to break into his apartment while he was in it. Another time, four black guys tried to steal his bike while he was on it. ""Regrettably, I expect that my son already has his own warnings prepared to pass on to his own future children,"" he says.

RELATED: Florida's Problems with Racial Politics Go Far Beyond Trayvon Martin

This is dumb and not very polite, The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, but also does not actually make Hanson's kids safe.

If I were to tell you that I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because ""Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT,"" you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because ""Jews are really successful,"" you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is.

But racism makes people do dumb things, Coates writes. So does politics. There have been pretty clear political ""sides"" to the Trayvon Martin case ever since President Obama spoke about him in March 2012. Coates wrote last fall:

As civil-rights activists descended on Florida, National Review, a magazine that once opposed integration, ran a column proclaiming“Al Sharpton Is Right.” The belief that a young man should be able to go to the store for Skittles and an iced tea and not be killed by a neighborhood-­watch patroller seemed un­controversial… The moment Obama spoke, the case of Trayvon Martin passed out of its national-mourning phase and lapsed into something darker and more familiar—racialized political fodder.

Since the Zimmerman verdict, many people have defended racial profiling as the right reaction to crime rates — black people have a higher crime rate, though it is dropping, as it is with other demographics. The Washington Post's Richard Cohen did, so did Kathleen Parker, calling it ""common sense."" The racial debate intensified again after Obama's speech last Friday, when he said ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" Several people pointed out that black people commit crimes too, and why didn't Obama mention that? ""If you think of the young mother whose 2-year-old son was shot in the face by the two black teens that approached her in Atlanta and that baby had died, why do presidents choose to speak about one case and not the other?"" former George W. Bush press secretary Dana Perino said on Sunday. Hanson points out that black men allegedly robbed a jewelry store the same day Holder gave his talk:

What were the names of two of the men suspected of being the ones who last week shot it out with the Santa Rosa jeweler as Eric Holder demagogued the Trayvon Martin shooting? Traveon Banks-Austin and Alexander Tyvon Brandon. And so the tragedy continues.

They had similar names, so... so that must mean something, right?

And Fox News' Bill O'Reilly said on Monday night, ""The sad truth is that from the president on down, our leadership has no clue, no clue at all about how to solve problems within the black community."" The real problem black people face is not white racism, he said, but instead, ""The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African-American family."" This is about personal choice, not oppression, O'Reilly said — ""White people don't force black people to have babies out of wedlock"" — except in the case of the liberal entertainment industry, which ""encourages the irresponsibility by marketing a gangster culture, hip hop, movies, trashy TV shows to impressionable children."" He continued, ""President Obama has welcomed some of the worst offenders in that cesspool to the White House when he should be condemning what these weasels are doing. These so-called entertainers get rich while the kids who emulate their lyrics and attitude destroy themselves."" Get it? Maybe the black president, in some small way, is the one who's really responsible for some black crime, too."

Thankfully, Democratic Attorney General candidate, State Senator Mark Herring (D-Loudoun, Fairfax), is all over this one.

(Photo by D Dipasupil/Getty Images for Extra)

""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson made headlines this week for his anti-gay sentiments in a GQ interview. Now another statement from the interview -- this time about the black community during the pre-civil rights era -- is stirring more controversy.

GQ's Drew Magary sat down with the ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch for a candid interview about his road to fame. The 67-year-old journeyed from substance abuse to devotion to God to small-screen celebrity, all in the backwoods of Louisiana. According to Robertson, growing up in those Louisiana backwoods in the pre-civil rights era was not bad for black people.

“I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" Robertson is quoted in GQ. ""Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash. We’re going across the field.... They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”

Before the civil rights movement of the 1950s, Jim Crow laws enforced a system of subjugating African-Americans in the South by upholding racial barriers for years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The cultural climate in the Southern states was one of ""disenfranchisement, segregation and various forms of oppression, including race-inspired violence,"" History.com notes.

The Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E, expressing deep concern over Robertson's remarks:

We want to be clear why Phil Robertson’s remarks are not just dangerous but also inaccurate. Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn’t see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street. And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it’s important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] -- it’s not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous.

Robertson called homosexuality a sin and juxtaposed it with bestiality. After his homophobia made news, A&E released a statement announcing Robertson's indefinite suspension from ""Duck Dynasty."" The network emphasized that his beliefs are in contrast to those of the network.

Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr.

I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.



The Birth of the NAACP The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were: National President, Moorfield Storey, Boston

Chairman of the Executive Committee, William English Walling

Treasurer, John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)

Disbursing Treasurer, Oswald Garrison Villard

Executive Secretary, Frances Blascoer

Director of Publicity and Research, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.



Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history, many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects, it wasn't until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I'll feature two of them here today.

NAACP founding member Mary White Ovington

Mary White Ovington was born April 11, 1865 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year, Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement. ...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled ""Race War in the North"" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909... After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951.

William English Walling, Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)

William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as ""English"" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880, and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP, and founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903. In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.

So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let's fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership, and yes, a majority are black Americans, NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County, South Carolina Branch of the NAACP, Phillip Howell , is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.

I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being ""anti-black"" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly ""white"" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them ""white"" groups at all, they are just ""groups,"" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else.

I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is ""a historically black college"" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.

The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having ""black"" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.

So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts.

Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your ""card"" for real."

I'm trying to figure out why the outreach of the GOP and especially CPAC is not working with black citizens and I have yet to find an answer, only I get, all I've gotten is abrasive attitudes and people yelling because I guess I ask the tough question, just ask the simple question, where's the inclusion? Where are the black people? I don't know why that is so offensive?""



I disagree with the gentleman who was asked to leave, no 'outreach' is every going to work with this broken farce of a GOP. The GOP can not astroturf minorities on stage and think that will win them minority voters in the ballot box because they are still selling them same product Mitt Romney couldn't sell with all the money in the world behind him, and even if they did, wouldn't GOP efforts to make voting harder for those same minorities negate that? There is a reason the GOP or CPAC or any of the other wingnut outfits can't win over anyone other than screaming white guys who cheered George W Bush on and suddenly got pissed off when President Obama was first inaugurated. The incestuous amplification of white Republicans telling white Republicans that race no longer matters only works on white Republicans, the root of the problem is that the entire GOP as a structure is rooted around demonizing everyone who isn't white or privileged, and that by nature excludes everyone else. I mean, it's hard to put 'Mr. Obama is a Kenyan Trump' on stage and then wonder why you can't win black people.

I guess you don't have to be a poor demented honky to vote Republican, but it helps.

The floor is now yours . . .

Surprise, the white guy screaming in this video is a Brietbart hack, check out the diary posted by bluebarnstormer http://www.dailykos.com/...

Another note, Republicans have convinced themselves that there is no racism for the same reasons they claim there is no such thing as Global warming, or that the problem is that we don't have enough guns on the street, Republicans pretend these problems don't exist and take offense if you claim they do because Conservatives and their wealthy financial backers are the chief beneficiaries of racism and pollution and the flooding of America with high power war rifles. Saying racism doesn't exist then allows you to turn a blind eye to it, because of course it doesn't exist, so what's the problem. That is why Republicans tell themselves that black people would only vote GOP if they really knew what the GOP was about. As if that isn't insulting.

If they admit the problem exists they have to offer a solution, so they don't. Instead they insist that the problem of racism, pollution and other things don't exist at all, unlike socialism.

And there you have it. Republicans can't admit racism exists because they are the sole beneficiaries of it, keeping poor white people voting for rich white people is only possible if the strawman of the Sherriff is black.

And the media will never state that because they are owned by the corporations who stand to gain the most if Republican racism remains the Elephant in the Room, pardon the pun.

Magical thinking doesn't fix these problems. And magical thinking is all the GOP has left, that and fear.

Bigots.

Scanning national media over the last several days, one sees words such as homophobia, bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution, states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever, to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.

This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:This is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment, from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost, and the damage inflicted is incalculable.

We liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment, from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election, where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:



None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist,” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.

Remember, those aren't liberals, but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist, hateful, out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.

That's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people, it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance, which is totally different than bigotry!

The mask is off the modern GOP, and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes, there really is justice in this world.

Steve King missed the message from party leaders about how supporting an immigration overhaul could help boost the GOP’s standing among Latino voters.

He just isn’t buying it.

“I’m incredulous with the conclusion they drew when the sun came up on the morning of Nov. 7,” the firebrand Iowa congressman said the other day, standing outside the Capitol. “They just said that Mitt Romney would be president-elect on that morning if he just hadn’t said two words: self-deport.”

It was a sparsely attended news conference: Just a handful of hard-line House Republicans protesting the immigration bill a Senate committee was poised to approve.

So it goes these days with the opposition to revamping the immigration system, a movement that has been more muted than six years ago when a similar effort successfully turned back a reform bill.

The opponents this time include a sizable coalition of tea party and conservative leaders, including many local-level talk radio hosts.

NumbersUSA, a group that has long fought to limit immigration, has run radio and television ads in more than a dozen states, seeking to pressure senators to vote against the bill. The organization’s president, Roy Beck, brushes off the idea that opposition has waned, noting that polls suggest Americans have mixed feelings about granting citizenship to immigrants. “It seems lonely — just us and the American people,” he said.

But the opponents face a much different landscape than six years ago. Not only are key Republicans not overtly attacking the proposal, but support appears much more solid among Democrats, who had also played a role in dashing earlier efforts.

The growing influence of the Latino electorate, which spurned Romney to help reelect President Obama, and the defeat of much of Arizona’s strict anti-immigration law in the Supreme Court, “created a lot of running room for Republicans to come to the table,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a center-left think tank in Washington.

Republicans as well as Democrats have become more comfortable with offering legal status to an estimated 11 million people who have entered the U.S. illegally or stayed beyond their visas.

The lawmakers are being nudged along, in part, by the stories being told by young people brought to the United States as children who have become adults without legal status. These young adults, who call themselves “Dreamers,” after the Dream Act, a failed legislative effort that would have offered them a route to citizenship, have given a compelling voice to a once largely unheard immigrant population.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, recalls that a “sort of death march” took hold of the 2007 legislative effort as both sides found reasons to back away.

“I don’t think there are as many shaking Democrats today as there were in 2007,” said Angela Kelley, vice president of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

One other element has weighed heavily on both parties: the White House.

Obama used executive authority last summer to defer deportations of Dreamers who came forward and registered. It was, for many lawmakers, a turning point.

Democrats saw the move as a political win that helped give Obama a 44-percentage-point lead among Latinos over Romney in the election.

Advertisement

Republican leaders have since sought to persuade reluctant colleagues that the time has come for Congress to fix the immigration system, lest Obama take further action on his own — and Democrats seize a permanent advantage among the growing Latino electorate.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has privately pushed a bipartisan group of lawmakers to complete their work on the House’s proposed immigration overhaul. “We’re not going to be stampeded by the White House or stampeded by the president,” he said last week.

Advertisement

King says that there are more Republican lawmakers on his side than the few who stood beside him on that sunny spring day and that he believes more will join to defeat the bill as voters learn about it.

In the NumbersUSA spots, a man’s voice argues that an overhaul will allow too many legal immigrants into the U.S. who would then compete with out-of-work Americans for jobs.

Advertisement

The group has enlisted its 2 million members to corner lawmakers at home. “We’re hoping to shame the senators: ‘You’ve got these long lines of unemployed Americans, and you’re going to pass this sort of bill?’” Beck said.

Like-minded Republican opponents also exist in the Senate, and so far not one beyond the four who helped draft the bill has fully endorsed the overhaul.

King predicted that over time, Republican leaders would join him.

“If they’re not on our side,” he said, “I’d suggest that they are convertibles.”

A federal judge Wednesday approved a plan to place an independent monitor inside the Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff’s Office to ensure the department is not racial profiling.

Maricopa County deputies - once described by a Justice Department expert as conducting “the most egregious racial profiling in the United States” - will have every traffic stop monitored statistically and with video cameras, with strict orders to ignore suspects’ race.

U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow’s ruling caps a class-action anti-discrimination lawsuit against Arpaio and the sheriff’s office. In May, Snow ruled that Arpaio’s office was using unconstitutional racial profiling to target and detain Latinos suspected to have entered the U.S. illegally.

The latest ruling orders the sheriff’s office to promote an internal policy “that unauthorized presence in the United States is not a crime and does not itself constitute reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing any crime.”

Deputies making stops will have to make a radio call specifying what the stop is about. They are barred from asking someone about immigration status unless the person is suspected of a crime.

Snow ruled that the court would maintain the monitorship until the sheriff’s office had achieved “full and effective compliance” for at least three years. The sheriff’s office and the plaintiffs - Latinos who said they were profiled by deputies - were expected to agree on the monitor, who will be appointed by the judge to oversee the department.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which filed suit against the sheriff’s office, will have access to department data and materials and will receive reports about the department’s progress on implementing new training and anti-discrimination policies.

“Every person in Maricopa County deserves better than a sheriff’s department that commits pervasive civil rights violations at the expense of public safety,” Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “The court’s order will make sure the agency actually enforces the law and will no longer go on wild goose chases based on racial stereotypes.”

The sheriff’s office’s attorney, Tim Casey, told the Arizona Republic that the department expected to appeal Snow’s decision but would abide by the order.

“The sheriff still remains in exclusive charge of the [sheriff’s office], he still sets the policy, still sets the programs and makes the sole decision on discretionary items,” Casey told the Republic. “The monitor has absolutely no veto power whatsoever on any law enforcement decision.”

That idea, which only a black person could invoke without being castigated for the flagrant racial overtones, is a trope to which an increasingly homogeneous Republican Party seems to subscribe.

The most recent example of this is E.W. Jackson, who last weekend became the Virginia Republicans’ candidate for lieutenant governor in the state.

In a video posted to YouTube in 2012 titled “Bishop E.W. Jackson Message to Black Christians,” Jackson says:

“It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat party. They have insulted us, used us and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies: ‘Unless we support the Democrat party, we will be returned to slavery. We will be robbed of voting rights. The Martin Luther King holiday will be repealed.’ They think we’re stupid and these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.”

He continues:

“Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder. We belong to God. Our ancestors were sold against their will centuries ago, but we’re going to the slave market voluntarily today. Yes, it’s just that ugly.”"

Now comes word there is yet another reason to avoid getting your crafty supplies and holiday decorations from Hobby Lobby. They recently opened a new store in New Jersey and blogger Ken Berwitz discovered last week that Hobby Lobby doesn't sell any Hanukkah merchandise. Not a single menorah. Not a single dreidel.



In the past few days two different friends told my wife they had gone into the new hobby lobby store in Marlboro, New Jersey and noticed that, although there already was a lot of Christmas merchandise available, there was none for the Jewish holiday of Chanukah (some people drop the ""C"" and spell it Hannukah. Same holiday). One of our friends entered the store, asked where the Chanukah goods were, was told there wouldn't be any, and asked why. According to her, the answer was: ""We don't cater to you people"" Understandably irate, she called the home office, and was told, indifferently, that hobby lobby doesn't have Chanukah on its list of holidays. Since I did not hear this ugly exchange with my own ears, I was not personally certain it was the case. And that's not good enough for this blog. So I just called the Marlboro hobby lobby and asked whether it would be stocking any Chanukah merchandise. I was told it would not. When I asked why, the answer - verbatim - was: ""Because Mr. Green is the owner of the company, he's a Christian, and those are his values"" FYI, I would guess that, in a five mile radius around the Marlboro store, a solid one-third of all residents are Jewish. But, then again, what is the difference? The reason hobby lobby won't sell Chanukah goods is unrelated to how many Jews are in the area,

In a brief email to Patch, Hobby Lobby representative Vincent Parker said, ""We currently do not carry any Hanukah items in our store. Our customers have brought this to our attention and we are currently evaluating our Holiday items and what we will carry in the future."" Parker did not comment on the alleged remarks by a Hobby Lobby employee, and did not confirm the conversation ever happened.

Over the weekend, backlash started to build and as of this morning, the company says: For what it's worth, I went to their Facebook page and asked whether they would confirm whether they do or do not sell any Hanukkah merchandise, and while my comment/question is still visible on the page, the ensuing conversation has been deleted. They seem to be responding to questions about a variety of friendly topics such as new store openings, discounts, etc., but questions from consumers about their policy on Hanukkah merchandise remain unanswered.All comments and questions regarding Hannukah merchandise are now being deleted from their Facebook page.

House Speaker Thom Tillis (R-Charlotte) announced Thursday afternoon that the bill would not be receiving a vote in the full House, effectively dropping the measure. Loretta Boniti, a reporter for News 14 Carolina, broke the news on Twitter, and it was confirmed in a breaking news alert posted on the home page of wral.com, a Raleigh-based television station. Tillis' decision followed several days of national media attention on the bill, which also said that the state government did not have to listen to federal court rulings and was exempt from the requirements of the First Amendment.

The bill, which was drafted by state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), was intended to address an issue in Rowan County, where the ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the county commission in an attempt to block commissioners from having a Christian prayer at the beginning of meetings.

The North Carolina measure responds to the ACLU suit by declaring that each state is ""sovereign"" and no federal court can prevent a state from ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" Though Warren, one of the bill's authors, told HuffPost Live that the measure was not seeking to create a state religion, the drafted legislation would clearly allow for such an action.

SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion. SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.

The North Carolina bill seeks to play the First Amendment both ways. It says that the state is exempted from the establishment clause under the First Amendment, which establishes the ""separation of church and state."" The clause reads that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an Establishment of Religion."" But the North Carolina bill asserts that prohibition does not apply ""to states, municipalities, or schools,"" and that North Carolina could establish a state religion. The bill then goes further, portraying this reasoning as a protection of the freedom of religion, including the state lawmakers' right to exercise their own religious beliefs.

In fact, in a series of cases stretching back nearly a century, the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment does cover state governments. Judicial precedent has held that any such proposals on the establishment of religion must have secular, legislative purpose; cannot inhibit or advance religion; and cannot be ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""

An explanation on why Tillis decided to kill the measure was not posted and a Tillis spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The media firestorm regarding the legislation comes as Tillis is considering a bid for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) next year. Tillis was not a co-sponsor of the bill, which originally drew 11 GOP supporters, including Tillis' deputy, Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Justin Burr (R-Albemarle). Three additional Republicans had signed on as co-sponsors since the bill was first introduced on Monday."

""Today, we celebrate the further cementing of the foundation on which the culture of life in Texas is built upon,"" Perry told an auditorium full of supportive Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists. ""It is our responsibility and duty to give voice to the unborn individuals.""

The law restricts abortions to surgical centers and requires doctors who work at abortion clinics to have hospital admitting privileges. Only five of the 42 abortion clinics in Texas — the nation's second-largest state — currently meet those new requirements.

STORY: Providers fear major shutdowns

The law also bans abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, based on the disputed notion that fetuses can feel pain at that point of development, and dictates when abortion-inducing drugs can be taken.

Clinics will have a year to either upgrade their facilities or shut down after the law takes effect in October.

Supporters argue the new law will ensure high-quality health care for women, but opponents view it as over-regulation intended to make abortions harder to obtain.

Similar measures in other states have been blocked by federal judges, and opponents in Texas said they would pursue a similar course.

""The fight over this law will move to the courts, while the bigger fight for women's access to health care in Texas gains steam,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.

Perry and other top Republican leaders made passing the law a top priority, in part to please the most conservative wing of the party before the primary election in March. But it touched off weeks of protests that saw thousands of activists on both sides of the issue descend on the Texas Capitol in an outpouring of activism unseen in at least 20 years.

After the regular legislative session ended May 27, Perry added passing the abortion measure to lawmakers' agenda for a 30-day special session. But on the last day to pass bills, Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis staged a more than 12-hour, one-woman filibuster hoping to talk past a midnight deadline and kill the legislation.

Republicans used parliamentary objections to silence Davis, but just before midnight hundreds of bill opponents in the Senate gallery screamed and cheered so loudly that all work stopped on the Senate floor below until it was too late. It launched Davis into an overnight political sensation.

But Perry called lawmakers back for a second special session — setting up the bill's final approval last week.

Thursday's signing ceremony was moved from Perry's office on the second floor of the Capitol to a basement auditorium, surrounded by dozens of state troopers who tightly controlled who entered and braced for potentially hundreds of activists. Instead, only about two dozen showed up, clutching coat-hangers and signs that read ""My Body, My Choice"" and ""Shame!""

As Perry and other lawmakers spoke, protesters repeatedly chanted ""shame!"" loud enough to be heard. Once the bill was signed, they hooted and then sang Twisted Sister's ""We're Not Gonna Take It!""

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who oversees the state Senate, blamed ""intentional chaos created by the radical left"" for the bill not passing sooner. He credited prayer and ""the hand of God"" in making Thursday's event happen.

That was a common sentiment among supporters. The Catholic Association said in a statement: ""Rick Perry is a brave man for standing up to the mob tactics of the abortion lobby and has earned the respect of pro-life women and men across the country.""

Republican Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, who sponsored the bill in the Texas House and mistakenly suggested during debate that emergency room rape kits could be used to terminate pregnancies, said: ""It really was the hand of God"" and prayer that helped make the signing possible. Laubenberg told Perry, who announced last week that he wouldn't seek a fourth full term as governor next year, that ""your eternal legacy will be as a defender of life.""

Sen. Glenn Hegar, a Katy Republican who sponsored the bill in the Senate, called it ""a very proud day in Texas history.""

""This will literally change the lives of millions of Texans,"" Hegar said. ""Not just today in 2013, but for eternity."""

His dissertation committee consisted of

George J. Borjas (chair)

Richard J. Zeckhauser

Christopher Jenks

Borjas is your basic, run-of-the-mill anti-immigrant conservative, with substantial scholarly and popular works explaining just how bad brown people are for America.

Zeckhauser is more of a money guy, but his wikipedia page describes him as one of ""the ""whiz kids"" assembled by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara to apply cutting-edge analysis to Cold War military strategy.""

The oddball in this list is Christopher Jenks. Jenks is currently on the editorial board of the American Prospect and many decades ago he was the editor of the New Republic. In the acknowledgements of Richwine's dissertation, he states that



I want to thank my Harvard committee members, starting with George Borjas, who helped me navigate the minefield of early graduate school and has now seen me through to the finish. Richard Zeckhauser, never someone to shy away from controversial ideas, immediately embraced my work and offered new ideas as well as incisive critiques. Christopher Jencks generously signed on as the committee's late addition and offered his own valuable input.

Reading between the lines, it seems to me that someone refused to pass the dissertation as written, and Jenks was brought in late.

Whatever else, these three people signed and passed Richwine's obviously bigotted and substandard dissertation. A dissertation that was so obviously wrong and bigoted that the Heritage Foundation...the Heritage Foundation...distanced themselves from Richwine immediately.

These three professors should be held publicly accountable. More-so, I believe that the signatures of these professors demonstrate, unequivocally, that simple bigotry resides at the heart of movement conservatism--and that this bigotry is no different whether taking about teabaggers or 'scholars'.

The dean of the Kennedy School of Government is David T. Ellwood, (david_ellwood@Harvard.Edu). I've already dropped him a line asking why the School awarded Richwine a PhD and what they plan to do in the future to prevent it from happening again. Perhaps you might as well.



Sorry to have been absent from this diary for so long now. When I posted it I never thought it would get to the rec list, and I was frankly startled to see it still there when I woke up this morning. I stuck around as long as I could.

A couple thoughts to add after all the comments.

1. Clearly there is too much variation and potential hijinks about PhD committees for my claim that the late addition of Jencks might show some problems in getting people to sign off on the dissertation. That was based on my experience as a professor in one discipline and school. Clearly, every school and discipline seems to do things differently. So, I concede that I overstated that.

2. Many folks are saying things like Harvard is a bullshit institution, Bush got his MBA there, it is a school for the 1%, etc. At some level all of that is true. I have my PhD (not from Harvard), and I would be the first to admit that a PhD does not indicate some great level of intelligence. That said, there is a difference between a PhD and an MBA, and while Harvard is seriously over-rated, they aren't the simple hacks some claim them to be. A Harvard PhD does still mean something to many folks.

I can live with dumb people getting PhDs for dumb things. Its always happened and it always will. But a PhD for what is basically a low-budget version of 19th and early-20th century eugenics? No, that is too fucking far. That is beyond what is acceptable."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Darrell Issa and the overblown scandals,"This is how a scandal implodes:

First, the head of the investigation overpromises. “This was a targeting of the president’s political enemies, effectively, and lies about it during the election year so that it wasn’t discovered until afterwards,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House oversight committee, said in May of the IRS targeting scandal. He later declared President Obama’s press secretary a “paid liar” for stating otherwise.

Next, facts emerge to undermine the investigator’s presuppositions. Documents released by Ways and Means committee Democrats this week show that the IRS, in addition to targeting tea party groups, also had “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) lists for groups using descriptors such as “progressive,” “health care legislation,” “medical marijuana,” “paying national debt” and “green energy.”

Finally, evidence surfaces that the investigator stacked the deck. Tuesday night, the Hill newspaper quoted a spokesman for Treasury’s inspector general, Russell George, saying the group was asked by Issa “to narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” The inspectors knew there were other terms, but “that was outside the scope of our audit.”

Certainly, something went badly wrong at the IRS that caused groups to be targeted because of ideology. But it’s nothing like the conspiracy Issa cooked up in which the president and his men supposedly used the tax authority to attack their political foes.

The White House deserves some of the blame for letting things get this far; a full release of information by the administration at the outset would have put the controversy to rest quickly. But the collapse of the Issa-driven scandal has reinforced a growing impression in the capital that ultimately will help Obama: The chairman is full of it.

When I covered President Clinton’s second term, White House officials were delighted to have the eccentric Dan Burton in charge of the House oversight committee. He gained prominence by shooting a melon to try to prove that Clinton aide Vince Foster hadn’t killed himself but had been murdered.

Now Issa has fallen to Burtonian levels of credibility. He’s launched a dozen or so probes, but what often begins as a legitimate inquiry into government failure turns quickly into a lunge for the Oval Office, missing each time.

Even before the Republican victory in 2010 gave him the chairmanship, Issa announced the discovery of “Obama’s Watergate” — the White House floating an administration job for a Democratic congressman to keep him out of a Senate primary. Issa backed off after learning that the Bush administration had done similar things.

Shortly before the 2010 election, Issa told Rush Limbaugh that Obama “has been one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.” He later said Obama isn’t “personally corrupt” but his administration is.

Issa then set out to prove it. He led a probe into the failed “Fast and Furious” gun sting by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Issa declared that “it went all the way to the White House,” insisting that the plan was approved “at the highest levels of the Obama appointees,” and that the Justice Department “has blood on their hands.”

The Justice Department inspector general determined that Attorney General Eric Holder didn’t even know about the program until after it was shut down.

After the failure of Solyndra, a government-aided solar company, Issa probed Energy Department loan guarantees, saying “I want to see when the president and his cronies are picking winners and losers ... that it wasn’t because there were large contributions given to them.”

The committee documented no cronyism and no presidential involvement.

Issa probed the response to Freedom of Information Act requests by the Department of Homeland Security, saying the matter “reeks of a Nixonian enemies list, and this committee will not tolerate it.”

Nothing Nixonian surfaced.

After the killing of U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, Issa accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of giving false information to Congress when she said she wasn’t involved in denying the Libyan diplomats’ security requests. He also said that it was “perhaps the White House” that later changed talking points to make it appear that the assault had begun as a protest.

It turned out Clinton wasn’t involved in the security decision and the White House wasn’t behind the change in the talking points.

Then came the IRS. Instead of delivering on Issa’s promise to reveal politically motivated harassment of conservatives by the Obama administration, the committee instead turned up evidence (including the account of a “conservative Republican” who managed IRS screening) that the actions weren’t political.

The most Issa et al. can hope to prove now is that conservatives were hassled by the IRS more than liberals. That’s a worthy topic to explore, but it’s no Watergate.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum at her alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

President Obama is expected to join the Bushes, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter for the library’s dedication Thursday.

Laura Bush, who was involved in the library’s design of Texas limestone and pecan, said she hopes visitors are touched by the 9/11 display, which includes a twisted steel beam from Tower 2 of the World Trade Center.

“I think people will be very moved by the 9/11 exhibit and I think that’s important because we still live with the effect of 9/11, both our security issues that we have and of course the loss that we still live with,” she said while answering questions in a garden outside the museum that mimics the White House Rose Garden design, substituting plants native to Texas.

PHOTOS: George W. Bush’s presidential library

“George walked a family through recently and realized that the children that were on the tour with them weren’t alive on Sept. 11 and so they had no direct memory of it like all of us do,” Bush continued. “Of course I remember where I was and who I was with—I was with Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Judd Gregg in the capital.”

Bush said the exhibit also reminded her of “meeting the families and going to that memorial service in that field in Shanksville. I remember the families that came to the White House more than once. I think some will be at the opening of the library.”

“I also remember how united we were as a country. And I think that’s an important lesson for us. We should be united. There’s more that unites us than divides us and we need to be reminded of that.”

She noted that the exhibit opens with photos of the couple’s Texas ranch and examples of the Bush agenda pre-9/11: tax cuts, faith-based initiatives, no child left behind, their first state dinner with Mexico: “And then you turn the corner and see the big beam from the World Trade Center.”

“Even in the way we tried to lay out the museum, you can see the way our lives changed and the lives of everyone in this country changed after Sept. 11,” she said.

She also noted how designers re-created the Bush White House situation room as the Decision Points Theater, an interactive exhibit that forces visitors to decide how they would have handled four crises: the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the troop surge, Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis. In the Katrina portion, images stream of people trapped atop homes and in rising water as newscasters warn of chaos in the streets.

“The idea was to show people what it’s like to have to make decisions quickly with the press hounding you,” Bush said. “I think people will find it interesting to relive those decisions.”

She said it was not difficult to part with her ball gowns for the exhibit. (“You know George is not wild about black tie.”) She said she particularly enjoyed the museum’s replica of her husband’s Oval Office, which longtime Bush advisor Karen Hughes said Wednesday was so life-like “I felt like I was going to work.”

The library also includes exhibits on the global war on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq featuring Saddam Hussein’s 9-millimeter pistol, seized during his capture. Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, said the former president enjoyed the museum and thinks his decisions have stood the test of time.

“He based his decisions on principles, he tried to make the best decisions he could, and I think he is at peace with that,” Hadley said at the library Wednesday.

Joshua Bolten, Bush’s chief of staff, was also at the library Wednesday, and praised library designers who “made the wise decision to take the difficulties of the Bush administration and face them head on: the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, Katrina, the financial crisis.” There’s even an exhibit with video of Bush, Al Gore and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris detailing the tumultuous 2000 election and Florida recount.

“So many difficult things happened during that presidency,” Bolten said, and although the library won’t boost Bush’s popularity among retractors, he said, “It will help people see the legacy through a more objective lens.”

Elsewhere in Dallas on Wednesday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-- both possible presidential contenders in 2016 -- were scheduled to speak before the library’s dedication.

Peters'],Tempers Flare as New Rules Strain Senate,"WASHINGTON — If there is a rock bottom in the frayed relationship between Senate Republicans and Democrats, it seemed uncomfortably close as the final days of 2013 on Capitol Hill degenerated into something like an endurance contest to see who could be the most spiteful.

As the sun rose on Friday, senators had worked through a second straight late-night session — called by Democrats as a way of retaliating for Republicans’ delaying tactics on confirmations. They held their first vote of the day at 7 a.m., confirming Deborah James to be secretary of the Air Force. And absent a compromise, they may still be voting through Saturday, a prospect that has thrilled no one.

“I think it resembles fourth graders playing in a sandbox, and I’ll give the majority leader, Harry Reid, 99 percent of the responsibility for it,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and usually one of the more reserved members, said Thursday.

“He’s going to have ‘The End of the Senate’ written on his tombstone,” Mr. Alexander complained.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called this week “chaotic and confusing, and a shameful waste of time.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/29/us/politics/despite-filibuster-limits-a-door-remains-open-to-block-judge-nominees.html,2013-11-29 00:00:00,['Charlie Savage'],"Despite Filibuster Limits, a Door Remains Open to Block Judge Nominees","WASHINGTON — The decision by Senate Democrats to eliminate filibusters for most judicial nominations only marginally enhanced President Obama’s power to reshape the judiciary, according to court watchers from across the political spectrum, because Republican senators can still veto his nominees to most currently vacant appeals court seats.

The new Senate rule clears the way for eight appeals court nominees who have already had confirmation hearings to win approval with simple majority votes, including three on the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reviews federal policies and regulations. But it left unchanged the Senate’s “blue slip” custom, which allows senators to block nominees to judgeships associated with their states.

“It is hard to overstate the change’s importance for the D.C. Circuit, which has a disproportionate impact on the world, but it won’t have overwhelming impact elsewhere,” Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel, said in an interview. “The blue slip rule for judges has been more problematic than the filibuster, in part because it is a silent, unaccountable veto.”

Twelve more appeals court seats are either vacant or will be by the end of 2014. All but one are in states with at least one Republican senator. As a result, Mr. Obama still lacks unrestricted power to swiftly appoint a flurry of more clearly left-of-center judges than he has done to date, despite the fears of conservatives and the hopes of liberals, specialists said."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/20/CBS-Congress-Using-Slush-Funds-to-Bankroll-Lavish-Lifestyle,2013-10-20 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],60 Minutes: Congress Using 'Slush Funds' to Bankroll Lavish Lifestyles,"On Sunday, a 60 Minutes investigative report by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer revealed how leadership PAC loopholes allow members of Congress to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.

“It’s another example, unfortunately, where the rules that apply to the rest of us, don’t really apply to the members of Congress,” said Schweizer on 60 Minutes.

The report, which contained selected material from Schweizer’s forthcoming book Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, revealed embarrassing and outlandish instances of cronyism and self-enrichment by members of Congress. Despite the fact that funds from leadership PACs are supposed to go to help elect fellow members of one’s own political party, lax campaign laws allow lawmakers to turn their leadership PACs into private slush funds to fund just about anything.

Rep. Rob Andrews (D-NJ), for example, tapped his wife, a lawyer and an associate law dean at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, to be a PAC compliance officer for his leadership PAC. She approved the use of donor dollars to fly her, Rep. Andrews, and their two daughters to Edinburgh, Scotland for a wedding at a posh resort. Andrews’s leadership PAC paid $16,575 in airfare. His campaign committee picked up the rest of the tab, which was slightly under $14,000. Schweizer says Andrews’s leadership PAC even paid for the wedding gift, which was china from Bloomingdale’s. Andrews and his wife even merged a campaign event with their daughter’s graduation party, allowing them to combine the costs of the two events, even though the PAC did not pick up the entire bill.

When Kroft confronted the Democratic New Jersey congressman, Andrews said, “I think we should take a look at having clearer rules at what they can and cannot be spent for. I’d be for that.” Andrews claimed he could not speak more on the matter because of a pending House Ethics investigation, even though Kroft said the committee told him they were fine with Andrews speaking about the matter.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) attempted to use $6,230 in campaign funds to pay for a personal trainer. Meeks’s staff claimed using campaign money for a fitness instructor is a legitimate expense, because gym visits alleviate stress from Meeks’s “official duties.” The investigation also revealed that Meeks has used $35,000 from his leadership PAC on NFL games.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss’s (R-GA) leadership PAC dropped $107,752 at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach during the 2012 election cycle. That is over three times as much money as he gave the National Republican Senatorial Committee to get fellow Republicans elected. One year, Chambliss spent nearly one-third of his entire leadership PAC funds on golf, limos, and at least one private jet ride. His leadership PAC also picked up a $26,814 dinner tab at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse and $10,344 at Pebble Beach.

The 60 Minutes special also revealed how members of Congress exploit a self-loan loophole that allows politicians to loan their own campaigns money at high interest rates and then let the loans linger to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in passive streams of profit for themselves.

Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) has bagged at least $294,245 since 1998 by loaning her congressional campaign money at interest rates up to 18%–a scheme that effectively funneled campaign contributor donations into her personal bank account. After numerous attempts to interview Napolitano, Kroft finally confronted her outside a Hispanic Caucus meeting.

“She told us that as a woman and a minority, banks wouldn’t lend her money, so she had to withdraw $150,000 from an investment account to lend it to her campaign,” said Kroft.

Kroft then questioned why she would charge 18% interest. “That’s what the Mafia gets,” he exclaimed.

“It isn’t like I’ve really profited,” said Napolitano. “I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

The 60 Minutes report also revealed that members of Congress are permitted to use leadership PAC money to hire their own family members. As Kroft and Schweizer point out, most corporations have nepotism laws that prevent the hiring of family members. And while congressional rules bar family members from serving on a congressman’s official staff, lawmakers are free to hire family to serve on their campaigns.

Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) put his daughter, grandson, daughter’s mother-in-law, grandson-in-law, granddaughter, and another relative–six family members in total–on his campaign payroll. The Paul progeny received a combined $304,599.

Kroft also confronted retiring Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-LA) about actions Schweizer reports on in Extortion. Alexander paid his two daughters over $130,000 in combined expenses for working on his campaign, which he won with an overwhelming 78% of the vote. Kroft asked Alexander what his daughters did.

“They do everything that others do for other campaigns,” said Alexander. “Somebody has to do that work. I kept it with someone I can trust. If one can’t trust their daughter, then who can they trust?”

Kroft and Schweizer agreed that leadership PACs are hotbeds of cronyism and self-enrichment.

“The abuse is substantial and pretty widespread,” said Kroft.

Schweizer agreed and said that is precisely how the Establishment likes it.

“We hear a lot about how there’s so much partisan fighting in Washington,” said Schweizer. “Here’s a great example of bipartisanship. Both sides like this current system.”

Sunday’s 60 Minutes report is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Schweizer’s publisher, next week’s Tuesday release of Extortion will include never-before-released documents and revelations on several top Democrats, Republicans, President Barack Obama, and Attorney General Eric Holder."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/05/1184716/-Ohio-Sheriff-Calls-President-Obama-An-Enemy-Won-t-Enforce-Laws-He-Doesn-t-Like,2013-02-05 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Ohio Sheriff Calls President Obama An Enemy,"In a letter dated February 1st, Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman decided to tell off the President of the United States:

It is with my blessing and my elected position as sheriff of Hancock County, Ohio, that the right of the people in the county which I represent will continue to keep and bear arms for their defense and security, and that right will not be infringed upon by any enemy, foreign or domestic. ... Any edict, regulation, or so-called 'federal law' which infringes on the right of the citizens of Hancock County, Ohio to keep and bear arms for their security will not be tolerated, recognized or enforced by me or my office.

Yep, Sheriff Heldman not only implies President Obama and the Congress are enemies of the people, but he is actually telling the chief law enforcer of the United States that he will refuse to enforce any law or regulation of his choosing.

That takes balls. He is absolutely bonkers but ballsy. Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign his office.

Heldman needs to re-read the Constitution. Article III only allows review of laws by the courts.

And then we have Article VI, Clause 2 also called the Supremacy Clause:

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.

Sheriff Heldman took an oath to enforce the laws as set by the local, state, and Federal legislatures. He can't pick and choose what laws he will enforce. He also isn't allowed to decide what laws are constitutional. That is for the courts to decide. Now if he wants to become a lawyer and then get appointed to a Federal court then he could make those decisions.

It's not like nullification is a new idea. It has been tried whenever a group of people have strongly disagreed with some laws.

During the nullification crisis of 1828 to 1834, South Carolina planter politicians formulated a new brand of slavery-based politics that would culminate in the formation of the southern confederacy. The crisis, which began as a dispute over federal tariff laws, became intertwined with the politics of slavery and sectionalism. Led by John C. Calhoun, a majority of South Carolina slaveholders claimed that a state had the right to nullify or veto federal laws and secede from the Union. Nullification and secession, according to Calhoun, were the reserved rights of the states and therefore constitutional. Calhoun's constitutional theories and the overtly proslavery discourse of the nullifiers laid the political and ideological foundation for southern nationalism. Nullification Crisis of 1828 to 1834

The result of the efforts of these attempts at nullification eventually led to the Civil War which the south lost and slavery was ended.

The US Supreme Court has also ruled nullification unconstitutional:

In the case of Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court rejected the Arkansas effort to use nullification and interposition. The state of Arkansas passed several laws in an effort to prevent the integration of its schools. The Supreme Court, in its only opinion to be signed by all nine justices, held that state governments had no power to nullify the Brown decision. The Supreme Court held that the Brown decision and its implementation ""can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted 'ingeniously or ingenuously.'"" Cooper v. Aaron (1958)

One doesn't even have to go back that far to find Heldman needs to resign his office.

The Sheriff needs to review the US Constitution and the most recent court decisions about guns especially District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) where the US Supreme court held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home and within federal enclaves and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) which extended that protection to the states.

Heldman also admitted to the Findlay Ohio Courier that the 1994 assault weapons ban wasn't enforced in Hancock county.

If an elected official, who took an oath to enforce all laws, can't, through moral or personal objections, enforce those laws, then that elected official needs to resign his office immediately.

Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign.

Here's the letter:

Update

Thanks for getting this on the Rec List.

Some commentors have pointed out a few things. A local Sheriff doesn't generally enforce Federal laws and Heldman's proposed action isn't any different than some local law enforcers who look the other way about certain drugs laws, draconian immigration laws, or other laws that a police officer thinks is stupid.

Those are valid points and wasn't something I thought about when writing my post.

If Heldman wrote in his letter and said Obama sucked and he hated the gun laws or the invisible gun laws that Rush and Hannity say are coming then I wouldn't pay attention to the guy and chalk him up to just another winger - which he is anyway.

I know that police use discretion when they can about enforcing laws - more about time and place than filling the jails. Most people call it ""getting a break"". It just happens and if someone raises a stink then we are back to where Heldman is now.

However Heldman's public letter and implying that the government was the enemy smacked of George Wallace and the other segregationists from the civil rights era. ""Normal"" police discretion isn't publicly announced in this way. That is what made me write a post about it.

I personally think there is a difference between laws that benefit the public good and those that single out and punish a certain class of people. The legislature can and does make mistakes - DOMA anyone? But these are still laws on the books and until they are changed or repealed by the lawmakers or the courts, law enforcement is obligated to enforce them.

I see it the same no matter who does it and the reason why. Police who use their discretion in extreme ways also need to resign then. It isn't their job to decide what laws to enforce. They can complain about those laws and even participate like all voters can and petition lawmakers to change the laws, but they can't publicly come out and defy a law they don't like.

Heldman basically just gave a reason he shouldn't be Sheriff and he should resign.

I'm just checking...","I've been told that here we are a ""reality-based community."" I do see some signs of that as finally, after years of outright hostility towards people who were trying to point out that the Democratic party establishment is on the take by the same moneyed corporatists cartels that own the Republican party establishment, more and more kossacks are beginning to accept that obvious fact.

But there is a topic I want to check on to assess whether we are actually making enough progress when it comes to being a ""reality-based"" community. I'll keep it short, since I think it is pretty straightforward...

You do know that so-called stand-your-ground, concealed-carry, ""castle-doctrine,"" and many other laws and regulations having to do with arming the population to the teeth have been pushed by corporatist business cartels like ALEC, and the gun industry, and the myriad astroturf front groups and think tanks they fund, right?

Now, you may ask, ""why would 'business' groups, or corporatist cartels would put so much effort on arming the population?""

Let's get a couple of facts out the way: The U.S. is in the final stages of a transition towards a plutocratic corporatocracy. I'm going to save space here and instead recommend these three information resources as support to this statement: ""America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy,"" Lawrence Lessig: We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim.

And by now, you must also be aware about the fact that the entire U.S. mainstream media has the overall effect of a mind-numbing propaganda machine that serves the interests of the corrupt ruling class by spreading lies, misinformation, and false narratives. I'll direct you to this information resource: ""America's Sell Out Intellectuals and the Perks They Get.""

Now, after getting that out of the way, hopefully by now you see where I'm going since if those two facts are accepted as such, then the rest is easy to understand...

The ruling elite is currently engaging in a massive looting and pillaging of the country's wealth, mainly by increasingly exploiting and subjugating the citizenry.

Whatever is left of democracy is being systematically dismantled, along with our constitutional rights. The proper functioning of government is being purposely atrophied by a well-planned and systematic de-funding strategy.

That's where all the talk about ""entitlement"" reforms and ""austerity"" is coming from.

As this happens, the social safety net is dismantled, and with it, the social fabric starts to unravel.

Eventually this creates a siege mentality on affected groups, starting with the very poor and dispossessed, followed by those who are near poverty, and up the economic ladder.

This eventually exacerbates divisions based on economic class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, etc...

When conditions get sufficiently bad (due to increased austerity policies, which by the way, are being imposed on purpose), once you flood communities with guns, and once you put in place a regime of laws that expand the justification for justifiable homicides, then you've created the perfect conditions for people to start shooting at each other.

Once people start shooting and getting away with it, then the business cartels keep pushing more and more boiler-plate laws expanding the justification for more shootings.

Eventually this will bring about a situation where you will have mainly right wing groups across the country armed to the teeth, emboldened to intimidate social justice activists as the conditions deteriorate due to the imposition of austerity, i.e., purposely defunding the proper functioning of government (of the the people and by the people).

What's behind all this? That's also pretty straightforward. What these fascistic business cartels are doing is taking down the regulatory infrastructure, the social safety net, and etc., in order to eventually align labor costs to those of developing countries. Yes, folks, it's about money; it's about putting a fascist boot on your neck, figuratively and literally.

So there you have it. That's what's happening.

Now, some people may refuse to believe that there could be people so evil as to purposely and systematically help in bringing about the conditions for this type of mayhem.

Think again. These billionaires funding this stuff are as much as fascists thugs as any other tyrant in history.

You haven't seen half of what these people are capable of--yet."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: The McWeiners of the world,"Over two decades of covering politicians’ scandals, I’ve often been asked a version of this question: What makes them do such stupid things?

Based on my extensive experience, I respond with a version of this answer: I don’t know.

But I do have theories. And that brings me to this week’s McWeiner controversy.

Most news accounts treated these as two separate scandals: Anthony Weiner, the disgraced Democratic congressman and would-be mayor of New York, had been exposed again as a digital flasher, sending “selfie” pictures of his privates to women. Bob McDonnell, the Republican governor of Virginia, was found to be taking gifts and loans from a businessman McDonnell had helped.

Their offenses — particularly their responses upon being caught — are much the same.

By coincidence, both men found themselves apologizing for their misdeeds on the same day, July 23. McDonnell’s was cowardly, done via Twitter while he was out of the country; Weiner’s was handled in yet another bizarre news conference. But both were reluctant, their statements less expressions of contrition than naked efforts to make the problems go away. These were the apologies of narcissists.

“I want you to know that I broke no laws,” McDonnell wrote in a statement expressing regret not for the gifts he took but for “the embarrassment” — which occurred when he was found out.

Weiner, though acknowledging his misbehavior, quickly pivoted to blaming others. “With 49 days left until primary day, perhaps I’m surprised that more things didn’t come out sooner,” he said. “This was a very public thing that we had happen to us,” he added, as if somebody else had forced him to send out photos of his genitals.

Their offenses are similarly pointless: Weiner threw away a promising career by exchanging smut with women he claims he never met. McDonnell, once mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, undid his reputation by accepting sums — a $6,500 Rolex, a $15,000 splurge at Bergdorf Goodman — that were trivial compared to those he could have earned after leaving office.

Both men seem to have the condition that afflicts so many officeholders who get into trouble, from Clinton to Foley to Sanford to Spitzer: a sense of invincibility, and a belief that the usual rules don’t apply to them. They take ever bigger risks, as if it is a form of thrill-seeking, or they can no longer gauge risk.

Weiner’s was particularly flamboyant: On the day in 2010 when the House voted to approve Obamacare, and Republican lawmakers stood on the House balcony riling a tea party crowd below, Weiner showed up and taunted the gathering. “I feel like Mussolini now!” he said.

The narcissistic strain is common, and it predates the rise to power. It takes a certain personality to believe that one is meant to lead. This is reinforced once in power by sycophantic staffers. The problem has become worse as congressional redistricting leaves more lawmakers with safe seats, but the phenomenon is not Washington’s alone: McDonnell honed his invincibility in Richmond, and Weiner continued his behavior after resigning his House seat.

Whatever the origins, the McWeiner apologies show what happens when the lawmaker’s innate grandiosity is nurtured. From McDonnell’s Twitter account came this message: “Gov Bob McDonnell releases important statement: Repaid loans, apologized,” as if checking boxes. The tweet also cited a “report” — issued by one of McDonnell’s lawyers — saying the company of the businessman who sponsored McDonnell received “no benefit.”

It later emerged that McDonnell was in Kuwait and Afghanistan when the perfunctory apologizing was occurring. He gave a satellite interview to a Washington TV station, saying with a smile, “I’m not going anywhere. I love this job.”

Likewise, when Weiner was asked at his news conference what he would say to “those people who want you to drop out of the race,” he shot back: “I’m sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race.”

McDonnell padded his brief statement with a proclamation that “Virginia has never been stronger and I plan to focus on creating even more jobs.”

Weiner, in turn, said the new revelations -- that he continued sexting even after his wife told People magazine last summer that he had reformed himself -- doesn’t change “the fundamentals of my feelings here, and that is that I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they’re willing to still continue to give me a second chance.”

Or a third chance. Whatever the number, the McWeiners will always think they deserve it.

BOB%3A Politicians in Washington today are too quick to use the word %22scandal.%22

CAL%3A The entire city of Washington%2C no matter which party is in the majority%2C is one big scandal.

Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot.

CAL: It's amusing to hear Washington politicians and much of the news media selectively use the word ""scandal."" They seem to be appealing to a standard for judging right and wrong that they have abandoned in most other categories.

BOB: Politicians in Washington today are too quick to use the word ""scandal."" Scandal used to refer to big things with serious consequences, things like Watergate, which brought down a sitting president. That was a big scandal. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa — a Republican, of course — has held two hearings on Benghazi, Libya, and come up with absolutely nothing except bad communication by the administration. Issa should wrap up his investigation.

CAL: Bad communication? That sounds Nixonian. Watergate was called a ""third-rate burglary"" by the Nixon White House. When Republicans are in power, Democrats constantly uncover scandals, but when Democrats are in power, scandalous behavior is dismissed by Democrats as phony. It's one of the things normal people — meaning those who don't live in Washington — hate about this town. Instead of performing their constitutional duties, politicians spend too much time (when they're not vacationing) smearing each other.

BOB: There have been plenty of Republican efforts to go to the extreme scandal zone. Impeaching Bill Clinton was a classic example. Fortunately, the Senate had enough sense to acquit Clinton, and the American people were behind him in huge numbers. Republicans just don't get that their idea of scandal is not what the average American thinks is a serious scandal.

CAL: If you ask me, the entire city of Washington — no matter which party is in the majority — is one big scandal.

BOB: You may have a point.

CAL: Applying the old standard for judging behavior, many policies and actions by members of this administration need scrutiny. Label them what you will. First and foremost is what in shorthand is now simply called ""Benghazi."" That several survivors of last year's attack on the U.S. mission have reportedly been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements and receive regular polygraph tests to ensure they don't talk to the news media and Congress is scandalous. The relatives of the dead deserve to know what happened to their loved ones, as does the public. Benghazi victim Sean Smith's mother says President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised her the truth, but she says she has not been told anything.

BOB: Non-disclosure and polygraph tests are standard procedures for the CIA. Darrell Issa has had everyone in the chain of command up before his committee and has not found a smoking gun. The only question that remains is who gave the final word to stand down. The idea of taking CIA operatives out of the field to testify before Congress jeopardizes them and will contribute little to what Congress already knows.

CAL: This sounds to be like a major coverup in part to ease the path of Hillary Clinton's expected run for president. It was on her watch this happened, and her dismissive ""What difference does it make?"" comment before a congressional panel is scandalous in its own right.

BOB: Cal, by 2016, the American people will have forgotten Benghazi. The idea that this was a strategy for Hillary Clinton and 2016 is absurd. Strategies like this are complicated and require numerous people to make them work. Do you really believe that if this were a strategy, it wouldn't have leaked by now? Come on. You've been here long enough to know the difference.

CAL: I've been here long enough to realize things aren't always what they at first appear to be.

BOB: I'll grant you that, but not in this case.

CAL: Other scandals include the Justice Department obtaining phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors as well as Fox News reporter James Rosen; the IRS targeting conservative groups when they applied for tax-exempt status; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius possibly violating the Hatch Act by soliciting contributions from agencies HHS might regulate to help sign up uninsured people for ObamaCare ...

BOB: Are you finished? This is starting to resemble a filibuster.

CAL: Not yet, because the list is long and growing. There is also ""Fast and Furious,"" in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent guns to Mexico in hopes of tracing them to drug cartels, only to see them used to kill a U.S. border agent; and the Pigford scandal, in which the Department of Agriculture, in an effort to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency, paid billions in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who didn't face discrimination. There's more.

BOB: Each of these has been investigated by a Republican House of Representatives. As far as I can tell, it came up with nothing that was unlawful or significant enough to remove people from office. If politicians of both parties would spend more time legislating and less time attacking each other, we would all be better off.

CAL: I agree with that in principle, Bob, but Congress has a constitutional responsibility to provide oversight of the executive branch. Not everything has to be illegal to be a scandal. Most Americans, I think, would prefer leadership that behaves responsibly with our money and with the power and privilege we entrust to them. As James Madison said, ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary."" And we know angels, whether Republicans or Democrats, are not often seen in Washington. Politicians need to be watched.

Corruption,"Members of Congress and their staffs are on red alert tonight for a CBS 60 Minutes investigation by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer exposing how lawmakers convert campaign donations into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.

Sources say top CBS executives thought the report was so explosive that they made it the show’s lead story and delayed airing it for another week in order to capture tonight’s much larger NFL-viewing audience. The report features selected revelations from Schweizer’s forthcoming book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.

“I’m under a publisher embargo right now and can’t say much,” Schweizer told Breitbart News. “But suffice it to say, President Obama and some members of Washington’s Permanent Political Class are not going to like what we uncovered and the kinds of personal enrichment and self-dealing exposed in Extortion.”

To prevent early leaks of the book’s contents, publisher Houghton Mifflin made bookstore managers sign legal affidavits saying they would not shelve Extortion until the book’s official Tuesday, October 22 launch date. The book, which contains a staggering 35 pages of source materials totaling over 600 endnotes, is chock-full of revelations and never-before-released documents on top Washington figures, says Houghton Mifflin.

According to the publisher’s description, the new book “reveals vast new areas of corruption in our political system” and contains “eye-opening revelations on every page,” while opening “a whole new battlefield in the great war to fix what’s wrong with our government.”

In 2011, Kroft and Schweizer teamed up for a 60 Minutes investigation based on Schweizer’s New York Times bestseller, Throw Them All Out. The results rocked official Washington, as the exposé revealed that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was given insider access to the Visa credit card IPO, wherein she made a 50% profit on her investment in just two days. The report also alleged that Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) engaged in insider trading, prompting an ethics investigation and Bachus stepping down from his chairmanship of the Financial Services Committee. Schweizer’s book ultimately led to passage of the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act banning congressional insider trading. Throw Them All Out was “the book that started the STOCK Act stampede,” reported Slate.

Schweizer, a noted conservative and fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, has gained a national reputation for his bipartisan corruption investigations, attacking Democrats and Republicans alike. Earlier this year, progressive Comedy Central host Jon Stewart of the Daily Show featured Schweizer in a segment on the STOCK Act wherein Stewart criticized Congress for watering down the bill Schweizer’s book helped pass.

Schweizer and GAI worked with 60 Minutes for six months on tonight’s program. On Friday, CBS hosts Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell sat down with Kroft to discuss the soon-to-air report. O’Donnell called GAI’s Peter Schweizer one of “the top campaign finance watchdogs” in America.

The 60 Minutes joint investigation by Kroft and GAI President Peter Schweizer airs tonight on CBS."

Bush.

""I believe we compromised our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law,"" said Obama at National Defense University, referring to the Bush administration's national security policy.

But Donald Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary under Bush from 2001-2006, said Obama has “blamed the Bush administration for practically everything since he took office.""

Rumsfeld said that people “kind of conflated” the Defense Department with the CIA during the Bush years.

“The Department of Defense at Guantanamo water boarded no one,” he said of the detention facility in Cuba and harsh treatment of certain terror suspects.



”Three people were water-boarded by the agency with the authority of the Department of Justice and the president,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld said the United States has not engaged terrorism ideologically in the same way it took on Communism during the Cold War.

""I gave us a D-minus, and I'm an easy grader. I would give this administration an F, because they won't even use the words,"" said Rumsfeld.

""Until today, I haven't heard people use the word jihad. I haven't heard the people in the Obama administration talk about the fact that there are people that are determined to kill innocent men, women, and children that are attacking the whole concept of the nation state,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld also took issue with Obama's assertion that al Qaeda had ""been gutted.""

""That just simply isn't true. Al Qaeda is still effective. We have killed or captured any number of al Qaeda leadership, and they get replaced. Someone comes on behind them,"" said Rumsfeld, who also acknowledged that the threat is not the same today as it was in 2001 or 2002.

But he said there are still many unknowns.

""We know the number of people that have been killed or captured. We don't know the number of people that have been recruited. We don't know the number that are being trained. We don't know the amount of money that the al Qaeda and their affiliates are raising every year from supporters,"" said Rumsfeld.

Drones were not started by the Obama administration; there were drone attacks during the Bush years as well.

""We had very few when I came into office. They were increased, and this administration has the benefit of those unmanned aerial vehicles,"" said Rumsfeld.

But Rumsfeld said that it is a very tough issue, and agreed with Obama's statement that the administration would consider options for making drone strikes more transparent, like an independent oversight board, or a special court to approve the attacks.

""Going to the Congress and discussing it with them and getting them on board for some policy - that makes sense to the American people, so that he has that kind of support. He will need it,"" said Rumsfeld.

On the topic of his new book, ""Rumsfeld's Rules: Leadership Lessons in Business, Politics, War, and Life,"" the former congressman, White House chief of staff, and two-time defense chief, responded to critics who doubt his leadership.

""These are not all Rumsfeld's rules. These are rules from people that are a lot wiser than I am. And I have collected them over my lifetime,"" said Rumsfeld. ""And I guess what I would say to people like that is read the book.""

Rumsfeld said there is one particular rule he would give to Obama.

""When I was a Navy pilot, the rule if you're lost is to climb, conserve, and confess. Get some altitude. Take a deep breath, and get on the radio and say, you're lost,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld said the administration changes its tune ""week after week after week, whether it's Benghazi or whether it's the Internal Revenue Service.""

""What you need to do is get the people in the office, sit them down, and find ground truth, because the currency a leader has is credibility,"" said Rumsfeld.

""To the extent that credibility gets eroded over time, you lose your ability to lead."""

Christie's lap band surgery was for political ambition or personal health

Editor’s Note: Margaret Hoover is the author of “American Individualism: How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party.”

(CNN) —

Dean Obeidallah, John Avlon and I kick off this week’s episode of “The Big Three” podcast by tackling Congress’ Benghazi hearings from three distinct perspectives.

Ever the centrist, my beloved husband John questions whether the hearings are an earnest search for the truth or a hyperpartisan GOP political witch hunt aimed at embarrassing the Obama administration while derailing Hillary Clinton’s potential 2016 presidential bid. Dean and I duke it out from opposite perspectives, and we all agree on a surprising point at the end.

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah John Avlon, Margaret Hoover, Dean Obeidallah

Then, on to a discussion of the dramatic fractures within the GOP on immigration reform – a split between former Sen. Jim DeMint’s Heritage Foundation and his protégé Sen. Marco Rubio – which give Dean cause for celebration. But I’m not sure he will ultimately like the outcome of these GOP growing pains, which I suspect reveal a realignment of Republican reformers from old guard thinking.

Cracks in what had been GOP monolithic thinking on issues ranging from immigration to gun control to gay rights – in a week where Delaware became the 11th state to pass marriage equality with a genuine bipartisan majority – could reinvigorate the GOP brand and lead to a more competitive party nationally.

John thinks renewal and competition in any party orthodoxy is healthy for America, but Dean is clearly rooting for DeMint’s success, even if it means the end of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act. To be fair, Dean’s a comedian, so maybe his partisanship is good for laughs, but it will give way to a desire for good policy to win the day – even if the Republicans get some credit. We’ll let you decide.

Finally, was Gov. Chris Christie’s lap band surgery motivated by political ambition or personal health? One of us thinks Americans are too obsessed with weight to elect an obese president. Another worries that the act of losing weight will obscure Christie’s record in New Jersey if he decides to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016. Is it possible for aspiring elected officials to make decisions independent of their political future?

We hope you have as much fun hearing us analyze these issues as we had laughing it out over them.

Separately, Mr. Young has also been accused of taking hunting trips between 2001 and 2007, paid for by some outside party, that were not reported in financial disclosure reports that are required to be filed with Congress.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation had previously examined these allegations, concluding that any wrongdoing did not merit criminal charges. But it did refer its findings to the Ethics Committee, hinting that it believed Mr. Young may at least have broken House rules.

A spokesman for Mr. Young, who has served as Alaska’s only House member since 1973, said Tuesday that he “has cooperated with the committee and will continue to do so.” A spokesman for the Ethics Committee, which had begun its own investigation even before the F.B.I. referral, would not say if the ethics review touched on other possible improper actions by Mr. Young.

The investigation into Mr. Andrews, who has served in the House since 1990, relates to his use of campaign money to pay for personal trips to Scotland and Los Angeles in 2011, and for a party for his daughter’s graduation in June 2011, among other possible abuses, according to an initial review of the matter by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which referred its findings to the Ethics Committee last year.

Records turned up during the initial investigation show that Mr. Andrews used $16,574 from his political action committee to buy four business-class plane tickets for himself, his wife and his two daughters to attend a wedding in Scotland."

He was the president, charged with safeguarding the national economy. Republicans threatening default therefore had the leverage. They might have been prepared to split the baby. Obama was not willing to — like the true mother, he couldn’t — let that happen.

“There’s no doubt that the challenge we had here was ultimately I and [Treasury Secretary] Tim Geith­ner were responsible for averting another financial meltdown,” Obama later told Bob Woodward. “And so my interest in not playing chicken, or seeing any miscalculation here that leads to a default, was profound.”

Two long years later, the presidential calculus has been transformed. It boils down to: He has to be willing to split the baby in order to save it, or, more precisely, to prevent future baby-splitting.

In the administration’s sadder-but-wiser view, the no-negotiation-over-the-debt-ceiling line must be drawn brightly, once and for all, in order to avert a never-ending cascade of extortionist episodes. Otherwise, Obama and his successors will be subject to incessant, escalating demands for concessions. Better to edge up to, or even leap off, the cliff of default disaster now than to be saddled with it forevermore.

“The president has made clear that the era of threatening default has to be over,” White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said at a Politico Playbook Breakfast on Monday.

The White House is serious about not blinking — to a somewhat unsettling degree. It was disconcerting, during the lead-up to calamity in 2011, to hear administration officials so forthright about the ultimate weakness of their position. Now, my discomfort is reversed.

Has the administration over-learned the lessons of 2011? Is it being unhelpfully dogmatic in its refusal to negotiate? Don’t Republicans — particularly House Speaker John Boehner — need a face-saving bonbon to dangle in front of colleagues and base voters?

I put these concerns in question form for two reasons.

First, I’m not saying that the administration is mishandling this non-negotiation. Especially given Republicans’ assumption — based on past performance — that the president will ultimately blink, Obama may be right to err on the side of chest-thumping.

Second, let’s be clear: The fundamental fault is with Republicans who have been willing to push the boundaries of debt-ceiling brinkmanship to dangerous new extremes.

The need to lift the debt ceiling has regularly been an occasion to obtain budgetary concessions. But the tacit understanding has always been that the limit would be lifted in the end. The know-nothing notion that default would not be disastrous, whether on Treasury bonds or other government obligations, reflects the emergence of a new, scary faction of the Republican Party.

But the administration has a thin and wobbly tightrope to walk. The White House does not want to signal openness to negotiating on the debt ceiling. At the same time, it does not want to let Republicans successfully cast Obama and Democrats as the intransigent ones. That path becomes even more politically precarious as Republicans edge the discussion away from the unthinkable (repeal/defund/delay Obamacare) into the realm of the traditionally negotiable (discussions of spending levels, tax reform and the like).

Thus the president at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday and his news conference Tuesday repeatedly touted his willingness to negotiate — later. “I am willing to work through all those issues,” Obama told reporters. “The only thing that our democracy can’t afford is a situation where one side says, ‘Unless I get my way and only my way, unless I get concessions before we even start having a serious give-and-take, I’ll threaten to shut down the government, or I will threaten to not pay America’s bills.’ ”

The glimmerings of an eventual agreement are beginning, slowly, to emerge. Democrats want relief from the straitjacket idiocy of “sequester” cuts. Republicans want entitlement reforms, including some that the president has already ponied up.

The riddle is how to get to the point where some such deal can be struck. The administration insists on handling the issues seriatim — first fund government and raise the ceiling, then we can talk. Congressional Democrats, seeing improved electoral prospects in 2014, are similarly disinclined to budge.

The wisdom of Solomon was that he could grasp the motivation of each mother and bluff accordingly. But the fundamental difference between biblical times and now is that Solomon was dealing with rational actors. Obama’s got Ted Cruz. Babies beware.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-and-bush-poll-numbers-nearly-identical-five-years-into-presidency-214919924.html,,[],"Five years in, Obama and Bush poll numbers nearly identical","When President Obama first ran for the White House in 2008, it was with the promise to turn the page on the presidency of George W. Bush. But for all their political differences, it turns out the American public pretty much view the two men in the same light, according to new polling data.



In the first week of November in the fifth year of their presidencies, Obama and Bush have nearly identical approval numbers, according to the latest Gallup polling.

In fact, Bush comes out one point ahead, 40 percent to 39 percent, respectively.

The Gallup daily tracking poll for November 5th 2013 puts Obama’s approval at 39 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance.

By comparison, polling for the first week of November in 2005 had Bush’s approval at 40 percent, with 55 percent disapproving of his job performance.

And the negative comparison to Bush’s numbers is potentially worse for Obama than just a tough headline.

As former Bush adviser Matthew Dowd said on ABC’s “This Week,” the real damage lies in the fact that historically low approval numbers often constrain a president’s ability to rebound with the public.

“I think what you have right now is you talked about the floor of the president's approval numbers, which are almost exactly where President Bush's were. Every time you establish a new floor, you establish a new ceiling,” Dowd said.

Noting that Bush’s approval free fall “wasn’t all about Katrina,” Dowd said Obama faces a similar assault from multiple fronts.

""The president's problems have been brewing for a while,” Dowd said. “What the Republican circus did was cover up a lot of the president's problems. That circus that went on with the Republicans for a while. And then once that was over, it revealed a deeper problem with the presidency.""

Of course, the most recent numbers don't guarantee that Obama's second term will end up mirroring Bush's, whose approval continued to fall to a low of 25 percent on three separate occasions before he left office. Still, they do place Obama in an interesting historical context when compared to how some other presidents have fared in the fifth year of their presidencies.

Story continues

Pulling back the curtain further to look at Obama’s approval rating during the 19th quarter of his presidency, Obama places 5th out of the last 8 presidents who served for the same length of time.



His quarterly Gallup approval rating of 44.5 percent places him ahead of Bush (43.9), Lyndon Johnson (41.8%) and Richard Nixon (31.8%). But Obama falls behind Bill Clinton (58.8%), Ronald Reagan (61.3%) Dwight Eisenhower (59.5%) and even Harry Truman (45%).

What might be most striking to Obama supporters is to compare the various challenges faced by Bush and Obama at this point in their respective presidencies. In the fall of 2005, Bush was reeling from fallout of Hurricane Katrina and arguably the low-point of the Iraq War. And while he had successfully won re-election against John Kerry, his approval rating had dropped 13 points from 53 percent since the November 2004 election.

In contrast, Obama has dealt with the continuing drag of a sluggish economy, partisan divisions, which led to a government shutdown, criticism over National Security Administration spying accusations and the recent fallout over problems associated with the launch of the Affordable Care Act.

And as a result of those challenges, Obama has experienced a nearly identical polling drop as Bush, falling a statistically identical 13 points from his approval ratings of 52 percent on election day in November, 2012 .

Of course, nothing is set in stone. Unforeseen events could restore Obama’s approval ratings: The economy could improve, the 2014 midterm elections could boost Obama’s standing and early setbacks of the Affordable Care Act could recede.

But if recent history is any indicator, Obama is likely to find himself in some unexpected and unwanted company – that of an unpopular president he was elected to replace."

He's the President, not the Asshole Whisperer","A nihilistic post-policy GOP that defines themselves by opposing whatever Obama wants on any given day, even if Obama supports GOP ideas, simply can not be reasoned with. Period. They define who they are by how much that hate Obama. Good luck working with that.

Saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" is like saying he should be more pro-active and think outside the box, its' meaningless bullshit designed to shift the blame from the hardline psychosis of the GOP onto the President, who somehow has the power to make Republicans stop acting insane but just won't use it. And I will remind you that nearly every hack journalist that is saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" are the same people who praised Bush's leadership while he was creating the problems that Congressional Republicans refuse to allow Obama to address in any way at all.

This diary started as a tweet and deserved more, but the title explains itself. Barack Obama is the President of the United States, he is not the Asshole Whisperer. He can not force Republicans to abandon a set of policies that has destroyed their own brand, nor can he force them to abandon a set of policies that even the Pope is against at this point. Obama can not force the GOP to grow up and moderate from the platform Romney/Ryan lost so badly on, but maybe, just maybe, if those journalists calling on Obama to ""show leadership"" would explain to their audiences how and why the GOP are filibustering everything they can just to defeat Obama despite the pain it causes average Americans, maybe that would help. But who the hell am I kidding, that would require lazy journalists to place blame on Congressional Republicans, and that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So we have a broken Government that can do nothing because that is how Mitch McConnell and John Boehner like it. Blaming Obama on Republicans being Republicans is just stupid. Maybe instead of holding Obama accountable for Congressional Republicans bad behavior we could try doing what Ceaser Milan does, and by that I mean that every time Congressional Republicans shit the floor journalists should rub John Boehner's nose in it instead of looking at Obama like it is his fault that Republican Cujo predictably mauled the economy again.

Um ... oops?

Let's all just savor this, shall we? The House Republicans release a scathing report blaming Hillary Clinton for something-something-Benghazi, because something-something-Benghazi is the newest Fox News conspiracy theory and there's really just nothing, and I mean nothing, that the Congress of the United States of America needs to spend their time on more than Fox News conspiracy theories. That's a given. Darrell Issa exists to investibate those theories. The entire House Oversight Committee has been turned into an episode of Scooby Doo where Obama or Hillary Clinton are behind literally every bad thing that happens in America, from solar companies going bust to children getting cavities.

The smoking gun in the new Republican report? That Hillary Clinton ""signed"" memos rejecting stepped-up security at the compound, thus proving that everything was all her fault, period, exclamation point, Ronald Reagan smiley face. There's only one little problem with that: Clinton did not ""sign"" the letter. Darrell Issa and the rest of the Crack House Investigative Team of Superheroes got confused on a basic fact of how the State Department works, and not one of them bothered to actually freaking check, just once, with the State Department as to their top-notch theory of things:



[By tradition], every cable from an embassy bears the “signature” of the ambassador — and every cable from Washington bears the “signature” of the secretary of state. The protocol is explained in the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual: […] Because of this protocol, “Secretary Clinton ‘signed’ hundreds of thousands of cables during her tenure as secretary,” said State Department spokesman Patrick H. Ventrell. “As then-Secretary Clinton testified, the security cables related to Benghazi did not come to her attention. These cables were reviewed at the assistant secretary level.”

“The allegations in your staff report are false, extremely irresponsible, and lack even a rudimentary understanding of how State Department cables are processed,” Cummings wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). […] “Although a telephone call could have clarified this issue in a matter of moments, you chose not to check with the Department before making these highly inflammatory and erroneous accusations in a public forum.”

Yep. The entire House Republican ""investigative"" team didn't know that, and they didn't check, and/or they didn't listen to Every Damn State Department Employee Who Could Tell Them That. Or, as Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings puts it Has there ever been a Congress more incompetent than this one? I don't mean partisan, or mean, or ineffective—I mean stone-cold incompetent. This is the sort of thing that really should require a public pie in the face for all involved, and the House Republican caucus is just goddamn stupid enough that we could probably get that required public pie-ing passed as actual bill, providing we bury it in some language about continued oil subsidies or free guns to American toddlers."

He Left In']",Attorney general orders criminal review of IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department began a criminal investigation Tuesday into overzealous scrutiny by the IRS of applications for tax exemptions by conservative groups, an improper targeting that an inspector general’s report blamed on a confused staff and lax oversight.

The improper activities “were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS,” the auditors said they were told by Internal Revenue Service officials.

Instead, the report painted a picture of an IRS unit based in Cincinnati that used “inappropriate criteria” for deciding which applications to examine, without any review by senior managers. The targeting, including that of groups that used “tea party” in their names, continued for more than 18 months, while some applications for nonprofit status languished for more than three years, the report found.

The statement that no one outside the IRS was involved, if it holds up, would counter efforts by Republican leaders to depict the IRS actions as a politically motivated scandal linked to President Obama. Faced with a barrage of questions on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that no one there had known of the matter until April, when the White House counsel’s office was briefed about the report.

But the controversy showed no signs of abating, as both the House and Senate prepared to hold hearings. At the top of the agenda will be questions about why IRS officials who were aware of the problems continued to assure Congress that no improper targeting had occurred.

“Unfortunately, the report raises more questions than it answers,” said House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista), whose committee was among those requesting the report. “What we do know for sure is that the IRS personnel responsible for granting tax exemptions systematically targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny, and that officials in Washington, D.C., were aware of this practice, even while publicly claiming that it never happened.”

The pace of investigations picked up as Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said that he had ordered an investigation into whether anyone at the IRS broke laws.

The IRS actions were “certainly outrageous and unacceptable,” Holder said at a news conference. “But we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations,” he added.

The president, in a statement released late Tuesday, said the activities described in the report from the Treasury inspector general for tax administration were “intolerable and inexcusable.”

“The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity,” Obama said. “This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.”

Advertisement

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, whose agency includes the IRS, said inspector general recommendations for better training for IRS personnel and clearer guidelines would be implemented “without delay.”

In its own statement, the IRS agreed that the reviews had been “inappropriate,” but said all the organizations that were singled out for extra review ultimately received similar treatment, regardless of ideology.

“It is also important to understand that the group of centralized cases included organizations of all political views,” the statement said, referring to cases that received heightened scrutiny.

The report looked at records for 298 organizations that IRS specialists scrutinized for their level of political activity. Of those, 96 applications were pulled out because they mentioned “tea party,” “patriots” or “9/12""; the remaining 202 applications did not have such phrases.

According to one IRS official cited in the report, the fact that two-thirds of the targeted groups were not flagged because of conservative-sounding words proved that the agency was “not politically biased in its identification of applications.” The other groups selected are not identified, however, so their political views, if any, remain unknown.

The agency also said that “there was no intent to hide” what was going on. Top career officials sent letters to members of Congress in 2012 that reassured them the IRS was not targeting any groups.

The inspector general’s office began its inquiry after receiving complaints from Congress that conservative groups were being harassed by the IRS. J. Russell George, inspector general for tax administration, was appointed to that position by Republican President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 2004. He’s a former Republican Capitol Hill staff member.

The problems at the IRS started in March 2010, as staff in a Cincinnati field office — the main office handling tax-exempt organizations — struggled to cope with a flood of applications for “social welfare” exemptions. Many came from politically oriented organizations that sprang up after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision loosening the rules for political donations. Between 2010 and 2012, the number of applications for tax exemption as social welfare groups almost doubled.

Unlike charities, social welfare groups, governed by Section 501(c)4 of the tax code, are allowed to participate in politics so long as that is not their primary purpose. But the IRS has never clearly defined the limits. The groups also can keep their donors’ names secret.

With many groups spending millions of dollars on elections, campaign reform advocates were pressuring the IRS to tighten enforcement of limits on politically active tax-exempt groups. Workers at the exempt organizations division, assigned the task of screening the applications, selected organizations for additional review whose paperwork included references to the “tea party” or similar words — a decision that wasn’t reviewed by top officials at the agency until more than a year after the screenings began, according to the report.

In June 2011, Lois Lerner, the IRS official in Washington who supervises the agency’s tax-exempt division, ordered the staff to change its approach. After a period of time using new, more appropriate, rules, however, the Cincinnati staff in January 2012 once again changed the criteria. This time they began screening for groups that were focused on the Constitution or on limiting or expanding government, according to the report. Officials in Washington did not intervene to fix that until May 2012.

Not only was the method misguided, the report said, it also didn’t work very well. The audit found that 14 groups weren’t flagged for extra scrutiny even though their files contained evidence of significant involvement in political campaigns.

Advertisement

The report concludes that the IRS workers had not considered the “public perception” of using politically oriented criteria in evaluating cases. Another problem: The staff doing the reviews had a “lack of knowledge” about what activities tax-exempt groups may legally engage in.

Many of the organizations received a long, detailed list of questions for further information, including requests for the names of all donors. The IRS asked whether the officers or directors intended to run for public office, where they worked and what conversations they had with people at their functions.

Advertisement

Nikole Flax, chief of staff for the office of IRS commissioner, told Issa’s committee staff that the request for donors’ names was unprecedented in IRS history, Issa said in a letter to Lerner.

The letter accused Lerner of lying or hiding information from Congress on four separate occasions, saying that she had failed to inform the committee of the screening or of the internal concerns, even after repeated questioning.

“Providing false or misleading information to Congress is a serious matter, with potential criminal liability,” the letter said.

Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy.

Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny.

Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny. It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice.

""They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,"" she admitted.

She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked. But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.

Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could ""comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits.""

She said: ""Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations.""

Crowley later called her answer evasive.

""The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress,"" he said.

In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.

Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws. The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.

James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by that.

""Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,"" he said.

When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned.

""She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,"" he said.

Lerner is represented by lawyer William W. Taylor, who is noted for winning a dismissal of all charges against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a high-profile sexual assault case.

Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said. ""I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee."""

Boehner said Tuesday it was about time the Senate “gets off their ass” and develop a way around the enormous automatic reductions.

The Ohio Republican reiterated Tuesday that he has no intention of putting forward his own alternative, arguing that the House twice passed proposals last year that would shift the burden of cuts away from Pentagon programs and onto other domestic accounts – including school lunches, food stamps and others.

“We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,” Boehner said. “The American people know if the president gets more money they’re just going to spend it. The fact is, is that he’s gotten his tax hikes. It’s time to focus on the real problem here in Washington and that is spending.”

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

It is unclear if Boehner could rally the votes in his chamber to pass an alternative, as the earlier proposals were approved last year with the slimmest margins. Those bills are no longer available as they expired when the new Congress began in January.

Polls show Americans will largely blame Republicans for the cuts coming Friday that may cause disruptions in federal services, but Republicans say the White House is hyping the magnitude of the cuts in a campaign to bend public opinion to its side.

Advertisement

To counter the White House bully pulpit, Republicans are considering offering legislation that would provide the administration even more authority over determining which federal programs get cut – allowing the president to tailor the reductions rather than slashing indiscriminately across the board as required under the law.

The Senate may consider that option this week, and the House could take up the issue as part of another budget bill next week.

Advertisement

But the idea of shifting even more responsibility to the White House is dividing Republicans in Congress, who have been unable to agree on a consistent strategy to fight the cuts because many conservative lawmakers would simply prefer to allow the reductions to happen as a way to stem the flow of red ink.

Some Republicans would like to protect defense and other programs they favor from cuts; others, including more veteran members of the House and Senate, are loathe to cede their constitutionally vested budget powers to the administration.

Advertisement

Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) compared the flexibility proposals to “rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,” saying last week: “They’re still dealing a body blow to the economy.”

The $85 billion in cuts were designed as a last-ditch strategy to bring both sides to the negotiating table on a broad deficit-reduction plan. But without an agreement, the cuts, also known as the sequester, are poised to take effect. Up to 13% from defense and 9% from other domestic accounts will be cut in the remaining seven months of the fiscal year, vacuuming about 750,000 jobs from the economy. Social Security and the Medicaid health program for poor and elderly Americans are spared, and cuts to Medicare are capped.

Obama traveled to Newport News, Va., on Tuesday to shift attention to the ordinary Americans in that military-heavy enclave who would be hit as the federal government withdraws funds from the economy. Most Americans say in polls they prefer the president’s approach of combining spending cuts with new tax revenue from wealthier Americans and corporations to stem deficits.

Democrats, to be sure, have their own divisions over Obama’s tax hike proposals. Oil state senators, for example, successfully blocked their party from proposing legislation to do away with tax deductions used by the oil and gas industries – long a target of the president.

The Senate is expected to propose Democratic and Republican alternatives this week, but neither are expected to overcome the 60-vote threshold to pass.

One point that both parties largely agree on is that the idea for the sequester originated in the administration, before Congress overwhelmingly approved it in 2011 as part of an earlier budget deal.

Pollak'],"NPR: Liberal Groups Now Say They Were 'Targeted' by IRS, Too","Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they, too, were “targeted” by the IRS, just as conservative groups were. None of them, however, can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.

Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status, including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.

But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured, such as questions about the content of their prayers, or leaks of donor lists.

Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other, somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.

The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS, as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.

Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted, Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.

Obama faced questions about e-mails related to Benghazi talking points

WASHINGTON -- Facing a wall of outrage from GOP lawmakers over revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted ""tea party"" groups and non-profit organizations that criticized the government, President Obama on Monday called the actions by agency personnel ""outrageous"" and said ""there is no place for it.""

The president, who appeared alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron at the White House, weighed in on the IRS controversy for the first time and attempted to head off snowballing criticism from Republican lawmakers that he hadn't personally condemned the agency's targeting of conservative political groups for extra scrutiny.

Obama said he first learned about the IRS actions from news reports Friday. He said those responsible for the practice should be held ""fully accountable."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said later on Monday that White House Counsel's Office was alerted during the week of April 22nd that the agency's inspector general was completing a review about matters involving the office in Cincinnati.

Lois Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organizations, on Friday admitted the agency made ""mistakes"" in the last few years and that employees in the agency's Cincinnati office routinely required conservative organizations seeking non-profit status to undergo more scrutiny.

Multiple conservative groups have said their applications were delayed and returned with lengthy requests for supporting materials, sometimes including website printouts and lists of guest speakers.

""You don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased,"" Obama said.

Even as Obama attempted to make clear his unhappiness with the IRS, Republicans continued to level their criticism against the agency and the administration.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Monday called for Obama to fire acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller.

""It is clear the IRS cannot operate with even a shred of the American people's confidence under the current leadership,"" Rubio wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. ""Therefore, I strongly urge that you and President Obama demand the IRS commissioner's resignation, effectively immediately. No government agency that has behaved in such a manner can possibly instill any faith and respect from the American public.""

Some Democrats, including Sen. Max Baucus, on Monday joined Republican calls for a Congressional investigation of the IRS.

""I want to review the inspector general's report first, but the IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee,"" said Baucus, of Montana, who is chairman of the committee. ""The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.""

Obama added that neither party wants the IRS to be perceived as ""anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate."" He added: ""This is something that I think people are properly concerned about.""

Still, the president pointed to the inspector general's ongoing investigation, saying he would not comment prematurely on specific findings.

The president added that his administration will get to the bottom of what happened at the IRS. ""I have no patience for it. I will not tolerate it. ""

Obama also faced a difficult question about the administration's response to last year's terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

E-mails unveiled last week show the State Department and other senior administration officials asking that references to terror groups and prior warnings be deleted from a unclassified memo on talking points about the incident shortly after the Sept. 11 attack.

GOP lawmakers have also criticized the State Department board that reviewed the incident for not interviewing then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

As the president held his press conference, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he had sent letters to Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB) co-chairs, former ambassador Thomas Pickering and former admiral Mike Mullen, requesting that they submit to transcribed interviews in anticipation of a public hearing on the board's investigation.

""Three senior State Department officials who testified at the hearing criticized the ARB's work as 'incomplete' and flawed because the ARB did not interview key witnesses and failed to hold senior officials accountable,"" wrote Issa in the letter to Pickering. ""On May 12, 2013, you defended the ARB's work on Face the Nation. You stated that those criticisms are 'unfair.' … The White House and the State Department have touted the ARB's report as the definitive account of how and why the Benghazi attacks occurred. It is necessary for the committee to understand whether the criticisms of the ARB's work that we heard from witnesses on May 8, 2013, are valid.""

But the president pushed back, saying his administration officials have been forthcoming about Benghazi and suggesting that Republicans are more interested in scoring political points than figuring out how to prevent such incidents from happening again in hot spots where U.S. diplomats and other personnel are deployed.



""There is no there, there,"" Obama said.

Obama and Cameron met for about hour at the White House before the news conference. Cameron said their talks centered on the economy, the ongoing civil war in Syria and next month's Group of Eight summit that Cameron will host in Northern Ireland.

Both Cameron and Obama acknowledged they have a difficult task in persuading Russia to abandon Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.

Obama noted that there are long-term ""suspicions"" by Russia toward the G-8 alliance — which includes the USA, Britain and Russia -- but both he and Cameron were trying to ""break down"" some of those suspicions.

""As a leader on the world stage, Russia has an interest and obligation to resolve this issue that can lead to an outcome we all want to see in the long-term,"" Obama said.

""Syria's history is being written in the blood of her people,"" Cameron said. He added, ""and it is happening under our watch."""

Washington (CNN) - Most Americans say the government shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems for the country, according to a new national poll.

And while a CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that slightly more people are angry at Republicans than Democrats or President Barack Obama for the shutdown, it is clear that both sides are taking a hit.



The poll, conducted over the weekend, was released on Monday, nearly one week into the partial shutdown over a push by tea party backed GOP lawmakers trying to dismantle or defund Obama's signature health care reform law.

According to the poll, 63% of those questioned say they are angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown.

""But the Democrats are not getting off scot-free. Fifty-seven percent of Americans are also angry at the way the Democrats are dealing with the shutdown. And a 53% majority say they are also angry at President Obama,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown.""

The CNN poll results are similar to those from a new Pew Research Center poll also released Monday and surveys from Gallup and CBS News/New York Times surveys conducted last week, which indicate slightly more people blaming - or angry at - Republicans than Democrats or the president for the shutdown.

Not surprisingly, huge majorities of Democrats are angry at the Republicans, and huge majorities of Republicans are angry at Obama and Democrats. Independents are equally angry at all sides, with 59% of Independents very or somewhat angry at the Democrats, six in 10 angry at the GOP, and 58% angry at Obama.

The poll indicates that 18% of the public says the shutdown is a crisis and an additional 49% say the shutdown has caused major problems.

""That's a higher level of worry than in November 1995, when the government shut down because the Democrats, led by President Bill Clinton, and the Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, could not agree on funding. In 1995, 12% felt the shutdown at that time was causing a crisis and 44% thought it was a major problem,"" adds Holland.

The two-thirds who say the shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems is similar to the seven in 10 who said the same thing in the Gallup poll.

According to the CNN survey, Democrats are most concerned about the shutdown, although a majority of Independents and Republicans also say the shutdown is causing a crisis or a major problem.

There's also a gender gap, with three-quarters of women but only 57% of men saying the shutdown has caused a crisis or major problems.

Some 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed due to the shutdown, with many government services and agencies are closed, suspended.

The CNN poll was conducted October 3-6 by ORC International, with 1,009 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."
http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-insists-obama-not-involved-irs-141138176.html,,[],White House insists Obama was not involved in IRS,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A top White House adviser insisted Sunday that President Barack Obama learned the Internal Revenue Service had targeted tea party groups only ""when it came out in the news"" while Republicans continued to press the administration for more answers.

Trying to move past a challenging week that put the White House on the defensive, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer was scheduled to appear on five Sunday news shows to repeat the administration's position that no senior officials were involved in the decision to give tea party groups extra scrutiny. Pfeiffer's appearances were unlike to quiet GOP critics, who have seized on the revelations as proof that Obama used the IRS to go after his political enemies.

""The deputy secretary of the treasury was made aware of just the fact that the investigation was beginning last year,"" Pfeiffer said. ""But no one in the White House was aware.""

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggested there was a written policy to target conservative groups opposing the president, but when pressed could not provide details.

""I haven't seen a policy statement, but I think we need to see that,"" Paul said. ""And when that comes forward, we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy.""

Regardless of when the president first learned of the investigations, Pfeiffer said the president wanted to ensure such activities were not repeated.

""The activity was outrageous and inexcusable, and it was stopped and it needs to be fixed to ensure it never happens again,"" Pfeiffer said.

A Treasury Department inspector's report said this week that conservative and small-government tea party groups that were critical of Obama received extra scrutiny. IRS agents did not flag similar progressive or liberal groups, according to the watchdog.

The report concluded that a regional IRS office in Ohio improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for more than 18 months and took no action on many of their applications for tax-exempt status for long periods of time — hindering their fundraising for the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Story continues

The new acting IRS commissioner is in the midst of a 30-day top-to-bottom review while Republicans continue to demand answers of Obama and his allies in government.

That's not sufficient, said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.

""I think a special counsel is going to wind up being necessary,"" he added said.

That move is not needed, said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

""I don't see the point,"" he said of a special counsel to investigate the scandal.

Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., said the IRS had stepped so far over its mandate that it asked book groups for reading lists and church groups about their prayers before granting them tax-exempt standing. It's government over-reach, he said, and a reason why Republicans need to have their own investigation into the agency.

""This is about trust,"" Price said.

But he stopped short of calling for a special counsel.

Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., said Republicans were using the incidents to embarrass the president.

""There is no Republican agenda other than to stop the president of the United States,"" he said.

Pfeiffer was appearing Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" CNN's ""State of the Union"" and ""Fox News Sunday."" Portman, Menendez, Price and Rangel were on ABC. Paul was on CNN."

Washington (CNN) - The rude comment that might or might not have happened just isn’t going away, with sources telling CNN that word of the remarks came from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors.

Allegations of the remark, which supposedly happened during an October 10 government shutdown meeting with House Republicans, first surfaced when Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, posted on his Facebook page that an unnamed senior House Republican told President Barack Obama that “I cannot even stand to look at you.”



White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied on Wednesday that the remark was ever made. Durbin has stuck to his story, though he refuses to say who made the alleged comment or how he learned of it.

Sources, however, tell CNN that Durbin learned of the alleged comment from Nabors, a longtime Hill insider.

According to the sources, Nabors told the story to four Senate Democrats – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, New York’s Chuck Schumer, Washington’s Patty Murray, and Durbin – on October 15, near the end of the shutdown.

Reid then told the story to the entire Senate Democratic caucus, identifying the Republican in question as Texas Rep. Pete Sessions.

Sessions denies the story. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner has demanded Durbin retract his allegation and apologize.

“Senator Durbin’s accusation is a serious one, and it appears to have been invented out of thin air,” spokesman Brendan Buck said. “The Senator should disclose who told him this account of events, retract his reckless allegations immediately, and apologize.”

Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who attended the White House meeting, told CNN that Durbin's account ""never happened.""

""It's irresponsible and divisive of him because it never happened and he ought to apologize for saying it. He ought to just man up and say 'You know what, I said something foolish I shouldn’t have said, it didn’t happen’ and apologize.""

The White House’s denial has upset Senate Democrats, since they had heard the story from the Nabors. The White House is now accusing Durbin of sharing an untruthful story.

But on Thursday a White House official accepted some blame for the story.

“While the quote attributed to a Republican lawmaker in the House GOP meeting with the President is not accurate, there was a miscommunication when the White House read out that meeting to Senate Democrats,” the official said. “We regret the misunderstanding.”

Senior administration officials tell CNN that, according to those White House officials who were in the room, Sessions’ comments at the October 10 meeting were expressing frustration with the shutdown standoff, not with President Obama.

White House officials would not comment on whether Nabors misunderstood what Sessions said, or whether he just miscommunicated the story to Senate Democrats.

Nabors could not be reached for comment.

There are consequences%2C but not for them.

People who are to blame lose their jobs. People who are %22responsible%2C%22 do not.

I%27d favor some changes that put accountability back in.

As scandals explode across Washington -- from the IRS scandals, to the Benghazi scandal, to the HHS donations scandal, to Pigford and more -- one thing that I've noticed is that the people involved don't seem to suffer much. There are consequences, but not for them. Likewise, Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., left office in disgrace, but wound up with surprisingly lucrative consulting gigs.

This reminds me of something writer Robert Heinlein once said: ""Any government will work if authority and responsibility are equal and coordinate. This does not ensure 'good' government, it simply ensures that it will work. But such governments are rare — most people want to run things, but want no part of the blame. This used to be called the 'backseat driver' syndrome.""

Government officials are happy making and executing plans that affect the lives of millions, but when things go wrong, well ... they're willing to accept the responsibility, but they're not willing to take the blame. What's the difference? People who are to blame lose their jobs. People who are ""responsible,"" do not. The blame, such as it is, winds up deflected on to The System, or something else suitably abstract.

But when you cut the linkage between outcomes and experience, you make learning much more difficult. When you were a toddler learning to walk, you fell down a lot. This was unpleasant: shocking, at least, and often painful. Thus, you learned to fall down a lot less often.

But imagine if falling down didn't hurt. You wouldn't have learned not to fall, or at least, you would have accumulated a lot more bruises along the way.

Given the low penalties for failure it faces, our political class is one for whom falling down is usually painless and even -- given the surprisingly common tendency of people who have presided over debacles to be given promotions rather than the boot -- actually pleasurable. The leaders move society's arms and legs, but we're the ones who collect the bruises.

The problem is that they don't have, in President Obama's words, ""skin in the game."" When it comes to actual wrongdoing, they're shielded by doctrines of ""absolute immunity"" (for the president) and ""qualified immunity"" (for lesser officials). This means that the president can't be sued for anything he does as president, while lower-ranking officials can't be sued so long as they can show that they were acting in a ""good faith"" belief that they were following the law.

Such defenses aren't available to the rest of us. And they're not even the product of legislation passed by Congress after considered judgment -- they're judicially created. (Judges gave themselves absolute immunity, too, for good measure.)

Then, of course, there's the unfortunate fact that the worse the economy does, the more important the government becomes. As Tim Noah pointed out back when the financial crisis was new, ""On Wall Street, financial crisis destroys jobs. Here in Washington, it creates them. The rest is just details.""

Some incentive system. And yet they want us to trust them to ""fix the economy."" My worry is that their idea of ""fixed"" may not be the same as mine.

I'd favor some changes that put accountability back in. First, I'd get rid of judicially created immunities. The Constitution itself creates only one kind of immunity, for members of Congress in speech and debate. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, courts have interpreted this grant of immunity, explicitly in the Constitution, more narrowly than the judicially created ones).

I'd also cut all payments to members of Congress whenever they haven't passed a budget. If they can't take care of that basic responsibility, why should they get paid? Likewise, I'd ban presidential travel when there's not a budget. He can do his job from the White House.

I'm willing to consider other changes: Term limits that kick in whenever there's a deficit for more than two years in a row. Limitations on civil-service protections to allow wronged citizens to get offending bureaucrats fired. Pay cuts for elected officials whenever inflation or unemployment are above a threshold.

But the real lesson is this: We entrust an inordinate amount of power to people who don't feel any pain when we fall down. The best solution of all is to take a lot of that power back. When the power is in your hands, it's in the hands of someone who feels it when you fall down. When it's in their hands, it's your pain, their gain. That's no way to run a country.

Corruption,"Members of Congress and their staffs are on red alert tonight for a CBS 60 Minutes investigation by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer exposing how lawmakers convert campaign donations into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.

Sources say top CBS executives thought the report was so explosive that they made it the show’s lead story and delayed airing it for another week in order to capture tonight’s much larger NFL-viewing audience. The report features selected revelations from Schweizer’s forthcoming book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.

“I’m under a publisher embargo right now and can’t say much,” Schweizer told Breitbart News. “But suffice it to say, President Obama and some members of Washington’s Permanent Political Class are not going to like what we uncovered and the kinds of personal enrichment and self-dealing exposed in Extortion.”

To prevent early leaks of the book’s contents, publisher Houghton Mifflin made bookstore managers sign legal affidavits saying they would not shelve Extortion until the book’s official Tuesday, October 22 launch date. The book, which contains a staggering 35 pages of source materials totaling over 600 endnotes, is chock-full of revelations and never-before-released documents on top Washington figures, says Houghton Mifflin.

According to the publisher’s description, the new book “reveals vast new areas of corruption in our political system” and contains “eye-opening revelations on every page,” while opening “a whole new battlefield in the great war to fix what’s wrong with our government.”

In 2011, Kroft and Schweizer teamed up for a 60 Minutes investigation based on Schweizer’s New York Times bestseller, Throw Them All Out. The results rocked official Washington, as the exposé revealed that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was given insider access to the Visa credit card IPO, wherein she made a 50% profit on her investment in just two days. The report also alleged that Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) engaged in insider trading, prompting an ethics investigation and Bachus stepping down from his chairmanship of the Financial Services Committee. Schweizer’s book ultimately led to passage of the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act banning congressional insider trading. Throw Them All Out was “the book that started the STOCK Act stampede,” reported Slate.

Schweizer, a noted conservative and fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, has gained a national reputation for his bipartisan corruption investigations, attacking Democrats and Republicans alike. Earlier this year, progressive Comedy Central host Jon Stewart of the Daily Show featured Schweizer in a segment on the STOCK Act wherein Stewart criticized Congress for watering down the bill Schweizer’s book helped pass.

Schweizer and GAI worked with 60 Minutes for six months on tonight’s program. On Friday, CBS hosts Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell sat down with Kroft to discuss the soon-to-air report. O’Donnell called GAI’s Peter Schweizer one of “the top campaign finance watchdogs” in America.

Mark Sanford won a runoff for U.S. House seat in South Carolina He'll now face Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of ""The Colbert Report"" star National Democrats started attacks against Sanford shortly after Tuesday's win While GOP acknowledges Sanford's liabilities, his district might be more forgiving than others

Watch the Jake Tapper interview with Mark Sanford on “The Lead,” Wednesday at 4 p.m. Eastern on CNN.

(CNN) —

Mark Sanford is another step closer to political redemption, but the real headline out of his Tuesday victory in a Republican primary runoff for his old congressional seat was a rare public appearance by his former mistress – who’s now his fiancée.

And while the former South Carolina governor is considered the favorite in next month’s general election showdown with Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, his past infidelity remains front and center in the race and could continue to hurt him with crucial female voters.

Democrats wasted no time in attacking Sanford over the affair.

“This is the same Mark Sanford who, as governor, disappeared from office and used taxpayer money to visit his mistress. With all the issues we are working on, we do not need him in Congress,” wrote Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in a fundraising e-mail for Colbert Busch sent in the hours after Sanford’s victory. “Fortunately, there is a strong independent woman running to give us a better alternative named Elizabeth Colbert Busch.”

Sanford addressed his “incredibly long journey” at his victory celebration over former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic. “In that journey, I am humbled.” He added that while God forgives, “sometimes the voters aren’t so forgiving.”

Sanford thanked supporters, family, and his fiancée, Maria Belen Chapur of Argentina. The former governor said Wednesday on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that he was surprised by her appearance at the victory celebration.

“She completely surprised me,” Sanford told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. “It was an awfully, awfully nice surprise.”

Sanford wins GOP nomination for House seat

“I didn’t know she was coming, but I’m excited to see her,” he said.

The affair came to light in 2009, after Sanford disappeared from public view for several days and re-emerged, claiming he’d been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing his lover. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and then-wife Jenny were divorced in 2010 and he finished his second term as governor in January 2011, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.

Sanford is touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for Congress, but he’s also asking the public for a second chance, telling CNN that he was seeking “redemption” by running for office again.

He came in first in a 16-candidate primary two weeks ago, but only with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. He topped Bostic in Tuesday’s runoff by a 57%-43% margin.

Bostic appeared to try to make infidelity a key issue in the runoff campaign. “Trust is a crucial issue. In fact, it has become a crucial issue in this race,” the candidate said at a debate with Sanford last week. Bostic added that the former governor was a “compromised candidate” because of the affair.

Now Sanford faces off May 7 with Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University’s wind turbine drive testing facility. She is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily Republican. The 1st District has been in GOP hands for more than three decades.

Rep. Tim Scott won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last November’s election. But when Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation, GOP Gov. Nikki Haley named Scott to fill the seat, triggering the special election to fill the seat that Sanford held for three terms before becoming governor.

Mark Sanford: Shamed politician fights for comeback

Colbert Busch’s famous brother has campaigned on his sister’s behalf.

“She’s my sister, and I’m willing to, you know, break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her,” Colbert told Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN’s “The Lead.”

Colbert will team up again with his sister for fundraisers later this month in the nation’s capital and in New York.

But Democrats are focusing on Sanford’s affair.

“The families of this district need a representative who they can trust,” Colbert Busch campaign spokesman James Smith said Tuesday night. “Mark Sanford simply has the wrong values for our community.

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee press secretary Emily Bittner tried to put Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a senior House Republican, on the spot.

“Even Republicans acknowledge that Congressman Sanford’s behavior was a disgrace and that he betrayed the public trust, so will Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers support Mark Sanford in his quest to return to Washington?”

Sanford disagrees, saying his runoff victory shows he doesn’t have a problem with female voters, at least those in his party.

There were a lot of Republican conservative women that voted last night. And what they did was decided to send me in as the Republican standard-bearer in this congressional seat,” Sanford told Tapper.

But some South Carolina Republicans disagree, saying that the female vote could be an issue for Sanford.

“Surveys show Sanford has a problem with women, and some may never forgive him,” said Republican strategist Bruce Haynes, a partner in the consulting firm Purple Strategies. “Acknowledgment of perceptions is the first step in rebuilding any reputation, and his choice to bring his fianceé forward is smart.”

“His past and his present relationship with her is an unavoidable issue in this race. It’s best that he acknowledge it, deal with it on his terms rather than let others define it for him. Otherwise, silence is hiding, and hiding is guilt, and guilt is losing,” added Haynes, who served as chief of staff for former Republican Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina, and as a staff member for former GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.

Haynes thinks Sanford can win a race that focuses on policy, but says a race on personality will be much harder to win.

Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, who served as executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, agreed.

“It’s going to be virtually impossible for Mark Sanford to attack Colbert Busch,” said Gidley, who worked for Sanford rival state Sen. Larry Grooms in the primary. “It’s extremely tricky political territory for several reasons: One, Sanford can’t effectively execute an apology tour and consistently be on the attack; two, any political attack on Colbert Busch would be used against Sanford and the party as proof of a perceived ‘war on women;’ three, we have a huge problem right now with the women vote – so any candidate perceived to be one who disregards women – is going to face issues getting votes.”

But the geography of the district may be in Sanford’s favor.

“The new 1st District is a coastal area, so it’s generally the most socially liberal of South Carolina’s GOP-held districts,” Haynes said. “This is because coastal communities are historically more diverse and concerned about issues like the environment that carry less importance inland.”"

Spiro T. Agnew, who served as vice president under President Richard Nixon, resigned his position after being indicted for bribery charges, becoming the first U.S. vice president in history to resign under criminal charges.

President Richard Nixon resigned his office after being implicated in a cover-up following a burglary at political offices in the Watergate building.

Senior officials working for President Ronald Reagan secretly arranged for the sale of military weapons to Iran with the hope that American hostages held there would be released and the proceeds could be used to fund the Contras fighting in a rebellion in Nicaragua -- a violation of the Boland Act that expressly prohibited U.S. funding of the rebels.

Story highlights Howard Kurtz: AP phone records search, other stories have turned press on Obama He says attention isn't just out of press self-interest; Obama's stuck in number of scandals He says that for the first time, press started to think Obama misled them Kurtz: GOP may overreach to damage Obama; still, scandal could drown out governing

Editor’s Note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

(CNN) —

The press has turned on President Obama with a vengeance.

Suddenly, the White House briefing room is filled with confrontational questions. Suddenly, the news pages are ablaze with scandal, and the commentators – even some of the president’s usual defenders – are bemoaning his shortcomings. Suddenly, Obama isn’t getting the benefit of the doubt.

According to Obama’s longtime detractors, the denizens of the fourth estate are finally climbing out of a tank in which they have been immersed since roughly 2007. But the reality is a bit more nuanced than that.

CNN Howard Kurtz

There are a number of unsavory allegations swirling around Washington, but do not underestimate the importance of the Justice Department seizing two months of Associated Press phone records without so much as a heads-up. This not only seems like a case of prosecutorial overreach, even in a case involving national security, it strikes at the heart of what journalists do – and has fostered feelings of betrayal. Does the administration not understand the chilling effect on reporters and their sources, they wonder, or simply not care?

It’s easy to say that news organizations recoiled from Obama only when their own special interests were threatened, and maybe there’s some truth to that. But the media also have a deep, abiding love for scandal, and beyond the AP phone records story, the administration is lately providing that scandal in spades.

The battle over Benghazi has mostly divided along partisan lines, with conservatives seeing a sustained coverup and liberals perceiving a partisan attack on what was a bungled operation and confused aftermath. But the report by ABC’s Jonathan Karl alleging the scrubbing of the Susan Rice talking points (following a less-noticed report by Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard) transformed the tone of the coverage in a single stroke.

The Karl report turned out to be based on an inaccurate, misleading characterization of an email, but for the first time, many journalists came to believe the administration had something to hide—and that they had been personally misled in press briefings. That is guaranteed to get the blood flowing.

The disclosure that the IRS selectively targeted conservative groups for review brought immediate condemnation from many across the media spectrum, including Carl Bernstein, who investigated the Nixonian abuses, of which this story carries an unmistakable echo. And it is the trifecta of these scandalous sagas that will dominate coverage for months as media outlets feast on the cycle of investigations, hearings, subpoenas, resignations and denials.

Any doubt that scandal trumps ideology in the media firmament can be dispelled with a glance back at Bill Clinton’s tenure, when what he called the “knee-jerk liberal press” investigated Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater and other allegations with a fervor that eventually put it on a virtual war footing against the White House.

More troubling for the current crew is that news outlets are starting to pivot to broader questions about whether Obama is competent at the business of government or a passive bystander in his own administration. That impression, if it takes hold, cannot be Etch-a-Sketched away.

To be sure, some of Obama’s antagonists will overreach by framing every scandal as the next Watergate and each revelation as an impeachable offense. That may trigger a counter-reaction in which some of the president’s liberal allies shift their focus from the administration’s missteps to the opposition’s overkill.

Some in the media rolled over for Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign, though the record was decidedly more mixed once he took office. But personal feelings toward this president who has never courted the press no longer matter; nor do personal predilections on gun control and immigration reform. The scandal machinery has kicked into high gear, and its sheer noise may drown out everything else.

Deprived of a crucial witness, members of Congress from both parties alternately grilled and scolded former Commissioner Douglas Shulman about the Internal Revenue Service’s improper screening of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status.

Although new details and documents have emerged about how IRS staff scrutinized organizations for political activity, the three hearings on three different days turned up no evidence that the aggressive screening stemmed from partisan motives or was ordered from above, either by the White House or by senior IRS management.

DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS report

The hearings, launched by the release last week of a scathing inspector general’s report, instead have painted a picture of a bungling agency in which top managers in Washington were largely out of touch with how their staff in a Cincinnati field office was handling applications for tax exemptions.

Many questions have not been answered, including how the improper screening started, why it continued on and off for two years, and why top IRS officials did not reveal it for more than a year despite pointed questions from Congress and loud complaints from the targeted conservative groups.

Lerner, who still supervises the IRS staff that handles those applications, and Shulman appeared Wednesday before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but provided little illumination.

Lerner, who revealed the inappropriate targeting two weeks ago, read a statement saying she did nothing wrong, then invoked her 5th Amendment right to not answer questions. “Because I’m asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I’ve done something wrong. I have not,” she said.

Her decision did not sit well with Republicans angered that conservative groups, including local tea party organizations, faced intrusive questions and long delays when they applied for nonprofit status.

“Ms. Lerner has invoked her constitutional rights not to answer our questions about her involvement or the IRS’ involvement, ironically, about denying others their constitutional rights,” Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) said.

Lerner, noting that the Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation, said her lawyer advised her not to testify. It is relatively rare for witnesses to invoke the 5th Amendment. In April 2012, a federal official refused to answer questions about a lavish conference in Las Vegas. And a year earlier, executives of Solyndra invoked the right during a congressional probe of federal grants to their failed solar-energy firm.

The oversight committee chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), excused Lerner, but said he may ask her to appear again, on the grounds that she may have waived her rights by first offering a defense of her actions.

Legal experts were divided on the question. Stanley Brand, former general counsel to the U.S. House, said other witnesses have made introductory statements before invoking the 5th. But Paul Rothstein, a professor of judicial process at Georgetown University Law Center, said Lerner is on “pretty thin ice” because her remarks touched on the subject of the hearing.

The IRS did not respond to questions about Lerner.

“It’s important to find the facts before you hold people accountable,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday when asked why Lerner was still at the IRS.

The new acting commissioner, Daniel Werfel, started Wednesday. President Obama asked him to report back in 30 days on what action he had taken to hold accountable staff who acted inappropriately. “There is a commitment here to get to the bottom of what happened,” Carney said.

Also testifying Wednesday was the first Obama administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal S. Wolin. He said he learned an inspector general’s audit was underway in 2012, but did not learn any details from J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. “I told him that he should follow the facts where they lead. I told him that our job is to stay out of the way and let him do his work,” he said.

Republicans and Democrats on the oversight committee, without Lerner to question, focused most of their attention on Shulman, who ran the IRS for five years before leaving in November 2012.

Shulman, who also testified on Tuesday, again said that he never knew much about what his staff was doing to look for political activity in organizations seeking tax exemptions. He said he didn’t take action when he learned about it in early 2012 since he was told the problem had ended.

“People in your own internal operation knew,” Issa told Shulman. “If you didn’t know, you were derelict in your duty, or your management style was such that you didn’t get informed. Either way, that is certainly not something you should be proud of.”

Shulman repeatedly parried questions about why he didn’t do more. “At the time I learned about this list I felt I was taking the appropriate actions and I felt my course was the right one, and I still feel that way today,” he said.

Advertisement

Many of the exchanges were testy. Some Republicans, trying to build a trail to the White House, asked Shulman what he talked about during his frequent visits to the executive mansion.

One, he pointedly noted, was “the Easter Egg roll with [his] kids.” But he said he steered clear of the subject: “It would not have been appropriate to have a conversation with anyone at the White House about the subject of discriminating against conservative groups in any part of our operations.”

The oversight committee staff has begun questioning IRS officials who were directly involved with supervising screeners and obtaining emails from the staff in Cincinnati who dealt with the issue.

One of those officials, Holly Paz, an attorney who worked under Lerner in Washington, said she first uncovered the improper screening in June 2011. She said the employees in Cincinnati didn’t realize that using terms such as “tea party” to single out applications crossed the line.

Advertisement

“They were not even aware of, you know, politics,” she said, according to committee staff. “Being outside of Washington, it was not something that they followed or had interest in.”

Many of the groups were sent letters with intrusive requests for information, such as lists of donors and details of their conversations at their events. Paz told the staff that no IRS managers looked at those letters before they went out, a practice that has since been changed.

Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, at least for the time being.

Fifty-eight senators voted to move forward with the nomination process, short of the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster. Four Republicans joined 54 Democrats on the losing side. Forty-one Republicans supported the winning side. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted against proceeding, but his vote was purely procedural—voting against proceeding allows him to bring the vote back up again in the future. If there'd been enough votes to hit 60, he'd have voted in favor of ending the filibuster.

This doesn't kill the Hagel nomination—it merely means Senate Republicans have exercised their power to block a vote on the nomination. However, even though at least 57 senators support his nomination, it does mean that unless two more Republicans agree to allow a vote on the nomination, Hagel won't be confirmed by the Senate without fixing the filibuster.

The whole thing is something of a dark comedy. Last month, a handful of Senate Democrats blocked efforts to reform the filibuster. If they hadn't blocked reform, Republicans would have been required to actually speak on the floor to continue their filibuster. Instead, they settled on a handshake agreement between Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. And now, to nobody's surprise, McConnell is stabbing Reid in the back.

Just before the vote, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) actually claimed Republicans weren't filibustering Hagel. Instead, he said, they were merely asking for a 60-vote threshold. Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), who was one of the handful of Democrats to kill filibuster reform, then took the floor to explain that Inhofe was in fact completely full of shit.

If nothing else, today's vote should be a lesson to Levin, Reid, and other Senate Democrats that they made a mistake to give up on filibuster reform. Fortunately, it's a mistake they can fix—if they choose to act. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism.

Reid says the Senate will vote again on Tuesday to move forward with the Hagel nomination. Wouldn't it be nice if instead of losing another vote on Tuesday they instead voted to reform the filibuster?

Apparently, it won't be next Tuesday, it'll be Tuesday February 26.

Republican senators are continuing to deny that this is a filibuster. But they are full of crap. Proof:





@streitfeldcnn via Twitter for BlackBerry® Murkowski explains her yes vote: ""Because I said I was not going to support a filibuster and I stuck by my word.""

They are seriously having a debate on the senate floor about whether this is actually a filibuster. Jesus. What a complete bunch of assholes."

Peters'],Tempers Flare as New Rules Strain Senate,"WASHINGTON — If there is a rock bottom in the frayed relationship between Senate Republicans and Democrats, it seemed uncomfortably close as the final days of 2013 on Capitol Hill degenerated into something like an endurance contest to see who could be the most spiteful.

As the sun rose on Friday, senators had worked through a second straight late-night session — called by Democrats as a way of retaliating for Republicans’ delaying tactics on confirmations. They held their first vote of the day at 7 a.m., confirming Deborah James to be secretary of the Air Force. And absent a compromise, they may still be voting through Saturday, a prospect that has thrilled no one.

“I think it resembles fourth graders playing in a sandbox, and I’ll give the majority leader, Harry Reid, 99 percent of the responsibility for it,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and usually one of the more reserved members, said Thursday.

“He’s going to have ‘The End of the Senate’ written on his tombstone,” Mr. Alexander complained.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called this week “chaotic and confusing, and a shameful waste of time.”"

Kirsten Gillibrand expressed confidence Sunday about getting enough votes this week to change how the military deals with victims of rape and other violent crimes -- a proposal that has sharply divided Washington.

The New York Democrat is leading the effort to give armed-services victims lawyers outside the military’s chain of command, as a way to prosecuting their attackers.

“I think we'll get” the votes, Gillibrand said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We want to make sure that the men and women who serve our military have a justice system deserving of their sacrifices. They are literally giving their lives for our values, for our country. They shouldn't have a justice system that is rife with bias and unfairness.”

Gillibrand’s plan is facing a strong, united opposition from the Pentagon's top echelon and its allies in Congress. However, she made clear Sunday that she wouldn’t soften the legislation by excluding cases of murder and theft to garner more votes.

“We're going to stick to the original plan because it's a better bill,” she told ABC.

Some of the strongest Capitol Hill opposition comes from two female senators who are former prosecutors.

They insist that commanders, not an outside military lawyer, must be accountable for meting out justice.

Even so, major changes are coming for a decades-old military system just a few months after several high-profile cases infuriated Republicans and Democrats in a rapid chain of events by Washington standards.

The Senate this week is set to consider an annual defense policy bill that would strip commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions, require dishonorable discharge or dismissal for any individual convicted of sexual assault and establish a civilian review when a decision is made not to prosecute a case.

The bill would provide a special counsel for victims and eliminate the statute of limitations.

The changes are backed by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But overshadowing the revisions is the testy, intense fight over Gillibrand's proposal to strip commanders of their authority to prosecute cases of sexual assault.

Her solution has divided the Senate, splitting Republicans and Democrats, men and women, even former attorneys general, into unusual coalitions. The lobbying has been fierce, with dueling data, testimonials and news conferences with victims. Opponents invited Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Loretta Reynolds to the closed-door Republican caucus last week.

Among Gillibrand's 47 announced supporters are conservative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with 16 of the Senate's 20 women.

Standing against the plan is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.; the panel's military veterans John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., and three of the committee's women -- Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., both former prosecutors, and Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.

Gillibrand says she privately has received backing from more than 50 senators, but support remains short of the filibuster-proof 60 votes that likely will be needed for her amendment to the defense bill.

McCaskill said the Pentagon already has already taken sufficient correct action, pointing to the Defense Department saying reports of sexual assaults in the military increased by 46 percent during the last budget year.

There were 3,553 sexual assault complaints from October 2012 to June, compared with 2,434 reports during the same period the previous year, which Defense Department officials suggest shows people are more confident about coming forward now that improvements are being made in handling assaults.

Gillibrand instead points to the Pentagon’s estimate of 26,000 possibly being sexually assaulted last year, based on an anonymous survey.

Thousands of victims were unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, according to the Pentagon report earlier this year.

""They didn't trust the chain of command, Gillibrand said recently. “They didn't think anything would be done in their cases. … The second reason they didn't report was because they feared or had witnessed retaliation. ... The command climate failed those victims.""

Gen. Ray Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, said last week that adopting her plan would be a ""big mistake"" and that it would cost an estimated $113 million a year, including salaries for about 600 attorneys and support staff.

That financial assessment doesn't take into account the expense of training members of the military, medical and mental health benefits for victims, loss of productivity and possible separation from service for a Pentagon with a fiscal year budget of more than $500 billion.

McCaskill, Ayotte and Fisher have compiled additional changes that the Senate is expected to approve. They include barring defendants from using the good military character defense, allowing sexual assault victims to challenge a discharge or separation from the service, and extending the new protections to the military service academies.

""The reason this issue is so hard is because on one side is a very simple narrative, this is victim versus commanders and you should be for the victims,"" McCaskill said.

""On the other side, it's much more complex, and I'm guided by practical experience handling these cases and a pretty intimate knowledge of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how it actually works ... and making sure we have a system that's constitutional, that works and that holds commanders accountable.""

That is when Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to deride Mr. McCain’s opposition to his measure that would punish Egypt as “spurious and really, frankly, absurd,” not the first time Mr. Paul has wielded verbal scythes toward his colleagues.

The willingness of Republicans to skewer one of their own became increasingly apparent on Friday as more and more members of the party peeled away from Mr. Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for secretary of defense, saying they would not vote to confirm him after Mr. Hagel melted like chocolate on a dashboard under combative questioning from Republicans.

Still, Republican senators and aides said that despite a halting performance, Mr. Hagel would probably be confirmed with Democratic votes. A filibuster of his nomination is still possible, a likely first for a cabinet nominee.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-gop-tells-obama-tone-down-attacks-214227808--finance.html,,[],Senate GOP tells Obama to tone down the attacks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Polite yet firm, Senate Republicans told President Barack Obama on Thursday to tone down his political attacks and prod Democratic allies to support controversial changes in Medicare if he wants a compromise reducing deficits and providing stability to federal benefit programs.

Participants at a 90-minute closed-door meeting said Obama acknowledged the point without yielding ground — and noted that Republicans criticize him freely. ""To quote an old Chicago politician, 'Politics ain't beanbag,'"" the president said.

The discussion came as Obama wrapped up a highly publicized round of meetings with rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties and both houses of Congress in hopes of building support for a second-term agenda of deficit reduction, immigration overhaul and gun control.

Obama met separately with Senate Republicans and House Democrats as legislation to lock in $85 billion in spending cuts and avert a government shutdown on March 27 made plodding progress. Separately the two parties advanced rival longer-term budgets in both houses.

No breakthroughs had been anticipated and none was reported in the closed-door sessions, although Obama told reporters before returning to the White House, ""We're making progress.""

In the Senate, several Republicans told the president his rhetoric was not conducive to compromise.

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota referred to a recent interview in which Obama said some Republicans want to eviscerate Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""Nobody here believes those programs ought to be gutted,"" Thune told Obama, the senator later recalled.

""It's better if the president is here fully engaged with us than traveling around the country saying Congress isn't doing its job,"" Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming later told reporters, summarizing comments he and others had made. ""The president needs to be here working side by side with Congress.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said the message to Obama had been: ""Step one is to work with us, not just heckle and taunt us on the campaign trail, and step two is to lead."" The Tennessee lawmaker said Obama must also ""go against the grain in his own party,"" much as Lyndon Johnson did in winning civil rights legislation from Congress in the 1960s or Richard Nixon did in forging an opening with China in the 1970s.

Story continues

Obama has repeatedly told Republicans in recent days he supports curtailing the growth of cost-of-living benefits for Social Security and other benefit programs as part of a compromise, as well as raising costs for wealthier Medicare beneficiaries.

He has also told them they must agree to raise revenue — although not tax rates — as part of any deal.

So far, at least, Republicans have noted that proposals to overhaul Medicare include higher premiums or copays on wealthier seniors. Some also have said they could accept higher revenues as part of tax reform that stimulates economic growth.

Neither approach is likely to guarantee enough revenue to satisfy Obama or congressional Democrats. The president said as much later in the day. According to one lawmaker, he told House Democrats in a separate meeting they need not worry about slowing the rise in cost of living benefits because Republicans so far show no willingness to raise revenues.

If nothing else, the reviews of Obama's meeting with Senate Republicans were uniformly positive.

""We'll see where we go from here, but it was a great meeting,"" said GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who normally is one of the president's sharpest critics in Congress.

Senators emerging from meetings with Obama said the discussions had ranged over the fate of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, regulatory concerns, fracking, deficit reduction and more.

The president declined to be pinned down on the fate of the Keystone Pipeline, which supporters hope to build to ship Canadian oil to the United States. Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota said Obama pledged only to make a decision before the end of the year on the project, which is opposed by environmentalists but supported by some labor unions.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., mentioned the Navajo Generating Station, a power plant in Page, Ariz., where the Environmental Protection Agency is requiring the facility's owner to spend $1.1 billion to upgrade emissions controls. Flake recently wrote that a separate federal agency recently said that even with the change, it couldn't guarantee there would be ""any perceptible improvement in visibility at the Grand Canyon and other national parks and wilderness areas.""

While Obama completed his closed-door round of meetings, the Senate slowly worked its way through a bill that locks in $85 billion in spending cuts through the end of the budget year while guaranteeing there won't be a government shutdown.

In a show of bipartisanship, leading senators in both parties agreed to provide flexibility for the departments of Commerce, State, Justice and Homeland Security in apportioning the spending cuts, just as the House did with the Pentagon in its version of the bill.

But there were limits to cooperation — most evidently as Republicans attacked a budget by Senate Democrats that relies on $1 trillion in higher taxes over a decade, makes relatively modest changes to Medicare and envisions deficits indefinitely into the future.

Because Democrats want to restore $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over the same period — cuts imposed by Washington's failure to strike a broader budget pact — the blueprint authored by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington increases spending slightly when compared with current policies.

McConnell labeled the plan a ""left-wing manifesto masquerading as a budget.""

Democrats on Thursday evening pushed Murray's budget through the Budget Committee on a 12-10 party-line vote, setting up a clash on the Senate floor next week.

A rival plan is expected to come to the Republican-controlled House next week after its approval in committee Wednesday evening. Democrats were as harsh in criticizing it as Republicans were in condemning theirs. The GOP plan cuts $4.6 trillion and eliminates deficits over a decade without any tax increase.

(CNN) —

On “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart captured the frustration that many of President Obama’s supporters have felt over the past week as one scandal after another cascaded into the White House.

After starting with a predictable riff accusing Bill O’Reilly of ignoring facts when attacking the Obama administration, Stewart turned to the IRS story, banged on his desk, and yelled out curses.

Stewart then blasted the administration for the revelation that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to right-wing organizations. “Explanation please,” Stewart said, before playing some comedic clips of Lois Lerner, the official in charge of handling tax-exempt organizations at the IRS, who admits she is not good at math.

“Well, congratulations, President Barack Obama,” Stewart went on to say. “Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f*****g heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. … This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government.”

This was just one of the scandals to rock the administration within the week. The media also reported that the Justice Department had conducted a surveillance operation focusing on journalists for The Associated Press, in an effort to find the source behind a leaked story about a foiled terrorist attack.

Many liberal Democrats were frustrated and shocked that the administration had permitted the seizure of the phone records, the kind of activities they would certainly have railed against had they happened under President George W. Bush.

Although there is no evidence that Obama was involved in either of these incidents – and many Republicans are clearly trying to use them to drum up a narrative about a scandal-ridden presidency – the combination left many Democrats, like Stewart, scratching their heads, wondering what happened to the president who promised when he ran in 2008 to transform the way politics worked.

Despite controversies, Obama approval rating holds steady

It is still too early to know all the facts and what the president’s role has been. Nonetheless, some of the frustration that Obama’s supporters feel comes from ways in which this White House has too often accepted politics as usual rather than embarking on the transformative changes that he once promised. While many of the president’s supporters insist that he has delivered on his promise to push forward a bold policy agenda, few would say that he has fulfilled his goal of changing the way that politics works.

What happened?

Since the resignation of President Richard Nixon over Watergate, most presidential candidates have run on the promise to fix a broken Washington. Jimmy Carter, whose 1976 campaign revolved around the basic promise that you could trust him, perfected this message and style of campaigning.

In one way or another, every candidate – including Obama’s predecessor, Bush – has assured voters he would reform government and transform politics. But the change doesn’t happen. Within four years, as Carter discovered, the new boss looks like the old boss and “the system” seems the same.

Most presidents realize once they are in office that reforming Washington will consume too much of their political capital, generating more enemies among their opponents as well as within their own party, and the results of any such initiative will probably be negligible.

Instead, once in office, presidents tend to embrace the role of politician and turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues that will matter much more to voters on Election Day. The easiest way to achieve policy goals is by working through the existing system rather than trying to remake things.

Transformation is also difficult simply because the size and scale of the executive branch have grown so much over the past century, vastly increasing the odds that things can go wrong.

Within each agency, there are multiple opportunities for unethical bureaucrats, sometimes without presidential knowledge, to do bad things. This is part of the reason there have been such strong advocates, on the right and the left, calling for greater – though less politicized – congressional oversight and tighter rules to constrain wrongdoing.

Opinion: For Obama, it’s no more Mr. Nice Media

In certain respects, the burden, as Stewart points out, is greater for liberals, given the centrality of government to their agenda. Over the past decades the vast expansion of executive power through the homeland security program has also increased the possibilities for wrongdoing.

People should not be surprised that the Justice Department was so aggressive with the AP phone records. After all, Obama has kept most of Bush’s homeland security program in place and has conducted an extraordinarily aggressive program to contain any leaks that threaten the system. In defense of the government’s actions, Attorney General Eric Holder said the leak that it was investigating “put the American people at risk.”

Reforming government has also fallen victim to the hyperpartisan polarization that defines Washington. From day one in the White House, Obama has faced an incredibly hostile Republican Party, unwilling to support almost anything he does. This vastly diminished the incentives for him to try to find bipartisan support for reform initiatives, which usually generate a lot of opposition from interests who thrive in the status quo and are rarely priorities for voters on Election Day.

With campaign finance, another area where Obama has greatly disappointed his supporters, Obama decided that the only way to beat the Republicans would be to raise and spend as much money as they did. That prompted his decision to turn down federal financing for his campaigns, bringing an end to the post-Watergate reforms, and leading to reliance on the Super PACs he once criticized.

None of this is meant to excuse the kinds of activities that have recently been revealed. But Americans should not be surprised that the promise of reform vanished under Obama and that the problems of government he inherited have not gone away.

Obama to new grads: ‘No time for excuses’

Ultimately, we will need politicians who are willing to take huge risks in tackling some of the underlying problems with government – or a scandal so severe that it creates real political pressure for incumbents to do something – if we are to strengthen our processes and reduce the risks of the kinds of stories we saw this past week.

Scandals can prod elected officials to take reform seriously. Following Watergate, a scandal far worse than what we have seen thus far, Congress and the president adopted a number of major government reforms that included a new campaign finance system, ethics rules, the Office of the Independent Counsel, and much more. While Carter has been criticized for many of his failings on domestic and foreign policy, his decision to move forward with reforms in the wake of Watergate stands as one of his biggest achievements.

Perhaps Obama should use this moment as an opportunity to be bold and to return to some of the fundamental ideas for reform that he raised in embarking on his journey to the White House.

Louisiana showed up at the top of a study of political corruption that calculated the number of convictions per capita. Georgia came out as worst on a corruption risk report from the State Integrity Investigation, which measured factors like accountability, transparency and ethics enforcement.

New Jersey got the best grade.

“There was an audible gasp across the entire state,” said Debbie Walsh of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.

“It was counterintuitive for us as well,” said Gordon Witkin, the managing editor at the Center for Public Integrity. Witkin’s theory is that New Jersey got to be good by being bad. “Where there has been a major, major scandal, that was the catalyst for very specific reform.”

Well, New Jersey has had its problems. Over the last decade there was Gov. James McGreevey’s affair with the male Israeli poet. (The state could have accepted the gay part, and the adultery part, if only McGreevey had not decided to prove his love by making the poet head of homeland security.) That was followed by a slew of political indictments, after which the Legislature did end some of its most notorious ethics loopholes. But it’s still, you know, New Jersey.

It’s at this point in every rant about state legislators that we stop to point out that most of them are honest, and some downright heroic. Really, just try spending a good chunk of your life as a reformer in the New York State Senate. See how you like it.

Also, some entire state legislatures are both honest and effective. People speak highly of the one in Nebraska. (It’s unicameral!) I once covered the Connecticut Legislature, where people took their jobs very seriously, holding endless public hearings on every bill and then having long, earnest debates in which the outcome was not preordained. But that was way back in the 1970s, when Joseph Lieberman was the Senate majority leader, and even at that early age was being accused by the liberals of selling out."

Three Navy officials have been charged with crimes, and four others, including two admirals, have been suspended over their ties to Mr. Francis.

“It’s like finding a couple of cockroaches in the kitchen when you turn on the light,” said Charles Tiefer, a former member of the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. “This suggests that this area of contracting is infested with problems, including a lack of competition, overbilling and resistance to government investigations.”

Investigators accuse Inchcape of a different scheme: that it paid commissions to subcontractors willing to give large discounts, then pocketed the difference instead of refunding it to the Navy.

A federal subpoena issued in March 2011 demanded that Inchcape turn over its records involving Navy ships and any discounts or rebates from subcontractors since 2002, court records show.

A Justice Department lawyer later sent the company an email saying investigators were especially concerned about its deals in supplying six aircraft carriers and four other ships from 2005 through 2009, and about its charges for fuel in Peru and for removing waste from ships in Bahrain, Dubai and South Africa.

Based in Florida, GEO is a nationwide political player. It makes the majority of its contributions in its home state, but it's been known to contribute to federal and state elections in places like California, New Mexico, Virginia, and, believe it or not, Indiana.

Over the last decade, GEO Group has spent more than $3 million in direct campaign contributions, the majority of that money going to Republican candidates and causes. This is most likely on the low end of estimates, too, since many state contribution records are either incomplete or missing altogether.

Indiana is eighth on the list of states where GEO does its spending, as it's sunk more than $60,000 into state elections there. It specifically contributed $12,500 to the 2012 Pence campaign, which doesn't seem like much without context. That contribution made GEO one of Pence's top 30 corporate contributors, ranking in front of US Steel Corp, Caterpillar, and Koch Industries.

The group has also thrown its financial weight behind Brian Bosma, the Indiana State House Speaker, who has been quoted as saying:



“As an entry drug, I think marijuana is more powerful than it’s given credit for,” he said. “I know some states have taken that step (to legalize it), but I don’t find it advisable at this point.”

During the first year of operation, the 2,416-bed prison is expected to house approximately 1,068 security level 1-4 adult male inmates for the Indiana Department of Correction and generate approximately $12.8 million. Under the terms of the contract, GEO will be paid for a guaranteed average daily population of 961 inmates, or 90 per cent of the initial contract capacity, following a ramp-up period of approximately four weeks.

State Police responded to the prison around 2 p.m., where inmates set fires outside the cell blocks. Mayor Tom Nipp described the situation as, ""A full-scale riot."" Nipp says police have set up a perimeter around the prison, assuring residents that no one has escaped. Video taken by Chopper 13 shows inmates standing near small flames that appear to be mattresses set on fire. The Indiana Department of Corrections confirms the disturbance involved prisoners from Indiana and prisoners from Arizona. Tear gas was used by correctional officers and State Police to gain control. Police moved hundreds of prisoners outside to an area along the outer fence line while cell blocks were searched for others involved in the riots.

Business has been quite good for GEO in Indiana. In 2005, they signed a contract to operate a prison in New Castle. That first contract reads like many that GEO signs with its depraved partners. Indiana guaranteed a prison population roughly 90% of capacity. Or, as the state's excited press release put it:Some might argue that private prison companies are worth it. After all, the private market is better equipped to handle things effectively and efficiently, right? Wrong The Indiana governor wants to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a felony because, apparently, we aren't nearly hard enough on those non-violent pot smokers. Or something. Lurking beneath the surface is an insidious actor. The unmentioned hand of political influence guides his actions, as prison corporations like GEO own their candidates and wreck state criminal codes."

A sect of the Republican Party has again flexed its political muscle and effectively shut down the government because it doesn’t feel it necessary for those without healthcare insurance now to be able to obtain it.

This group has been unwilling to work with President Obama since he has been in office — if he says yes, they vote no; if he says up, they vote down. These lawmakers’ concern has never been about what’s right for the nation, but only about how to thwart the president whenever possible.

Once again, the lesson is that politics and ignorance don’t mix. Perhaps this time the voters are paying attention.

Leave it to the Republicans to shut down government because they don’t think millions of uninsured people should be covered by health insurance. We pride ourselves on being the best country in the world. Surely the “best country in the world” can provide health insurance to its people.

Maybe members of Congress should take a reduction in their salaries to help everyone out. They should have to pay some penalty for this blackmail.

I hope Obama stands strong on this. No party should be able to hold the country hostage. I hope the Republicans pay dearly for this come election time.

Hundreds of thousands of federal government employees are now furloughed as a result of the government shutdown facilitated by the Republican-controlled House. As a result, these workers and their families will be facing tough financial choices.

In 2011, the average net worth of a GOP House member was nearly $8 million. Republicans in the House have the resources to withstand any government shutdown. The same cannot be said of other government employees.

I’ve got a great idea to ameliorate this suffering: Let the Republicans pay the wages of all furloughed workers.

Congress holds the purse strings. Whether the president signs a budget or vetoes it is his choice. But the president doesn’t “make” the laws; Congress does.

In 2012, the nation reelected Obama, kept the Senate in the hands of the Democrats and left the House firmly in the hands of Republicans. I think what the nation was saying to the leaders is simple: Here’s the hand you’ve been dealt, now do the best you can and compromise.

Back when this happened under Bill Clinton, he vetoed what Congress had sent him. But thanks to the media, voters blamed Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, even though they did their job and gave the president a budget.

There’s a reason the Constitution doesn’t allow one person to decide what budget the country should live on.

Whatever happens, the Affordable Care Act will be implemented. The Democratic-controlled Senate and the president are clearly not going to yield on this issue.

Funding any law is implicit in its passage. Republican attempts to defund Obamacare, delay it for a year or make it ineffective are pathetic attempts to reverse a law of the land. Tying their objections on this law to the budget or the debt ceiling is extremely irresponsible and completely indefensible.

USA TODAY

Karl Rove offered an interesting postmortem Thursday of what happened to Republicans in their battle with the White House over the government shutdown and debt ceiling.

Rove, the former George W. Bush political strategist and organizer of the political action committee American Crossroads, writes in the Wall Street Journal that Republican lawmakers walked into a trap set by President Obama.

Here's a bit of what Rove had to say:

""There's plenty of blame to go around for the chaos in Washington, but at the top of the list is the absence of presidential leadership. When Congress is close to agreement but still divided, the country rightly counts on its chief executive to bridge the gaps, make the compromises, and smooth the way to passage.

""Instead, President Obama deliberately withdrew from negotiations over the debt ceiling and government shutdown. According to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday, the White House was concerned his personal involvement would be 'a mistake that damaged the president's ability to advance his agenda.'

""Perhaps it was for the best. Mr. Obama's skill is not in bringing Americans together; it is turning them against one another. This latest crisis over the debt ceiling and shutdown is a case in point. Having voted against an increase in the debt ceiling in 2006 as the junior senator from Illinois, the president now characterizes those opposed to one today as reckless and crazed. Hypocrisy makes for clever politics but bad governing.""

Rove concludes:

""Barack Obama set the trap. Some congressional Republicans walked into it. As a result, the president is stronger, the GOP is weaker, and ObamaCare is marginally more popular."""
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leaders-confounded-stopgap-spending-bill-195923220--politics.html,,[],GOP leaders confounded on stopgap spending bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — GOP leaders eager to avoid blame for a possible government shutdown next month appear confounded by conservatives' passion for using fast-approaching deadlines to derail the implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, conceded Thursday his plan was all but dead for quickly passing a temporary spending bill that also defunds Obamacare, make the Senate vote on each idea separately and then send only the portion for keeping the government open to the White House for the president's signature.

Meanwhile, new freelance effort by rank-and-file Republicans to condition keeping the government open or preventing a debt ceiling default on delaying Obamacare for a year hit a brick wall of opposition from Democrats vowing to never let the health care law be delayed or unraveled.

Nonetheless, some Republicans floated the idea of postponing all of the unimplemented portions of the new law for a year — including a requirement that virtually everyone buys health insurance and with new tax subsidies to help many people pay for it — in exchange for raising the government's borrowing cap and easing tens of billions of dollars in broad, automatic spending cuts.

""Let's give them something and then we get something in exchange,"" Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said. ""We give the administration the debt ceiling increase they want. We give them maybe some sequestration dollars that they would like to have. And in exchange we delay Obamacare, which I think the president should want. ... He's already delayed big chunks of it. It's not ready for implementation.""

The administration has delayed a provision of the health care law requiring larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers. State exchanges through which people can purchase health insurance are set to begin operation Oct. 1.

Washington faces two key deadlines in coming weeks. The first is Oct. 1, when a stopgap spending measure will be needed to fund federal agency operations such as employee salaries, equipment and other costs. Without new spending authority, non-essential government operations would shut down for the first time since 1996. Even if the government shuts down, however, Social Security, Medicare and other so-called mandatory programs would continue to operate on autopilot.

Story continues

The other, far more important must-pass measure looms later in October and would increase the government's borrowing limit so it can pay all of its bills, including Social Security benefits, interest payments on government debt, and payments to local governments and government contractors. Defaulting of those obligations would have far greater consequences for both the economy and the political fortunes of the politicians that bear the blame from voters.

The White House vowed again Thursday that it will do everything in its power to protect and defend Obama's health care law, his most significant accomplishment in office.

""We will not accept anything that delays or defunds Obamacare,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

""It's not going to happen. It's the law of the land. It's been upheld by the Supreme Court,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""So anybody who ties the operations of the government or the debt ceiling to trying to defeat Obamacare is really in favor of shutting down the government and having us default on our debt.""

The chaos on Capitol Hill forced House leaders to tell lawmakers they'll likely have to scrap a vacation set for the week of Sept. 23 so they can be available to work out a short-term spending bill to keep the government running past the Oct. 1 start of the new budget year.

On Tuesday, GOP leaders proposed a plan to advance the measure through the House coupled with a provision to derail implementation of the new health care law but allow the Democratic Senate to send it on to the White House shorn of the ""defund 'Obamacare'"" provision as long as there was a vote on it. That got poor reviews from some conservatives who don't see it as fighting hard enough to block Obamacare.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is privately proposing a one-year delay of Obamacare implementation as part of the stopgap funding bill. The flaw in that strategy is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., could win a vote to strip the Obamacare provision out in the Senate and send it straight back to the House.

""There are a lot of members with a lot of ideas,"" Boehner said. ""And we're going to continue to talk to all of them.""

The speaker met Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew — an adversary from the 2011 budget and debt negotiations — and presented him with a list of examples in which debt ceiling legislation has been paired with budget cuts. Such examples including budget pacts in 2011, 1997 and 1990.

""For decades the White House, the Congress have used the debt limit to find bipartisan solutions on the deficit and the debt. Now these types of changes were signed into law by Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton — and President Obama himself two years ago,"" Boehner said. The administration says is won't negotiate on the debt limit after Republicans used it in 2011 to demand spending cuts.

On numerous other occasions, including seven instances during the administration of George W. Bush, Republicans have delivered support for debt ceiling increases without any spending cuts attached. That's what the administration and Democrats are demanding now, and they're confident that Republicans have less leverage than they think.

""If push comes to shove on debt ceiling, I'm virtually certain they blink,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""They know they shouldn't be playing havoc with the markets."""
http://news.yahoo.com/money-tangle-irs-tea-party-tempest-144831224.html,,[],Money tangle: The IRS and its tea party tempest,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is feeling the sort of heat that targeted taxpayers feel from the tax agency. It's the sense that a powerful someone is breathing down your neck.

Republicans in Congress are livid with the IRS over its systematic scrutiny of conservative groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Democrats agree that something must be done. Likewise, President Barack Obama isn't at all happy with the tax collectors.

That kind of commonality in Washington is about as rare as a budget surplus. So expect a bumpy ride for the IRS, unloved in the best of times, as a Justice Department criminal investigation and multiple congressional inquiries try to get to the bottom of it all.

A look at the matter:

___

IN BRIEF

The central issue is whether IRS agents who determine whether nonprofit organizations have to pay federal income taxes played political favorites or even broke the law when they subjected tea party groups and other conservative organizations to special scrutiny.

Also foremost in the concerns of Congress: Why senior IRS officials, for many months, did not disclose what they had learned about the actions of lower-level employees despite persistent questions from Republican lawmakers and howls from aggrieved organizations.

___

WHY IT MATTERS

The IRS is expected to be pesky, even intimidating, to miscreants, but at all times politically neutral. Nonpartisanship is the coin of its realm, perhaps more so than in any other part of government.

""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives,"" Obama said in ousting the agency's acting chief, Steven T. Miller.

The president named Daniel Werfel, a senior White House budget official, to take charge of the agency temporarily. Werfel launched a 30-day review of IRS operations, a step unlikely by itself to quiet the storm. Some Republicans want a special counsel appointed to investigate; Democrats are resistant to that.

Story continues

There's no question IRS actions in the period covering the 2010 congressional elections and the early going of the 2012 presidential campaign have tattered the perception that the agency is clean of political leanings. Whether that was also the reality remains to be discovered.

A report by the Treasury Department's top investigator for tax matters found no evidence that sheer partisanship drove the targeting. But the watchdog disclosed Friday that he is still investigating. His report faulted lax management for not stopping it sooner.

It's a sensitive time for the agency's professionalism to be in doubt because the IRS soon will loom even larger in people's lives. It's to be the enforcer of the individual mandate to carry insurance under Obama's health care law, itself an object of suspicion for many conservatives. To the right, that's insult upon injury from the left.

___

WHAT WOULD MAKE IT MATTER EVEN MORE

Any effort from top levels of the administration or political operatives to manipulate the IRS for campaign purposes would put the scandal in the realm of Nixonian skullduggery.

The public record as it is known does not show interference.

At the same time, early IRS assurances that high-level people inside the agency did not know what was going on have been contradicted by evidence that the head of the agency's tax-exemption operation and later its deputy commissioner were briefed about it and did not tell Congress.

As well, J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified Friday that he informed senior Treasury Department officials of his investigation last summer. Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday, ""No one in the White House was aware.""

___

RED-FLAG WORDS

To qualify for exemption from federal income taxes, organizations must show they are not too political in nature to meet the standard. In the cases in question, applications that raised eyebrows were referred to a team of specialists who took a much closer look at a group's operations. That's normal.

But in early 2010, IRS agents in the Determinations Unit began paying special attention to tax-exempt applications from groups associated with the tea party or with certain words or phrases in their materials, according to the IRS inspector general's report. That's not normal.

The red-flag keywords came to include ""Patriots,"" ''Take Back the Country"" and ""We the People.""

That August, agents were given an explicit ""be on the lookout"" directive for ""various local organizations in the Tea Party movement"" that are seeking tax-exempt status. Such organizations saw their applications languish except when they were hit with lots of questions, some of which the IRS was not entitled to ask, such as the names of donors.

In June 2011, after the congressional elections, Lois G. Lerner, in charge of overseeing tax-exempt organizations, learned of the flagging and ordered the criteria to be changed right away, the inspector general said. The new guidance was more generic and stripped of any explicit partisan freight. But it did not last.

In January 2012, the screening was modified again, this time to watch for references to the Constitution or Bill of Rights, and for ""political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government.""

The Constitution and Bill of Rights are touchstones for liberals, too. But in modern politics, they've been appropriated as rallying cries of conservatives and libertarians. Finally, that May, such flagging ended.

Altogether, specialists reviewed a variety of potentially too-political applications, presumably covering the liberal-conservative spectrum. But fully one-third of the cases were of the tea party-patriot variety. During the height of the flagging, the inspector general says, all applications fitting the conservative-focused criteria went to the specialists while others that should have stirred concern did not.

In short, if you were with the tea party, you were guaranteed a close second look and almost certainly months more of delay. If you were leading a liberal activist group, maybe yes, maybe no.

ON THE RECEIVING END

""Dealing with this was like dealing with tax day every day for 2½ years,"" says Laurence Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party in Virginia. ""Like your worst audit nightmare.""

His group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2009 and finally got it in July 2012.

Tom Zawistowski applied for the tax exemption for his group, the Ohio Liberty Coalition, in June 2010 when the flagging was gathering steam. He got it in December 2012, after the presidential election.

The IRS asked him for the identity of the group's members, times and location of group activities, printouts of its website and Facebook pages, contents of speeches and the names and credentials of speakers at forums. He said the IRS also audited his personal finances and his wife's.

""The intent of this was to hurt the ability of tea party groups to function in an election year,"" he said.

An Associated Press analysis of 93 ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" groups found that most were shoestring operations, with only two dozen raising more than $20,000 a year.

FIVE-OH WHAT?

If the IRS merely rolled over and played dead when it got an application for a tax exemption, the government would be even more broke than it is and big money would have an even more pernicious grip on campaigns.

The IRS knows better than most that politically driven organizations, out to elect and defeat candidates, can masquerade as ""social welfare"" or other charitable entities under the tax-exempting articles of Section 501 (c) of the tax code.

Or they can align themselves with one, allowing unlimited donations to be raised and the identities of the contributors to stay secret as long as the nonprofit entities don't go too far in overt politicking.

In recent years, advocacy groups have paired their nonprofit arms with ""super"" political action committees, moves that took hold after a series of court rulings — including the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision — loosened the rules on money in politics.

The rulings gave rise to such pairings as the American Crossroads super PAC with its Crossroads GPS nonprofit on behalf of Republicans in the 2012 campaign, and the Priorities USA Action super PAC with its own nonprofit arm, for Obama's benefit.

Section 501 (c) (3) can be the most lucrative financially for organizations because in addition to conferring tax-exempt status, it allows donations to qualifying groups to be tax deductible.

Section 501 (c) (4) doesn't permit tax-deductible donations but gives groups more latitude to lobby and to dabble more directly in political campaigns as long as ""social welfare"" remains their primary mission. They can also keep their donors secret, a big benefit over more blatantly political super PACs.

It's all complex, squishy and in some ways subjective, so it might not come as a shock that the IRS would look for shortcuts such as political buzzwords and slogans when deciding what a group is really up to. But the record as yet known does not show that the scrutiny cut both ways.

In congressional testimony about the discredited IRS actions, Attorney General Eric Holder said there is good reason to take a skeptical look at some Section 501 applications but ""it has to be done in a way that does not depend on the political persuasion of the group.""

BY THE NUMBERS

The inspector general's office reviewed 296 tax-exempt applications that had been flagged as potentially too political. Of them, 108 were ultimately approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been rejected and 160 were still open in December 2012, some languishing for more than three years.

___

STONEWALLING?

Hearing complaints of IRS harassment from constituents, lawmakers began asking a lot of questions of the agency starting in mid-2011. They got a lot of answers — just not answers revealing what was going on.

In multiple letters, some as long as 45 pages, as well as in meetings and congressional hearings, senior IRS officials laid out in painstaking detail the process of checking tax-exempt applications but did not disclose what they had come to learn of the flagging.

Miller, for example, was told by staff in May 2012 about the inappropriate screening but did not pass that on in communications with inquiring members of Congress or in his appearance two months later with the House panel most concerned about the reports.

Lois G. Lerner, in charge of overseeing tax-exempt organizations at the IRS, was briefed about the screening a year earlier and ordered an end to explicit tea party-type flagging. But she did not tell lawmakers about that when asked about the constituent complaints.

Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Lerner ""should be relieved of her duties.""

ABOUT THAT SKULLDUGGERY

A number of presidents or their operatives have tried to twist the IRS against ""dissidents"" or political opponents. Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy are among them.

President Richard Nixon, though, surely takes the cake here.

The Senate Judiciary Committee cited his IRS manipulations, including his pursuit of those on his ""enemies list,"" in the articles of impeachment accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors in the Watergate scandal and of actions ""subversive of constitutional government.""

Article 2, Abuse of Power, said: ""He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavored to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposes not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.""

Nixon resigned after it became clear that a Senate impeachment trial would drive him from office.

These are activities for which donations aren’t eligible for tax exemptions or donor confidentiality.

What scandal, you ask? It’s not the bogus scandal about the IRS targeting “tea party” and “patriot” groups for special scrutiny. It’s the real scandal that these groups or any others were trying to get tax breaks and anonymity for political donations in the first place.

Unsurprisingly, conservative groups instantly put up a big squeal about the IRS rules; after all, they’re the ones who have exploited the murky old rules most assiduously. “These proposed new regulations put the 1st Amendment rights of Americans at even greater risk,” said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the conservative American Center for Law and Justice, a big defender of the right of political donors to masquerade as public-spirited philanthropists and remain anonymous to boot. But make no mistake: Organizations across the political spectrum flouted the law, and they were all in the wrong.

The IRS proposal would dispel the murkiness that allowed illicit, anonymous multimillion-dollar political contributions to fly under the radar. It would define “candidate-related political activity” in detail, and make clear that it’s not eligible for the tax exemption and anonymity granted to nonpolitical activities by so-called nonprofit “social welfare organizations,” known formally as 501(c)4’s.

The IRS rules still leave one important issue unresolved. That’s the question of how much political activity a “social welfare” C4 can engage in at all, and why the figure shouldn’t be zero. The agency awaits further comments on that question.

A bit of history is useful here. As we reported last year, political operatives loved 501(c)4’s as vehicles for political contributions for two reasons: Their income was tax exempt, and their donors could remain unidentified. The problem was that such organizations were supposed to be devoted primarily, if not exclusively, to “social welfare.”

We observed in a second column that typical C4’s as envisioned by the IRS were religious groups; cultural, educational and veterans organizations; homeowners associations; and volunteer fire departments. Instead, C4 designation was claimed by organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, which spent nearly $86 million on political activity in 2012, according to ProPublica.

Over the years, the IRS had ruled that nonprofits could keep their C4 status as long as their political activities didn’t exceed 49% of their work. But the agency didn’t define political activity very clearly. It was left up to rank-and-file agents to figure out what side of the line an organization was on. Flash forward to the 2010 and 2012 elections, and the beleaguered troops tried to winnow out violators by screening for organizations with the terms “tea party,” “patriots” and, as it turned out, “progressive” and “green” in their names.

This led to the famous “IRS scandal,” a bogus claim by Republicans, especially Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), that the Obama administration was “targeting” tea party groups for harassment. Despite Issa’s reputation for shooting first and asking questions never, this brouhaha held the stage in Washington for months -- even now it’s got holdout believers in the GOP.

The IRS guidelines, which are still subject to formal review, will do much to take guesswork out of the enforcement effort. They’d define “candidate-related political activity” as, among other things, “communications that expressly advocate for a clearly identified political candidate or candidates of a political party,” or that are made within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary and “clearly identify a candidate or political party.”

Also included would be grants to PACs, Super PACS, and other political advocacy groups, and voter registration drives and “get-out-the-vote” drives.

It’s worth noting that none of these activities are considered illegal or barred -- so much for the claim that freedom of speech hangs in the balance. But they’re not tax-exempt, and henceforth no one should be able to pursue them and weasel around the campaign finance disclosure laws. The message finally is becoming clear: You want to spend money on politics, fine. You want to do it in secret by claiming to be a “social welfare” group, no dice."

President Barack Obama rejected a Republican proposal for a short-term debt limit hike, the New York Times reports.

However, Republicans immediately pushed back against the paper's report. ""He did not reject,"" one House GOP leadership aide who was at the meeting said flatly.

On Thursday, Republican House leaders offered Obama and the Senate a six-week hike of the debt limit, pushing the deadline from Oct. 17 to around Thanksgiving. The offer did not, however, include a deal to reopen the shuttered federal government. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said earlier Thursday the deal was ""not going to happen.""

A statement from the White House said that, though no determination was made, Obama ""looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle.""

""The President’s goal remains to ensure we pay the bills we’ve incurred, reopen the government and get back to the business of growing the economy, creating jobs and strengthening the middle class,"" the statement said.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor hoped for ""a clearer path"" moving forward.

Even though business has been slow at Mr. Epperson’s sword and knife shop since tourists stopped visiting the historic Chickamauga battlefield, which closed on Tuesday because of the furlough of federal workers in the shutdown, he said the only thing that would weaken his support for Mr. Graves would be if the congressman caved in now. In that case, he might vote for a more conservative choice in the next Republican primary.

“If he backs off, then I would say absolutely I’d be inclined to look for someone else,” said Mr. Epperson, whose store flew a Don’t Tread on Me flag.

The Republican insistence in the House on tying financing of the federal government to dismantling the Affordable Care Act is being driven by a deeply conservative caucus from places like Mr. Graves’s 14th Congressional District, newly created by Georgia’s Republican-controlled Legislature."

White people eat it too, y'know. Just think of Colonel Sanders!

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race: sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up, diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup and you just can’t help it,” Marble said. “Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better BBQ and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down south and you — I love it.” Marble went on to mention how Mexicans eat vegetables in Mexico but stop eating healthily when they immigrate to the United States. “These things aren’t good for you,” she continued. “There’s so many attributing factors as to why these graphs look the way they do.”

Saying black people like fried chicken is an old stereotype. Saying black people and Latinos are poorthey like fried chicken is a new twist . But presented with statistics on racial disparities in the poverty rate, that was Colorado state Sen. Vicki Marble's explanation:Also in there somewhere, she mentioned a restaurant called ""Type II Chicken,"" which she had always wanted to eat at, and also that ""an idle mind is the devil's workshop."" She was rambling, is what I'm saying. Free-associating about the causes of poverty. And her free-associating led her to—actually kind of kicked off with—the idea that black people are genetically flawed and like fried chicken.

Marble's epic four minutes-plus ramble on poverty (which she began wrapping up only when she was cut off by the task force chair saying ""it seems like there's a repetition there and I think the point is made"") ended with a ""question"" aimed at suggesting that the War on Poverty had made things worse. So while she mentioned a whole lot of things along the way, her basic points were to blame either people of color or policies to combat poverty or both for high infant mortality and low life expectancy among poor black and Latino people. Which kind of contradicts her statement that she's ""saddened"" her comments were taken as disparaging and that ""I hope our work on this committee will offer real solutions to the health and financial challenges of our vulnerable populations,"" unless of course you think ""black people shouldn't eat so much fried chicken and the War on Poverty made things worse"" are real solutions."
http://news.yahoo.com/spending-cuts-unpopular-yet-not-101827897.html,,[],Spending cuts unpopular yet not set to go away,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said Monday the automatic spending cuts starting to take place across the federal government, with no end in sight, represent an ""empty victory"" for Republicans at odds with the party's priorities.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters it's remarkable some Republicans are calling the so-called ""sequester"" a win for the conservative tea party, or because Republicans stood up to the president, because the cuts go against usual GOP goals to increase defense spending and border security. He also said the cuts do nothing to address Republican priorities for long-term deficit reduction or tax reform.

Obama ""hopes that having achieved this empty victory, at least as they see it, the Republicans will understand that their goals are being unmet here,"" Carney told reporters at the White House. ""So not only are Americans suffering from this, regular folks, but their objectives are being unmet and there's an opportunity to change that dynamic.""

The Senate's Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday called those cuts modest and House Speaker John Boehner said he isn't sure they will hurt the economy. White House economic adviser Gene Sperling says the pain isn't that bad — yet.

After months of dire warnings, the deep budget cuts have started taking hold and there's no evidence officials are moving to reverse the $85 billion in reductions.

""This modest reduction of 2.4 percent in spending over the next six months is a little more than the average American experienced just two months ago, when their own pay went down when the payroll tax holiday expired,"" McConnell said.

""I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not,"" Boehner said. ""I don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work.""

But Sperling cautioned: ""On Day One, it will not be as harmful as it will be over time.""

Both parties cast blame on the other for the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts but gave little guidance on what to expect in the coming weeks. Republicans and Democrats pledged to retroactively undo the cuts, but signaled no hints as to how that process would start to take shape. Republicans insisted there would be no new taxes and Democrats refused to talk about any bargain without them.

Story continues

""That's not going to work,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. ""If we're going to increase revenue again, it's got to go to the debt with real entitlement reform and real tax reform when you actually lower rates. ... I'm not going to agree to any more tax increases that are going to go to increase more government.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said any tax increases were unacceptable.

""I'm not going to do any more small deals. I'm not going to raise taxes to fix sequestration. We don't need to raise taxes to fund the government,"" Graham said.

All of this comes ahead of a new, March 27 deadline to deal with the question of funding the government and a debt-ceiling clash coming in May.

Obama has phoned lawmakers but it isn't clear to what end and the White House would not say whom Obama is calling.

Administration officials planned to criticize the cuts in appearances with those affected by them; Education Secretary Arne Duncan, for instance, planned to appear with school leaders who faced a leaner budget.

""Well, no one can think that that's been a success for the president,"" said Mitt Romney, Obama's unsuccessful rival in November's election. ""He didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening.""

Obama and the Republicans have been fighting over federal spending since the opposition party regained control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections. The budget cuts were designed in 2011 to be so ruthless that both sides would be forced to find a better deal, but they haven't despite two years to find a compromise.

The $85 billion in cuts apply to the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But without a deal they will continue slashing government spending by about $1 trillion more over a 10-year period.

McConnell spoke to CNN's ""State of the Union."" Boehner was interviewed on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Sperling appeared on ABC's ""This Week,"" NBC and CNN. Ayotte appeared on ABC. Graham spoke with CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Romney was a guest on ""Fox News Sunday."""

The president is reprising his core message that what the economy needs is more federal spending on popular priorities such as infrastructure and education, not less.

And his stump speeches last week in Illinois, Missouri and Florida put Republicans on notice that he will blame them if a standoff over spending results in a government shutdown or a financial crisis over the federal debt ceiling this fall.

“Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan,” Obama lectured his opponents. “You can’t just be against something; you’ve got to be for something.”

But is that true?

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) doesn’t seem to think so. When asked recently about the glacial pace of legislation in the House, he responded: “We should not be judged on how many new laws we create. We ought to be judged on how many laws that we repeal.”

Boehner has a point. The number of bills a Congress passes is no guarantee that it’s doing important work. Roughly a third of the measures Congress passes are inconsequential actions such as renaming post offices.

But there’s also a flaw in Boehner’s argument. Although the current Congress is on pace to pass even fewer laws than the previous one (which set a modern record for lack of productivity), it hasn’t succeeded in repealing many laws either. The GOP-led House has voted nearly 40 times to repeal all or part of Obama’s healthcare law, for example, but hasn’t succeeded in overturning the act — although it has cut its funding.

Boehner has said he has no intention of shutting down the government during budget talks this fall, a move he believes would be counterproductive.

As one of his allies, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), put it last week: “The only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt. Shutting down the government is not in the best interests of the American people, and it makes you look politically irresponsible.”

But Boehner doesn’t always control the majority of his own caucus. Tea party radicals in both chambers of Congress are demanding a hard line, with some, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, promising to block any increase in the federal debt ceiling unless Obama’s healthcare law is repealed — a proposal another Republican, Sen. Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, called “the dumbest idea I ever heard.”

That’s no guarantee it won’t gain traction. Members of Congress in safely partisan districts — including some liberal Democrats as well as tea party conservatives — can be remarkably indifferent to broader public opinion. That’s one reason Congress’ approval rating dropped last week to an all-time low of 12% in the NBC News-Wall Street Journal Poll, far below Obama’s anemic rating of 45%.

It’s also well below the level Congress sank to last year, when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joked that its only remaining supporters were “paid staff and blood relatives.”

Obama hasn’t given up hope that he can spur legislators to action. He’s trying to win legislative battles on both immigration and the budget by striking bipartisan compromises in the Senate, which still has a sizable faction of Republicans who say they want to negotiate with the president.

Even as he denounced House Republicans last week, Obama doled out elaborate praise for a few, unnamed Republican senators who he said were working toward bipartisan compromises.

“The Senate is their only hope,” said Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “If you begin to get 70 or 75 votes for things in the Senate, then you get a different conversation; it becomes clear that there’s only one group of people [the House conservatives] standing in the way.”

Obama is doing everything he can to cast the opposition as being obstructionist. But will his return to the campaign trail have any real effect on Congress?

The too-easy answer is no. He’s given speeches like these before. He’s got no new proposals to unveil. And the House members who stand in his way aren’t worried about pressure from voters who support the president; they are more worried about primary challenges from even more conservative Republicans to their right. Speeches from the president aren’t going to change their minds.

But that’s not what Obama’s campaign is about. On one level, it’s about influencing votes in the Senate, not the House. And on another, it’s about making sure that if this fall’s budget battles do result in a government shutdown or, even worse, a financial crisis over the debt ceiling, the president and his party don’t get blamed.

Obama may look and sound as if he’s on the offensive, but his strategy has an awful lot of defense in it too.

The vote came two weeks after the Agriculture Department reported that 17.6 million households did not have enough to eat at some point in 2012 because they lacked the resources to put food on the table. It came two days after the Census Bureau reported that 15 percent of Americans, or 46.5 million people, live in poverty.

These numbers were basically unchanged from 2011, but in a growing economy steady rates of hunger and poverty amount, in effect, to backsliding. Cutting food stamps would accelerate the slide. Food stamps kept four million people out of poverty last year and kept millions more from falling deeper into poverty. Under the House Republican bill, many of these people would be impoverished.

The struggling middle class is also faring poorly. Though the unemployment rate dropped to a low of 7.8 percent last year from a high of 9.1 percent in 2011, median household income was virtually unchanged, at $51,017. In a healthy economy, income would rise when unemployment falls. But in today’s weak economy, much of the decline in the jobless rate is not due to new hiring, but to a shrinking work force — the very definition of a feeble labor market in which employed people work for years without raises and unemployed job seekers routinely end up in new jobs that pay less than their previous ones."

Bush, who presided over one of the most tumultuous periods in modern American history. Among liberals, Bush is considered a uniquely awful president, having led the United States into the ill-fated invasion and occupation of Iraq and having passed into law deep tax cuts that contributed to America’s present-day fiscal crunch.

Conservatives are more conflicted. Some dismiss him as a big-government conservative who failed to heed the wisdom of Goldwater and Reagan. Others, including many who served in the Bush administration, believe that as time passes, he will be lauded for his achievements. The complicated truth is that for all his flaws, George W. Bush had a better understanding of the challenges facing Republicans than most Obama-era conservatives. His rocky tenure is best understood as a testament to how difficult it will be to modernize the GOP.

Many hero-worshipped Bush during the early days of the war on terror, seeing him as a humble Christian leader who was always willing to take the hard road rather than the easy one. But as the public turned against the Iraq War, and as his efforts on behalf of Social Security reform and immigration reform engendered a fierce political backlash, a growing number of conservatives came to see Bush as an apostate who expanded Medicare and the federal role in education while failing to roll back the growth of government. The Bush administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis alienated conservatives even further, as the ominously named Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), engineered by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, struck many as a hardly-any-strings-attached Wall Street bailout. The Tea Party movement arose in no small part as a repudiation of Bush and his fitful efforts to transform the GOP.

Bush administration veterans, meanwhile, remain convinced that their president has gotten a bum rap. Keith Hennessey, who served as director of the National Economic Council during Bush’s second term, recently described Bush’s keen intelligence, and in doing so worked the former president’s liberal detractors into a frenzy. Among my friends and acquaintances who served in the Bush White House, the general view is that while Bush had solidly conservative instincts on domestic policy matters, he was hemmed in by the demands of the war on terror and the recalcitrance of Republican lawmakers. When the administration pressed for reform of Medicaid and, later on, changes in the way employer-sponsored health insurance would be treated in the tax code, congressional Republicans hardly ever gave him in inch. President Bush had little leverage, as he needed congressional Republicans to approve military spending and to defend his administration in the endless controversies over enemy combatants and surveillance that sapped its strength.

One of the ironies of the Bush presidency is that for all its failures, it was rooted in a clear-eyed diagnosis of the challenges facing Republicans. The end of the Cold War and the success of the Clinton-era Democrats’ centrism had badly undermined the GOP, which by the late 1990s risked irrelevance. Newt Gingrich’s efforts to shrink government were successfully countered by President Bill Clinton’s protean progressive centrism, and so George W. Bush, as governor of Texas, identified an alternative way forward.

During his first presidential run, Bush famously lambasted congressional Republicans for “balancing their budget on the backs of the poor,” and he touted his various efforts to raise literacy and math scores for black and Latino students in Texas. Bush recognized that Republicans needed to be seen not as opponents of government but rather as its reformers, and his moderation was essential to his razor-thin, hotly contested 2000 victory.

This is not to suggest that Bush had the right policy prescriptions all or even most of the time. There is a strong case that the Bush administration should have done much more to address the larger challenges facing less skilled workers.

Bush’s vision of an “ownership society,” which centered on increasing homeownership among low-income Americans, building on the work of his Democratic predecessor, seems in hindsight to have been ill-advised, particularly in the wake of the housing bust. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which aimed to empower religious organizations to take a bigger role in providing them, was always very limited in scope. The Bush-era tax cuts, arguably the centerpiece of the Bush domestic policy, were at best a mixed bag. The cuts in top marginal tax rates and capital gains may well have improved the incentives to work and invest at the top end, and the increase in the child tax credit benefited large numbers of middle-income families. But in the absence of a more ambitious overhaul of the tax code, it’s not clear that these gains were worth the loss of revenue.

Republicans would be wise to heed some of the political lessons of George W. Bush, positive and negative. The most obvious lesson is that the GOP won’t flourish unless it is seen as the defender of the economic interests of middle-income Americans. In 2000, Bush’s emphasis on K-12 education and tax relief was in tune with the voting public. By 2005, however, the Bush administration’s domestic policy was adrift, as it championed misbegotten, ill-explained Social Security reform just as defined benefit pensions were vanishing and middle-class squeeze became a national obsession.

And as James Capretta argues in “Recasting Conservative Economics”in the new issue ofNational Affairs, the right-of-center policy journal (where I am a contributing editor), Republicans need to tell a more compelling story about the Bush years and the 2008 financial crisis with which they will forever be associated. In 2012, it often seemed as though Mitt Romney had forgotten that Bush had ever been in office, and he struggled to articulate how and why his views differed from those of the former president.

The outlines of a compelling counternarrative of what went wrong during the crisis are emerging. One view, which has gained in popularity among right-of-center intellectuals but remains profoundly unpopular among the conservative rank-and-file, is that Senator John McCain was actually right to say that “the fundamentals of our economy are strong” in 2008 — the only problem was that the Federal Reserve failed to do enough to keep aggregate demand stable as the financial crisis took its toll. This has been dubbed a “market monetarist” interpretation of the Great Recession.

The conservative intelligentsia has also rallied around the position that the stability of the financial system can be attributed in part to the overreliance of America’s major financial institutions on debt rather than equity. Wall Street Republicans resist this interpretation, as more stringent equity requirements would reduce profits. Yet at least one prominent Republican lawmaker, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, has joined forces with the populist Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio to push for much higher equity requirements for banks with assets of more than $400 billion, a measure that will tend to curb the size of the largest banks. The idea is that higher equity requirements will help cushion banks against losses, thus forestalling future taxpayer bailouts.

One can imagine a Republican party that embraces tough equity requirements and market monetarism in the name of preventing future financial crises and catastrophic economic downturns. One can also imagine a GOP that takes George W. Bush’s lead by at least trying to craft a compelling message for middle-income voters. But in 2013, over four years after Bush left office, the GOP still doesn’t know what to make of his legacy, and the result is a party and a movement that is very much adrift.

John Stossel has said some pretty ridiculous crap over the years, but this might take the prize for the most insensitive, moronic thing that has ever come out of his piehole:

Fox Business host John Stossel on Thursday declared that government programs should be cut based on the false assertion that “no one” died of starvation in the Great Depression before the modern “welfare state.” [...] “And when people are needy you want them [to get] help,” Stossel agreed. “But think about the [Great] Depression. That was before there was any welfare state at all. How many people starved? No one.” “Right, good point,” Doocy agreed.

Really John? No one starved to death during the Great Depression? That's not how a lot of people remember those years.



In the Pennsylvania coal fields, three or four families crowded together in one-room shacks and lived on wild weeds. In Arkansas, families were found inhabiting caves. In Oakland, California, whole families lived in sewer pipes. President Herbert Hoover declared, ""Nobody is actually starving. The hoboes are better fed than they have ever been."" But in New York City in 1931, there were 20 known cases of starvation; in 1934, there were 110 deaths caused by hunger. There were so many accounts of people starving in New York that the West African nation of Cameroon sent $3.77 in relief.

We will never know how many people died as a result of starvation or illness related to malnutrition during the years of the Great Depression because there were no official Federal Government statistics for that era. [Deleted reference to Russian researcher] However, there is enough anecdotal evidence that people did starve during the Great Depression, and that contrary to what Mr. Stossel asserts now, and President Hoover asserted then, people did in fact die from lack of adequate food intake, otherwise known as death by starvation. We certainly have a photographic record of people who look very thin and malnourished as evidence that starvation was a reality for many people during the Depression:

We also know that food riots broke out in many states. Well fed people, or even adequately fed people do not riot over food. Hungry, starving people on the other hand do:

Feb. 1931 ""Food riots"" begin to break out in parts of the U.S. In Minneapolis, several hundred men and women smashed the windows of a grocery market and made off with fruit, canned goods, bacon, and ham. One of the store's owners pulled out a gun to stop the looters, but was leapt upon and had his arm broken. The ""riot"" was brought under control by 100 policemen. Seven people were arrested.

And another food riot incident, this time in Oklahoma:

From the New York Times, January 31, 1931. Food Rioters Raid Oklahoma City Store; 500 Dispersed by the Police With Tear Gas OKLAHOMA CITY. Jan. 20 (AP)-A crowd of men and women, shouting that they were hungry and jobless, raided a grocery store near the City Hall today. Twenty-six of the men were arrested. Scores loitered near the city jail following the arrests, but kept well out of range of fire hoses made ready for use in case of another disturbance. The police tonight broke up a second meeting of about one hundred unemployed men and arrested Francis Owens, alleged head of the ""Oklahoma City Unemployed Council,"" who was accused of instigating the raid.

People starved Mr. Stossel. They went hungry. Some of them, we don't know how many, died, either from the direct effects of starvation or from malnutrition and illnesses related to their lowered resistance to disease caused by, yes, starvation. And guess what? More people would be dying today if we didn't have social welfare programs such as SNAP (i.e., food stamps) to prevent poor people, and the unemployed from going without food. Yet you want to eliminate these programs. In fact you stated that you wanted to eliminate the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, among others.

You cut whole departments,” the Fox Business host explained. “Why do we have a Commerce Department? Commerce just happens! Agriculture, farmers do that! You don’t need bureaucrats.” He added that the Department of Education was also unnecessary. “Isn’t that part of what the government does in a lot of people minds?” Fox News host Steve Doocy asked. “They need to help people rather than let people help themselves?”

Guess what you left off your list? The entire Department of Defense. Well hell's bells, why do we need a wasteful military establishment when we have an armed militia available? Using your logic, our military forces are completely unnecessary, because individuals can take care of that themselves when it comes to national defense. Just like social welfare programs are unnecessary. Please let me know, from your libertarian perspective, why the largest Department in the Federal Government and the one whose elimination, or even significant down-sizing, would solve most of our debt issues going forward is left off your list. I'm dying to find out why you failed to mention it, though you have no problem with killing off social welfare programs that millions of your fellow citizens depend upon.

UPDATE: Further evidence of the effects of starvation among the poor in the United States during the Great Depression era and the years leading up to it (i.e., before the development of our current socialist hellhole welfare state) can be found at the Link (h/t to mollyd from the comments.

UPDATE 2: Stossel has issued a classic nopology:

This morning, on Fox and Friends, I said ""no one"" starved during the Depression. I was almost certainly wrong. During the Depression, the governor of Pennsylvania wrote, ""we know that starvation is widespread, but no one has enumerated the starving."" However, all other governors who wrote to Congress, 43 of them, sent letters saying that they knew of no starvation in their states. Historians Steven Mintz and Sara McNeil wrote that there were hundreds of deaths in NYC alone. However, hunger was rare enough that health in America generally improved during the Depression, according to a National Academy of Sciences study [...] There's no doubt that there was privation of all sorts in the 30's - when America was much poorer. But today's reduction in malnutrition is almost entirely a result of greater prosperity, thanks to our relatively free market. Our unsustainable welfare state causes poverty (by rewarding dependency) as often as it relieves it. Stopping government handouts to people like ME won't lead to starvation.



Stossel forgets to mention that part of that ""improvement"" was related to advances in medicine, and part only looked like improvement, since the 1918-1920 ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic which killed millions skewed the statistics by making the pre-Roaring Twenties look very deadly in comaparison. He also forgets that under FDR, federal funding for vaccinations increased significantly under FERA (the Federal Emergency Relief Administration) which in all likelihood led to better health outcomes and fewer childhood deaths."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/04/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html,2013-01-04 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Debt ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club,"Brinksmanship over the debt ceiling could make the fiscal cliff standoff look like child's play.

Right after the House passed the fiscal cliff compromise, President Obama said, ""I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed.""

But Republicans continue to insist that any increase in the debt ceiling must be exceeded by spending cuts and entitlement reforms.

""[The president] doesn't even want to have a discussion about it because he knows this is where we have leverage,"" Sen. Pat Toomey said on MSNBC earlier this week. ""We absolutely have to have this fight over the debt limit.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that Republicans in coming months will ""force the conversation that Washington needs to have"" about spending cuts if need be.

The country's borrowing has already hit its legal limit -- currently $16.394 trillion. As a result the Treasury can't borrow any more money in the markets, so it has begun to use ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure that the government can continue to pay all its bills in full and on time. But those measures can only buy about two months' of headroom.

If the ceiling isn't raised by late February or early March, the United States runs the risk of defaulting on its obligations because the Treasury would no longer have enough money available to pay all the country's bills.

Related: Fiscal cliff deal leave big issues pending

To cover a year's worth of borrowing, the debt ceiling may need to be raised by close to $1 trillion.

Obama and McConnell agree on one thing: They both say they have no interest in resolving the debt ceiling debate at the very last minute the way they did in 2011, the last time they went through the exercise.

That debate was so bruising that the United States was downgraded after the fact by Standard & Poor's.

The government's borrowing rates remained very low throughout. But the Government Accountability Office nevertheless estimates that they were higher during the standoff than they would have been otherwise. The result: An additional $19 billion in interest payments will be owed over the next decade, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

There's a good chance the debate this year will go down to the wire if not past it.

""The two groups are farther apart than they've ever been,"" said Steve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

If Congress does not approve a debt ceiling increase, some believe the president could invoke the 14th Amendment, which states: ""The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.""

By doing so, the argument goes, Obama could direct the Treasury secretary to keep borrowing in order to pay the country's bills in full.

The White House has indicated that's not a strategy the president would employ.

It would be risky politically -- there could be moves to impeach Obama.

And the country could still be hurt financially. By invoking the 14th Amendment, the president could spark a constitutional crisis -- not an affirming message to send markets already questioning Washington's ability to get beyond its dysfunction.

And yet, it's not yet clear what else the president could do to contain the damage.

""It is hard to imagine any Treasury secretary, or any president, allowing himself -- or herself -- to be the first to default on the public debt,"" said Joseph Minarik, research director at the Committee for Economic Development and a former chief economist at the White House Budget Office.

""That having been said, no one knows what other options lurk in the file cabinets of the attorneys in the Treasury. They aren't talking ... And I wouldn't have a very high opinion of anyone who did."""

In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot. The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months.

I also saw that Amy Goodman included the Moral Monday protests in yesterday's Democracy Now broadcast. As this movement is building in North Carolina, the national attention it is getting, and that it is bringing upon the actions of the Republican legislature and governor, is growing as well. This is, after all, not just a North Carolina story.

This is a part of the story that is unfolding in Texas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and other states where the more extreme elements of the Republican party have gained power on the state level and are exacting laws that, to use the words of the Times editorial board, are doing grotesque damage; and where the people are standing up and pushing back. This is a national story, and a national movement. We are bringing awareness to the people of this country to what happens when Republicans are given power at the state level; and we are encouraging them to think a bit more deeply, and to take action.

For more on these protests, see today's diary by Leslie Salzillo and yesterday's diary by MsSpentyouth.

Thank you New York Times and Amy Goodman for increasing national attention; and thanks to everyone who is supporting this movement, if North Carolina, in Texas, in every state where folks are standing up and pushing back.

These are activities for which donations aren’t eligible for tax exemptions or donor confidentiality.

What scandal, you ask? It’s not the bogus scandal about the IRS targeting “tea party” and “patriot” groups for special scrutiny. It’s the real scandal that these groups or any others were trying to get tax breaks and anonymity for political donations in the first place.

Unsurprisingly, conservative groups instantly put up a big squeal about the IRS rules; after all, they’re the ones who have exploited the murky old rules most assiduously. “These proposed new regulations put the 1st Amendment rights of Americans at even greater risk,” said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the conservative American Center for Law and Justice, a big defender of the right of political donors to masquerade as public-spirited philanthropists and remain anonymous to boot. But make no mistake: Organizations across the political spectrum flouted the law, and they were all in the wrong.

The IRS proposal would dispel the murkiness that allowed illicit, anonymous multimillion-dollar political contributions to fly under the radar. It would define “candidate-related political activity” in detail, and make clear that it’s not eligible for the tax exemption and anonymity granted to nonpolitical activities by so-called nonprofit “social welfare organizations,” known formally as 501(c)4’s.

Advertisement

The IRS rules still leave one important issue unresolved. That’s the question of how much political activity a “social welfare” C4 can engage in at all, and why the figure shouldn’t be zero. The agency awaits further comments on that question.

A bit of history is useful here. As we reported last year, political operatives loved 501(c)4’s as vehicles for political contributions for two reasons: Their income was tax exempt, and their donors could remain unidentified. The problem was that such organizations were supposed to be devoted primarily, if not exclusively, to “social welfare.”

We observed in a second column that typical C4’s as envisioned by the IRS were religious groups; cultural, educational and veterans organizations; homeowners associations; and volunteer fire departments. Instead, C4 designation was claimed by organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, which spent nearly $86 million on political activity in 2012, according to ProPublica.

Over the years, the IRS had ruled that nonprofits could keep their C4 status as long as their political activities didn’t exceed 49% of their work. But the agency didn’t define political activity very clearly. It was left up to rank-and-file agents to figure out what side of the line an organization was on. Flash forward to the 2010 and 2012 elections, and the beleaguered troops tried to winnow out violators by screening for organizations with the terms “tea party,” “patriots” and, as it turned out, “progressive” and “green” in their names.

This led to the famous “IRS scandal,” a bogus claim by Republicans, especially Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), that the Obama administration was “targeting” tea party groups for harassment. Despite Issa’s reputation for shooting first and asking questions never, this brouhaha held the stage in Washington for months -- even now it’s got holdout believers in the GOP.

The IRS guidelines, which are still subject to formal review, will do much to take guesswork out of the enforcement effort. They’d define “candidate-related political activity” as, among other things, “communications that expressly advocate for a clearly identified political candidate or candidates of a political party,” or that are made within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary and “clearly identify a candidate or political party.”

Also included would be grants to PACs, Super PACS, and other political advocacy groups, and voter registration drives and “get-out-the-vote” drives.

It’s worth noting that none of these activities are considered illegal or barred -- so much for the claim that freedom of speech hangs in the balance. But they’re not tax-exempt, and henceforth no one should be able to pursue them and weasel around the campaign finance disclosure laws. The message finally is becoming clear: You want to spend money on politics, fine. You want to do it in secret by claiming to be a “social welfare” group, no dice."

But by seeking to establish clearer limits for campaign-related spending by groups claiming tax exemption, the I.R.S. proposal could have an enormous impact on some of the biggest groups, forcing them to either limit their election spending or register as openly political organizations, such as super PACs.

A spokesman for Crossroads declined to comment, as did officials at other political nonprofits.

Nick Ryan, the founder of the American Future Fund, which spent at least $25 million on political advertising last year, said, “Unfortunately, it appears that the same bureaucrats that attempted to suppress the speech of conservative groups in recent years has now put together new rules that apply to (c)4 groups but do not apply to liberal groups like labor unions.”

“I wish I could say I am surprised,” Mr. Ryan added, “but I am not.” The final rules are unlikely to be issued until after the 2014 election, after a public comment period.

The administration’s proposal would apply to nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)4 of the tax code, which are granted tax exemption in exchange for devoting themselves to the promotion of “social welfare.”

Under current rules, promoting social welfare can include some political activity, along with unlimited amounts of lobbying. Some of the largest political nonprofits — like Americans for Prosperity, backed by the conservative philanthropists Charles and David Koch — have used that provision to justify significant expenditures on political ads.

But under the new proposal, a broad swath of political work would be classified as “candidate-related political activity” and explicitly excluded from the agency’s definition of social welfare. Those activities include advertisements that mention a candidate within 60 days of an election as well as grants to other organizations making candidate-related expenditures.

“Depending on the details, this could be dramatic,” said Marcus S. Owens, a former chief of the I.R.S.’s exempt organizations division."

Story highlights Some tense moments not long into the 21-hour speaking marathon; then Rubio showed up Cruz had mental breaks, but couldn't leave the Senate floor to use the restroom or eat Texas Republican put aside his Ostrich boots and wore sneakers; staff supplied speaking material Cruz drank ""very little water""; Other marathon Senate speeches featured colorful stories, too

(CNN) —

The critical moment for Sen. Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night.

The Texas Republican’s suit was still crisp, despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the Senate floor aimed at derailing Obamacare.

But until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Without more help, Lee’s aides weren’t sure how long the effort could continue.

Then Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, arrived. It was a sign that they’d get the bodies they needed for the long haul.

“When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day),” said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips.

Lee was on or near the floor all night. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held the floor for 12 hours in March, jumped in. Even ideological opponent Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute Cruz’ points.

That gave Cruz some time for mental breaks even though he couldn’t leave the floor to eat, use the restroom or do anything else.

For material, staff pulled together binders of articles, talking points and documents that could be used to fill time. And as social networks heated up, aides ferried in a stream of tweets for Cruz to read.

Bryan Perry/CNN Facebook users mentioned 'Obamacare' 300,000 times in the U.S. and 360,000 times globally, according to data from the site. Here is a breakdown of those Facebook users.

But to the big and less comfortable question: How did he manage physically?

Good, pliable shoes, for a start. Cruz left his trademark Ostrich boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing.

No food. Senate rules ban anyone from eating on the chamber floor. So that is easy.

Dehydration. CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett asked Cruz how he stood for more than 21 hours without having to use the men’s room.

“Drinking very little water,” he replied.

That surely is part of it. But we do not know if anything else was involved, as has been the case in the past.

Bryan Perry/CNN 'Green Eggs' and Facebook users

The Senate’s marathon speech record-holder, the late Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, reportedly set up a bucket in the Senate cloakroom next to the chamber and used it while keeping one foot on the Senate floor, so as to retain his speaking position.

Former Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee used some kind of bag during his portion of a filibuster, according to an oral history from former parliamentarian Floyd Riddick. It did not end well.

“That’s always a defining issue, how much stamina a person has,” said Senate Historian Don Ritchie, who recorded the oral history with Riddick and says there is a tradition of senators using a contraption for bodily functions during speech-a-thons.

Cruz was on the Senate floor just 1 hour and 41 minutes short of a day.

“I don’t know of any special thing he used,” said Phillips. “And he didn’t indicate there was anything.”

Then he paused.

“That’s one of those things that is so personal that there are only a couple of people who know. And they will probably take it to their graves.”

Cruz’ office did not respond to CNN’s request for more details."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/08/1260564/-Republicans-chicken-out-on-tax-reform,2013-12-08 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']",Republicans chicken out on tax reform,"As TPC's Howard Gleckman explained the numbers:



The tax cuts described in Ryan's budget would generate a huge windfall for high-income taxpayers. On average, households would get a cut of $3,000. But those in the top 0.1 percent of income, who make $3.3 million or more, would get a whopping $1.2 million on average-a 20 percent increase in their after-tax income.

To put it another way, each of the Ryan budget budgets backed by House and Senate Republicans over the last three years inevitably will produce both oceans of red ink and a Treasury-draining payday for the rich. Unless, that is, Republicans can identify which tax breaks and loopholes they would limit or end to prevent those two certainties from coming to pass.

And from the beginning, that's precisely what they've been too cowardly to do.

As the Washington Post showed (chart above), the trillion-plus dollars in annual tax expenditures is now larger than Uncle Sam's take from the income tax each year. Much of the estimated $1.3 trillion in annual tax expenditures in 2015 (a figure almost double the size of the last fiscal year's budget deficit) benefits working and middle income Americans. For example, the home mortgage interest deduction was worth $89 billion in 2011. Tax-deferred 401K accounts cost the Treasury $63 billion that same year. The Earned Income Tax Credit had a similar price tag. It's no wonder, as the Post concluded, ""ever-increasing tax breaks for U.S. families eclipse benefits for special interests.""

So which ones would John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and company curb or close? We're still waiting for an answer.

Matthew Yglesias mocked the dodge at the center of Ryan's 2012 budget, the same one he used before and since:



Thirteen pages dedicated to explaining his vision for revenue-neutral tax reform. And even so he manages to not name a single tax deduction that he's planning to eliminate. Home mortgage interest deduction? I dunno. Electric vehicle tax credit? I dunno. Deductibility of state and local income taxes? I dunno.

We're talking about a lot of loophole-closing. As Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center points out, to make his numbers work Mr. Ryan would, by 2022, have to close enough loopholes to yield an extra $700 billion in revenue every year. That's a lot of money, even in an economy as big as ours. So which specific loopholes has Mr. Ryan, who issued a 98-page manifesto on behalf of his budget, said he would close? None. Not one. He has, however, categorically ruled out any move to close the major loophole that benefits the rich, namely the ultra-low tax rates on income from capital. (That's the loophole that lets Mitt Romney pay only 14 percent of his income in taxes, a lower tax rate than that faced by many middle-class families.)

That same month, Paul Krugman tried to decipher which deductions and tax breaks are actually in the mystery meat that is Paul Ryan's budgetary dog food. As he explained in "" Pink Slime Economics "":

Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe on March 20, 2012, Congressman Ryan declared he would ""get rid of the special interest loopholes, special deductions, lower everybody's tax rates, bring in at least as much revenue to the government but grow the economy and create jobs, and get spending under control so we can pay off this debt."" But when host Joe Scarborough asked, ""Which one of those [loopholes] do you eliminate,"" Ryan decided to duck and cover:



""We want to do this in the light of day and in front of everybody. So the Ways and Means Committee, which is in charge of the tax system, sent us the plan here, which is a 10 and 25 percent bracket for individuals and small businesses, and then they want to have hearings and, in light of day, show how they would go about doing this.""

""That's what the Ways & Means Committee is supposed to do. That's not the job of the Budget Committee,"" Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. ""What we're saying is, we want to do this in the light of day, not in some backroom deal. We want to have hearings in the Ways & Means Committee that Chairman Dave Camp has already started that work, to say what tax benefits should go.""

Both chairmen refused to say what they supported or what tax loopholes they'd propose closing. Camp focused instead on areas of agreement. ""There are so many good (tax) simplification policies that we agree on,"" he said. Asked whether they'll propose limiting the mortgage-interest deduction that homeowners now enjoy, Camp acknowledged that two-thirds of Americans don't itemize their federal taxes and said that perhaps a complete rethink was in order.

Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation just days later, Ryan again claimed that ""We're proposing to keep revenues where they are, but to clear up all the special interest loopholes, which are uniquely enjoyed by higher income earners, in exchange for lower rates for everyone."" But he once again pleaded the Fifth when asked which ""special interest loopholes"" he would do away with:Almost two years later, Camp won't publicly say what tax benefits would go, either. As McClatchy reported in June on the progress he and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) had made:A complete rethink, indeed. During the 2012 campaign, Paul Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney similarly called for closing tax loopholes to offset his huge tax cuts for the wealthy. For months, Mitt Romney had performing the same trick as Ryan, promising only that the ""1 percent keeps paying the current share they're paying or more."" His economic adviser Glenn Hubbard even confirmed Romney's cowardice, explaining ""it is not his intention to take on any specific deduction or exclusion and eliminate it.""

Unfortunately for the Republican ticket, nonpartisan analysts trying to model Romney's proposals did. And the picture they painted wasn't a pretty one. Even after assuming the closure of tax loopholes and deductions which disproportionately favor the rich, the Tax Policy Center forecast that President Romney would end up cutting taxes for the richest five percent of earners while increasing the tax bill for the other 95 percent of Americans. It's no wonder Ezra Klein concluded that ""'broadening the base and lowering the rates' is anti-family tax reform,"" adding:



""The size of the tax cut he's proposing for the rich is larger than all of the tax expenditures that go to the rich put together. As such, it is mathematically impossible for him to keep his promise to make sure the top one percent keeps paying the same or more.""

""So I haven't laid out all of the details about how we're going to deal with each deduction, so I think it's kind of interesting for the groups to try and score it, because frankly it can't be scored, because those kinds of details will have to be worked out with Congress, and we have a wide array of options.""

""Let's be clear on this: A tax plan that can't be scored because it doesn't include sufficient details is not a plan. It's a gesture towards a plan, or a statement of intended direction, or perhaps an unusually wonky daydream. But it's not a plan.""

""What would be best is a fundamental reform of the tax code that lowers rates, broadens the base, makes America's business competitive again, and reduces the burden imposed by taxes on work and investment.""

Lawmakers had no idea how they'd make the math work. It would be a mammoth task, forcing them to dig into big, popular middle-class tax breaks.

Romney stuck to his line, assuring voters those gains for the gilded class weren't true because no one could predict what his plan would do. During an appearance on CNBC , he went for the full ostrich:In response, the Post's Klein could only shake his head:It's certainly not plan, but instead a fraud. Yet just days after Barack Obama vanquished his Republican opponent, Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt suggested the president make the Republican scam his own. ""Look at ways to increase revenue by one growing the economy,"" he said on Fox News. ""And two, maybe look at the tax code, just like Governor Romney suggested, you look at the tax code and increase revenue without increasing taxes."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed:But by September, Cantor didn't even include tax reform in his list of priorities for House Republicans. As for Paul Ryan, next week he has a compromise budget proposal to work on with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, a task he must complete to avoid another embarrassing government shutdown for the GOP. And after that, he has a 2016 presidential campaign to contemplate. All of which means the Republicans' three-year tax reform scheme is, at best, on the backburner. As Politico concluded, Camp and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan did not make it any easier on themselves:Or, to put it another way, tax reform is dead. Long live tax reform."

It's easy for people, even politicians, to get very personally invested in negotiations with people they don't particularly like. At this point, Barack Obama and John Boehner do not particularly like each other. It may be the case that Boehner doesn't want to default and doesn't even want the government shut down. But he -- and others in the Republican Party -- are also getting angrier at what they see as the White House's condescending refusal to even sit down and talk. It wouldn't be that hard for Boehner to convince himself that he's made a more than reasonable effort to reach a deal and that it's Obama who's standing in the way."

Obama first brought up the issue with Lindsay Graham in the context of the Collins proposal. Obama and Reid were of the same mind on the crappy Paul Ryan House GOP proposal that it was an insulting non-starter. Regarding the Senate GOP proposal, Obama was willing to entertain some concessions in order to replace the sequester but Reid prevailed to push Obama to remain philosophically consistent and convinced the President that the Collins proposal was a bit of a Trojan horse. Reid now has a few days to run the show to play bad cop to Obama's good cop. Neither cop wants to do business with the House GOP. Boehner is only too happy to sit on the sidelines and watch football this weekend. The Senate GOP feels embattled but doesn't think it can trust the House to do anything.

Mitch McConnell has willingly accepted the role of GOP negotiator and has openly stated that he intends to reach a compromise with Democrats. This is potentially significant because McConnell is more likely to bend to the Democrats because he faces a credible Democratic opponent in the 2014 Senate elections (Grimes) and Democratic Governor Steve Beshear is almost single-handedly validating Obamacare through the Kynect program. He also doesn't seem to be too threatened by his tea party opponent (Bevin)in the GOP Senate primary (a harbinger of things to come in red states in 2014?)

In addition, Chuck Todd reported that when McConnell recently tried to sell the sequester as GOP success to base GOP voters, it did not move them very much. Therefore, McConnell may be more willing to jettison the sequester than we realize, particularly since it was hurting the GOP long before the shutdown and because most of the year 2 sequester cuts will fall on the military.

So Harry Reid has a shot to get an agreement that extends the debt ceiling for a longer period (6 months to 1 year), ends the shutdown with a shorter CR and/or replaces the sequester. If Reid fails, he may be able to push the Overton window far enough to the left where the GOP might feel that simply passing a clean CR and debt ceiling increase at current levels might be the best solution.

The problem, of course, is the House of Representatives and particularly Paul Ryan. The good news is that Obama's firm rejection of the House GOP offer forced the dark lord out of his crypt and into the open, and everyone in DC saw him for what he is: a maniacal power hungry nihilist who values leverage above all and would rather see the country default than to hand a victory of any kind to Democrats. This man is a sociopath and must be stopped.

Ryan seems, in my view, concerned that Boehner might bring up a Senate passed bill and let it pass in the House with Democratic votes. That's why he was so angry and boisterous in the House meeting. He wants to whip the GOP House to unite behind him, which is a road to nowhere. Ryan has made it clear that he will deny Boehner a majority of GOP votes. The tea party will be aligned with Ryan on this particular vote. Boehner controls at most only 20-25 votes. Ultimately this is all about Boehner. If he does undercut Ryan, he can say that he is acting for the good of the country and the survival of his party. That will open him up to recriminations within the GOP and their media and perhaps a leadership challenge.

The Democrats will be on solid political ground to pass the bill they want in the Senate and then force the House to deal with the issue and absorb most of the blame should they fail to act to avoid a default. This requires Democrats to be unafraid of the GOP taking the country into default if Ryan has his way. Democrats cannot save the GOP from itself, even if not stepping in results in a default because of the GOP's inability to govern.

For his part, President Obama will need to resist the temptation to offer anything of substance to the GOP. Boehner will come calling again, but he cannot deliver anything approaching a majority of the GOP caucus so he should be ignored. Boehner simply has to be told to let whatever bill comes out of the Senate have a floor vote.

The risk of default remains high mainly because of Paul Ryan's unwillingness to let go of hostages and the tactic of hostage taking. However, with many GOPers seeing the writing on the wall, the Democrats have an equally reasonable chance to impose their will and obtain the right result. Stay tuned."

[T]hose who want to stay out of poverty have the best chances of doing so if they graduate from high school, don’t get addicted to drugs and alcohol and don’t get pregnant out of wedlock.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) recently attended a Rotary Club meeting in my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. During this meeting he spoke on several topics, but what was most notable were his comments about poverty and how to avoid it Keep in mind this is coming from a man whose net worth is well over $23 Million so he really knows what he is talking about. Of course as a guy who has lived paycheck to paycheck I have some advice I would like to add to Sen. Johnson’s on how to avoid poverty.

Sen. Johnson giving advice about how to avoid poverty is about as useless as a parka and electric socks at Lambeau Field on the 4th of July. He has no idea of how it feels to have a job yet you still have to lurch from paycheck to paycheck. What it is like to eat ramen noodles for weeks on end because you don’t have the money to go grocery shopping. He has no idea of what it is like knowing you will be homeless if you miss just one paycheck.

It must be nice to live such a simple life like Sen. Johnson. A life where the solution to avoiding poverty is pretty much, don’t fuck up, ever. Too bad it isn’t that simple in the real world where you can do everything right and still struggle just because of who your parents were or because of random chance."

USA TODAY

The partial federal government shutdown begins Day 14 amid even greater anxiety. The nation could face its first-ever default if the debt ceiling is not raised by Thursday. What you need to know on Monday, Oct. 14:

Shutdown, debt deal hangs on Senate leaders

It's come down to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and his GOP counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Many on Capitol Hill are looking at talks between the two Senate leaders as the last — and best — hope for a deal that would end the government shutdown and raise the debt limit of $16.7 trillion. The two leaders asserted control over negotiations to end the stalemate on Saturday, when it became clear that House Speaker John Boehner could not strike a deal with the White House on his own. Reid said he was ""optimistic,"" while Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Republicans are ""very unified"" behind McConnell.

Mount Rushmore will reopen today

In one of several deals between a state and the federal government, Mount Rushmore will welcome visitors again Monday. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day for the national memorial to four of the nation's presidents to stay open. At least a dozen businesses or organizations are partnering with the state to pay the operating costs. The Statute of Liberty and Grand Canyon have also reopened. With the National Park Service one of the hardest-hit federal agencies in the shutdown, the Obama administration announced last week it would allow states to pay to reopen any of the country's 401 properties managed by the NPS.

Visitors turned away from Normandy cemeteries

While there's good news for some visitors to historic sites in the United States, the same can't be said for visitors who want to pay their respects at the final resting place of U.S. troops who died during the invasion of Normandy, France, in World War II. The Wall Street Journal reports visitors are being turned away from the Normandy cemeteries because ""U.S. war memorials on foreign soil ... answer to the federal government in Washington.""

Merchant Marine Academy cancels classes for the week

President Obama was to be briefed Sunday on the status of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. Rear Adm. James Helis posted a note on the academy's website Friday saying classes would resume ""no earlier than Oct. 21"" because of the government shutdown. The academy had already moved up its fall break because of the budget impasse in Washington. The shutdown's impact is ""most severe"" because the Merchant Marine Academy's faculty and staff are almost all civilians who have been furloughed — unlike the other service academies.

Social Security recipients await news of increase

Remember that Labor Department inflation report for September, the one that was supposed to come out Wednesday? It holds the key to just how small the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be for millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees. Preliminary figures suggest a benefit increase of 1.5% come January, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. The COLA is usually announced in October. Social Security benefits have continued in the shutdown.

Thomas E. Mann is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. They are the authors of “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism.”

Our political system was not designed to be efficient, but it wasn’t supposed to be self-destructive, either. After a near-default on the public debt and a “fiscal cliff” that threatened a new recession, we are facing another man-made crisis: the sequester, across-the-board cuts in discretionary domestic and defense spending that began Friday and will extend over a decade. Let’s separate fact from fiction about the sequester and its impact.

1. Blame Obama — the sequester was his White House’s idea.

Identifying the origins of the sequester has become a major Washington fight. Bob Woodward weighed in recently with a Washington Post op-ed making the case that the idea began in the White House. He’s right in a narrow sense, mainly because he focuses on the middle of the 2011 negotiations between Obama and Republican lawmakers. If you look before and after, a different picture emerges.

In our view, what happened is quite straightforward: In 2011, House Republican leaders used their new majority to force their priorities on the Democratically controlled Senate and the president by holding the debt limit hostage to demands for deep and immediate spending cuts. After negotiations between Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner failed (Eric Cantor recently took credit for scuttling a deal), the parties at the eleventh hour settled on a two-part solution: immediate discretionary spending caps that would result in cuts of almost $1 trillion over 10 years and the creation of a “supercommittee” tasked with reducing the 2012-2021 deficit by another $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. If the supercommittee didn’t broker a deal, automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over the next decade — the sequester — would go into effect. The sequester was designed to be so potentially destructive that the supercommittee would surely reach a deal to avert it.

The sequester’s origins can’t be blamed on one person — or one party. Republicans insisted on a trigger for automatic cuts; Jack Lew, then the White House budget director, suggested the specifics, modeled after a sequester-like mechanism Congress used in the 1980s, but with automatic tax increases added. Republicans rejected the latter but, at the time, took credit for the rest. Obama took the deal to get a debt-ceiling increase. But he never accepted the prospect that the sequester would occur, nor did he ever agree to take tax increases off the table.

2. At least the automatic cuts will reduce runaway spending and begin to control the deficit.

What runaway spending? The $787 billion stimulus was a one-time expenditure that has come and gone. Under current law, not including the sequester, non-defense discretionary spending as a share of the economy will shrink to a level not seen in 50 years. Defense spending grew substantially over the past decade, but that pattern has slowed and will soon end. Additional reductions must be achieved intelligently, tied to legitimate national security needs.

Across-the-board cuts can have perverse effects on deficits; as services are cut, the fees users pay for those services are lost. For example, sequester-driven furloughs of air-traffic controllers will lead to the number of flights being reduced.

The annual budget deficit is projected to fall by almost 50 percent in 2013 compared with the height of the recession. Reducing the deficit over the long term requires going where the money is — boosting economic growth, controlling health-care costs and increasing revenue to handle the expense of an aging population. Deeper discretionary-spending cuts are counterproductive; immediate cuts, as Europe has made, could lead to a recession and bigger deficits.

3. The amounts are so small, they won’t hurt much.

The size of the automatic cuts this fiscal year, $85 billion, looks trivial compared with our $3.7 trillion federal budget. As Post columnist George F. Will has written: “Head for the storm cellar — spending will be cut 2.3 percent! Or: Washington chain-saw massacre — we must scrape by on 97.7 percent of current spending!”

It seems like 2.3 percent of savings can be found without inflicting harm. But that 2.3 percent is applied to only a small part of the budget. And seven months, not 12, remain in this fiscal year to make the cuts. With little discretion about trimming areas such as aviation and food safety, layoffs and furloughs will interrupt services vital to the economy and public health. As disruptive as the first year of the sequester would be, imagine what a decade of automatic cuts would produce.

4. The cuts are so large, they will be catastrophic.

The administration has released state-by-state estimates of the sequester and highlighted the cutbacks most likely to harm or inconvenience the public. The reality is not so immediate or dramatic. The damage will accumulate in less visible ways, as irrational reductions in public spending impede economic growth and job creation; reduce investments in education, infrastructure and scientific research; and further disrupt the routines of a modern democracy. The longer the sequester remains in place, the more harm is inflicted.

5. This fight is all about money.

Those who relish using a sequester — some House Republicans, along with a gaggle of radio talk-show hosts, editorial writers and cable television commentators — say this is one small step toward reducing U.S. deficits and debt. But if the goal were really debt reduction, it would be easy to get a bipartisan deal that would lower the debt enough to meet the original target set by the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, with roughly a third coming from revenue. The insistence on deep discretionary-spending reductions while calling for even deeper tax cuts shows that the sequester is not about money but about taking a meat ax to government as we know it.

The tactics to achieve that goal — from the sequester to the threat to shut down the government in late March to the next confrontation over the debt limit — have made basic governance a huge challenge for the executives managing programs and agencies, nearly all of whom lack a clear sense of how much money they will have from one day to the next. Planning, recruiting personnel and drafting long-term contracts have become impossible in areas from cybersecurity to embassy security to medical research to homeland security, damaging not industries rife with waste, fraud and abuse but critical services. If only it were all about money!

Five myths about the 112th Congress

Let’s just say it: The Republicans are the problem

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/25/1189635/-Eric-Cantor-will-propose-Federal-Law-that-Ends-Overtime-Pay-for-hourly-workers,2013-02-25 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Eric Cantor will propose Federal Law that Ends Overtime Pay for hourly workers,"In 2003, when the Republicans tried to end the requirement that hourly workers get paid overtime, they tried to sell it in good-old fashioned GOP Propaganda Minster: Frank Luntz terms. They used words like ""Family Flex time"" ... and ... ""work longer hours so you can have half a day with your family, maybe""

Cantor's goal in allowing the interview with the New Yorker Magazine, was to re-market the GOP draconian policies.

Since the 2012 elections, the Republicans have been divided between those who believe their policies are the problem and those who believe they just need better marketing—between those who believe they need to make better pizza and those who think they just need a more attractive box. Cantor, who is known among his colleagues as someone with strategic intelligence and a knack for political positioning, argues that it’s the box. Cantor was happy to make himself available for several long interviews. He persistently struck a diplomatic note and mentioned again and again how much he looked forward to working with Obama, a position that he said he’s been articulating for a long time. “Why isn’t that your reputation, then?” I asked. “I have to ask you that. Maybe you can make it so!”

No, Eric, it is not the ""box"" -- it is the policies.

The article reminded the readers about the time in December when Cantor, Boehner and the House GOP tried, but failed, to pass more spending cuts. As a reminder, Cantor thought he had the votes to pass a Bill requiring more spending cuts but he did not and Boehner and Cantor ended up with egg on their face. Cantor was especially pissed off because the failure to pass the GOP Bill meant Cantor would not be able to go on his ""family vacation""

House Republicans had to decide what to do with it. If Cantor had had his way, he would have been in Guadeloupe. “My whole family went on a cruise, and I couldn’t go,” he told me, glumly; he had to stay in Washington to deal with the fiscal-cliff crisis. His wife, Diana, said, “This was our twenty-third anniversary, and he missed my fiftieth-birthday cruise also.” [wah, wah, wah]

Isn't that sad. Poor Eric Cantor could not go on his family vacation because he screwed up in doing his job so he had to stay to clean up the mess he and his GOP brethren made.

.... Meanwhile, Eric Cantor wants to pass a Federal Law to eliminate overtime pay but not overtime labor. Meaning, naturally, that the law Eric Cantor wants to propose will mean that millions of hourly workers in America would a) not be able to afford their family vacation, and b) might have to work overtime during a scheduled family vacation all without extra pay.

Since Eric Cantor has not given anyone in the media a copy of his proposed Bill, all we can do is look back at the 2003 Republican Bill that would end the Federal Law requiring workers get actual money in exchange for extra hours worked.

One of the many problems with the 2003 Bill was that the Bill did not actually ""require"" employers to give their hourly workers the ""family flex time"" when the worker wanted to use it:

Requires the employer to permit use of comp-time accrued under such an option program within a reasonable time after the employee's request if such use does not unduly disrupt the employer's operations.

Also, Under H.R. 1119, employees who work overtime hours in a given week might not receive any pay or time off for that work until more than a year later,

Therefore, without receiving any interest or security, the employees, in essence, give their overtime pay to the employer in the hopes of getting it back some time later as paid time off.

Hourly worker's overtime pay was put at risk of loss in the event of business failure and closure, bankruptcy, or fraud. In short, H.R.1119 was nothing more than a scheme to allow employers to avoid paying for overtime, a scheme that would result in longer hours, lower incomes, and less predictable workweeks for hourly workers.

From Eric Cantor's February speech, his words sounded a lot like the ""marketing"" used in 2003 where the GOP tried to pass off the notion that not getting actual money paid for overtime worked was a great thing because if workers work overtime they'll have more time to spend with their family.



Eric Cantor Speech dated February, 2013

""Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. That’s not right. ""There’s a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event. ""Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she’ll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families.""

Cantor seems very giddy and excited that Vicki gets to work overtime in order to 'save it up for a sick day' ...

Two things wrong with Cantor's last paragraph, 1) the mom would feel a lot better about her income if she were PAID OVERTIME for all the extra hours she worked; and 2) the 2003 GOP Bill did not guarantee the worker would get time off when the worker wanted it.

In Cantor's defense, I don't know if Cantor's Bill will be different from the 2003 Bill whereby the time off of the worker asked for was restricted by the employer to a degree that the worker might not get their time off until 12 months after they worked extra hours ... and even after 12 months there was no guarantee the worker would get their requested time off.

However, in Cantor's speech, he did not say Vicky got to use her extra hours worked as time off with pay the next month, Cantor said she had to work extra hours and, ""save it up for a sick day or a school event."" Therefore, it is likely that Cantor's Bill could very much look like the 2003 Republican Bill.

After his speech in February, he met privately with Republicans (as described above the orange squiggle) where Cantor asked if they were finished drafting the 'end overtime pay for hourly worker's' proposal:

Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, excused herself halfway through the session and left; the meeting seemed to have been convened mostly for the edification of the one reporter in the room. Cantor asked Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican leader, if the legislation was ready yet. “We’re still kind of in the exploratory stage, but we are looking at some child-care bills, and not quite ready at this point to bring them forward,” she said. “But we’re working on it."" “O.K., I get it,” Cantor said. “There’s always . . .” His voice trailed off. “O.K., anybody else have anything?” The room went silent. “All right, thank you. Thank you very much.”

The article went on to explain the additional massive cuts the Republicans were demanding in exchange for the 'debt ceiling' vote.



Cantor explained why he argued at the retreat against using the debt ceiling as political leverage. He had been hearing from donors on Wall Street and in the business community about the potential impact on the markets. The legislation merely delayed the fight over the debt ceiling until mid-May. In its place, Cantor and the House Republicans had engineered the battle over the sequester, which would begin on March 1st. Cantor viewed the various fiscal deadlines as what his aides referred to as hot stoves. “One is particularly hot,” Steve Stombres, Cantor’s chief of staff, said. “You touch the debt limit and you go into default, and that could be irreparable damage to our economy. But we felt like we could handle the heat of the sequester. We just needed to get them sequenced correctly and use that as an opportunity. The sequester was in place, and the members don’t want to give up that money, those cuts.”

hmmm ... was that a slip of the tongue when Cantor's aid said ""the members don’t want to give up that money"" ... was he referring to the money from the Wall Street donors who told Cantor not to f'ck with the Debt Ceiling vote?

In the article, Eric Cantor insists that the American voters don't reject Republican draconian policies that are geared to benefit the ultra-wealthy - Cantor thinks the American voters agree with Republicans:

* that ultra-wealthy people should get workers to work overtime with no extra pay and

* that the ultra-wealthy should be able to hide their income overseas to avoid paying taxes that would otherwise pay for things like our debt on two wars and

* that Americans do want cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaide, Food Stamps, education, infrastructure spending ... all so the ultra-wealthy can pay anywhere from 0%-14% income tax rate.

Eric Cantor believes that all the Republicans need to do is market those policies, that would roll America back to the era of the failed ""Gilded Age"" in a prettier box.

(CNN) —

House Speaker John Boehner may have stood up to conservative arm-twisters and embraced bipartisanship in moving a budget agreement through the House, but insiders don’t see it as the start of a sea change on Capitol Hill.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is one who was pragmatic about Boehner’s new and strident public tone this week toward several influential conservative groups that have questioned his leadership and blasted the compromise budget plan approved Thursday.

Senior GOP aides also cautioned that Boehner’s rhetorical flogging of these groups was not part of a larger legislative strategy moving forward – especially on immigration reform. They view it as the Speaker simply calling out people who he thought crossed a line.

Boehner took to the podium on Wednesday and Thursday to say that he was fed up with criticism from conservative advocates.

At first, he said they were “misleading their followers.” He followed up with this round-house:

“Frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Spat puts conservative groups in the spotlight

In recent months, Boehner has downplayed internal GOP splits and was on the defensive about why he bent to pressure from the conservative wing of the party to wage what amounted to unwinnable fights with Democrats.

Some vindication

The inability of Boehner to control his majority in the House, many of whom take their cues from conservative advocates, has fostered perpetual gridlock on Capitol Hill and dwindling public support for Republicans and the overall Congress.

Thursday’s budget vote may provided some vindication for Boehner as the House overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan compromise panned by conservative advocates, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to pass next week.

He enthusiastically banged the gavel down and thundered the final tally – 332-94.

Boehner said the proposal hammered out by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart, Patty Murray, didn’t achieve everything Republicans wanted.

But it proposes to reduce the deficit, relax forced military and other spending cuts under so-called sequestration, avoid another government shutdown, and restore a semblance of order to the congressional budget process, which has become an area of recurring political crisis in Washington.

House approves budget deal aimed at averting shutdown

A push on immigration coming?

Pelosi said she was “encouraged” by Boehner’s pushback. But when pressed if she thought Republicans would turn over a new leaf and begin working across party lines on other issues, she didn’t sound convinced that much would change.

“Certainly not achieving this would not have been a good signal, but I don’t under or overestimate the power of this one event today,” Pelosi said.

Immigration is one issue that has been stalled in the House over Republican divisions.

Those pushing for comprehensive reform seized on Boehner’s posture to conservative advocates.

“Our lawmakers’ abilities to work across the aisle will continue to be crucial for us to overhaul our broken immigration system,” Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said.

“The budget vote displayed Speaker Boehner’s great willingness to work across the aisle and move forward on issues that have bipartisan support,” he said.

But senior congressional GOP aides caution that Boehner’s comments this week did not signal a broader approach on legislation.

California Republican Rep Darrell Issa told reporters he’s been working to bridge the partisan divide over immigration for the past 13 years, but he predicted any progress will remain elusive.

“I would love it if we could find acceptable middle ground in which nobody won but the American people on immigration reform. I don’t expect it. I’m working for it but I don’t expect it after this many years,” he said.

Texas GOP Rep Pete Sessions flat out rejected the notion this budget deal means a green light for major immigration legislation.

“I don’t see that this is now clear channel for us to then move immigration, no I don’t. I don’t think that’s what this was about,” he said.

Not seeing eye-to-eye

A test of whether Boehner will continue to confront conservative criticism looms on another fiscal fight next year - the debate over increasing the nation’s ability to borrow money to pay its bills – or the debt limit.

That issue has rallied fiscal hard liners and outside groups to demand new spending reductions and entitlement reforms, Boehner will certainly face another round of pressure to not compromise with Democrats.

5 reasons why Congress might (finally) pass a budget

Why the move now to take on these groups? Boehner didn’t see eye-to- eye with many of them for some time, but hasn’t been willing to go public with his disagreements.

Those close to the Speaker say his public comments weren’t any different than what he’s been saying in closed-door meetings with Republican members.

One senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that once the attacks got personal, Boehner felt the need to fight back.

The fact that conservative groups started attacking the budget deal before it was even announced particularly bothered Boehner, the aide said.

Asserting authority

Military retirees: You betrayed us, Congress

At one point, Boehner acknowledged the power of these groups have had over House Republicans, saying “they pushed us into the fight to defund Obamacare and shut down the government” in October.

After Boehner’s comments on Thursday, the same groups he singled out showed no signs of backing down.

“I don’t think it’s for anyone in Washington to decide who has credibility,” Michael Needham of Heritage Action said in an interview with CNN. “The American people have the right to be told different perspectives on a deal. We’re trying to have a policy disagreement with the deal that was cut, and that’s healthy.”

Some of you have read a lot of carping from me about ""the other 1% problem,"" the fact that about 1% of our population now fights our wars, and we don't hesitate to involve them in stupid and endless wars because, after all, they volunteered.

I cannot improve on a comment under the editorial signed by one Judy Allen from Beaumont, Texas, who in this comment makes me proud to claim her as a Texan:



My husband is a 33-plus year veteran who retired as a Master Sergeant from service in the U.S. Army and the Texas Air National Guard. Sure, cut our retirement, deny us benefits; who are we? We don't underperform fraudulent contracts and have a consistent record of cost-overruns, for which we are regularly rewarded with new contracts in 7 to 8 figures. We aren't or weren't working on a project which the military decided wasn't needed, but which Congressional representatives decided must continue anyway because it benefitted their district. Don't touch any of those expenses -- No, No, No. The ordinary serving military are ripe for the cuts; who cares what they think about getting kicked anyway? Some of them are still in harm's way. If I could speak to them, I would tell them: Put down your weapons, turn those ships around, demand immediate return to the states and walk away from whatever you were doing for the U.S. Those in this country with their hands on the till don't care about what you endure, just so long as they don't have to go or send their kids to serve. As a good friend said to my husband during Thanksgiving dinner, he resented that our medical care was paid for by his tax dollars. (We did nothing to deserve it, obviously.) That's a good tea-party Republican for you. My husband was aghast; he returned home disgusted. This country is being destroyed from within by partisan stupidity paid for by the 1 percent.

Ms. Allen is right. We have a 1% problem in who calls the political shots and another 1% problem in who gets to go to war. President Bush II started a new tradition that says now we can go to war without even paying for it on the books...or, rather, we'll put in on the cuff so there's no immediate pain and make it up later by cutting Social Security and Medicare.

Bring back the draft, and the 98% who neither call the shots nor go to war won't stand for perpetual war any more. The Vietnam debacle finally ended when too many Americans had to face the prospect summed up so neatly by Country Joe McDonald:

http://news.yahoo.com/army-says-no-more-tanks-congress-insists-115422396.html,,[],"Army says no to more tanks, but Congress insists","WASHINGTON (AP) — Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the Army's hulking Abrams tank is proving equally hard to beat in a budget battle.

Lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer money over the past two years to build improved versions of the 70-ton Abrams.

But senior Army officials have said repeatedly, ""No thanks.""

It's the inverse of the federal budget world these days, in which automatic spending cuts are leaving sought-after pet programs struggling or unpaid altogether. Republicans and Democrats for years have fought so bitterly that lawmaking in Washington ground to a near-halt.

Yet in the case of the Abrams tank, there's a bipartisan push to spend an extra $436 million on a weapon the experts explicitly say is not needed.

""If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way,"" Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army's chief of staff, told The Associated Press this past week.

Why are the tank dollars still flowing? Politics.

Keeping the Abrams production line rolling protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank's many suppliers are located.

If there's a home of the Abrams, it's politically important Ohio. The nation's only tank plant is in Lima. So it's no coincidence that the champions for more tanks are Rep. Jim Jordan and Sen. Rob Portman, two of Capitol's Hill most prominent deficit hawks, as well as Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. They said their support is rooted in protecting national security, not in pork-barrel politics.

""The one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country,"" said Jordan, whose district in the northwest part of the state includes the tank plant.

The Abrams dilemma underscores the challenge that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive in order to ensure there's enough money for essential operations, training and equipment.

Story continues

Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, faces a daunting task in persuading members of Congress to eliminate or scale back projects favored by constituents.

Federal budgets are always peppered with money for pet projects. What sets the Abrams example apart is the certainty of the Army's position.

Sean Kennedy, director of research for the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste, said Congress should listen when one of the military services says no to more equipment.

""When an institution as risk averse as the Defense Department says they have enough tanks, we can probably believe them,"" Kennedy said.

Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved. The money, they say, is a modest investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills from being lost if the Abrams line were to be shut down.

The Lima plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities, which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars. The facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of General Dynamics, a major defense contractor that spent close to $11 million last year on lobbying, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

The plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Mayor David Berger. But the facility is still crucial to the local economy. ""All of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company's spending probably have about a $100 million impact annually,"" Berger said.

Jordan, a House conservative leader who has pushed for deep reductions in federal spending, supported the automatic cuts known as the sequester that require $42 billion to be shaved from the Pentagon's budget by the end of September. The military also has to absorb a $487 billion reduction in defense spending over the next 10 years, as required by the Budget Control Act passed in 2011.

Still, said Jordan, it would be a big mistake to stop producing tanks.

""Look, (the plant) is in the 4th Congressional District and my job is to represent the 4th Congressional District, so I understand that,"" he said. ""But the fact remains, if it was not in the best interests of the national defense for the United States of America, then you would not see me supporting it like we do.""

The tanks that Congress is requiring the Army to buy aren't brand new. Earlier models are being outfitted with a sophisticated suite of electronics that gives the vehicles better microprocessors, color flat panel displays, a more capable communications system, and other improvements. The upgraded tanks cost about $7.5 million each, according to the Army.

Out of a fleet of nearly 2,400 tanks, roughly two-thirds are the improved versions, which the Army refers to with a moniker that befits their heft: the M1A2SEPv2, and service officials said they have plenty of them. ""The Army is on record saying we do not require any additional M1A2s,"" Davis Welch, deputy director of the Army budget office, said this month.

The tank fleet, on average, is less than 3 years old. The Abrams is named after Gen. Creighton Abrams, one of the top tank commanders during World War II and a former Army chief of staff.

The Army's plan was to stop buying tanks until 2017, when production of a newly designed Abrams would begin. Orders for Abrams tanks from U.S. allies help fill the gap created by the loss of tanks for the Army, according to service officials, but congressional proponents of the program feared there would not be enough international business to keep the Abrams line going.

This pause in tank production for the U.S. would allow the Army to spend its money on research and development work for the new and improved model, said Ashley Givens, a spokeswoman for the Army's Ground Combat Systems office.

The first editions of the Abrams tank were fielded in the early 1980s. Over the decades, the Abrams supply chain has become embedded in communities across the country.

General Dynamics estimated in 2011 that there were more than 560 subcontractors throughout the country involved in the Abrams program and that they employed as many as 18,000 people. More than 40 of the companies are in Pennsylvania, according to Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., also a staunch backer of continued tank production.

A letter signed by 173 Democratic and Republican members of the House last year and sent to then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta demonstrated the depth of bipartisan support for the Abrams program on Capitol Hill. They chided the Obama administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the United States for the first time since World War II.

Portman, who served as President George W. Bush's budget director before being elected to the Senate, said allowing the line to wither and close would create a financial mess.

""People can't sit around for three years on unemployment insurance and wait for the government to come back,"" Portman said. ""That supply chain is going to be much more costly and much more inefficient to create if you mothball the plant.""

Pete Keating, a General Dynamics spokesman, said the money from Congress is allowing for a stable base of production for the Army, which receives about four tanks a month. With the line open, Lima also can fill international orders, bringing more work to Lima and preserving American jobs, he said.

Current foreign customers are Saudi Arabia, which is getting about five tanks a month, and Egypt, which is getting four. Each country pays all of their own costs. That's a ""success story during a period of economic pain,"" Keating said.

Still, far fewer tanks are coming out of the Lima plant than in years past. The drop-off has affected companies such as Verhoff Machine and Welding in Continental, Ohio, which makes seats and other parts for the Abrams. Ed Verhoff, the company's president, said his sales have dropped from $20 million to $7 million over the past two years. He's also had to lay off about 25 skilled employees and he expects to be issuing more pink slips in the future.

""When we start to lose this base of people, what are we going to do? Buy our tanks from China?"" Verhoff said.

Steven Grundman, a defense expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said the difficulty of reviving defense industrial capabilities tends to be overstated.

""From the fairly insular world in which the defense industry operates, these capabilities seem to be unique and in many cases extraordinarily high art,"" said Grundman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial affairs and installations during the Clinton administration. ""But in the greater scope of the economy, they tend not to be.""

Hall report, the IRS might have targeted them because of their conservatism. The story arrived late in a month of scandal when a growing number of people conveniently claimed that the IRS had audited them because they are conservative — and claimed as much without much more proof than that 1) the IRS had audited them and 2) they are conservative.

""[T]hese examples suggest the government was looking at a broader array of conservative groups and perhaps individuals."" Without further evidence, these examples don't suggest that. But there has been an avalanche of claims — not just from would-be heroes, but average folk and major pundits — that because conservatives were audited, they were audited because they're conservative.

New York City strip club owner Sam Zherka says he was investigated by the IRS in 2010, shortly after calling for a local Tea Party. ""They're investigating every dealing I've done, since the beginning of time,"" Zherka says. He claims the FBI is involved, too, and is suing both agencies.

Rep. Bill Flores suggested to The National Review that he might have been asked for more information about his tax returns because he made inquiries to the IRS on behalf of a Tea Party group in Texas.

Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, told Politico that the IRS asked about his group's political activity because, ""someone in the administration was targeting and attempting to intimidate us.""

Former Libertarian Party candidate Wayne Allyn Root said ""I am the face of Obama’s IRS attacks,"" but as Mother Jones ' Stephanie Mencimer reports, there were probably other reasons Root was audited. Like that in 2007, Root and his wife reported $215,000 in gross income, but had so many write offs that he claimed his taxable income was just $25,000. In 2008, his gross income was $209,000 but his taxable income was $136,000. Root apparently filed a Schedule C, Mencimer reports, and about 25 percent of all Schedule Cs get audited.

The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan made a similar claim, saying Romney donor Frank VanderSloot ""found himself last June, for the first time in 30 years, the target of I.R.S. auditors."" Does that mean VanderSloot was audited in 1982? No doubt he was being persecuted by Ronald Reagan.

As The New York Times' Nate Silver has explained, in 2012, the IRS got 144 million individual income tax returns. It audited just 1 percent — which means 1.5 million of them. That means you'd expect many, many of the people audited to be conservative. It does not mean the IRS was combing Mitt Romney's fundraising disclosures to find conservatives to audit.

According to a Treasury Department inspector general's report, a Cincinnati field office of the IRS improperly targeted conservatives when determining whether they should get tax-exempt status. The law says 501©(4)s must be educational organizations, not political ones. So they created short cuts to find groups that looked like they'd do campaign activity — names with words like ""Tea Party"" and missions involving cutting spending, reducing the debt, things like that. That's really bad! That's a scandal! But it's not evidence of a massive IRS-wide campaign to silence all conservative voters and donors. It's not evidence that the White House was on the phone with the IRS, siccing it on the president's enemies.

RELATED: Why the IRS Abruptly Apologized to the Tea Party

But many are looking for that evidence. The Daily Caller analyzed White House visitor logs and found that IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman visited the White House 157 times — far more than any other Cabinet member. Fox News' Brit Hume tweeted, ""What was the ex-IRS chief doing at the White House all those times?"" Bill O'Reilly said it was the ""smoking gun.""

RELATED: Lois Lerner, IRS Scandal Target No. 1, Just Got in Actual Trouble

But The Atlantic's Garance Frank-Ruta destroys that claim. The visitor records only show Shulman was cleared to visit the White House 157 times. A full 76 percent of those planned visits were related to the implementation of Obamacare, including 80 biweekly health reform deputies meetings. The vast majority of these visits were not in the White House proper, but the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and New Executive Office Building instead. And, just because you're cleared to meet at the White House doesn't mean you actually go. ""Indeed, of the 157 events Shulman was cleared to attend, White House records only provide time of arrival information — confirming that he actually went to them — for 11 events over the 2009-2012 period, and time of departure information for only six appointments,"" Franke-Ruta reports.

Of the conservatives who blame their auditing on their politics, McClatchy writes, ""Their collective experiences at a minimum could spread skepticism about the fairness of a powerful agency that should be above reproach and at worst could point to a secret political vendetta within the government against conservatives."" Anyone who's been excessively generous in estimating the cost of their ""home office"" certainly hopes so.

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”

Until now “sequestration” has been a word that only means something to people living inside the Beltway or to political junkies who depend on their daily dose of Politico and The Hill. But if Congress and the president do not reach a deal by March 1, which appears likely, Americans will quickly learn what it means – namely deep spending cuts.

The spending cuts pose a significant political threat to Republicans, more so than to Democrats. Although many Republicans are standing firm, insisting that their party will be fine if the cuts go through, there are many reasons for the GOP, through a sober eye, to see the dangers that lay ahead.

The cuts could push congressional politics in a liberal direction and establish the foundation for solid Democratic gains in 2014.

Last week Bob Woodward argued that President Obama was responsible for the sequester idea, not the Republicans. But while people are squabbling over who owns the sequester, the GOP will take the hit regardless.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

The danger for Republicans is that the budget cuts will severely weaken public support for the austerity theme that the party has been promoting since 2010. The cuts will make “deficit reduction” something very real to average American citizens and business and something that is often quite painful rather than an abstract debate over numbers.

Opinion: One cuts, Washington throws a tantrum

While Americans have historically been hostile to government, they tend to support specific government services when asked by pollsters. So Washington’s overall spending might not be popular as a concept, but Social Security and Medicare are.

The spending cuts will shift the debate toward the specifics. Americans will watch as government services are retrenched. The last time this happened, things didn’t go well for the GOP.

When the federal government shut down in 1995-1996 because of a budget standoff between Republicans and President Clinton, the GOP faced a huge backlash when Americans were unable to access basic government services, such as obtaining a passport or visiting the national zoo.

Opinion: The spending cut fairy tale

President Obama has already been using the bully pulpit to make this case, appearing with first responders and warning of how the cuts will impact police, hospitals, teachers, airline workers and more. Standing in front of a group of police officers, Obama said, “Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go.” While these speeches are a form of political theater, they are based on very real possibilities.

The budget cuts that result from sequestration would just be the first of the threats the GOP faces. If the government has to shut down as a result of a standoff when the government’s general operating budget expires in late March or the debt ceiling is not raised this spring, Republicans will continue to lose the public’s confidence in their ability to govern and the reduction in services will highlight to Americans what the government actually does.

If the economy sputters as a result of the spending cuts, as some economists predict, deficit reduction will look even worse. An already frustrated workforce will become even more angry, and likely take out their frustration on a Republican Party that has been insisting deficit reduction should be the nation’s short-term goal, rather than stimulating the economy.

Conservatives will suffer as the focus of congressional debate will quickly shift from the issue of spending cuts, where the emphasis has been since 2011, to the issue of spending more.

Once the cuts go through, frustration and anger with the impact on government services will certainly produce increased pressure on legislators in both parties to offer a fix, namely to restore spending to key areas.

Borger: Obama can’t kick his legacy down the road

With legislators already thinking about the 2014 elections, this will be tempting. If this shift occurs, Republicans, who have invested so much in making fiscal discipline their top issue, will be operating in a congressional environment where the debates center around areas where the government needs to devote more government resources rather than less.

The automatic spending cuts are the ultimate symbol of a dysfunctional government. The reason the cuts were put into place was that President Obama and Congress were unable to reach an agreement on taxes and spending. Government leaders agreed to put a gun to their own head by threatening unpalatable cuts if they were unable to reach a deal. Now the trigger is about to be pulled.

The problem for Republicans is that the polls show that the approval rating of the GOP is in the tank while President Obama is doing relatively well. According to Quinnipiac University, only 19% of Americans approve of how Republicans are handling their job.

Obama is enjoying his highest favorability ratings since 2009, with 60% having a favorable rating of him in a Washington Post-ABC poll. The likelihood, as in 1995-1996, is that the public will blame the dysfunction on the GOP rather than Democrats and the party will suffer a further erosion of its standing as a result.

According to a recent poll by the Pew Foundation and USA Today, Republicans would be blamed for the cuts by almost half of Americans, while only 31% would blame Obama.

News: Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cuts

Sequestration will soon become a dirty word in the American political lexicon. While it is impossible to predict which way the political winds will blow, there is good reason for Republicans to see how they can suffer politically if some kind of deal is not reached.

Republicans, who have now struggled through two presidential elections and are facing a demographic shift that does not work in their favor, might want to start thinking harder about their strategy on spending. Deficit reduction is no longer a winning issue for the GOP.

He fulminates about people who are allegedly ""unwilling to work"" sucking off the government teat with impunity. This is a patently dishonest representation of the SNAP program. Most people who receive food stamps cannot be dismissed as losers who are ""unwilling to work."" Nearly half (47%) of all food stamp recipients are children. Another 8% are 60 years of age or older. The ""working poor"" - people who live in a household with income from work - represent another 41%. Between children, the elderly, the working poor, and people who want a job but cannot find one - someone should tell Fincher that there are still more than 3 unemployed job seekers for every 1 opening - that leaves very few people who can be accurately described as being ""unwilling"" to work. It's also worth noting that the average monthly SNAP benefit is a whopping $287. It takes a deeply disturbed person to crusade against providing this class of people with food to eat, when the economy is this battered, and when the broad economic benefits of the program have been so well established (at least in the reality-based community).





Now, this would not normally be worthy of mention. Hardly a day goes by without some Republican sadist expressing fury that poor people have it so good. Devising new ways to make the peasants suffer is what makes Republicans wake up in the morning. What's fascinating about this particular case, though, is Fincher's background.





millions - The reason this is even more egregious than the usual Republican class warfare is that Fincher himself is a poster boy for government dependency. It's not just that he's benefited here and there from some government help. That sort of low-level hypocrisy is almost to be expected from these types. But Fincher has received $3.2 million as of June 2010 - in federal crop subsidies. The people who refer to themselves as Tea Partiers threatened to derail his candidacy over this, but then they realized that they have no principles, and supported him anyway. He's now a member of the ""Tea Party Caucus,"" which, amazingly, is something that actually exists. Fincher's brother and father also snatched another $6.7 million in subsidies as Stephen geared up to run for Congress on a platform of eliminating ""wasteful government spending."" The ""wasteful spending"" that he had in mind, of course, was that which serves policy aims with which he disagrees, such as keeping poor people alive.





House Republicans are on a mission to slash the SNAP program by $20 billion over the next decade. A Senate committee, just last week, voted to cut it by ""only"" $4 billion. If some sort of vicious ""compromise"" is reached between the sociopaths in the House who are demanding human sacrifice on a massive scale, and the ""moderates"" in the Senate who are only comfortable with letting some people starve, it will not be pretty. This is not hyperbole, either. SNAP really does keep poor people, including millions of children, from going hungry, and it's under attack from ultra-right-wing ideologues. This program deserves the support and activism of progressives as much as any government program in existence."

Boehner delivered an uncharacteristically forceful response to conservative groups lining up against the budget compromise announced Tuesday, accusing them of “using” people to advance their own goals rather than the GOP’s.

Speaking with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday, the Ohio Republican mocked the powerful conservative forces that he said were staking out opposition to the deal even before its full details were public.

“They’re using our members and they’re using the American people for their own goals,” Boehner charged. “This is ridiculous.

“If you’re for more deficit reduction, you’re for this agreement,” he added.

The Club for Growth, one of the more prominent anti-tax groups, was the latest to come out against the deal forged by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), calling it “flawed.”

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

“Apparently, there are some Republicans who don’t have the stomach for even relatively small spending reductions that are devoid of budgetary smoke and mirrors,” the group’s president, former Rep. Chris Chocola, said Wednesday.

Another group, Heritage Action, said Wednesday it would urge Republicans to vote against the deal and factor the vote into its influential rating system.

The agreement would set spending levels for 2014 at $1.012 trillion, higher than the $967-billion level that would have taken effect under the sequester in January. It would restore some funding to military and domestic spending programs, paid for with new fees and cuts elsewhere in the budget.

The House is expected to vote on the measure Thursday.

Boehner’s blunt response stands in contrast to his tone during previous budget battles, when conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action were complicating leadership’s efforts to come to agreements with the Senate’s Democratic leaders by coming out against proposed compromises.

When asked about the groups’ influence on his members in late October, Boehner answered simply: “Pass.”

That shift could reflect his confidence that the deal could pass without the support of a block of conservatives, whose votes were needed in previous deals since Democrats were voting nearly unanimously against them.

As members left a closed-door conference meeting Wednesday morning, many expressed concerns with the deal but nonetheless indicated they could support it.

“There’s a lot of mixed feelings about it,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.), who said he was still mulling over the proposal.

Responding to Boehner’s remarks, the Club for Growth issued a second statement from Chocola.

“We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” he said, adding that his organization did not comment until the deal was complete. “We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”

Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho), one of at least a dozen of the more conservative Republicans who will vote against the deal, also defended the conservative groups.

“What is it that these outside groups said yesterday about this deal that is false today?” he asked. But he also downplayed their influence on his vote. “Anybody who thinks my vote is for sale to Heritage Action is sadly mistaken.”

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/05/30/who-is-not-to-trust-why-ted-cruz-is-right,2013-05-30 00:00:00,['Alfred S. Regnery'],Who Is Not to Trust? Why Ted Cruz Is Right,"So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.

“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.

But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.

“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”

He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would.

And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”

When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.

It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”

Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.

Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.

Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.

The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?

So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.”

Maybe we need new leadership."

Not so GOP's. If cuts happen, voters will blame GOP

Editor’s Note: Maria Cardona is a Democratic strategist, a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton and former communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

Earlier this month, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, rolled out to much fanfare a new “branding effort” for the Republican Party, focused on broadening its appeal and helping the middle class.

It seemed hopeful at the time. Sadly, today it is laughable. We are days away from severe forced spending cuts that will do nothing but hurt the very people the GOP is trying to win over. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana recently declared that Republicans had to stop being “the stupid party” if they were ever going to put together the long-term winning coalition they needs to reach the White House in 2016. Sorry, governor: your party didn’t listen.

Maria Cardona

If the forced cuts, known as the sequester, go through, 14,000 teachers could get laid off – affecting thousands of middle-class families, including many African-American and Latino families. Construction jobs, manufacturing jobs, first-responder jobs – all well-paying middle-class jobs, will get cut.

Castellanos: On cuts, Washington throws a tantrum

Domestic violence programs will be slashed as $20 million gets cut from the Violence Against Women Act. Public safety in many ways will suffer. Food inspectors will get laid off. Up to 5,000 Border Patrol agents will be called from the border – the mother of ironies for the Republicans who complain that the administration isn’t doing enough on border security.

This is not what was supposed to happen. Sequestration was designed to be a bipartisan stink bomb so noxious to both parties that neither would allow it to happen. It was a release valve that allowed the parties to reach a deal on the debt limit in the summer of 2011 to avoid sending the nation into default, with the understanding that a broader agreement on the debt and deficit would be reached. If it wasn’t, off went the bomb.

What happened between then and now? President Barack Obama won reelection by voters who support his idea of dealing with the debt and deficit – by asking everyone to put some skin in the game. He was seen as the protector of the middle class, and importantly, as the one who understood that government is not the enemy. That in fact, a lean, efficient, smart government, can help level the playing field and help all Americans and businesses get ahead.

Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough

This argument was overwhelmingly supported by Latinos, African-Americans, women and young people and helped propel the president to a second term. Then came the fiscal-cliff debacle, where again, majorities of Americans sided with the president on how to fix it. Republicans acquiesced, and it seemed they knew they had to change their tune.

In his GOP rebranding speech, Cantor said: “We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth.” That sounded smart enough. But in this current showdown du jour, Republicans have proven they are unserious. The party cannot see beyond its insistence on protecting the rich from paying even a single penny more, while welcoming draconian cuts to programs that hurt the middle class and the most vulnerable, especially in the areas of education, health care, innovation and job growth.

Zelizer: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame

Instead of trying to find a way to avoid these steep cuts, and to keep faith with their newfound concern for the middle class, Republicans are doubling down on the “my way or the highway” mentality that put them in an electoral hole to begin with.

The party’s deficit among these key voting groups will only get bigger if the GOP allows the spending cuts to go through. The risk to their standing among the American people is quite real. They are making a choice to protect loopholes for millionaires and their corporate jets while kicking 70,000 kids off critical Head Start programs – and many of these kids come from low-income African American and Latino families. Thousands of middle-class American jobs are on the chopping block because the Republican Party did not learn the lesson of the election.

While there is political risk for everyone, including Obama, if these cuts happen, he enjoys something the GOP does not: the trust of the American people. Recent polling suggests up to half of Americans would blame Republicans. Less than a third would blame President Obama. Polls also show that an overwhelming 76% of voters, and 56% of Republicans, agree with the president that the solution to our fiscal woes should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

Obama’s approval rating is at 55%, a three-year high. He is at 73% of support with Latinos, up 2 points from his 71% election victory – not a promising trend for Republicans.

When you are in a hole, the best advice is to stop digging. The GOP seems to prefer to grab a bigger shovel.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) for his all-night non-filibuster, and how he read from Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and seemed to miss the entire point of the story.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in an effort to speak for 26 million Texans, and for 300 million Americans. ... And as Americans, we value liberty and opportunity above all else. ... What the American people are interested in is what we've always been interested in.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... what we've always been interested in. Which is freedom.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You go to the 1940s. Nazi Germany.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, accept the Nazis. Yes, they'll dominate the continent of Europe. But that's not our problem. Let's appease them. ... And in America, there were voices that listened to that. I suspect those same pundits who say it can't be done, if it had been in the 1940s, we would've been listening to them.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in opposition...

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... in opposition to Obamacare.

OK, OK, possibly a very troubled bureaucratic system. Can we focus on the Nazi zombies for a second?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.

So you'd be unable to stand. ""Until the Nazis steal my knees.""

Yes, that's Ted Cruz, the Senator who, starting yesterday at 2:41 Eastern Wasting Time, took to the Senate floor for 21 hours, not to filibuster, not to delay, but to cast himself as Churchill to Obama's Chamberlain in the great fight against... Hitler's... health care exchanges. I lost the thread of the metaphor. But my point is this.

(audience laughter)

Yeah, it takes a while to sink in. It takes a while to sink in.

Senator Cruz clearly believes our very freedom is at stake here. And Senator Cruz — as a brilliant Harvard educated lawyer and Princeton debate champion — I imagine that he is prepared to make a stunning and sophisticated argument as to why Obamacare places this very nation in such peril.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Some time ago, I tweeted a speech that Ashton Kutcher gave. That's a terrific speech.

You're fucking with us, right?

""I tweeted a speech by Ashton Kutcher. It was so good, I only needed 140 characters of it.""

Wow, how would something like that look in the Senator's original analogy?

Ted Cruz, Senator! You are one of the great minds of our times — says you — who says we are facing one of the great perils of our age. And yet you've outsourced your argument and wisdom to a dude who cannot find his car? Perhaps there was even more eloquent and soaring speech-making to come.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I want to point out just a few words of wisdom from Duck Dynasty. ... There was a movie, Jason vs. Freddy, I forget, they fought each other, I forget what even happened in that movie. ... Eight White Castle restaurants a year, I like their little burgers. ... It's a little bit like the World Wrestling Federation. ... In my mind, I heard the music from The Shining, er, not The Shining, from Psycho. ... Just like in Star Wars movies ... (in bad Darth Vader voice) Mike Lee, I am your father.

(whispers to Cruz) You're losing them.

Come on, Senator Cruz, this isn't even a filibuster! You had 20 hours to make your case. You're double Ivy League! Surely you can do better, maybe cite a study or a book.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" ... ""I do not like them, Sam I am, I do not like green eggs and ham"".

So to express your opposition to Obamacare, you go with a book about a stubborn jerk who decides he hates something before he's tried it. (wild audience cheering and applause) And when he finally does get a taste, he has to admit after tasting it, ""This is pretty fucking good"".

Senator Cruz, you're trying to save America! Get to the dire foundational issue at hand.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You like your doctor? Do you want to keep seeing your doctor? Well, I'll tell ya, Americans all over this country are losing their health care because of Obamacare. They're losing their ability to see their doctors. That's what happens if the Senate doesn't act to defund Obamacare.

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): One half of small businesses say that they will either cut hours to reduce full-time employees, or full-time employees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. ... Obamacare is estimated to have increased individual health insurance premiums by anywhere from 64% to 146%.

(audience laughter)

Take that down, that's really disturbing. (picture of Cruz reappears) Not much better.

Do you have a more foundational critique?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country. ... Small businesses have been hammered under Obamacare unlike ever before. ... It's shattering the economy, all across the country in all 50 states.

But... I can think of another thing that came out of Washington recently that is hurting economic growth right now. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the spending cuts from the sequester are costing the country three-quarters of a million jobs this year alone. How did you feel about those cuts?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (3/16/2013): We stood our ground and finally got at least the first small step — and I underscore it is a small step — to reigning in our uncontrollable spending and debt.

So your problem with the sequester is that it didn't cost us enough jobs. For all its flaws, Obamacare appears to at least be attempting to fix some fundamental holes in our health care system, like insurance companies being able to deny based on pre-existing conditions. So if you're going to repeal it, you'd better have some idea of your own on how to do that. Pre-existing conditions, how would you do that?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): My view on pre-existing conditions is we ought to reform the market to deal with that problem.

So you got nothing. You know what, Ted Cruz? The level of threat you say we face from Obamacare isn't met by the quality of solutions and the rhetoric that you offer.

You know, reminds me of a character I once read about, by I believe one of your favorite authors, Dr. Seuss and his beloved children's book, ""The Bore-ax"". (audience laughter)

Join me now as I read one of my favorite sections. (wild audience cheering as Jon takes out the book)



In the land of D.C., in the Senate of Snooze,

Lived the showboatiest Blab whose name was Ted Cruz. Ted talked about health care, compared it to Nazis.

As comparisons so, he was off by a lotsy. Health care, he said, would end this great nation.

A point made after hours of mouth masturbation. Repeal it, defund it, erase it, deny it,

Murder it, skullfuck it, bread and deep fry it!

Cruz claimed freedom and liberty, but it was all a big show.

Because he could have spent all that time making sure the law didn't blow."

The Republican frame for 40 years has been that Democrats are the party of tax, spend and regulation, while Republicans are the party of tax cuts, austerity and deregulation. It’s hard to let go of this message; for many years, it worked. But then we had the presidency of George W. Bush and the campaign of Mitt Romney. Bush won because he was a compassionate conservative, the supposed antidote to the callousness of Newt Gingrich. But he governed, with the exception of the prescription drug benefit, as an orthodox Republican, pursuing tax cuts for the wealthy and loose regulations. The deficit exploded and the economy collapsed. While these policies cannot be blamed exclusively for these economic outcomes, the rosy and ridiculous Republican assumption that cutting taxes on the wealthy and reducing regulation lead to prosperity was finally and brutally exposed. The trickle in trickle-down dried up, and Republican economic policies were blamed."

[T]hose who want to stay out of poverty have the best chances of doing so if they graduate from high school, don’t get addicted to drugs and alcohol and don’t get pregnant out of wedlock.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) recently attended a Rotary Club meeting in my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. During this meeting he spoke on several topics, but what was most notable were his comments about poverty and how to avoid it Keep in mind this is coming from a man whose net worth is well over $23 Million so he really knows what he is talking about. Of course as a guy who has lived paycheck to paycheck I have some advice I would like to add to Sen. Johnson’s on how to avoid poverty.

Sen. Johnson giving advice about how to avoid poverty is about as useless as a parka and electric socks at Lambeau Field on the 4th of July. He has no idea of how it feels to have a job yet you still have to lurch from paycheck to paycheck. What it is like to eat ramen noodles for weeks on end because you don’t have the money to go grocery shopping. He has no idea of what it is like knowing you will be homeless if you miss just one paycheck.

It must be nice to live such a simple life like Sen. Johnson. A life where the solution to avoiding poverty is pretty much, don’t fuck up, ever. Too bad it isn’t that simple in the real world where you can do everything right and still struggle just because of who your parents were or because of random chance."

But Sen. Tom Coburn says there's ""no shortage of potential savings,"" pointing out that the department is nevertheless spending millions on newly created monuments and landmarks.

The Oklahoma Republican, who has been hounding federal agencies for weeks about questionable spending under the cloud of sequester, aired his grievances with the Interior Department in a letter to Secretary Sally Jewell Tuesday.

""It makes little sense to expand the number of sites at the same time the budget of every other park is being cut and visitors are being turned away from visiting the White House,"" Coburn wrote.

Coburn pointedly questioned department efforts to name new sites and expand others -- decisions that will contribute to the department's annual costs. Coburn said the National Park Service has designated 13 new historic landmarks and three new monuments since the sequester hit March 1. One of those landmarks, he noted, is a whiskey distillery -- the George T. Stagg Distillery in Kentucky. Other newly created landmarks include the Connecticut home of abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, the historic bridge crossed by civil rights marchers in Selma, Ala., and an artists' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

Coburn also said the NPS is trying to acquire new land elsewhere for existing parks, and urged the department to ""cease"" until normal access to U.S. parks has been restored.

Coburn also questioned whether the department needed to be spending money on drone surveillance of animal populations ranging from sheep in Nevada to pygmy rabbits in Idaho. Coburn cited several population counts that are expected to be conducted later this year.

Despite these expenses, the Associated Press reported in late April that the U.S. Geological Survey -- which is part of the Interior Department -- was preparing to shut down more than 100 gauges that warn about possible flooding or water shortages.

Plus department officials have repeatedly discussed the impact on national parks. NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis testified last month that the sequester would lead to ""delayed road openings, reduced hours of operation for programs and services and fewer programs and patrols.""

In response to Coburn's letter, Interior spokesman Blake Androff said the department cannot move money around so easily.

""Sequestration requires an across-the-board cut to all programs and accounts and does not allow the flexibility to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" he said. ""The Department of the Interior has already taken aggressive steps to reduce spending across the agency and will continue to look for innovative ways to cut costs while preserving our mission essential activities.""

Roughly half the department budget pays staff, which is far more than at other agencies. The department argues that the sequester cuts, then, have a significant impact on services -- seasonal hiring, for instance, had to be drastically cut back, which impacts programs at national parks.

Federal agencies have each responded differently to the sequester. The Federal Aviation Administration rattled lawmakers after it furloughed air traffic controllers, leading to delays at major U.S. airports. Congress, though, intervened by allowing the FAA to move money around, in turn canceling those furloughs.

The private business community also has stepped in. At Yellowstone National Park, two cities stepped up when the National Park Service decided to save money by plowing snow two weeks later than usual. This would have delayed the clearing of four park gates well past the typical May 1 opening, so city officials held a fundraiser and collected enough money to pay the state to clear the roads, ensuring the gates will be open on time.

Coburn cited this as a positive example in his letter, and urged the department to find more savings.

""I believe the Department can continue to maintain this same level access even under sequestration,"" he wrote. ""To accomplish this, the Department must prioritize its core mission, eliminate unnecessary, wasteful, and duplicative programs, and find innovative ways to do more with less."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/18/military-hardship-furloughs/,2013-07-18 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],Military communities brace for 'hardship' as defense furloughs take effect,"Military communities across the country, after listening to the warnings about steep budget cutbacks for months, are now bracing for impact as furloughs for roughly 650,000 civilian Defense Department employees kick in this month.

Officials at military bases and other DoD facilities will have some flexibility in scheduling days off. But the furloughs will nevertheless result in non-essential civilian workers missing one paid workday a week -- a roughly 20 percent pay cut -- over the next three months.

Virginia’s Hampton Roads, which encompasses the massive Naval Station Norfolk, is expected to be among the country’s hardest-hit communities -- considering it has 14 military and Coast Guard facilities. Roughly half the regional economy is tied to the Defense Department.

“There no question we’ll feel the impact and it will pervasive across the entire region,” said Ira Agricola, a government affairs official with the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce.

However, he and other regional experts said the full effect will not be known for months because the furloughs just started and economists need time to collect and analyze the data.

“I’m certain it will impact the community,” said retired Adm. Craig Quigley, now executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance.

“People will be spending less across the board. They’ll postpone a family vacation, fix the car instead of getting a new one. … But it’s difficult to put a dollar figure on. It’s all over the map,” Quigley, a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense, told FoxNews.com.

The civilian defense employees -- about 85 percent of the department’s civilian workforce -- must take off 11 days without pay through September, the end of fiscal 2013.

Furloughed workers are already talking about canceling vacations and other efforts to trim household budgets, while military families express concerns about cutbacks in services, including their children’s schooling, considering fewer civilian providers will be on the job.

“I have been hit by the furloughs, and they're inconvenient and difficult,” Claire Riggle, a civilian employee and military spouse, told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Monday. “But what bothers me more is the effect it has on our children.”

Hagel, speaking at a town hall-style meeting at Fort Bragg, N.C., said civilian teachers are being furloughed just five days and that officials are trying to schedule their furloughs on non-school days.

“Most of the family programs are exempt,” he said. “I know this is difficult. And I know it's difficult for children.”

Hagel’s comments echoed those he made May 14 in announcing the furloughs, saying cuts to training, maintenance and other operations were not enough to reduce a $30 billion shortfall.

“The department has been doing everything possible to reduce this shortfall while ensuring we can defend the nation,” he said at the time. “I recognized the significant hardship this places on you and your families.”

The furloughs are part of the so-called “across the board” cuts to the federal government that are known as sequester and started in March -- after Washington failed to agree on less drastic budget reductions. As much as $85 billion will be cut this year as part of the large effort to trim the federal deficit by roughly $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

The furloughs are expected to save the department about $1.8 billion this year, but Hagel warned again Monday about an uncertain future, saying the potential for more cuts are “casting a very dark cloud over our institution.”

Part of the reason for the wide-ranging impact is that furloughs affect everybody from a senior-level civil servant to lesser-paid workers supporting their families on one salary.

Among those to first raise concerns about the furloughs were advocates for wounded combat soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center -- the country’s top facility for wounded warriors.

Roughly 2,400 workers at the suburban Washington facility – including doctors and therapists -- were notified in May about being furloughed, which advocates say could jeopardize the quality of care.

A spokeswoman for National Capital Regional Medical said in response that wounded warrior care remains Walter Reed’s “top priority” and “will not be compromised.”"

The revised GOP plan reflects the demands Obama made in a meeting with House GOP Leaders on Thursday. It also reflects the unwillingness of the DC GOP to face a fiscal showdown with Democrats.

Aside from reopening the government and agreeing to raise America’s debt over the current $16.7 trillion limit, the Republicans made several other concession to President Obama and the Democrats. One such example is that Obamacare would receive funding. The Republicans would get to take out a portion of the president’s signature legislation, but the law would substantially remain intact. The AP reports:

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

In addition, some of the across-the-board “sequester” cuts would be reversed under the GOP plan. It has not been determined which specific cuts will be targeted at this time.

In exchange for meeting, at least momentarily, all of Obama’s demands, the House GOP is seeking a “framework” for future negotiations on addressing longer-term budget issues. These negotiations would be led for the Republicans by Rep. Paul Ryan, who is likely to seek a “grand bargain” resolving the nation’s structural budget problems.

After such a swift capitulation on the current impasse, how likely is it that the GOP will be able to extract meaningful reforms during yet another round of budget talks? House Leadership has already shown that, when nearing an actual deadline, it will cave while extracting very few concessions.

The GOP surrender comes at a time when it is in a stronger position than it was during the partial government shutdown in 1995/96. The public generally blames both parties and President Obama for the fiscal stalemate. Obama’s approval ratings, meanwhile, have cratered to 37%, the lowest of his Presidency.

In addition, 61% of the public thinks significant spending cuts have to be part of any deal to lift the debt ceiling. By that, they mean actual cuts, not a “framework” to discuss cuts.

The House GOP has signaled to the Democrats that it is desperate to end the stand-off. They will, of course, promise that they will have more “leverage” next time. They’ve said that so many times, they probably even believe it."

Christie's Bad Bet Will Cost Taxpayers Millions","The gambling industry and Atlantic City are not in good health. The Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City recently sold for $20 MM - today it would cost $400 MM to build, so it has lost 95% of its value. The Sands and Atlantis casinos have disappeared. Yet Christie thought this project was a good investment of taxpayers' $260MM which is now essentially down the drain.

Because betting is now legal in neighboring states, gambling here is way down. The casino hotels have slashed their workforces, cut real wages and, citing falling property values, received huge property tax refunds - with more refunds likely. The city has sold $103 million of bonds to finance casino property tax refunds, bonds that with interest will cost the average homeowner more than $2,100 over the next two decades, Michael Stinson, the city finance director, said.

As early as last September an article by David Cay Johnston appeared in Reuters describing the troubles the Atlantic City gambling industry was facing so it should come as no surprise that the casino is now declaring bankruptcyBut Gov. Christie likes to brag in his ads and speeches that he has lowered New Jerseyan's property taxes.

According to Johnston, Atlantic City has imposed a tax on its residents to subsidize the casinos - $100 mm over next 15 years. The casinos cannot operate without government subsidies and have become ""welfare queens"". This is an ironic reversal of what was supposed to produce jobs and income for residents, who now instead have to support the industry with their tax dollars.

According to Johnston, Chris Christie is a leading proponent of corporate socialism - taking from the many and giving to business owners. Massive gifts to corporations entice them to relocate to New Jersey. For example, these corporations get to collect state income tax from workers' paychecks, but do not have to actually pay it to the state. They pocket the state income tax.



The city is about to sell another $35 million in bonds, while the Press of Atlantic City reports that $40 million more may have to be borrowed next year. If all that happens the average homeowner eventually may be out more than $3,600 in added taxes. That may well understate the added costs to local taxpayers in the next few years as the gambling business is likely to shrink even more, as Mayor Lorenzo Langford told me. Each time another casino opens in nearby states, ""the Atlantic City market should expect to see some lost business,"" Mayor Langford said, and ""one or more of the weaker casinos may close.""

Of course what this brings to mind is the endless whining by Republicans about Solyndra. who liked to repeat that the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. Which is of course ridiculous on its face as the government has always been instrumental in shaping policy and the economy. And Solyndra will have cost taxpayers far less than Revel and is a far more ethical and beneficial use of monies as it could have reduced the effects of climate change, whereas gambling robs from the poor to give to the rich.



NEW YORK (CNNMoney) To Democrats it represents government support for a private enterprise that was supposed to create something that made us all better off -- clean energy and jobs.

To Republicans it represents government overstepping its role. With the issue not showing signs of fading away in the election, here are seven things you should know about Solyndra and the Department of Energy loan program that supported it. It was started by Bush: The DOE loan program that funded Solyndra was actually started by President Bush in 2005. It was intended to provide government support for ""innovative technologies."" Lawmakers set aside $10 billion to cover any losses from $26 billion in loans. Solyndra could potentially cost the government $529 million. And Beacon, a power storage company that also went bankrupt, cost the government $12 million. So even if Solyndra ends up costing the full $529 million, there's still nearly $9.5 billion available should other loans go belly up. Solyndra wanted more: The company applied for another $468 million in funding shortly after its first DOE loan closed. The government did not award the second request.



And of course the final reminder is Christie's cancellation of what was at the time the country's largest public works project, on the grounds that taxpayers couldn't afford it. But, according to him they can afford to subsidize a private project.

The Tunnel would have created jobs in the region, but Christie chose to throw good money after bad in Atlantic City. Furthermore his reasons for doing so have now been refuted in a subsequent GAO report.



Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey exaggerated when he declared that unforeseen costs to the state were forcing him to cancel the new train tunnel planned to relieve congested routes across the Hudson River, according to a long-awaited report by independent Congressional investigators. The report [...] found that while Mr. Christie said that state transportation officials had revised cost estimates for the tunnel to at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion, the range of estimates had in fact remained unchanged in the two years before he announced in 2010 that he was shutting down the project. And state transportation officials, the report says, had said the cost would be no more than $10 billion. Mr. Christie also misstated New Jersey’s share of the costs: he said the state would pay 70 percent of the project; the report found that New Jersey was paying 14.4 percent. Canceling the tunnel, then the largest public works project in the nation, helped shape Mr. Christie’s profile as a rising Republican star, an enforcer of fiscal discipline in a country drunk on debt. But the report is likely to revive criticism that his decision, which he said was about “hard choices” in tough economic times, was more about avoiding the need to raise the state’s gasoline tax, which would have violated a campaign promise. The governor subsequently steered $4 billion earmarked for the tunnel to the state’s near-bankrupt transportation trust fund, traditionally financed by the gasoline tax.



If there's any doubt that Christie is a typical Republican let's hope this debacle puts it to rest. He is on the forefront of corporate socialism - giving from the many to give to the (well connected) few."

Some federal workers sent home;

Benefit checks could be delayed

December 18, 1995

Web posted at: 2:30 p.m. EST

From Senior White House Correspondent Wolf Blitzer

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On the third day of a new partial government shutdown, some federal workers were being sent home and President Clinton vetoed Republican-passed spending bills covering several cabinet-level agencies. Clinton objects to provisions in the measures that include aspects of the Republican legislative platform The measures would have provided funding for the Veterans Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.

A veto was expected later in the day on a bill covering the State, Justice and Commerce departments.

Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was meeting on Capitol Hill with Democrats in an effort to forge new seven-year budget proposals. Clinton said he planned to call House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole later Monday to discuss the budget impasse. At a breakfast fund-raiser in Richmond, Va., Gingrich blamed the partial shutdown on Clinton. ""The bills are on his desk,"" Gingrich said. ""The burden is on him.""

Lacking a budget agreement, White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin ordered more than 260,000 federal workers -- about 13 percent of government employees -- to suspend operations. Last month's shutdown affected 800,000 employees. Those being furloughed Monday still had to show up for work in the morning but were to be sent home immediately.

These federal employees say the shutdown hurts non-government workers, too.

""It's just stupidity,"" said government worker Maureen Allen.

""I can balance my budget in a week. They ought to be able to do it themselves,"" complained Fred Bustillos, a National Park Service employee furloughed over the weekend.

The current shutdown began at midnight Friday, when Congress did not extend a temporary spending measure put in place after the last closure. ""It's absolutely disgusting,"" Labor Department staffer Walter Martin said on the way into his office Monday morning. ""There's a lot of work to be done that's not being done.""

Before the last shutdown, congressional leaders and President Clinton promised that furloughed workers would be paid, and they were. But there have been no promises this time.

Government services affected

The administration has promised that Social Security and Medicare checks will be paid on time. However, if the second shutdown isn't over by Thursday morning, veterans' benefit checks for more than 3.3 million people would be delayed, said Ken McKinnon, spokesman for the Veterans' Affairs Department. The checks are supposed to be mailed December 29, but the department has neither the money nor the personnel to process them.

Passports also may not get processed, but as in November, postal service will not be affected and vital workers in public health and safety will stay on the job. The six-day closure that ended on November 19 was the longest in history and cost the government an estimated $750 million, more than half of it in retroactive salaries to workers who were sent home.

Sen. John Breaux, D-Louisiana, a member of the Finance Committee, predicted Monday the Senate would pass a temporary measure to keep the government in business through the end of the week while negotiators continue working. ""I think it's real possible it'll happen today,"" he said. But it was not clear whether the House would approve such a measure.

Partial Shutdown

Agencies and Departments Affected Interior Justice Commerce Veterans Housing and Urban Development Education Health and Human Services NASA EPA Labor State

Among programs that would have been killed by the bills Clinton vetoed Monday morning were his AmeriCorps community service program. The bills also contained environmental riders that critics say favor developers in the use of public lands. Clinton said the bills would undermine the nation's environment. The bills would have cut 21 percent from both the EPA and federal housing programs.

When the bills passed in the Senate last week, they did not win enough support to override a veto.

So what do our representatives in Congress plan to do about it? Take a two-week break. Are they trying to see whether their abysmal 13% approval rating can sink any lower?

I get it. Spring break shouldn’t just be for students. Adults work hard too. But usually, a “break” follows a period of “work.” And not much can be said of the 113th Congress’ accomplishments so far.

Indeed, it has been more than two years since the president’s bipartisan fiscal commission declared a so-called moment of truth: “We cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer.” Yet that is exactly what Washington has done and continues to do.

It kicked the can down the road after the fiscal commission made its recommendations in 2010. Then, in 2011, when the nation came to the brink of defaulting on its obligations over battles about raising the debt ceiling, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) struck a narrow deal on spending cuts but punted the tough budget choices to a congressional committee.

After just a few months, this committee announced it couldn’t reach an agreement and set the clock ticking on the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. Most recently, when confronting the “fiscal cliff” of scheduled tax increases and spending reductions, Washington once again did the bare minimum, raising tax rates on the wealthy and letting the sequester take effect.

We recently pushed back another debt ceiling deadline without addressing the underlying problem of unsustainable deficits remains unsolved. Yet Congress is scheduled to be out of session for nine weeks over the next five months. And even when it’s supposed to be in session during that period, the House isn’t scheduled to meet for a full five-day workweek.

Although Washington has managed to enact several trillion dollars in deficit reduction as the country lurched from one unnecessary crisis to the next, the job is far from finished and the most important issues remain untouched. To set a sustainable financial course for the country, Congress and the president must replace the sequester with a larger and more generationally balanced deficit reduction agreement of at least $2.4 trillion that couples meaningful changes in entitlements with pro-growth tax reform.

Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan of the House Budget Committee and Washington Democrat Patty Murray of the Senate Budget Committee, to their credit, each released proposed budgets that recognize the need for reducing the deficit. But neither proposal has a chance of winning support from the other party, and they each tackle only half the problem. Ryan’s budget, for example, doesn’t ask for a dime in revenue increases, while Murray’s budget doesn’t go nearly far enough in achieving savings from entitlements.

Instead of going their separate ways home, lawmakers should stay together in Washington, find common ground and get a real deal done. John Hilley, who helped strike a balanced budget with a Republican Congress as President Clinton’s legislative affairs director in 1997, nailed it when he wrote: “Bipartisanship is not the absence of partisanship; it is partisans coming together to reconcile their competing political and policy objectives.” What we need is some true bipartisanship.

Both parties have bridged the gap before, and it’s time to do it again. That will require, as did the 1997 deal, a number of elements: commitment to a common goal, open communication between all stakeholders, an understanding of what each side needs out of an agreement and, perhaps most important, leaders who can put the country’s interests ahead of their own.

For any of that to happen, though, legislators will have to be in the same place.

Until a deal is reached that addresses the nation’s mounting debt, lawmakers should stay in Washington, hunker down and figure it out. No more trips, breaks, vacations, recesses, “constituent work weeks” or whatever you want to call them. They should just do what we elected them to do: legislate.

THOMAS ROBERTS (12/3/2013): The 113th Congress is about to go down as the least productive in our American history. CHRIS JANSING (12/3/2013): If you can believe it, only 55 bills have been signed into law this year. That makes this the least productive Congress ever. CHRIS HAYES (12/4/2013): The least productive Congress in the history of the American republic. ALAN COLMES (8/8/2013): It literally is a do-nothing Congress.

Now sure, the 113th hasn't passed the bills every Congress does, like a highway bill, or a defense bill, or a farm bill, or a budget. But, I mean, what do we need a budget for? Clearly not for highways, defense, or food. Besides, Congress did pass a bill ensuring that people can fish near dams on the Cumberland River, and they also passed deep cuts in food stamps for the poor, which is good solid governing, because the poor don't need food stamps anymore, now that they can fish near dams on the Cumberland River. Remember the old saying, ""Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Take away his food stamps, maybe he won't."" (audience laughter)

And folks, I am so excited to have others report that there's been an even bigger bipartisan achievement.



FOX32 (11/18/2013): Congress is about to shell out $55 million dollars to pay for retirement benefits for a group of chimpanzees. The 300 chimps are part of a research testing facility, who are being sent to a habitat in Louisiana to live out the rest of their lives. The money will be used to provide the animals with housing, food, and medical care.

Nation, this is great news, because it means Congress can agree on a social safety net, as long as it's not for human beings. And if they're willing to reward research chimps with cushy retirement, I see no reason why we shouldn't just offer the same deal to our elderly, as long as we can use them for medical experiments first.

Face it, come on, face it, they already swallow whatever pills you put in the tray. And since we won't need chimps for research anymore, we can have them do all the things Congress refuses to pay people to do. Like rebuilding our bridges, or paving our highways. I mean, it would be so much better! Because a chimp on a tricycle is funny, but a chimp on a steamroller? Hilarious!

And come to think of it, why don't we just put the chimps in Congress?

First, it is not federal. President Obama has used Race to the Top money to encourage states to embrace higher standards, but the Common Core was written under the auspices of the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, an effort that began in 2007, before Obama was elected. Some advocates of Common Core have actually implored Obama and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, just to stop talking about it, because their endorsement feeds the myth that this is a federal takeover.

Second, there is no national curriculum. The standards, which you can read here, describe a reasonable progression of learning from grade to grade, but leave it to state and local school officials to get there. The Common

Core is not an attempt to pack kids’ heads with an officially sanctioned list of facts, but to assure that they are able to read a complicated text and understand it, to recognize a problem and know how to solve it.

So, to pick an example at random, the Common Core says a third grader should be able to “describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.” By eighth grade the student should be able to “analyze how particular lines of dialogue or incidents in a story or drama propel the action, reveal aspects of a character or provoke a decision.”

The Common Core does not dictate what stories these kids will be reading or what textbooks schools should use and does not prescribe reading lists, except for a few obvious essentials, including America’s founding documents and a bit of Shakespeare.

Third, the Common Core is not some new and untried pedagogical experiment. Much of it leans on traditional methods that have proved themselves over time. Kids are taught phonics in the early grades. They learn times tables and memorize the formulas for areas and volumes.

The standards encourage more use of informational texts and literary nonfiction to build background knowledge and vocabulary that will be useful in the real world. But the Common Core does not stint on literature. By the end of high school, nonfiction would account for 70 percent of the total reading material in all subjects. That still leaves a lot of room for the classics."

Nothing of the sort transpired, as we all know now. Five years later, Obama and his acolytes can’t wait to trash members of the GOP who dare stretch a toe over the ideological line toward the President.

Two new examples: a MoveOn.org effort to paint Paul Ryan (R-WI) as racist for using the term “anchor babies” in an immigration talk, and Organizing for Action branding Marco Rubio (R-FL) a “climate denier.”

Both Ryan and Rubio have been generally supportive of the “Gang of 8” Senate immigration bill, one that most conservatives have unabashedly decried.

This afternoon, a group of liberal Wisconsinites will gather at Monument Square in Racine, WI to demand Ryan apologize for using an “offensive anti-immigrant slur”–anchor babies–while discussing immigration reform. The petition began on MoveOn.org’s online petition platform.

A press release announcing the protest featured this battle cry:

As a former vice-presidential nominee and key player in the GOP’s future, Rep. Ryan knows better than to resort to language that only serves to rile up the fringe, anti-immigrant segment of his party. If he wants to attract Republican voters to truly bipartisan reform efforts, this isn’t the way to do it.

That comes on the heels of Obama’s constant campaign arm saying Rubio publicly mocked basic science by not falling in lockstep surrounding the left’s global warming hysteria. Here’s some of the text Organizing for Action sent to its members:

If we want to make progress on climate change, we need everyone in Congress on board for a solution. It’s our job to show them there’s a price to pay for being a climate denier.

Hope and Change? More like Chicago-style politics powered by a dash of Thought Police enforcement."

""We have interviewed a lot of candidates this year and Matt Bevin is one of the very best. He's principled, passionate, and has Ted Cruz-like courage,” said Matt Hoskins, the group’s executive director, referring to Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, who led the fight to shut down government in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

After the Republican New Jersey Senate candidate she supported lost Wednesday night, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin suggested that Kentucky might be her next project. [...] ""We're going to shake things up in 2014,"" Palin wrote. ""Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky —which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi — from sea to shining sea we will not give up. We've only just begun to fight.""

The Senate Conservatives Fund, a conservative political action committee founded by Heritage CEO Jim DeMint when he was in the U.S. Senate, has endorsed Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin, who is running a tea party challenge against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky GOP Senate primary next May. Louisville Courier-Journal: So, if Kentucky Republicans are looking for the second coming of Ted Cruz, SCF says Matt Bevin is their man. And it appears as though he'll make his case with Sarah Palin on his side (emphasis added):Palin didn't specifically mention Bevin, but it's clear from the context that she was talking about endorsing him. As far primaries are concerned, Palin's 2012 track record was decent—she made five endorsements in contested Senate primaries and her preferred candidate won in four of those cases, though she also endorsed Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign, and we all know how that turned out.

Bevin has yet to show any major fundraising or polling success, but he has been willing to put at least some of his money into the campaign—he's loaned more than a half-million dollars so far to his effort. Still, there's six months to go before the primary, and primaries tend to not take shape until the last few weeks of the campaign, so even though Mitch McConnell claims he's focused on Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes (who leads McConnell in the latest polling) it's clear he's still got a primary race ahead of him."

The State Department has become adjunct to the Israeli Foreign Minister’s office …

Wow. A very bold statement by Hagel bound to further raise the ire of the “Jewish Lobby” (yawn), but it does express his strong belief in a comprehensive solution to problems in the Middle East. Hagel mentioned this theme several times —comprehensive, he said, in the sense that all tools should be used to achieve American foreign policy objectives (diplomatic, political, economic, and military), but also comprehensive in the James Baker sense of addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict holistically as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have proved too lazy and too incompetent to do.

Two campaign committees in California are being ordered to pay a total of $15 million to the state, a sum equivalent to the donations they received, which regulators said were improperly reported. Two Arizona nonprofits, one linked to billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch, will pay a combined $1-million fine as part of a settlement.

The nonprofits are not being required to reveal their donors’ identities, even though disclosure was at the root of the investigation. Under existing campaign finance laws, the state cannot force the groups to release the names, officials said.

“California law doesn’t provide adequate disclosure of political contributions made through dark-money nonprofits,” said Fair Political Practices Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, who announced the investigation’s resolution Thursday along with the commission’s largest-ever penalties.

The case highlighted how some big-ticket donors have sought to influence political campaigns by relying on off-the-books methods. Anonymous donations have exploded in popularity since 2010, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United case that many nonprofits can spend unlimited money on elections.

The controversial donations in California last year bankrolled two of the biggest conservative election causes: derailing Gov. Jerry Brown’s ultimately successful tax hike and supporting an unsuccessful ballot measure intended to limit unions’ political power.

Only a haphazardly redacted list of names, uncovered by state officials through their investigation, provides clues to some of the original donors’ identities.

Charles Schwab, the San Francisco investor, gave $6.4 million. The Fisher family, owners of clothing retailer Gap Inc., where Brown’s wife was once an executive, donated more than $9 million.

Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad provided $1 million, despite his public support for higher taxes on high-earning Californians. And casino owner Sheldon Adelson, one of the biggest Republican donors in the country, and his wife gave $500,000. B. Wayne Hughes, founder of Public Storage, donated $450,000.

None could be reached for comment.

The donors gave to Americans for Job Security, a Virginia trade association, as a first step in what officials characterized as a scheme designed to hide the original sources of campaign money. As the money was channeled to California, some of the transfers were not properly disclosed and therefore violated state law, officials said.

Thursday’s announcement drew mixed reactions from experts and advocates, who praised state officials for their aggressive probe and expressed concern about loopholes in disclosure laws across the country.

It’s rare for regulators to pursue such cases, said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington: “Voters don’t have the information they need to make informed decisions on election day.”

Phil Ung of California Common Cause, an advocacy group that filed the original complaint about the controversial donations last year, said new laws will be necessary to dissuade secret donors.

“You know they’ll be back. And they’ll be more sophisticated,” he said.

The donations that were routed through the Arizona nonprofits were solicited by Tony Russo, a California-based Republican political consultant, according to state officials.

Russo did not return calls requesting comment. But a state interview transcript shows he told investigators he wanted to use nonprofits to help with California campaigns.

“Koch, our understanding was, had a pretty significant network of groups,” Russo said. “So that’s why we went to Sean.”

Russo was referring to Sean Noble, a political operative who has worked with the Kochs and is president of the Arizona-based Center to Protect Patient Rights.

Donors wanted to remain secret, Russo said, “because of all the risk [of retribution] involved with the unions,” the interview transcript shows, and Noble seemed interested in helping.

A spokesman for the Koch brothers and their company, Robert Tappan, said they had no involvement in the battles over Propositions 30 or 32.

Officials said Russo offered donors two options: provide money directly to a California group called the Small Business Action Committee and have your identities revealed, or give to Americans for Job Security, and remain anonymous because the law does not require that group to identify its donors.

The money sent to Americans for Job Security was intended for “issue advocacy,” meaning advertising that doesn’t expressly urge Californians to vote one way or another. Because of laws on how and when such funds can be used, the group passed the money to the Center to Protect Patient Rights in Arizona.

The center then sent $11 million to a Phoenix group, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which provided it to the Small Business Action Committee.

In another transaction, using a separate source of money, the Center to Protect Patient Rights provided more than $4 million to the America Future Fund in Iowa, which relayed the money to the California Future Fund for Free Markets, a campaign committee supporting Proposition 32.

The settlement the state reached with the two Arizona nonprofits said violations of California law were inadvertent, and the investigation did not result in any criminal charges.

Kirk Adams, president of Americans for Responsible Leadership, said people who have a problem with anonymous political money “can take it up with the First Amendment.”

“What’s happened here is an attempt to intimidate groups like ours from participating in California politics,” Adams said.

Representatives from the Small Business Action Committee said they plan to fight the $11-million penalty.

The Republican candidate, Joe Lhota, campaigned on warnings that De Blasio, a staunch liberal who has served as the city’s public advocate since 2010, would drag New York back to the days of sky-high crime, no-go neighborhoods and racial tension.

But throughout the campaign, opinion polls showed Lhota, who was deputy mayor under Rudolph Giuliani and who last year served as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, lagging about 40 percentage points behind De Blasio.

De Blasio, 52, went to his polling place with his wife and children, who became something of a campaign issue when critics accused the Democrat of exploiting their multi-racialism. De Blasio’s wife is black, he is white, and his telegenic son and daughter proved a hit with voters when they starred in TV ads for their father.

“This morning is an extraordinary moment for me and my family,” De Blasio said after voting. “It has been a very, very long journey, and to get to this morning at our polling site, in our neighborhood, to finally cast our vote is an incredibly emotional moment.”

Lhota said he would not have changed anything about his campaign, even though political experts said he was a lackluster candidate who waited too long to attack De Blasio as soft on crime.

“Everything I’ve done I wanted to,” Lhota, 59, said after voting in Brooklyn. “I’m very optimistic about tonight.”

The election closed out a campaign with no shortage of unexpected twists, including the May arrival into the Democratic primary race of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner, who was forced to resign his congressional seat in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, shook up a Democratic field that had long been led by the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn.

Quinn, hoping to become the city’s first female and first openly gay mayor, lost ground to Weiner. She suffered further as the other Democrats seized on her close relationship with the outgoing mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, and blamed her for enabling him to serve a third term.

As Weiner lost backers after admitting to more online relationships with women, much of his support went to De Blasio.

De Blasio also won points with black and Latino New Yorkers by bashing as racial profiling the police department’s stop-and-frisk tactic in high-crime neighborhoods.

De Blasio vowed to fire the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, if elected. He also said he would fund educational programs with a tax on New York residents earning $500,000 a year – something that would require state legislative action.

Both promises helped catapult him over six other candidates to clinch the ballot spot without a runoff.

Lhota’s closest primary rival was a billionaire supermarket magnate, John Catsimatidis, a political novice. He portrayed Lhota as a heartless cat-hater after the former transit chief questioned the wisdom of officials closing a subway line for hours so that kittens lost on the track could be saved.

“I’m not the anti-kitten candidate,” Lhota declared as he sought to defend himself at one of the Republican debates.

In the end, he easily defeated Catsimatidis on primary day, but he never was able to make a dent in De Blasio’s huge lead.

The Democrat had a built-in advantage because of the city’s political makeup. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 5 to 1. De Blasio also benefited from the controversy over stop-and-frisk, which many blacks and Latinos – who overwhelmingly support De Blasio – say unfairly targets them.

In addition, polls showed that voters were ready for a change after 12 years under Bloomberg, whom De Blasio portrayed as out-of-touch with working-class New Yorkers.

He and Lhota both tried to present themselves as far different from Bloomberg, whom they portrayed as Manhattan-centric and too focused on billionaires and big business to notice regular residents’ problems.

Bloomberg did not endorse either candidate, saying he didn’t want to interfere in the race, but said Tuesday he believed he was leaving the nation’s largest city in good shape.

“We’ve made a lot of progress that I don’t think should be turned back,” said Bloomberg, whose legacy will include a legal battle over one of his most controversial moves: the banning of super-size sugary drinks to combat obesity in the city. De Blasio has said he supports the effort; Lhota opposed it.

Bloomberg, who was elected as a Republican but switched to an independent, won praise from many moderate Democrats for pushing for stricter gun control measures nationwide – a fight he was able to fund with his own wealth – and for making the city more pedestrian-friendly with bike lanes and pedestrian malls. He took on obesity and other health issues by ushering in smoking bans and crackdowns on trans-fats, and by trying to limit soda sizes.

But as demographic shifts brought more racial diversity to New York and raised the number of Democrats, even fans of Bloomberg said it was time to take the city in another direction.

“I like what he’s done for the city in terms of the bike lanes and bringing businesses here, and I think he’s right to worry about our health,” said Jonathan Simpson, who voted for Bloomberg in past elections. “But New York is more than a bunch of skyscrapers and rich people in Manhattan, so that’s why I think we need to have someone totally different like De Blasio in office for awhile.”

Bloomberg said he wasn’t worried about the changes that the next mayor might bring, noting that candidates often make promises that fall by the wayside.

“The real issue is not what they said during the campaigns,” Bloomberg said after voting. “The real issue is what do they do when they get elected?”

(CNN) - New Jersey Democrat and gubernatorial hopeful Barbara Buono released a new web video Monday–but it's not the ad getting the most attention in the Garden State these days.

Republican Gov. Chris Christie is taking heat for his role in a new tourism ad for his state following the devastating impact of Superstorm Sandy.



The television commercial, released last week, is part of a $25 million tourism campaign using federal funds to promote the Jersey Shore this summer.

So what's the problem?

Christie, who's running for re-election this year, makes a cameo in the 30-second spot, prompting some critics to say the potential 2016 presidential contender is using federal taxpayer dollars to boost his political image.

After Congress delayed sending tens of billions in relief aid to Northeastern states at the beginning of this year, Christie went on a blistering critique of Washington lawmakers during a now-famous press conference.

""We respond to innocent victims of natural disasters, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans,"" he said, adding politics was trumping the needs of U.S. citizens. ""For me, it was disappointing and disgusting to watch.""

The Star-Ledger in New Jersey noted in a biting editorial Sunday that it's not the people who are most bouncing back from the story who get to star in the tourism ad–it's the state's governor, who already gets plenty of air time and positive ratings as the public face of state recovery efforts.

""(It's) not the small business owners working to get back on their feet. Not shore residents trying to rebuild, or their kids,"" the editorial stated. ""Not even celebrities, as in the 'Fall in Love with Louisiana All Over Again ad campaign after Hurricane Katrina, which featured local stars who participated for free. Were Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi simply unavailable?""

Christie may face more questions Monday when he makes a media appearance on the Lavallette Boardwalk.

The governor and his family appear in the ad for about five seconds at the end, as they sit on the shore and declare the state is ""stronger than the storm.""

Christie has argued in defense that ""there's nothing political about the ads"" and his aides point out that the commercials won't even be running in New Jersey itself, according to the Star Ledger.

But the editorial asked that ""given Christie's presidential ambitions, is it any surprise that he'd use federal relief dollars to splash his face all over TV in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Canada – in addition to ads in print, on the radio and Internet?""

Colin Reed, a spokesman for the governor, told CNN the move was a creative decision by the Stronger Than The Storm campaign to include Christie and his wife in the ad.

""They are in a uniquely qualified position to tell a very wide audience beyond New Jersey that our state and our Shore is open for business,"" he said.

Christie saw a surge in his poll numbers during the aftermath of the storm, a popularity that he's maintained in the last six months.

Recent surveys also indicate the governor has a strong advantage over his Democratic opponent in this year's gubernatorial race.

In Buono's new web ad, the state senator takes a light-hearted approach in telling voters how to say her often-mispronounced name. She has been vastly outspent by Christie in ads."

The Eisenhauer (German for “iron hewer”) family migrated from Germany. The Eisenhower family settled in York, Pennsylvania, in 1730, and in the 1880s they moved to Kansas. At some point the German name Eisenhauer was changed to a more American spelling of Eisenhower. Dwight’s father, David Jacob Eisenhower, was a college educated engineer. Eisenhower’s mother, Ida Elizabeth Stover, born in Virginia of German Lutheran ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She met David Eisenhower when they were both attending college, and they married in September 1885. David owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 to their name. David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery. By 1898, the family was self-sustaining with suitable accommodations for their large family, and set about on doing just that. Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, the third of seven boys. All of the boys were called “Ike”, such as “Big Ike” (Edgar) and “Little Ike” (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name. As a child, Dwight was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye; he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him. Dwight attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909. He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college, though they lacked the funds. They agreed to take alternate years at college while the other worked, in order to earn the tuitions. Edgar went to college first while Dwight was worked as a night supervisor at a creamery. At the end of the year Edgar pleaded for a second year in college as he was enjoying it so much, and Dwight deferred to his brother and continued working. During that second year a friend was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school, since no tuition was required. Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy. He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911. At West Point Dwight as at best an average student, and graduated in the middle of the class of 1915. Dwight was first stationed in Texas, and it was there that me met and fell in love with Mamie Geneva Doud, his beloved “Mamie”. He proposed to her on Valentine’s Day in 1916, and they were married on July 1 of that year, and remained married for the next 53 years, until Dwight’s death in 1969. Dwight had a very successful military career, continually promoted to higher and higher positions. In December 1943, President Roosevelt appointed Eisenhower Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Eisenhower planned and led the famous D-Day Invasion of Normandy, and the subsequent operations that led to the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany less than one year later.

General Eisenhower was immensely popular for his successes in WWII, and As the 1948 election approached, Eisenhower was repeatedly urged by both the Democrats and Republicans to run for president. President Truman even offering to serve as his Vice-President if he would agree to run as president on the Democratic ticket. Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. He firmly declined all the offers and many believed he was foregoing his only opportunity to be president – Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would then be too old. Despite a certain Chicago newspaper headline proclaiming otherwise, Truman defeated Dewy. In 1951 President Truman again pressed Eisenhower to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disdain for the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A “Draft Eisenhower” movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert Taft, who he narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination. Eisenhower ran a strong campaign and defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide, the first Republican elected President in 20 years. He also managed to bring with a Republican majority in Congress, also the first time in 20 years. Eisenhower’s campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, “I Like Ike”.



Eisenhower was reelected in 1956, defeating Stevenson a second time, in an even greater landslide. Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of a moderate, progressive Republicanism: He said: “I have just one purpose … and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it … before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won’t be with them anymore.” He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation and expanded Social Security programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948, actual implementation had been slow. Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union message in February 1953, saying “I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces“. When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through. The day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools were unconstitutional, Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children. He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. In 1957, the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision. Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order. When Faubus balked, the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division. They escorted and protected nine black students’ entry to Little Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, for the first time since the Reconstruction era.



We baby boomers look back at the Eisenhower years as a period of peace and prosperity, with strong economic growth and an ever increasing middle class. It was the time when television took it’s place in the American home, and families would gather round to watch shows like Leave it to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy. It was Eisenhower who nominated Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, leading the “Warren Court” to make so many decisions that led to much greater equality and justice in our country: Brown v. Board of Education, that banned racial segregation of public schools. Gideon v. Wainwright, which that all criminal defendants receive publicly funded defense counsel if they could not afford one themselves. Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the “Miranda Warning”, that everyone charged with a crime must be advised of his rights to remain silent until he has been advised by an attorney. And two of Eisenhower’s greatest legislative achievements still foster and promote economic growth today. In cooperation with Canada, we built the St. Lawrence Seaway, a series of canals and channels that connected all the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River, opening up ports deep in our Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean. And it was Eisenhower who pushed through and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. He managed to overcome opposition claiming the project was “too expensive” and that we “couldn’t afford it” (sound familiar?) by promoting it as essential to American security during the Cold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers. But he also believed an interstate highway system would lead to greater economic growth, and he was right.

Although known for, and probably elected President, as a great military leader, Eisenhower knew first hand the horrors of war and deftly kept us out of war. And it was Dwight Eisenhower who first warned us of the dangers of the Military-Industrial Complex:

“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.""

On Fox News Sunday this morning former Senator and Republican Presidential Candidate Bob Dole said that he didn’t think he could make it in today’s Republican Party, and he didn’t think Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon could either. I thinks he’s right, and would certainly add Dwight D. Eisenhower to the list. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a thoughtful man, a decent man, a man of principle, a man committed to doing what was right - right for the country, right for it's people, not what's just best for his own political party. And people like that need not apply to today's Republican Party.

But, I'll leave it at that. Memorial Day should not be a day for partisan politics. It is a day to honor people like Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Greatest Generation would saved us from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. It is day to honor the millions of brave men and women who serve and served with honor, distinction, and bravery wearing the uniform of our great nation. All gave some, and some gave all. God bless them, God bless their families. And may God bless every one else in this world, bless them and get them to see that war and violence should have no place in this world. More than enough have died, more than enough have suffered."

Believing they are losing the messaging war with progressives, a group of prominent conservatives in Washington—including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and journalists from Breitbart News and the Washington Examiner—has been meeting privately since early this year to concoct talking points, coordinate messaging, and hatch plans for ""a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,"" according to documents obtained by Mother Jones.

Dubbed Groundswell, this coalition convenes weekly in the offices of Judicial Watch, the conservative legal watchdog group. During these hush-hush sessions and through a Google group, the members of Groundswell—including aides to congressional Republicans—cook up battle plans for their ongoing fights against the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, progressive outfits, and the Republican establishment and ""clueless"" GOP congressional leaders. They devise strategies for killing immigration reform, hyping the Benghazi controversy, and countering the impression that the GOP exploits racism. And the Groundswell gang is mounting a behind-the-scenes organized effort to eradicate the outsize influence of GOP über-strategist/pundit Karl Rove within Republican and conservative ranks. (For more on Groundswell's ""two front war"" against Rove—a major clash on the right—click here.)

At the March 27 meeting, Groundswell participants discussed one multipurpose theme they had been deploying for weeks to bash the president on a variety of fronts, including immigration reform and the sequester: Obama places ""politics over public safety."" In a display of Groundswell's message-syncing, members of the group repeatedly flogged this phrase in public. Frank Gaffney penned a Washington Times op-ed titled ""Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Tom Fitton headlined a Judicial Watch weekly update ""Politics over Public Safety: More Illegal Alien Criminals Released by Obama Administration.""

http://news.yahoo.com/shutdown-showdown-widened-gop-tea-party-rift-191705968.html,,[],Shutdown showdown widened GOP-tea party rift,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republicans' clear defeat in the budget-debt brawl has widened the rift between the Grand Old Party and the blossoming tea party movement that helped revive it.

Implored by House Speaker John Boehner to unite and ""fight another day"" against President Barack Obama and Democrats, Republicans instead intensified attacks on one another, an ominous sign in advance of more difficult policy fights and the 2014 midterm elections.

The tea party movement spawned by the passage of Obama's health care overhaul three years ago put the GOP back in charge of the House and in hot pursuit of the law's repeal. The effort hit a wall this month in the budget and debt fight, but tea partyers promised to keep up the effort.

Whatever the future of the law, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell vowed he would not permit another government shutdown.

""I think we have now fully acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is,"" McConnell said in an interview with The Hill newspaper.

Tea party Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told ABC News he wouldn't rule out using the tactic again, when the same budget and debt questions come up next year.

""I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,"" Cruz said.

That divide defined the warring Republican factions ahead of the midterm elections, when 35 seats in the Democratic-controlled Senate and all 435 seats in the Republican-dominated House will be on the ballot. In the nearer term, difficult debates over immigration and farm policy loom, along with another round of budget and debt talks.

The animosity only intensified as lawmakers fled Washington this week for a few days' rest.

The Twitterverse crackled with threats, insults and the names of the 27 GOP senators and 87 GOP House members who voted for the leadership's agreement that reopened the government and raised the nation's borrowing limit. Republicans got none of their demands, keeping only the spending cuts they had won in 2011.

Story continues

Within hours, TeaParty.net tweeted a link to the 114 lawmakers, tagging each as a Republican in name only who should be turned out of office: ""Your 2014 #RINO hunting list!""

""We shouldn't have to put up with fake conservatives like Mitch McConnell,"" read a fundraising letter Thursday from the Tea Party Victory Fund Inc.

Another group, the Senate Conservatives Fund, announced it was endorsing McConnell's GOP opponent, Louisville, Ky., businessman Matt Bevin.

""Mitch McConnell has the support of the entire Washington establishment and he will do anything to hold on to power,"" the group, which raised nearly $2 million for tea party candidates in last year's elections, announced. ""But if people in Kentucky and all across the country rise up and demand something better, we're confident Matt Bevin can win this race.""

The same group pivoted to the Mississippi Senate race, where Republican Thad Cochran is weighing whether to seek a seventh term. Cochran voted for the McConnell-Reid deal, so the Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed a primary opponent, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a private attorney the group says ""will fight to stop Obamacare,"" ''is not part of the Washington establishment"" and ""has the courage to stand up to the big spenders in both parties.""

There were more tea party targets: Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee also are seeking re-election.

To her Facebook friends, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin posted: ""We're going to shake things up in 2014. Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky — which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi.""

Opponents of the tea party strategy to make ""Obamacare"" the centerpiece of the budget fight seethed over what they said was an exercise in self destruction. Many clamored for Boehner and McConnell, the nation's highest-ranking Republicans, to impose some discipline, pointing to polls that showed public approval of Congress plummeting to historic lows and that most Americans blamed Republicans for the government shutdown.

A Pew Research Center poll released this week showed public favorability for the Tea Party dropped to its lowest level since driving the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 elections. An AP-Gfk poll showed that 70 percent now hold unfavorable views of the Tea Party.

And yet, House Republican leaders tried again and again to resolve the standoff the tea party's way — by demanding limits on Obamacare in exchange for reopening the government — until they ran of options and accepted the bipartisan deal.

""When your strategy doesn't work, or your tactic doesn't work, you lose credibility in your conference,"" said Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., referring to the tea partyers' tactics. ""Clearly the leadership followed certain members' tactics, certain members' strategies, and they proved not to be all that successful. So I would hope that we learn from the past.""

""I do believe the outside groups have really put us in this position,"" said Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., referring to the Heritage Foundation's political campaign arm and other organizations demanding fealty to their ideology. Those groups ""have worked in conjunction with members of Congress and with Tea Party groups pushing a strategy that was never going to work.""

Tea partyers hold a contrary view. Boehner, they say, solidified his standing as the GOP's leader by holding the line against compromise as long as he did. And the standoff, they add, has increased their movement's clout.

""I think it builds credibility, because I think Democrats did not think that we would press this,"" said Rep. John Fleming, R-La. ""And now they know that we will, and that we might do it again."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/opinion/a-new-danger-to-campaign-law.html,2013-08-17 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],A New Danger to Campaign Law - The New York Times,"Republican operatives are charging forward with their efforts to sabotage the Federal Election Commission in its lawful obligation to police campaign abuses. The six-member commission is evenly divided between the two parties, but the Republican vice chairman, Donald McGahn, has spent his tenure as a partisan obstructionist, adroitly engineering 3-to-3 standoff votes to block penalties and other recommendations by staff investigators who uncover abuses by big-money campaigners.

Now Mr. McGahn aims to take advantage of a temporary Democratic vacancy and 3-to-2 Republican edge to push through rules that would make total lackeys of commission staff members by blocking them from the usual sharing of information with the Justice Department and other agencies. In his partisan cunning, Mr. McGahn would even bar them from looking into possible violations publicly reported in news media and on the Internet.

It is critically important when the commission meets next week that this attempt to gut investigative procedures be kept off the agenda until a full, six-member panel is in place. Two nominees — to fill the vacancy and to replace Mr. McGahn, whose term is up — await approval in the Senate. Washington’s major watchdog groups have said that the McGahn proposal would gravely undermine campaign law and that the issue is of such importance that it should be taken up only by a full panel.

Predictably, Mr. McGahn is muddying things by suggesting darkly that F.E.C. staff members may have conspired with the Internal Revenue Service in its investigation into right-wing political groups seeking tax exemption. There is no evidence that they did, but that has not deterred Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House oversight committee, from lending loud support to Mr. McGahn’s crusade."

Terry Branstad told Karl Rove to keep his new super PAC, which some conservatives believe was created to wage war on them, out of Iowa’s Republican primaries.

“I basically told Karl Rove that what he was doing is counter-productive and he needs to stay out of it,” Branstad told the Associated Press last Friday. “If some outside group that has no connection to Iowa attacks somebody from Iowa, that is not smart.”

After Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, announced he would be retiring from the Senate in January, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) indicated he may be interested in pursuing the Senate seat, which has been held by a Democrat for 30 years, in 2014.

Rove’s group promptly decided to smear King a week later, indicating he would be a Republican against whom the group would try to obliterate with negative ads in a potential Iowa GOP Senate primary.

After Rove leaked the details of his super PAC to the New York Times, American Crossroads President Steven Law blistered King in the same publication, telling the Times the group was “concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem” and that “all of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” These comments enraged King because they falsely implied King endorsed Akin’s views and comments about “legitimate rape,” which cost Akin Missouri’s Senate race in 2012.

“Nobody can bully me out of running,” King declared nearly a week ago, after learning of the comments.

And Branstad agrees, noting it would be a “mistake” if Rove’s super PAC went into Iowa and started running negative attacks to tear down King in favor of another candidate backed by the establishment Republican group.

Branstad’s comments are significant not only because he is the governor of the state that kicks off the presidential nomination process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses, but also because Branstad is a politician who has traditionally had good ties to the Republican establishment. Many outside groups, like Rove’s super PAC, are intending to use the 2014 elections as a test run for 2016.

Branstad was not alone in criticizing Rove’s intentions. Even a longtime Rove friend and former Iowa Republican Party chairman, Richard Schwarm, told the Associated Press he felt Rove’s super PAC was a mistake.

“I think that was a total backfire on Rove’s part,” the member of the Iowa Republican political establishment said."

According to sources close to the criminal investigation of Bachmann's presidential campaign, the FBI has now been given sworn testimony and documents alleging Bachmann approved secret payments to Iowa state Senator Kent Sorenson in exchange for his help and support in that state's 2012 Presidential caucuses. Ethics rules explicitly prohibit Iowa lawmakers from accepting payments from Presidential campaigns or PACs. Investigation sources tell Take Action News the FBI is examining money laundering allegations against Bachmann, as well as possible wire fraud and mail fraud.

As we detailed on my nationally syndicated radio and YouTube show Take Action News this past Saturday, the key claims against Bachmann are coming from two of her former campaign insiders -- former Congressional chief of staff Andy Parrish and former national field coordinator Pete Waldron. Waldron has filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission, alleging the payments to State Senator Sorenson were improper. Parrish has provided an affidavit to investigators, confirming Bachmann knew of and approved the payments.

I first broke this news on Take Action News in the clip above. Shameless plug: you can subscribe to video clips from the show for free at Youtube.com/takeactionnewstv.

The Iowa Senate Ethics Committee voted more than a month ago to appoint a special investigator to determine whether State Senator Sorenson was guilty of violating Iowa state ethics rules prohibiting direct or indirect employment from a political action committee. The Committee's ongoing investigation of Sorenson is based on Waldron's FEC complaint and Parrish's testimony.

It's not unusual for a political campaign, with all of the paperwork and forms required by the FEC, to make mistakes. Furthermore, many U.S. lawmakers have been fined by the FEC for improper fundraising, spending, and misleading accounting records.



The Bachmann case, though, is different. Her own team is alleging the campaign violations, and declaring that Bachmann knew about the actions in advance. Presumably, Bachmann -- like other Presidential candidates -- signed hundreds of disclosure reports filed with the federal government. If she lied on those reports, or mailed misleading financial statements, however, she may face serious legal trouble.

For her part, Bachmann has told friends that she did nothing wrong. ""It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,"" Bachmann said in her retirement announcement. ""And I have no reason to believe that that was not the case.""

Investigators have reason to believe otherwise, however. Was Bachmann's campaign involved in bribery? Money laundering? Or were her actions in this case just the industry standard for a high wire political campaign?

We may eventually get an answer from the FBI, and perhaps a federal prosecutor. In the meantime, the Michele Bachmann circus is going to remain on the national stage."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Threatened by the Armageddon Caucus,"Are you ready for the Big Magilla of American politics? This fall, every important domestic issue could crash into every other: health-care reform, autopilot budget cuts, a government shutdown, even a default on the national debt.

If I were betting, I’d wager that we will somehow avoid a total meltdown. House Speaker John Boehner seems desperate to get around his party’s Armageddon Caucus.

But after three years of congressional dysfunction brought on by the rise of a radicalized brand of conservatism, it’s time to call the core questions:

Will our ability to govern ourselves be held perpetually hostage to an ideology that casts government as little more than dead weight in American life? And will a small minority in Congress be allowed to grind decision-making to a halt?

Congress is supposed to be the venue in which we Americans work our way past divisions that are inevitable in a large and diverse democracy. Yet for some time, Republican congressional leaders have given the most right-wing members of the House and Senate a veto power that impedes compromise, and thus governing itself.

On the few occasions when the far-right veto was lifted, Congress got things done, courtesy of a middle-ground majority that included most Democrats and the more moderately conservative Republicans. That’s how Congress passed the modest tax increases on the well-off that have helped reduce the deficit, as well as the Violence Against Women Act and assistance for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

All these actions had something in common: They were premised on the belief that government can take practical steps to make American life better.

This idea is dismissed by those ready to shut down the government or to use the debt ceiling as a way of forcing the repeal or delay of the Affordable Care Act and passing more draconian spending reductions. It needs to be made very clear that these radical Republicans are operating well outside their party’s own constructive traditions.

Before their 2010 election victory, Republicans had never been willing to use the threat of default to achieve their goals. The GOP tried a government shutdown back in the mid-1990s, but it was a political disaster. Experienced Republicans are trying to steer their party away from the brink, the very place where politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and a group of fourscore or so House members want it to go.

Particularly instructive is the effort to repeal health-care reform. The very fact that everyone now accepts the term “Obamacare” to refer to a measure designed to get health insurance to many more Americans is a sign of how stupidly partisan we have become. We never described Medicare as “Johnsoncare.” We didn’t label Social Security “FDRsecurity.”

Tying the whole thing to Obama disguises the fact that most of the major provisions of the law he fought for had their origins among conservatives and Republicans.

The health-care exchanges to facilitate the purchase of private insurance were based on a Heritage Foundation proposal, first brought to fruition in Massachusetts by a Republican governor named Mitt Romney. Subsidizing private premiums was always a Republican alternative to extending Medicare to cover everyone, the remedy preferred by many liberals.

Conservatives even once favored the individual mandate to buy insurance, as MSNBC columnist Tim Noah pointed out. “Many states now require passengers in automobiles to wear seatbelts for their own protection,” the Heritage Foundation’s Stuart Butler said back in 1989. “Many others require anybody driving a car to have liability insurance.” Since all of us will use health care at some point, Butler argued reasonably, it makes sense to have us all in the insurance pool.

But that was then. The right wing’s recent rejection of a significant government role in ending the scandal of “a health-care system that does not even come close to being comprehensive and fails to reach far too many” — the words were spoken 24 years ago by the late Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican — tells us why Congress no longer works.

The GOP has gone from endorsing market-based government solutions to problems the private sector can’t solve — i.e, Obamacare — to believing that no solution involving expanded government can possibly be good for the country.

Ask yourself: If conservatives still believed in what both left and right once saw as a normal approach to government, would they speak so cavalierly about shutting it down or risking its credit? This is what’s at stake in the Big Magilla.

Metaphor? Yes.

Rep. Greg Walden’s absence from the Anaheim gathering exemplified the shadow the Capitol standoff has cast across grass-roots Republicans eying next year’s elections. In Anaheim, as in Washington, the mood among Republicans seemed to meld support for the goals of GOP congressional leaders and an expectation that Republicans would pay a price for them.

Everyone at the event, from congressional Republicans on down, was trying to push blame for the shutdown onto Democrats, in defiance of national polls showing more Americans blame Republicans than President Obama or his party.

“I sure wish I could be with you in person, but as you’ve seen, a few things are going on in Washington as we fight to stand up for our Republican principles,” Walden, who represents a district in Oregon, said on the video played to a few hundred delegates.

“Getting anything done has been incredibly difficult as we have a president and a Democratically-controlled Senate who refuse even to even negotiate and work with Republicans to fund the government and make changes to Obamacare. Even on important nonpartisan issues like cancer funding and keeping the World War II memorial open to World War II veterans, the Democrats refuse to budge.”

He echoed what Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, had said a day earlier when she was asked if the federal government shutdown would harm Republican chances next year. She angrily denounced President Obama and Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, for their tactics and what she described as efforts to bait Republicans.

“If you look at it, they have truly become the ‘party of no’ in this battle,” she said, using a sobriquet frequently flung at Republicans. “I’d like to see the president and I’d like to see Harry Reid stop throwing around statements and comments that are not helpful and I’d like them to sit down and compromise. …

“If you remember, it was the senators who didn’t show up to work on the bill while the Republican Congress worked till midnight. It was the president that played golf while the Republican Congress individuals continued to work and try to find solutions.”

Inevitably, however, she turned to the impact.

“Does it have an impact? I guess it will have an impact,” she said, her body language implying the fallout would be negative: “But the right thing is what I believe -- what the Congress is doing is trying to find solutions, unlike the president and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who just simply say, ‘I want it all, I want it now and I don’t care what your compromises are, I’m not even going to show up to work and do my job.’”

Jim Brulte, the state Republican Party chairman, declined to say whether he thought Republicans would pay for the shutdown. But an analogy he drew — the fact that President George H. W. Bush was intensely popular in 1991 and lost his reelection race in 1992 — suggested he thought the fallout for Republicans might be short-lived.

“For anyone to suggest that they know what’s going to happen in November of 2014 based on what’s happening in October of 2013 is either a prophet or a fool,” he said. “And I may be one, but I try not to be either of them.”

[…] One former RNC field staffer, who is Hispanic, described a culture of cynicism among his predominantly white colleagues when it came to minority outreach. He said that in his office, whenever they were notified of a new Republican outreach effort, they would pass around a Beanie Baby — which they had dubbed the ""pander bear"" — and make fun of the ""tokenism.""

He also recalled a Mitt Romney rally last year featuring Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, during which the staffer and his coworkers were tasked with finding Hispanics in the crowd who they could place on stage for the benefit of the TV cameras. It's a common, bipartisan practice in campaign politics — but one that his colleagues resented. ""My white peers were clearly not understanding what a powerful image a Hispanic senator standing in front of a sea of Hispanic Romney supporters would be,"" he said. ""They grumbled about it, treated it like a chore. Not racist or anything like that, just didn't understand why they were doing it.""

Who would have figured that Republican efforts at minority outreach have not been entirely sincere? No, really!Anytime you have to explain to someone that your crowd is ""not racist,"" but, you may have a problem. Anytime you try to hold a panel discussion on how not to be a racist only to have it interrupted by racists, you may have a problem. Anytime your minority outreach efforts have been assigned their own mocking Beanie Baby mascot by the office staff, you might just have a problem. (Then again, asking staffers to go out and find Hispanic Mitt Romney supporters in the crowd does sound like a special kind of torture.)

This points to the rather awkward problem faced by the GOP in their new ""minority outreach"" efforts. They know they're insincere, and everyone else knows they're insincere, so the entire episode has the element of farce built into it from the get-go. While Reince Preibus touts his new $10 million plan to have actual Republicans go out and talk to actual black and brown people, $10 million is not much of an ad budget when the rest of your organization has gone all-out on mocking and despising the very concept of diversity for more decades than most of your target audience has been alive.

Also a core part of this story: The ongoing cat fight between ex-RNC chair Michael Steele and the suit-wearing pickled egg that took over that slot, Reince Preibus. Steele's obvious disgust at Preibus and, by extension, the entire party apparatus propping him up gets funnier the longer it goes on."

In remarks on the Senate floor, the Nevada Democrat called it a “disturbing trend” that Republicans have blocked or delayed some of President Obama’s appointees even when their qualifications are not in doubt, bogging them down “with unreasonable demands.”

He cited an earlier filibuster of Chuck Hagel to be Defense secretary and continued delays in the confirmation of Obama’s picks to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Labor Department and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. The obstruction, Reid said, “has continued at every level and through creative new methods.”

“They’re blocking qualified nominees because they refuse to accept the law of the land,” he said, adding that the American people “know the Senate hasn’t worked. And we need to do something to change that.”

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

Reid was convening a meeting of Senate Democrats to outline the strategy for implementing rules changes that would streamline the process for confirming executive appointments, and possibly most judicial nominations, by simple majority votes, limiting the use of the filibuster to legislation. The filibuster is part of the Senate rules and can be changed by a majority vote.

The Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, bitterly protested the threat to employ what he called the “nuclear option,” saying it would be “one of the most consequential changes to the United States Senate in the history of our nation.”

“This is no small matter,” he said. “And I guarantee you it’s a decision that if they actually go through with it they will live to regret.”

The Kentucky Republican said Reid was manufacturing a crisis to appease Democratic allies in labor and the party’s liberal base to replace the Senate mandate of “advise and consent” with “sit down and shut up.”

He noted that every Obama Cabinet choice brought to the Senate floor for a vote this year has been confirmed and maintained that it was Reid’s decision not to schedule votes on other nominations that is holding them up, not Republican obstruction.

Reid countered that he has no such power to unilaterally bring nominations to the floor, and that McConnell also proved his point – that some nominees who were eventually confirmed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities still had to wait more than a month to work through the confirmation process.

He even compared the situation to depriving the manager of Washington’s baseball team, the Nationals, with key players until long after the season had begun.

“We shouldn’t be waiting around here for months and months and months to get a vote,” he said.

Reid’s comments on the Senate floor to start Thursday’s session drew a number of Republicans to the chamber to protest. Some senators suggested that the full Senate convene in private – perhaps in the historic Old Senate Chamber – to have a fuller debate before acting. Reid said he might be open to such a discussion, but in the meantime would schedule votes on some of the controversial nominees.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his birth certificate on Sunday in an effort to curb speculation that he is ineligible to run for president.

The document, published by the Dallas Morning News, confirms that Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta to an American mother, immediately making Cruz a citizen of both the United States and Canada. As the Morning News points out, that means Cruz could run for office in Canada unless he later decided to renounce his Canadian citizenship.

However, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier denied the senator's dual citizenship.

“Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,” Frazier said. “To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.”

Cruz, first elected to the Senate last fall, has sparked early presidential speculation by making visits to key primary states like Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. He's also courted Republican donors at GOP functions in New York City and his home state of Texas.

Under the U.S. constitution, only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to run for president. While this definition includes individuals born overseas to an American parent -- like Cruz -- some have continued to raise questions about the freshman senator's eligibility for office if he chooses to run in 2016.

During an appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" earlier this month, business mogul and unapologetic skeptic of President Barack Obama's birth certificate Donald Trump suggested that Cruz was ""perhaps not"" allowed to run for higher office.

""I don't know the circumstances. I heard somebody told me he was born in Canada. That's really his thing,"" Trump said."

Critics say Christie protecting his image in advance of 2016 presidential run

Christie spokesman dismisses criticism

TRENTON, N.J. -- In advance of an expected 2016 presidential campaign, Chris Christie's administration is stepping up efforts to control the Republican governor's image at all costs — even skirting sunshine laws that permit public access to government records.

Getting the Christie administration to release its grip of records tracking use of federal recovery money for Superstorm Sandy has been particularly difficult for watchdog groups and media outlets, including the Asbury Park Press.

The Fair Share Housing Center recently received the first detailed information about housing recovery programs supported by federal grants — only after suing the administration for not complying with a public records request.

The Press has yet to receive Sandy recovery information the newspaper first sought four months ago. The Press asked for internal administration records from the contract bidding that resulted in Christie and his family starring in TV commercials for the $25 million ""Stronger Than the Storm"" tourism campaign.

In September, state officials told the Press a search had ""identified hundreds of potentially responsive documents"" and promised to begin sharing the information ""on a rolling basis"" starting in the second week of October.

For two months after the deadline, nothing was forthcoming — until some of the documents were released Friday, just hours after this story first appeared on the newspaper's APP.com website. State officials said more information would be available later this month.

""Withholding public records that, by law, have to be released is just government censorship by another name,"" said Hollis R. Towns, executive editor and vice president of news for the Press. ""When the state loses a public access battle in court, the taxpayers end up footing the legal bill for both sides, sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars. We hope that we do not have to sue, but we will if we have to protect the public's right to know under the law.""

Jeff Tittel, state director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said his pursuit of information from Christie's Department of Environmental Protection ""has been fought at every turn."" Tittel is a constant critic of the administration's environmental policies.

Tittel said Christie's national ambitions have led to tightened restrictions on the flow of government information to the public.

""Everything at this point is about Christie's image, and delaying and keeping records from you protects the brand,"" Tittel said. ""All administrations try to hide stuff, but the current administration has been the worst. They've taken it to a new art form because of Christie's pursuit of higher office. They are in lockdown mode.""

Christie's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, dismissed the criticism. He offered no explanation as to why responses to information requests have been delayed.

""The governor's press office is not involved in the OPRA process, which has always been a legal process in this administration and prior administrations,"" Drewniak said in an email.

Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, called the tactics ""standard operating procedure for the administration.""

""Is this a sign they are controlling his image? As opposed to the dozens of other signs over the past four years?"" said Murray, adding that Christie loyalists ""manage his image extremely well, and as of yet there has been no price to pay. Given the governor's personal popularity, the only thing that will get the public to reconsider their view of him is a smoking gun. And since this administration is airtight, there is no smoke.""

The 2002 Open Public Records Act lays out definitions of public records and also includes a uniform system for requesting records and responding to requests. The law says, in short, if the government holds a record, it must release it within seven business days or cite the specific law that exempts the record from public review. Criminal investigations, for example, are generally exempt. Budget documents are cited as being public."

Update 5:53 p.m. ET

Washington (CNN) - Senate Democrats dropped the filibuster bomb Thursday, and now the question is what kind of fallout will result from the so-called nuclear option.

By a 52-48 vote, the Senate ended the ability of minority Republicans to continue using filibusters to block some of President Barack Obama's judicial and executive nominations, despite the vehement objections of Republicans.



Majority Democrats then quickly acted on the change by ending a filibuster against one of Obama's nominees for a federal appeals court.

Obama later cited what he called ""an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress"" during his presidency for the move led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

""A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal,"" Obama said of the change. ""And for the sake of future generations, it cannot become normal.""

The man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it

Republicans warned the controversial move would worsen the already bitter partisan divide in Washington, complaining it took away a time-honored right for any member of the Senate minority party to filibuster.

""This changes everything, this changes everything,"" veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: ""They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.""

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Thursday's maneuvering a diversion from the problem-plagued Obamacare issue that has been giving the White House and Democrats political headaches.

""You'll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,"" McConnell warned, adding that ""the Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw power - the same playbook that got us Obamacare - has to end. It may take the American people to end it, but it has to end.""

CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Democrats seem to believe that things couldn't get much worse, with judicial vacancies increasing and Republicans increasing their use of filibusters after an agreement earlier this year that cleared some presidential appointees.

Opinion: 'Nuclear option' makes GOP do its job

""I think there is probably a little bit of 'calling your bluff' going on here; that Harry Reid basically threw up his hands and said, enough of this, it's time to do it,"" Borger said. Now, she added, the question was whether angry Republicans would further harden their positions in the already bitter political climate which she said ""will get worse.""

Thursday's change affected presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court appointees.

It did not affect the ability of Republicans to filibuster legislation.

Under the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority.

The nuclear option deployed by Reid allowed a procedural vote that required a simple majority to change the threshold for approving presidential and judicial nominees, instead of a super majority typically required.

Opinion: What's at stake in power struggle over judges

""It's time to get the Senate working again,"" the Nevada Democrat said on the Senate floor. ""Not for the good of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority, but for the good of the United States of America. It's time to change. It's time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.""

Reid followed through on threats dating back years after Republicans blocked three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, known as the highest court in the land after the Supreme Court.

Both parties have been guilty of political hijinks involving filibusters.

In 2005, Republicans who then held the majority threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.

Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time.

""I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules,"" he said on the Senate floor in 2005. ""In the long run it is not a good result for either party. One day Democrats will be in the majority again and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority.""

Explainer: What's the nuclear option?

Asked about Obama's past stance compared to his support Thursday for Reid's move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees for the need to get the Senate working again.

""The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,"" Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today and that many of the President's nominees have bipartisan support but can't get an up-or-down Senate vote.

Furious Republicans accused Reid of reneging on a pledge against using the nuclear option.

""It is another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do, and in this case it is to advance the President's regulatory agenda and the only cure for it that I know is an election,"" said veteran GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

Until now, Reid hadn't necessarily had support from enough of his own Democratic caucus to pass a rules change. Some Democratic senators were reluctant to change the rules because of reverence for the institution and, more importantly, because they know Democrats will not always be in the majority.

Veterans such as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who had been opposed to the nuclear option to change the Senate rules, recently decided to back Reid's move. Feinstein and others, like fellow Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said things were so broken in Washington that the nuclear option was the only way to fix it.

Three Democrats voted with Republicans on Thursday in opposing the nuclear option - Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

However, Republicans argued Democrats were just trying to manufacture a crisis in order to create a distraction from the Obamacare rollout debacle.

""Sounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject and if I were taking all the incoming fire that he is taking over Obamacare I'd try to change the subject too,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.

WASHINGTON -- The year after a presidential election, fewer people focus on campaign finance issues, but 2013 was well worth your attention. There were financial scandals, a new Supreme Court case, laws rewritten and the anticipation of more money than ever before. Below are 10 of the biggest campaign finance stories of the year.

10. Big money took over North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) won election in late 2012 with huge support from the political network funded by wealthy conservative activist Art Pope and immediately announced that Pope would be his budget director. In the ensuing year, the state enacted highly divisive right-wing legislation along the lines long proposed by Pope's outside network of think tanks and political organizations. North Carolina became example number one of how a single donor can influence the political direction of an entire state in the post-Citizens United world.

9. Get ready for the most expensive midterm election ever. More than $815 million has been raised or spent on the 2014 midterm elections and 2013 special elections already. Spending by independent groups like super PACs and ""dark money"" nonprofits is ahead of the 2012 pace, when these groups laid out nearly $1 billion.

Next year's Kentucky Senate race, pitting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) against both a tea party primary challenger and a very well-financed Democratic candidate, is also well ahead of the fundraising pace set by the two most expensive Senate campaigns in history. The 2012 Massachusetts race cost candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren a combined $82 million, and the 2000 New York race between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio topped $70 million. The Kentucky candidates have raised nearly $20 million and that's just through September 2013.

8. Are Democrats winning the super PAC war? Just one year after conservative independent groups outspent liberal groups 2.5 to 1, the spending pattern has reversed. Liberal independent groups doled out $16.5 million in 2013, compared to $9 million from conservative groups, and liberal super PACs outraised their conservative counterparts 2 to 1 in the first half of the year.

These numbers, however, are somewhat deceiving. Most of the money was spent in special elections that were highly favorable to Democrats, so major conservative groups sat out those contests. The financial comparison also does not account for ""issue"" advertising that masks an electoral purpose. Conservative groups have already spent millions on this form of independent spending that doesn't have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.

7. OFA turned into a dark money nonprofit. Following another successful electoral campaign, the Obama for America machinery, with its troves of data desired by practically every Democratic candidate in the country, sought a new home. The group transformed itself into the 501(c)(4) nonprofit Organizing for Action, the exact type of dark money group that the president had lambasted during his 2012 reelection.

It may have become a bit trite, even if true, to mock the president for his repeated hypocrisy on the issue, but the transformation of his campaign organization into a nonprofit relying on voluntary disclosure -- the group does disclose its donors, but only as it sees fit -- solidified that hypocrisy for many advocates of openness and campaign finance reform.

6. Obama bundlers were nominated to be ambassadors. Again, after promising to change the culture of Washington, President Barack Obama continued the tried and true practice of nominating his biggest campaign fundraisers to jobs as overseas diplomats. According to the Center for Public Integrity, Obama has nominated 23 campaign bundlers for ambassadorships since January.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired Foreign Service officers, has called for an end to this practice: ""Now is the time to end the spoils system and the de facto 'three-year rental' of ambassadorships. The United States is alone in this practice; no other major democracy routinely appoints non-diplomats to serve as envoys to other countries.""

5. California officials tore back the curtain on dark money in their state. The state's investigation into an $11 million contribution to a ballot campaign committee late in 2012 revealed the inner workings of the dark-money nonprofit network connected to the billionaire Koch brothers. Due to poorly redacted documents released during the investigation, many of the original donors were uncovered, including the owners of the Gap clothing brand, investor Charles Schwab, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and real estate developer Eli Broad, who had publicly supported the ballot initiative even as his money funded the opposition.

The success of the inquiry propelled Ann Ravel, then head of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, into the vice chairmanship of the FEC.

4. The Republican Party faces civil strife. This tea party vs. big business battle is apparently a real thing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce plans to dump $50 million into supporting primary candidates from the GOP's establishment wing -- even if those candidates don't differ much on policy from the tea partiers they oppose.

The key contests to watch are the Senate primary races in Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia and the House primaries in Michigan's 3rd and 11th districts and Idaho's 2nd District.

3. The Supreme Court debates maybe the next Citizens United. In October, the justices heard arguments on another potentially groundbreaking campaign finance case, McCutcheon v. FEC -- this time challenging the aggregate contribution limits that restrict overall giving by an individual donor.

Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, which upended politics by freeing independent groups to spend unlimited sums of money, including corporate and union funds, campaign finance cases have been watched very closely. Some observers have even worried that the Supreme Court could use the McCutcheon case to roll back all contribution limits, although legal experts consider this unlikely.

2. IRS scandal led to proposed clearer rules for nonprofits. If you think the public relations rollout for Obamacare has been bad, remember how the Internal Revenue Service slowly admitted that it had improperly targeted conservative groups for heightened review. After repeatedly denying any such misdeed, IRS official Lois Lerner apologized for doing precisely that in response to a planted question at a meeting of nonprofit tax lawyers. Months of howling by conservatives and hours of congressional testimony ensued until it was revealed that the IRS had targeted not just conservative groups but also liberal groups and other nonpolitical organizations.

The scandal did bring about greater scrutiny of the agency's oversight of political groups, particularly dark money nonprofits that aren't required to disclose their donors. These groups have proliferated over the last several years following the Supreme Court's rulings in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life and the Citizens United case. In November, the IRS proposed new regulations for political activity by such nonprofits. The draft regulations, which were criticized from all sides, will take months, if not years, to wend their way through the regulatory process. Nonetheless, they mark a step toward greater transparency for political spending by nonprofits and, potentially, less abuse of the nonprofit tax code to hide donors' identities.

1. States raised contribution limits. After the Citizens United ruling, proposals were put forward across the country to increase disclosure, rein in rampant independent spending and pass constitutional amendments to reverse the decision. The most popular idea -- among politicians, at least -- was to increase the amount of money they can raise to even the playing field.

Nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Wyoming -- increased their campaign contribution limits in 2013. The feat was accomplished by state legislatures run both by Republicans and by Democrats.

Minnesota state Rep. Ryan Winkler (D) told The Huffington Post earlier this year, ""Increasing the money flowing directly through candidates from individuals is a better system. It might not be a perfect world, but we have to live in the world that the Supreme Court created for us and do the best we can.""

The multiple bills to raise contribution limits highlight the gulf between the public, which sees far too much money in politics and supports the reversal of Citizens United, and the lawmakers, who simply want as much money as the independent groups empowered by that decision. Expect even more states to adopt hike their limits in the coming years.

Permanent honorable mention: The FEC is an ongoing disaster."

According to sources close to the criminal investigation of Bachmann's presidential campaign, the FBI has now been given sworn testimony and documents alleging Bachmann approved secret payments to Iowa state Senator Kent Sorenson in exchange for his help and support in that state's 2012 Presidential caucuses. Ethics rules explicitly prohibit Iowa lawmakers from accepting payments from Presidential campaigns or PACs. Investigation sources tell Take Action News the FBI is examining money laundering allegations against Bachmann, as well as possible wire fraud and mail fraud.

As we detailed on my nationally syndicated radio and YouTube show Take Action News this past Saturday, the key claims against Bachmann are coming from two of her former campaign insiders -- former Congressional chief of staff Andy Parrish and former national field coordinator Pete Waldron. Waldron has filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission, alleging the payments to State Senator Sorenson were improper. Parrish has provided an affidavit to investigators, confirming Bachmann knew of and approved the payments.

I first broke this news on Take Action News in the clip above. Shameless plug: you can subscribe to video clips from the show for free at Youtube.com/takeactionnewstv.

The Iowa Senate Ethics Committee voted more than a month ago to appoint a special investigator to determine whether State Senator Sorenson was guilty of violating Iowa state ethics rules prohibiting direct or indirect employment from a political action committee. The Committee's ongoing investigation of Sorenson is based on Waldron's FEC complaint and Parrish's testimony.

It's not unusual for a political campaign, with all of the paperwork and forms required by the FEC, to make mistakes. Furthermore, many U.S. lawmakers have been fined by the FEC for improper fundraising, spending, and misleading accounting records.



The Bachmann case, though, is different. Her own team is alleging the campaign violations, and declaring that Bachmann knew about the actions in advance. Presumably, Bachmann -- like other Presidential candidates -- signed hundreds of disclosure reports filed with the federal government. If she lied on those reports, or mailed misleading financial statements, however, she may face serious legal trouble.

For her part, Bachmann has told friends that she did nothing wrong. ""It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,"" Bachmann said in her retirement announcement. ""And I have no reason to believe that that was not the case.""

Investigators have reason to believe otherwise, however. Was Bachmann's campaign involved in bribery? Money laundering? Or were her actions in this case just the industry standard for a high wire political campaign?

We may eventually get an answer from the FBI, and perhaps a federal prosecutor. In the meantime, the Michele Bachmann circus is going to remain on the national stage."

The GOP had a plausible, but narrow, path to capture enough of these seats to win control of the Senate. The ObamaCare disaster, however, has expanded the battlefield for control of the Senate. New polls show high-profile Democrats with negligible leads against phantom Republicans in IA, CO and MI. If these states are in play next year, Dem control of the Senate will be especially vulnerable.

Republicans, so far, have been unable to attract high-profile candidates to contest the open seats in Iowa and Michigan or challenge Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. All three seats have been safely in the Democrat column for much of the year. The terrible rollout of ObamaCare, however, has hurt the poll numbers of Democrats everywhere. This has become most pronounced in states that weren’t considered competitive.

In Colorado, incumbent Sen. Mark Udall doesn’t draw more than 45% support against a host of possible GOP opponents. That level of support is a clear sign of vulnerability. Just a few months ago, Udall was a prohibitive favorite to win reelection.

Democrats in Iowa have rallied behind Rep. Bruce Braley for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. There is no clear GOP challenger, yet Braley can’t reach more than 42% against a number of possible challengers.

In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters, a typical union-backed Democrat, is running to replace Sen. Carl Levin. Again, there is no high-profile consensus GOP candidate, yet Peters can’t even crack 40% support in the polls. The most recent poll found Peters leading Republican former Secretary of State, Terri Land, by just one point, 37-36. Months ago, again, Peters was considered the overwhelming favorite.

Polls in these three states suggest that ObamaCare represents an existential threat to the Democrat party next year. Setting aside the problems with the website, the program will exert a gravitational pull on everyone’s health insurance. For most voters, the impact will be negative.

Barring some unexpected event, Democrats could be slow-walking to their own political oblivion. If the party has to spend money to defend its seat in Michigan, it is unlikely to hold its seats in states like North Carolina or Alaska.

The 2014 elections may be getting past the point that Republicans can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The party still hasn’t learned the lessons of 2010. They are about to get another primer from voters. Hopefully, the party will know now how to listen."
http://news.yahoo.com/christie-backlash-104500529--politics.html,,[],The Christie Backlash,"The Christie Backlash

Wow, that was quick.

It took Sen. John McCain, the straight-talking maverick from Arizona, eight long years—between the presidential campaigns of 2000 and 2008—to be transformed from media darling to media target. But for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the process was completed in a political nanosecond.

Less than two months after his landslide reelection, in which he beat Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by a 21-point margin, the Republican governor is undergoing the sort of media metamorphosis that sometimes befalls popular statewide politicians who dare to think of themselves as future presidents.

To paraphrase Franz Kafka, Christie awoke one morning last week and, reading the front page of The New York Times, discovered that he’d been changed into a giant bully. In his new media incarnation, he was suddenly a politician who wreaks petty revenge and humiliation on any poor soul who is unwise enough to cross him, and who countenanced the closure of two local access lanes of the George Washington Bridge, causing vehicular chaos for four days in Fort Lee, N.J., where the Democratic mayor had declined to endorse him.

This, for a public official who previously had been portrayed in the national media as a truth-telling, tough-talking executive who was willing to reach across the aisle to get things done.

Arguably worse, Double Down, a book about the 2012 campaign released in early November, just as Christie was racking up his 60-percent vote total, depicted the governor previously celebrated for uncompromising honesty as a possibly shady New Jersey pol who’d done lucrative backroom favors for political allies, lobbied for the business interests of Bernie Madoff and his ilk, lacked that ineffable quality called “presidential temperament,” and freely spent the taxpayer’s dime for his own personal aggrandizement, among other disturbing details reportedly uncovered by Mitt Romney’s vice presidential vetting team.

He was also, Romney’s vetters are said to have concluded, alarmingly obese—although the governor has been noticeably slimming down since his lap-band surgery in June.

Story continues

The good news for Team Christie is that the media’s alterations on Christie’s portrait have yet to make a dent in his popularity among voters. The latest CNN poll has the governor running well ahead of other likely contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination, even beating Hillary Clinton by a sliver in a hypothetical head-to-head. That fact alone permits Christie loyalists to greet the new negativity with a healthy degree of sangfroid.

“The governor is not a complete stranger to intense scrutiny and coverage and is not surprised by it,” says a Christie aide, noting that the boss has had the national spotlight trained on him from the moment he campaigned for fellow Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, through the endless speculation about his 2012 plans and his much-analyzed keynote speech to the GOP convention in Tampa. “The other thing he’s not surprised by is when media outlets and Democratic organizations make him a target.”

The Christie aide added: “When you’ve had success like he has had, there comes a degree of scrutiny and also attacks from outside forces with political motivations. The fact that there is already a greater degree of scrutiny isn’t a surprise either. The governor himself said recently, ‘We’re not in Kansas anymore.’ ”

Christie made his little quip, acknowledging the intrusion of presidential politics, during a news conference at which the bridge snafu was front and center. He was suspected but never quite implicated in the nasty business, and the smoking traffic cones were instead laid at the feet of Christie appointees who couldn’t be shown to have consulted the governor, let alone taken orders from him, before acting possibly on their own.

“It’s all a setup,” says Michael Steele, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee when Christie first ran for governor in 2009. “It plays itself out in a variety of ways, sometimes aided by the main target, sometimes by subordinates or opposition camps. There’s a tendency to reach that turning point so that the knives come out and the new narrative begins.”

In what amounts to Steele’s political-literary analysis, the current storyline began in November 2012, when Christie disappointed the Romney campaign and enraged fellow Republicans—but charmed the East Coast media establishment—by embracing President Obama in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. “The political leadership on the left, and even some on the right, were enamored of this man and his style and his ability to cut through the BS and tell it like it is,” Steele says. “How saucy, how sexy, how wonderful for politics!”

Then came Christie’s universally predicted reelection victory, which the media treated as big news portending bright prospects for higher office. And then…

“Since this past November, you have seen the slow and steady drumbeat of degradation,” Steele says. “It’s the media’s and the Democrats’ effort to take down that which they summarily have built up and to begin to carve into bite-size chunks a narrative that will unfold itself over the next year in preparation for the 2016 cycle.”

The irony, Steele says, is that “Chris Christie is the same guy today as he was when he sat in my office when I was national chairman during his first bid for the governorship of New Jersey…He’s still the same breath of fresh air, the same guy who can create a new narrative for the Republican Party and the country, which is longing and starving for it. So, for me, this is just unbelievable bullshit, and it says to me that there are interests in the media and in politics who don’t want the status quo to change, and who actually like this red/blue politics crisis-management model.”

Democratic media consultant Jimmy Siegel, who is no fan of Christie and believes that he probably is a bully, concurs with a central theme of Steele’s analysis—that much of the recent unflattering coverage is being influenced, if not orchestrated, by Democratic operatives.

“Now they’re going after him,” Siegel says. “I think they read the polls like everyone else, and they want people to see him as something different from the straight-talking lung-to-tongue guy who tells it the way it is and is willing to reach across the aisle. So now they’re portraying the more unsavory aspects of his character.”

Siegel theorizes that Christie, who has handled the bridge flap with admirable restraint, might ultimately revert to form and damage himself in an angry explosion. “If there is any politician who is susceptible to an ‘A Few Good Men’ moment—the Jack Nicholson character who is put under so much pressure that he will lash out at any moment—it’s Christie. And his opponents are hoping that will happen. It hasn’t so far.”

Steele, too, cautions that Christie should exercise discipline and not do anything that could fuel new headlines. “You can become your own worst enemy in these narratives to prove a point, and come out on the other end not smelling or looking as good as you think you should,” Steele says. “You’ve got to be careful you don’t create new negative narratives going forward.”

Republican consultant E. O’Brien Murray, who argues that Christie’s Sandy embrace of Barack Obama will be featured in far more GOP primary attack ads than charges of bullying, says there might even be an upside to the current negative portrayals of the governor in the so-called “lamestream media.”

For conservative primary voters in, say, Iowa—who might be naturally suspicious of a middle-of-the-road Northeastern Republican—unfavorable media coverage “might create a halo over his head,” Murray says. “It certainly helped Ronald Reagan, who always said that when The New York Times agreed with him, it was a bad day.”

The purpose of the meeting is to muster and organize a ""shadow army"" of ""shadow warriors"" that are willing to volunteer their time to stand toe-to-toe at the majority of the locations here in Maricopa County where the paid progressive socialists are collecting petition signatures to recall Sheriff Joe.... We need to make sure this abusive and egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution, voter sovereignty and the will of the people here in Arizona and around the Country fails in getting enough signatures. Randy Parraz, Chad Snow and the special interest groups that are behind this recall effort are nothing more than domestic terrorists who are attempting to turn Arizona dark blue so they can further their liberal agenda. These are the same thugs who wrongfully recalled Russell Pearce. We need to stop these people now.

Someone should point out to these nitwits that the ""egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution,"" i.e., the recall, is provided for right there in the Arizona Constitution! If anything, stopping people from exercising their right to sign a petition is the ""abusive"" thing that's ""attacking Arizona's Constitution.""

Dog whistle alert! The ""domestic terrorists"" and ""thugs"" who recalled SB 1070 author Sen. Russell Pearce in 2011 (though not ""wrongfully"") were teachers, priests, seniors, librarians, business leaders and Republicans! Chad Snow, one of the Pearce recall organizers mentioned in the invitation, is a Republican. And the district in Mesa that Sen. Pearce had represented for six terms was heavily GOP and Mormon. Terrorists! Thugs! If anything, Pearce's campaign team practiced thuggery—recruiting a sham candidate to syphon votes away from the eventual winner, Republican Jerry Lewis.

Join me below the fold to learn more about this invitation from crazy.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Chris Christie has lessons for GOP,"A pair of polls out this week shows the dire state the Republican Party finds itself in — and a way out of the wilderness, should Republicans choose to take it.

Poll No. 1: Rasmussen Reports found that views of the tea party — the wing of Republicanism that dominates party primaries and therefore the congressional Republican caucuses — at a new low. Only 8 percent of likely voters considered themselves tea-party members, down from 24 percent in 2010. According to Rasmussen (which tends to have a pro-Republican bias), unfavorable views of the movement topped favorable views, 49 percent to 30 percent.

Poll No. 2: Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 73 percent of New Jersey voters approved of the job their Republican governor, Chris Christie, is doing — near his all-time high. Even 62 percent of Democrats approve of Christie, as well as 69 percent of racial minorities and 70 percent of women. The top would-be challenger to Christie in November’s gubernatorial election is trailing him by 33 percentage points.

So grim are things for the Democrats in heavily Democratic New Jersey that the state Senate president, Democrat Stephen Sweeney, apologized Monday after saying Christie wished for Hurricane Sandy to hit New Jersey. “I guess he prayed a lot and got lucky because a storm came,” Sweeney had said.

Certainly, the storm — and, more important, Christie’s forceful response — boosted the governor’s standing. But the tea party’s record lows and Christie’s record highs tell a larger story: Americans are crying out for an end to ideological warfare.

That has developed into Christie’s signature in New Jersey. He began his term promising tax cuts and fighting with the teachers union over tenure, pay and education reforms, but he now preaches reconciliation — a recurring theme in his State of the State address Tuesday afternoon.

“Now, we’ve had our fights,” he told state legislators. “We have stuck to our principles. But we have established a governing model for America that shows that, even with heartfelt beliefs, bipartisan compromise is possible. . . . Maybe the folks in Washington, in both parties, could learn something from our record here.”

Christie, his eye on a possible 2016 presidential run, overstates that record, both in terms of economic progress and in terms of partisan cooperation. But his message is undoubtedly a winning one. More than three-quarters of Americans believe that politics in Washington is causing “serious harm to the United States,” according to a new Gallup poll — and they are correct to think so.

Christie lent his powerful voice to that sentiment last week when he condemned as “disgusting” the House Republicans’ decision not to take up a $60 billion Hurricane Sandy recovery bill because tea-party lawmakers considered it wasteful. “That’s why people hate Washington,” Christie said at the time, helping to force House Speaker John Boehner to reconsider.

It was just the latest of Christie’s many breaks with tea-party orthodoxy. Just before the election, his effusive praise of President Obama’s “outstanding” response to Sandy earned him condemnation from Rush Limbaugh and Rupert Murdoch.

He unnerved fiscal conservatives by saying that the hurricane recovery would probably require higher taxes, because “there’s no magic money tree.” He came out against the National Rifle Association’s plan to have gun-wielding guards in schools, saying, “You don’t want to make this an armed camp for kids.”

Earlier, after conservatives criticized his appointment of a Muslim judge, he took on these “bigots” for their “gaze of intolerance.” And on immigration, he called for an “orderly process” to legalize immigrants and he criticized those who “demagogue.”

Caption Piles of debris, damaged homes and flooded streets remain in the wake of the storm. Nov. 3, 2012 New Jersey state troopers keep order as motorists line up to purchase gasoline at the Thomas A. Edison service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near Woodbridge, N.J. Lines were long at some gas stations with motorists trying to make purchases before a noon switch to a gas-rationing system ordered by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Drivers with license plates ending in an even number will be allowed to buy gas on even-numbered days, and those with plates ending in an odd number can make gas purchases on odd-numbered days. Mel Evans/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Certainly, Christie is no liberal, but his State of the State speech was full of policy prescriptions that conservatives might label big government: “We’ve requested the federal government to pay 100 percent of the costs of the significant debris removal. . . . We have secured $20 million from the Federal Highway Administration. . . . We have worked with the Small Business Administration to secure nearly $189 million in loans.”

Christie also bragged about “implementing the toughest fertilizer law in America,” fighting insurers’ “excessive deductibles” and “investing the largest amount of state aid to education in New Jersey history.” He said “both Republicans and Democrats” would make sure the state got its full federal payout for the storm.

“You see,” he told the legislators, “some things are above politics.”

It’s a lesson that could help the national Republican Party loosen the tea party’s death grip.

So help me God.""

Congress passes or repeals laws, such as the Affordable Care Act, with the legislative process and votes, authority vested in Congress by a little thing called the Constitution. ""Conservative Republicans are so very fond of telling everyone else how no one loves the Constitution more than they do.""

Well, Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution states:



Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it….

This is how the Affordable Care Act became law. The Congress voted for the ACA in 2010 and President Obama signed the ACA into law two days later. There's even a video to show the signing of the bill into law!

If the teabaggers need a refresher course regarding how a bill becomes a law, the clerk of the house has a nice outline used to educate kids. This educational guide concludes that once a bill becomes law via this legislative process, it is ""enforced by the government.""

Last summer, two days after the House voted again to delay key provisions of ACA, Boehner said Congress ""should not be judged on how many new laws we create"" but on ""how many laws ... we repeal."" Since ACA became law, the House GOP voted ""42 times to defund, repeal or otherwise hobble Obamacare,"" but the measures died in the Senate.

In 2012, another branch of government, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA:



The court’s 5 to 4 ruling was a stunning legal conclusion to a battle that has consumed American politics for two years. Roberts’s compromise offered a dramatic victory for Obama and Democrats’ decades-long effort to enact a health-care law and a bitter defeat for Republicans and tea party activists, who had uniformly opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made repeal of the health-care law a central part of his campaign. “Our mission is clear: if we want to get rid of Obamacare, we are going to have to replace President Obama,” Romney said the day of the court ruling. “That is my mission. That is our work. And I’m asking the American people to join me.” And yet, voters reelected Obama with a decisive victory over Romney.

So, the GOP teabaggers turned to the election process. In the 2012 presidential election, Romney promised to repeal ACA if elected, but the voters chose Obama:Even speaker Boehner stated, after the 2012 election, that ACA is the ""law of the land,"" yet he continues to try to repeal it by unconstitutional means.

Having failed again, the GOP in January of this year plotted out a new ""legislative strategy"" adopted in an agreement called The Williamsburg Accord. After losing in the Congressional lawmaking process, the Courts and with the voters, the teabaggers agree to hold the country hostage with threats of a shutdown :



Republicans have fallen out, often sharply, over which hostages to ransom, with the most conservative ones favoring a government shutdown threat and the more pragmatic wing, oddly, endorsing a debt default threat. They have also struggled to define the terms of their ransom. The Williamsburg Accord initially envisioned forcing Obama to sign spending cuts, or some form of the Paul Ryan budget. During the summer, Republicans flirted with making Obama lock in lower marginal tax rates. Recently, Republicans settled on pressuring him to kill his health-care law. But the general contours of the legislative strike, and the plan of obtaining policy victories without offering any policy concessions, has enjoyed general agreement within the party.

Had we had more time I would have explained to the former Speaker something he surely already knows: The Affordable Care Act was duly enacted by a majority of both houses of Congress, signed into law by the President, and even upheld by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of the United States does not allow a majority of the House of Representatives to repeal the law of the land by de-funding it (and threatening to close the entire government, or default on the nation’s full faith and credit, if the Senate and the President don’t come around).



If that were permissible, no law on the books would be safe. A majority of the House could get rid of unemployment insurance, federal aid to education, Social Security, Medicare, or any other law they didn’t like merely by deciding not to fund them.

So now teabaggers want to repeal ACA by defunding it backed by shutdown. Robert Reich explained to New Gingrich why our constitutional system does not allow repeal by defunding a law . Rather, the constitutional process to repeal a law requires both houses to enact a new bill that repeals the old and then President Obama must sign it:The MSM characterize the teabaggers' conduct as a ""GOP shutdown strategy."" Polling concludes that ""American Voters Reject GOP Shutdown Strategy."" Some GOP members say shutting down the government over Obamacare is a bad strategy

Words matter. The GOP teabaggers' conduct violates the oath of office and the Constitution. Their conduct is unlawful. Not a political strategy that gives them cover as if this were politics as usual.

As Robert Reich stated:



The Republicans who are now running the House of Representatives are pushing a dangerous new constitutional doctrine. They must be stopped. There should be no compromising with fanatics.

Indeed, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called implementing ACA a ""criminal act."" Right. Implementing the law of the land is criminal, trying to repeal or defund the law by unconstitutional means is just permissible political strategy."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/mitch-mcconnell-reelection-campaign_n_3178608.html,2013-04-29 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Mitch McConnell Reelection Campaign Hoping To Close Data Gap By Bringing In New Blood,"WASHINGTON –- Mitch McConnell does not seem like an obvious choice to help lead the GOP out of the digital wilderness it has found itself in when it comes to political campaigns.

The Senate minority leader most often emerges into the public eye from the floor of the Senate, formally debating Democrats in the chamber or dryly answering (or completely ignoring) reporter questions in the halls. Flashy he is not.

Yet McConnell's aides have noticed that the Republican conversation about catching up to Obama's data-driven, clinic of a campaign in 2012 is mostly focused on doing so by 2016. That doesn't help McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2014.

And so the attitude among aides to the fifth-term Kentucky Republican is that while some in the GOP are holding soul-searching panel discussions and others are fighting over who gets to control the data and the money in 2016, they're going to run a cutting-edge, digital-savvy campaign in 2014 that shows their party how it's done.

""We have no doubt the GOP will be ready for the 2016 presidential cycle, but in the meantime, we plan to set the standard here in our campaign and establish best practices other conservatives can emulate,"" said Jesse Benton, McConnell's campaign manager.

McConnell may not have a Democratic opponent yet; he has so far managed to intimidate a long list of Democrats from taking him on, all while avoiding a primary challenge from his right flank. But McConnell has struggled with a low approval rating. Some polls have shown him as low as 36 percent, though his aides point to other surveys showing him closer to 50 percent. And the fact that he is running a full-throttle reelection campaign is a sign to some that he knows he remains vulnerable.

So McConnell is bringing some relatively new blood into an establishment campaign. He has hired a small firm called Crowdverb to run his campaign's data operation. For digital strategy, McConnell is turning to Vincent Harris, a 24-year-old digital specialist who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) campaign and on the presidential primary runs of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga).

Throw in Benton, the 35-year-old former campaign manager for former Rep. Ron Paul's (R-Texas) 2012 presidential campaign, and the message is clear: McConnell may be 71-years-old and look the part of a local chamber of commerce president, but he is taking an approach to personnel that embraces outsiders and innovation.

Crowdverb's co-founder, Cyrus Krohn, is someone who has been ""largely ignored in Republican circles,"" Benton said. The 42-year-old Krohn is of the tech world, not of the GOP political establishment, said Josh Holmes, the 34-year-old McConnell adviser who runs the senator's district office in Washington and was Krohn's connection to McConnell.

Krohn, who is based in Seattle like Crowdverb co-founder Todd Herman, has done some work for the Republican party, in a two-year stint as digital director at the Republican National Committee during the 2008 election. But he fell victim at the RNC to ""myth of the savior"" thinking, one senior Republican digital strategist told The Huffington Post on background. The RNC, led by then-chairman Mike Duncan, expected Krohn to ""work magic"" but did not give him the resources or the authority to do so, the strategist said.

Krohn spent a few years at CNN in the early '90s before helping to start Slate Magazine, where he eventually became publisher. All told, he spent a decade at Slate, and then from 2004 to 2007 Krohn worked for Microsoft and Yahoo in the world of online video, primarily in politics.

""One of the things that has bothered me most about the political industry is that everyone knows how to talk a good game but very few do anything remarkable or unique. Nowhere is that more prevalent than the world of data and online strategy,"" Holmes, the McConnell adviser, told The Huffington Post in an e-mail. ""Most of the people selling data-based products or online strategy to the political world are from the political world, which immediately disqualifies them in my view. I wouldn't hire an accountant to be our press secretary so why would we hire a political strategist to handle our data?""

""I spent about a year talking to a lot of vendors. Very few of them invented the technology, wrote code, understood data analytics, or applied algorithms. Most of them know politics and they have a widget to sell,"" Holmes said. ""[Krohn] and his team invent technology, write code, understand analytics, create algorithms, and build usable dashboards. They don't write ad copy and they don't even seem to have an opinion on the political application of their findings. When you're up in the air it's really comforting to know that the guy flying the plane is a pilot.""

Crowdverb is harvesting massive amounts of data from publicly available information on the web, in cooperation with its partner BehaviorMatrix, and using it to enhance the McConnell campaign's voter file, to measure public sentiment about McConnell moment by moment and to track how its different messages and tactics are impacting persuadable voters.

""What we're focused on really is the inherent need for dynamic data to complement traditional campaign tactics,"" Krohn said. ""What can you glean from the live web to understand in real time, based on people's emotions, to get them to take an action on the campaign's behalf: opening an e-mail, making a donation.""

Krohn gave an example.

""Let's say it's a Sunday talk show in Kentucky and it's a call-in program. All of the audio from that program is digitized for closed captioning. We're able to score what was said, gauge how it played with the electorate, and then determine what the implications were in terms of how people perceived that content via broadcast, and then respond,"" he said.

Crowdverb measures the response, in part, by ""maintaining records of individuals who have publicly available profiles, and mapping that back to the voter database.""

""We can say, 'We've identified that the comments from this program affected people emotionally in these ways' through predictive modeling as well as actual commentary, and that informs geographically how to communicate with them,"" Krohn said.

Benton said the campaign has ""about 41 percent of voter file matched to what they consider a detailed online profile,"" which includes ""things like social media handles, mobile phone number, preferred method of internet browsing, general internet activity, how people prefer to use social networks, and then also certain behavioral things or sentiment things about issues.""

He continued, ""This is what the Obama machine did.""

That may be a stretch. The Obama campaign, according to Sasha Issenberg's reporting, began the 2012 election ""confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House,"" and then worked to identify more potential supporters and recruited them one by one with individualized outreach.

If McConnell has 40 percent of the voter file identified, they may be on their way to doing some of what Obama did.

Benton explained how the real time feedback from Crowdverb will help the McConnell campaign monitor how the electorate is moving, and will then inform how to respond.

""Because the boss is always getting attacked, we're seeing a little bit more cycnicism about the boss than we'd like to see. They show us what they think is a critical level of cynicism that would start to hurt, and at this point in time we are below that,"" Benton said. ""But if we start to see a cynicism indices indicate a rise and that would tell us there could be a problem there, we would try to encourage our netroots people to make phone from home calls to people where their cynicism indexes are rising … with a sincerity message.""

That element of engaging grassroots supporters to influence their friends was a key component of the Obama campaign ground game.

Harris' job in running the campaign's digital strategy is not so much the harvesting and organizing of data as it is the promotion of the candidate through new media.

""Usually campaigns have a communications plan centered only on traditional media but Team McConnell believes in the emerging Buzzfeed culture: memes, web videos, and persuasion by entertainment,"" Harris said. ""They understand that when given a choice, many people would prefer to look at cat photos than engage with their elected officials. So we're working hard to ensure the senator's message breaks through what has become a cluttered medium.""

The McConnell team was eager to talk about their burgeoning digital operation, in an obvious attempt to project strength to potential opponents and hopefully keep the field clear as long as possible. Yet, it's not a bluff. McConnell, as always, is playing for keeps."

Did someone say creepy and depressing?

In the months before the 2012 election, a group of high-powered consultants and political operatives prepared a secret report for candidate Mitt Romney, explaining how he should take over and restructure the federal government should he win the presidency. […] But now the secret is out. On May 29, the Romney Readiness Project, the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P, published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.

“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide, which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices,” like speechwriting, “Policy Offices,” like the National Security Council, and “Packaging & Selling Offices,” like the office of the press secretary.

Among the recommendations for the Romney administration: • Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.

• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style, with clear deliverables.

• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”

Oh God, no. No, no, no. The actual document is horrifying. It's horrifying in exactly the way you'd expect it to be horrifying, coming from Mitt Freaking Romney's camp. It proposes treating the entire executive branch like a big financial firm, because THAT IS WHAT MITT ROMNEY KNOWS AND LOVES, PUNY FLESH-HUMANS.I see now how narrowly the satirists, comedians and other snarkish wags of America averted catastrophe last November. There is no way anyone with any sense of humor could have survived the first hundred days of a Mitt Romney ""let's treat the Oval Office like a big Wall Street firm"" presidency without dying outright. The true cynics would have been killed off within a week; the optimists, within a month. It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.Once you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a ""holding company"" and whatnot, most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best, for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example, a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized, written with words like ""COO"" and ""Selling"" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff, charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)

The White House as holding company, though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares. Now I know how the people in Russia felt when that meteor whizzed over their heads."

Story highlights John Avlon: Media emphasizing Jenny Sanford and Stephen Colbert in special election In reality, the story is the race between Mark Sanford and Elizabeth Colbert Busch He says there's reason Democrats can hope to capture the seat Avlon: Changing demographics make victory for centrist Democrats possible

Editor’s Note: John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the author of “Independent Nation” and “Wingnuts.” He won the National Society of Newspaper Columnists’ award for best online column in 2012.

(CNN) —

The fiery South Carolina congressional special election between former Gov. Mark Sanford and Elizabeth Colbert Busch is attracting national attention – but not for the reasons it should.

Listening to much of the national coverage, it can sound like a race between Jenny Sanford – the ex-wife of the ex-governor – and comedian Stephen Colbert, the brother of the Democratic candidate.

But the real news is that a Democrat could win the 1st Congressional District in South Carolina, reversing Republican control of the seat since 1981. Polls show Colbert Busch ahead and her confident debate performance on Monday night helped solidify the sense that momentum is behind her campaign.

Newsweek John Avlon

Subsequent endorsements of Sanford by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, who unhelpfully praised him as a “sexual pioneer,” and a billboard put up by the odious adultery website Ashley Madison did nothing to help this would-be comeback kid.

It is too early to count Sanford out, despite some liberal pundits declaring the race all but over. The coastal 1st District still has a 20% Republican registration advantage, and Sanford has never lost an election. But if Colbert Busch does win, it should shake up the lazy partisan assumptions that underlie our politics. That’s because the result will not just be a referendum on Sanford but would also be a reflection of changing demographics in South Carolina and throughout the South.

The idea that Texas, rich in Electoral College votes, could turn into a swing state has preoccupied pundits in recent weeks because it would upend presidential electoral math. A win by Colbert Busch in South Carolina wouldn’t have equal implications, but it could be a canary in the coalmine. And a close analysis of how her campaign defied the odds would be required reading for any Southern Democrats.

First, consider that Charleston County – the heart of the 1st Congressional District – voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. Urban centers in the South have been trending more Democratic in recent years, buoyed not just by the black vote but younger voters – including students and Northern transplants who move South for the improved quality of life.

In fact, the 1st District of South Carolina is only 21% rural, according to U.S. Census statistics published in the Almanac of American Politics. Most significantly, the population has grown 28% since 2000. This because of a Southern resurgence and a growth in local businesses, especially manufacturing – thanks largely to the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. (Colbert-Busch, who is also running on the Working Families Party line, proclaimed herself “proud to live in a right to work state during the debate).

The takeaway here is that the old assumptions about a monochrome conservative electorate don’t apply in coastal areas of South Carolina. This creates an opening for a centrist Democrat to win, especially against a polarizing Republican.

And that is precisely the card that Colbert Busch has tried to play throughout the campaign, presenting herself as a “tough, independent businesswoman” who will try to find common ground in Congress.

During the contentious debate at the Citadel on Monday, a well-coached Colbert Busch repeatedly tried to distance herself from liberal positions and then seize the center.

“Obamacare is extremely problematic” she declared, expressing concerns about unintended costs and then pivoting to praise popular provisions such as an end to the exclusion of people with pre-existing conditions and the allowance for children to stay on their parents’ health care plans until 26.

She proclaimed herself “a really proud defender of the Second Amendment” and then worked her way to saying she would have voted for the universal background check bill. Likewise, when she endorsed immigration reform, she framed it as a plan backed by the Chamber of Commerce and the state’s senior senator, Lindsey Graham.

Even her most forthrightly liberal position, support for marriage equality, was explained by a quote from Dick Cheney – “freedom means freedom for everyone.” And when she was asked about abortion, she responded with a classic poll-tested Bill Clinton formulation – it is a difficult personal choice that should be made between “a woman, her family, her doctor and her God.”

Sanford’s repeated tactic was to try and essentially deny her attempt at seizing the center by connecting her to Nancy Pelosi and labor unions. (Full disclosure: I hosted the debate, which was sponsored by Patch.com and South Carolina Radio Network.)

But there are a few lessons.

First, centrist Democrats can get elected in South. This has been made more difficult in recent years because the Blue Dog tribe has been hunted into near-extinction, thanks largely to the rigged system of redistricting. In the case of South Carolina’s 1st District, that meant that the largely African-American neighborhood of North Charleston was added to the neighboring district of James Clyburn, the state’s sole Democratic congressional representative, who won re-election in 2012, virtually unchallenged.

Democrats increase their competitiveness not by simply playing to the base, but reaching out to the center – showing that they are committed to solving problems as well as being guided by core principles. Throughout the debate, Colbert Busch stuck studiously to that script, presenting herself an a independent-minded moderate who can help change the tone in Washington, contrasting with Republicans’ increasing reputation for being too inflexible and uncompromising.

“We have got to come to the middle;” she pleaded. “We have got to be reasonable”

Second, demographics are destiny and even the Solid South is subject to change.

Diversity is on the increase, but almost more significantly is the population growth – families moving to the South from other parts of the country in search of an improved quality of life and job opportunities. The growth of Southern cities also changes the political calculus because cities usually are less conservative than rural areas.

Finally, the competitiveness of this race even in a district with a 20-point Republican registration advantage shows that citizens are willing to vote for the person and not the party if they are given a compelling candidate and contrast. All of which is to say that Republicans who believe that they will inevitably win back the seat in 2014 might be mistaken.

Regardless of who wins the May 7 special election – and, again, Sanford shouldn’t be counted out – the real winners are already the residents of the coastal South Carolina.

Competitive congressional elections are increasingly rare in an age of redistricting-enforced one-party rule. But when everyone’s vote matters in a general election, it is a win for democracy.

It is not that the Republican Right Wing base is less intelligent. They are willfully ignorant. They are unwilling to accept uncomfortable realities, so they live in a delusional bubble irrespective of consequences.

Ted Cruz was born on foreign soil from an American mother and a foreign father. That is fact. President Obama was born on American soil from an American mother and a foreign father. In effect there was never a real constitutional question regarding President Obama’s eligibility to be president. Irrespective of his parents, he was born on American soil. There is a constitutional question on Cruz’s eligibility based on the definition of ‘natural born citizen’. As such one would expect the Right Wing birthers to go after Ted Cruz.

As long as you have constituents like Walden Republican Christina Katok, Canadians would qualify for the presidency. She says “As far as I am concerned, Canada is not foreign soil. That’s the way I look at it”. Listen to her and others in this short Texas Tribune video snippet.

Aren’t these guys the strict constitutionalists? This behavior is called willful ignorance. Adjust your beliefs to satisfy your desires. What is ironic is had President Obama been born in Kenya, based on Cruz’s circumstance and acceptance by the Right Wing, President Obama would be just as eligible given his American mother to these birthers. The reality is even if both President Obama’s parents were foreign; he constitutionally qualifies for the presidency as he was born on American soil while Cruz was not.

The reason the country is at a standstill is that we have a sect that is obstructing that has no interest in reality based governing. They can do this as long as their willfully ignorant base continues to vote at higher rates than the rest of America in gerrymandered districts. In effect America gets the government it deserves. Those who want good government must vote for good politicians.

Repeated national surveys have shown public support for the Republican Party tanking since GOP lawmakers banded together to shut down the federal government and bring the U.S. to the brink of financial default.

On a more personal level, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, one of the highest-profile supporters of the impasse, has seen his appproval ratings plunge at home—a conservative stronghold that delivered President Obama a mere 25% of the vote in 2012.

Now, in a rare statement of second thoughts, the hometown newspaper of Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed its regrets for endorsing him a year ago. Cruz was one of the chief architects of the impasse.

“Does anyone else miss Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison?” asked the Houston Chronicle editorial board, citing the three-term U.S. senator whom Cruz replaced. “We’re not sure how much difference one person could make in the toxic, chaotic, hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington, but if we could choose just one it would be Hutchison, whose years of service in the Senate were marked by two things sorely lacking in her successor, Ted Cruz.”

FULL COVERAGE: The U.S. government shutdown

Those, the editorial said were a focus on Texas’ interests in Washington and a willingness to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats.

“When we endorsed Ted Cruz in last November’s general election, we did so with many reservations and at least one specific recommendation - that he follow Hutchison’s example in his conduct as a senator,” the editorial board stated. “Obviously, he has not done so. Cruz has been part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.”

Cruz upset Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the favorite of the GOP establishment, in last year’s Republican primary. Dewhurst was backed by the Chronicle in that race, which may somewhat soften the blow of its recantation(Cruz may point out he was, after all, the paper’s second choice).

Then there’s this: Cruz, like Lee, is not up for reelection for several years.

Of course you do. Towards that end, the Republican party has launched the Growth & Opportunity Project, chaired by such luminaries as Henry Barbour and Ari Fleischer, to recommend how best to not screw things up quite so horribly next time. And to help with that, they're using that most scientific of all tools, an internet survey

The questions are, sadly, rather generic:



Which issues do you think Republicans should spend MORE time talking about? (please select one)

- Fiscal issues, like taxes, government spending, and the debt

- Economic issues, like unemployment, housing, and high energy prices

- National Security issues, like terrorism, foreign policy, and national defense

- Social issues, like abortion and family values

They also ask you to rate how much ""improvement"" the party needs in areas like ""Diversity within the Party"" and ""How the Party communicates with voters.""

Republicans looking to interject their opinions will probably be disappointed, however. In a dozen or so pages of questions to fill out, only four or so invite you to give your input on the actual Republican Party and their efforts. All the others are demographic questions—data mining stuff. What's your name? What age are you? What's your email address, little feller? You know, the kind of questions you teach your kids not to answer during their own internet sessions.

Hey, at least the party leaders are asking for opinions, right? Your opinion is only worth about 1/4th of the content on an actual opinion survey, but it's a start? Surely it's not just a flimsy effort towards party list-building under the guise of momentary introspection."

Rep. Paul Ryan, seen here telling the crowd why good Jesus-based values demand we cut Food Stamps and meal assistance for seniors yet again because those kids and old people will probably just trade that food for abortions or something. Probably.

The most interesting thing about Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Forum being held this week is that it exists at all. Ralph Reed, for those precious few of you who do not remember recent political history, is a crook . He is a political scammer who worked with Jack Abramoff in a swindle of Native American tribes and conservative Christians alike, a scam that went to the heart of the conservative movement but in which every last person save Abramoff himself has undergone a magical conversion back into respectability based essentially on the same scam as they started out with, which is duping Good Christian People out of their money.

So to have Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Allen West, Ron Johnson, Rick Santorum, Gohmert-Perry-Bachman-Palin-Cain-and-everyone-else-who-is-anyone in far-right conservatism eagerly climb aboard the good ship Ralph Reed for his latest little shindig should tell you all you need to know about the sincerity of the whole movement. He's a lobbyist who got caught in a money laundering scandal, and he was back lobbying and collecting checks in no time flat because, bluntly, all the conservatives currently surrounding him were just fine with that. Just don't get caught again, Ralph, and everyone will go along with the political scammer running a supposed morality-based movement. Everyone involved is exactly that shallow.

All right, so let's do this thing. Here's a brief roundup of the stuff that the very important people saw fit to get up in front of a microphone and preach about to a group of moral scolds led by scammers and crooks—the conservative Mob, dressed up nice and pretty. Below the fold lie the details:

But by week's end, that vote seemed secondary to the question of the party's long-term survival.

After three months of denial, anger, despair and depression over the results of a bruising national election that gave Democrats an edge in Congress and kept President Barack Obama in the White House, Republicans know they must adapt if they are to move forward.

They acknowledge that it's time for a serious gut check (or, as Haley Barbour put it in November, a ""proctology exam"").

Whatever bodily metaphor you choose, the fact remains that the election so jolted and shocked the party that it is taking real steps to change.

And change it will! As soon as it figures out how.

While Republicans in Virginia and other battleground states launched an effort this week to alter Electoral College rules so that votes are doled out proportionately—which would likely give the GOP at least a short-term edge—GOP leaders here discussed their party's own shortcomings and sought areas of internal improvement.

Almost every conversation in the bar of the Charlotte Westin Hotel this week involved a discussion about what the party must do to win the next elections. Floating through the air is a desire to recapture glorious days of the past, a challenge made difficult by a country that refuses to stand still. Demographics are changing, minorities are growing in political influence and views on social issues like gay marriage are drifting rapidly leftward. Something's got to give.

Bring in the Bobs

Enter the RNC's five-person ""Growth and Opportunity"" committee, an ethnically diverse cadre of political veterans and RNC members analyzing what the party must to do avoid another 2012-like drubbing. (Think of them as The Bobs from ""Office Space,"" but with American flag lapel pins.)

The group includes Henry Barbour, a Mississippi committeeman and Haley Barbour's nephew; former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer; Florida strategist Sally Bradshaw; South Carolina committeeman Glenn McCall and Puerto Rico committeewoman Zori Fonalledas. They will submit a detailed report in March that looks back on the 2012 election and forward to 2014 and 2016.

Story continues

""You're going to see a very renewed aggressive effort by this party to put on a different face,"" Bradshaw said on Thursday. ""We've got to find a way to take our message to more people and get more votes. It's not a particularly complicated formula. We got beat; we have to change what we're doing.""

The report is a work in progress, and only part of it will be made public, but The Bobs delivered an update on their findings on Thursday to the RNC members.

First, they said Republicans must work on improving their tone when taking their ideas to the American people. For example, when discussing immigration, maybe presidential candidates should avoid phrases like ""self-deportation"" (Mitt Romney) and ""anchor babies"" (Michele Bachmann).

Henry Barbour said some in the party can appear ""hostile"" to certain constituencies with the rhetoric they use. The party must increase communication training for candidates, he said.

""There are certainly too many times when we've had candidates who have come across as hostile, and that's not really helpful when you're trying to win elections,"" Barbour said.

Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, was even more blunt.

""We need to understand that we can't come off as a bunch of angry white men,"" he said.

Minority 'engagement' a top priority

Making an honest effort to engage minorities was above anything else the main, yet unofficial, focus of party leaders this week.

On Thursday, committee members took part in a closed-door panel discussion on minority engagement. Edward Cousar, a black committeeman from South Carolina who sat on the panel, said white Republicans struggle in part because they spend too much time with other white Republicans. They have little idea how to speak or interact in a way that appears welcoming to outsiders who come from different ethnic and social backgrounds.

""People get set in their ways, and maybe they don't have a diverse set of friends and they say things,"" Cousar told Yahoo News in an interview before the panel. ""It's not that they're being racist. They just don't know.""

Cousar, who leads the Black Republican Political Action Committee, pointed to past Republican efforts to suppress early voting—""shameful,"" he said—and Romney's writing off of 47 percent of the country as unwinnable.

""I always thought Romney had better policies,"" Cousar, who is the only Republican in his family, said, comparing Romney and Obama. ""But he was a horrible messenger.""

In November, Obama won more than 70 percent of the Hispanic vote and more than 95 percent of black voters supported him. Single women also fled the Republican party on Election Day, with about two-thirds supporting the Democrat. It's a serious problem for Republicans, one they admit will take a lot of time to overcome.

""It's not going to happen overnight,"" said McCall, a black member of the study group. ""But it can be done, and we're going to make that effort.""

No more witches

Part of that effort relies heavily on recruiting quality candidates, many attendees said.

For the past four years, Republicans have faced a series of disappointing setbacks after mediocre candidates—often tea party favorites—have gone on to lose very winnable elections.

They include Todd ""Legitimate Rape"" Akin, who lost a Missouri Senate race last year and forced Romney and other Republicans on the defensive over women's issues.

In 2010, Nevada's Sharron ""Second Amendment Remedies"" Angle and Delaware's Christine ""I'm Not A Witch"" O'Donnell lost Senate races Republicans had been expected to win.

The party hopes to take steps to avoid such catastrophes.

Republicans say if that means supporting a moderate candidate who can actually win over a hardline conservative who doesn't stand a chance, so be it. (You may have noticed that among the names that make up The Bobs, there isn't anyone who might be considered a ""tea party leader."")

""If we're not nominating candidates that can win in the general election, what business are we in?"" Barbour said. ""We are in the business of winning elections.""

There is one thing, however, that no one—not the committee members, elected officials or even The Bobs—seem interested in addressing, and that's whether core Republican ideas need to change.

Most here said they don't.

""The conservative message sells,"" said Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""We're on the right side of history, on the right side of the issues. We just haven't done a very good job on articulating the issues.""

Anuzis' analysis is pretty universal in Republican circles. They see the true cause of their problems as merely poor presentations of otherwise good ideas.

That means a tricky rhetorical sleight of hand.

Don't believe women should have access to an abortion if they are raped or victims of incest? Try not to talk about it. Think the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes are ""takers""? Please don't quote Ayn Rand in your stump speech. Support laws banning gay couples from legal rights guaranteed to straight couples? Keep it in the closet. And remember, when in doubt, pivot and talk about economic growth.

Barbour admitted his committee wasn't brought in to debate or change those policy ideas. Their task, he said, is to put Republicans on a path to win election—not a squishy exercise in lazy pontificating or a dorm room bull session about the proper role of government.

It's data driven.

It's going to hurt some feelings.

And most of all, it's damn serious.

""We did get whipped in the presidential election,"" Barbour said. ""That's not something we take lightly."""

Ex-South Carolina governor seeks redemption after admitting extramarital affair

Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch has been competitive in GOP stronghold

Sanford held this seat in House from 1995 to 2001

WASHINGTON — Disgraced ex-South Carolina governor Mark Sanford won his bid for redemption on Tuesday night, defeating Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch for his old seat in Congress.

Sanford, a Republican who admitted an extramarital affair in 2009, was ready to quit politics for good if he was not victorious in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. He will replace Republican Tim Scott, who was appointed to the Senate.

The former governor — once a rising GOP star considered presidential material — was an early favorite in the Republican district, which Mitt Romney carried by 18 percentage points in the 2012 election. But the revelation that Sanford's ex-wife, Jenny, accused the candidate of trespassing at her home caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to withdraw its support in mid-April and gave Colbert Busch an opening.

At his victory party, Sanford thanked the ""angels"" he met during the campaign and spoke of learning about ""human grace"" as reflected through a higher power. ""I just want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances, but of third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth chances ... because that's the reality of our shared humanity,"" he said.

Sanford must appear in Charleston County Family Court on Thursday on his ex-wife's complaint. It is not clear when he will be sworn in to office.

Colbert Busch, a businesswoman and sister of comedian Stephen Colbert, stayed competitive but a final Public Policy Polling survey two days before the special election showed a dead heat. A business development officer who worked in the shipping industry, Colbert Busch focused on her plans to create jobs and vowed she would be an independent voice for the district.

""The people have spoken and I respect their decision,"" she told supporters Tuesday night.

This was the first time Sanford was on the ballot since his admission in 2009 that he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail — when he was actually in Argentina visiting his mistress — became a punch line on late-night TV.

""I absolutely failed. Period,"" Sanford said in an interview earlier Tuesday on CNN, one of several he gave on Election Day. He told MSNBC that ""one event does not define your life.""

Sanford urged his friends and neighbors to help him spread the word about his ideas to curb the nation's debt and to send a message about his Democratic rival. He stressed that Colbert Busch received help from labor unions and liberal groups from outside the district, and tied her to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House GOP campaign committee, congratulated Sanford and made no mention of how the organization parted ways with the candidate. ""These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014,"" Walden said in a statement. ""At the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch.""

Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said the governor congratulates the congressman-elect. Haley, who appeared at a fundraiser for Sanford last week, ""looks forward to working with him to bring jobs to the Lowcountry, fight job-killing unions, rein in out-of-control Washington spending, turn back Obamacare and strengthen the Charleston port,"" Godfrey said.

Democrats, meanwhile, saw a silver lining in Colbert Busch's efforts.

Rep. Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the candidate's efforts will be an example of how the party will stay aggressive in the 2014 elections. Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats next year to win majority control in the House. Sanford's election does not change that equation.

""The fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates,"" Israel said. ""Democrats will be aggressive and drive deep into Republican-held territory this cycle to find districts with flawed candidates where we can compete.""

The House Majority PAC, which spent $450,000 on TV ads and direct mail to boost Colbert Busch, said the outcome in South Carolina reflects poorly on the GOP.

""The House Republican caucus has added yet another ethically challenged embarrassment who will be an albatross around the neck of every Republican forced to answer for Mark Sanford's embarrassing and reckless behavior,"" said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of House Majority PAC."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/08/conservative-leaders-urge-rnc-rule-changes,2013-04-08 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Exclusive: Conservative Leaders Urge Reversing RNC Rules Power-Grab,"Monday morning, more than 60 leaders of conservative and grass roots organizations sent a letter to RNC Chair Reince Priebus, urging him to consider Rules changes that would reverse a power-grab by the national party at the convention in Tampa. In August, the RNC adopted a number of rules changes that stripped state parties of their control of convention delegates, among other changes. The rules changes further centralized control over the nominating process for the Presidency. They would give DC greater control over picking the GOP nominee.

Many of the changes to the RNC rules adopted in Tampa may seem innocuous, but their effect would shorten the presidential primary and strengthen the position of any front-runner at the beginning of the contest. They would eliminate the proportional allocation of delegates in early primaries and limit the candidates whose names could be offered at the convention for the nomination. It would also allow stripping state-elected convention delegates of their voting rights.

The letter reads in part:

Conservatism and the Reagan coalition that created the modern Republican Party represents the fusion of economic conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Rather than allowing political consultants and other elite minorities to shed our principles in the name of political expediency, we must reaffirm our commitment to these timeless American principles and the work that it will take to again make them relevant to a majority of our citizens.

The signers of the letter cover the breadth of the conservative and grass roots base of the party. They seek to reverse the recently adopted rules at the upcoming Spring meeting of the RNC, to ensure that all voices in the party have a role in selecting its Presidential candidate.

Engaging and winning a competitive primary does not drain a nominee of resources or energy, as many in DC contend. Rather, it makes the nominee stronger, having been forced to build a broad coalition from all wings of the party. A candidate who is successful at that is well on their way to building a winning general election coalition.

The future.

After flirting with ""rebranding"", conservatives convinced themselves they could win elections again by merely getting more white people to vote for them. Ron Brownstein delivers a solid rebuttal , including stuff we've discussed ad infinitum around here—like noting that demographic trends will push white Americans into eventual minority status (old white people being replaced by diverse and tolerant young voters).

But a white-voter-focused GOP has another big problem on its hands. Turns out, the kinds of white people Republicans attract are shrinking as a percentage of the electorate.

Republicans do worse among college educated whites. In 1984, 62 percent of white voters didn't have a college degree. In 2012, the number of college-educated whites equaled that of those without a degree.

Republicans do worse among white women than men. In 1984, white men and women were an equal percentage of the vote. In 2012, white men lagged white women by four points (38 versus 34) of the total sex by race vote.

Put it all together?

In 1984, those blue-collar men cast nearly three times as many votes as the white-collar women; in 2012, for the first time, the college women (at 19 percent) outvoted the noncollege men (at 17 percent). Given that the share of white adults with at least a four-year degree has increased in every year since 1981 except two, and that women are garnering nearly three-fifths of those degrees, this gap is likely to widen.

Republicans do better among married voters than single ones. In 1984, married couples were 70 percent of all white voters. In 2012, it was 65 percent.

Republicans do better among religious voters. In 2007, 15 percent of white voters were secular. In 2012, it was 20 percent.

Republicans do better among whites in states ignored by Democratic presidential campaigns. Here's an amazing stat: ""Obama equaled or exceeded his national share of the vote among noncollege whites in 22 of the 31 states in which exit polls were conducted last year—and won each of them except Indiana.""

Republicans do better among older whites. During the 1980s, Democrats averaged 36 percent among white voters under the age of 30. Since 2000, Democrats have averaged 45 percent.

On the Republican side, the decline of labor households has given them a boost among working-class non-college educated whites. But the broader trends are not favorable to them. And unless the GOP does an about-face on social issues like gay marriage, for starters, its slide into electoral irrelevance will continue.

And you know they won't. Not without suffering additional electoral pain."

Enter the RNC's five-person ""Growth and Opportunity"" committee, an ethnically diverse cadre of political veterans and RNC members analyzing what the party must to do avoid another 2012-like drubbing. (Think of them as The Bobs from ""Office Space,"" but with American flag lapel pins.)

The group includes Henry Barbour, a Mississippi committeeman and Haley Barbour's nephew; former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer; Florida strategist Sally Bradshaw; South Carolina committeeman Glenn McCall and Puerto Rico committeewoman Zori Fonalledas. They will submit a detailed report in March that looks back on the 2012 election and forward to 2014 and 2016.

Story continues

""You're going to see a very renewed aggressive effort by this party to put on a different face,"" Bradshaw said on Thursday. ""We've got to find a way to take our message to more people and get more votes. It's not a particularly complicated formula. We got beat; we have to change what we're doing.""

The report is a work in progress, and only part of it will be made public, but The Bobs delivered an update on their findings on Thursday to the RNC members.

First, they said Republicans must work on improving their tone when taking their ideas to the American people. For example, when discussing immigration, maybe presidential candidates should avoid phrases like ""self-deportation"" (Mitt Romney) and ""anchor babies"" (Michele Bachmann).

Henry Barbour said some in the party can appear ""hostile"" to certain constituencies with the rhetoric they use. The party must increase communication training for candidates, he said.

""There are certainly too many times when we've had candidates who have come across as hostile, and that's not really helpful when you're trying to win elections,"" Barbour said.

Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, was even more blunt.

""We need to understand that we can't come off as a bunch of angry white men,"" he said.

Minority 'engagement' a top priority

Making an honest effort to engage minorities was above anything else the main, yet unofficial, focus of party leaders this week.

On Thursday, committee members took part in a closed-door panel discussion on minority engagement. Edward Cousar, a black committeeman from South Carolina who sat on the panel, said white Republicans struggle in part because they spend too much time with other white Republicans. They have little idea how to speak or interact in a way that appears welcoming to outsiders who come from different ethnic and social backgrounds.

""People get set in their ways, and maybe they don't have a diverse set of friends and they say things,"" Cousar told Yahoo News in an interview before the panel. ""It's not that they're being racist. They just don't know.""

Cousar, who leads the Black Republican Political Action Committee, pointed to past Republican efforts to suppress early voting—""shameful,"" he said—and Romney's writing off of 47 percent of the country as unwinnable.

""I always thought Romney had better policies,"" Cousar, who is the only Republican in his family, said, comparing Romney and Obama. ""But he was a horrible messenger.""

In November, Obama won more than 70 percent of the Hispanic vote and more than 95 percent of black voters supported him. Single women also fled the Republican party on Election Day, with about two-thirds supporting the Democrat. It's a serious problem for Republicans, one they admit will take a lot of time to overcome.

""It's not going to happen overnight,"" said McCall, a black member of the study group. ""But it can be done, and we're going to make that effort.""

No more witches

Part of that effort relies heavily on recruiting quality candidates, many attendees said.

For the past four years, Republicans have faced a series of disappointing setbacks after mediocre candidates—often tea party favorites—have gone on to lose very winnable elections.

They include Todd ""Legitimate Rape"" Akin, who lost a Missouri Senate race last year and forced Romney and other Republicans on the defensive over women's issues.

In 2010, Nevada's Sharron ""Second Amendment Remedies"" Angle and Delaware's Christine ""I'm Not A Witch"" O'Donnell lost Senate races Republicans had been expected to win.

The party hopes to take steps to avoid such catastrophes.

Republicans say if that means supporting a moderate candidate who can actually win over a hardline conservative who doesn't stand a chance, so be it. (You may have noticed that among the names that make up The Bobs, there isn't anyone who might be considered a ""tea party leader."")

""If we're not nominating candidates that can win in the general election, what business are we in?"" Barbour said. ""We are in the business of winning elections.""

There is one thing, however, that no one—not the committee members, elected officials or even The Bobs—seem interested in addressing, and that's whether core Republican ideas need to change.

Most here said they don't.

""The conservative message sells,"" said Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""We're on the right side of history, on the right side of the issues. We just haven't done a very good job on articulating the issues.""

Anuzis' analysis is pretty universal in Republican circles. They see the true cause of their problems as merely poor presentations of otherwise good ideas.

That means a tricky rhetorical sleight of hand.

Don't believe women should have access to an abortion if they are raped or victims of incest? Try not to talk about it. Think the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes are ""takers""? Please don't quote Ayn Rand in your stump speech. Support laws banning gay couples from legal rights guaranteed to straight couples? Keep it in the closet. And remember, when in doubt, pivot and talk about economic growth.

Barbour admitted his committee wasn't brought in to debate or change those policy ideas. Their task, he said, is to put Republicans on a path to win election—not a squishy exercise in lazy pontificating or a dorm room bull session about the proper role of government.

It's data driven.

It's going to hurt some feelings.

And most of all, it's damn serious.

""We did get whipped in the presidential election,"" Barbour said. ""That's not something we take lightly."""

Congress will investigate the IRS%27 enhanced scrutiny of Tea Party-related groups

The controversy could derail any IRS efforts to crack down on tax-exempt groups active in politics%2C observers say.

%27Social-welfare%27 nonprofits spent more than %24250 million in 2012 federal elections

WASHINGTON —The political firestorm over the Internal Revenue Service's admission that it targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny during the 2012 election could jeopardize separate efforts underway in Congress to force the agency to crack down on non-profit political organizations, observers say.

Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, immediately denounced the IRS after a top official acknowledged that organizations that included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status were singled out for additional questioning. The Republican-controlled House plans an investigation.

The scandal erupted Friday when Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, apologized for the enhanced scrutiny of Tea Party-related groups' tax-exempt applications. She told reporters Friday that the actions were undertaken by low-level employees in Cincinnati, and that she learned of the additional scrutiny through news reports last year.

A draft timeline of events compiled by the agency's inspector general, however, indicates Lerner was briefed about the additional scrutiny in 2011.

""This is going to be fodder for partisan warfare in Congress,"" said Richard Hasen, a campaign-finance expert who teaches law at the University of California-Irvine. He said congressional hearings are justified.

""At the very least, it's a distraction for the IRS,"" he said. ""At the most, it will significantly dampen efforts to rein in shadowy"" groups.

Campaign-finance watchdogs, along with a handful of mostly Democratic lawmakers, have put increasing pressure on the IRS to more closely monitor the actions of self-described ""social welfare"" organizations — arguing these groups have abused the tax code to mask their funders.

These tax-exempt groups can conduct political activity, but it cannot be their primary function. Experts say that groups are spending as much as 49% of their money on politics, instead of a minimal amount.

In the 2012 election, social welfare groups — led by Crossroads GPS, an organization linked to Republican strategist Karl Rove — spent more than $254 million on last-minute advertising to shape the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political money.

None disclosed its donors.

Bills in the House and Senate would require top donors to put their names on any political advertising they helped fund. Previous efforts to pass similar measures have failed. Proposed legislation introduced last month by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also would give the IRS the power to temporarily revoke the tax-exempt status of serious violators.

Wyden said political operatives are ""masquerading as tax-exempt social welfare groups.""

""The IRS has refused to take on its clear responsibility to interpret and enforce the existing law when it comes to these tax-exempt 'social welfare' groups that injected massive amounts of dark money into the 2012 elections,"" he said.

David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, which favors fewer campaign-finance regulations, said the IRS incident ""proves Congress should not pass pending legislation to give the IRS more power over advocacy or political groups.""

""The agency abuses that power, doesn't understand the need to exercise it with caution, or is simply incompetent to exercise it with care,"" he said.

David Vance of the Campaign Legal Center, one of the campaign-finance watchdog groups urging the IRS to investigate social-welfare groups, said that ""the goal of this political storm is to scuttle the IRS cracking down on the larger abuses.""

""I hope this doesn't cause them to turn around with their tail behind their legs and leave the field,"" he said.

The controversial IRS action disclosed Friday did not involve groups that had already secured their tax-exempt status and were active in politics. Instead, IRS officials decided to subject conservative groups to additional questions as they reviewed the organizations' applications for tax-exempt status.

Lerner, who heads the IRS Exempt Organization section, said workers inappropriately assumed that any group with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in its name needed more scrutiny for political activity just because of its name. About 300 groups that had applied for tax-exempt status were put into a ""bucket"" of cases needing further scrutiny, and of those, about a quarter had Tea Party affiliations, she said.

Lerner said what happened in Cincinnati won't affect the agency's ability to investigate other tax-exempt groups for improper political conduct. Officials who conduct those reviews are ""used to looking at organizations in a very different way,"" she said.

Those reviews are done by staffers in Dallas, who submit allegations to a review panel, which decides if further investigation is warranted. She said the episode has further sensitized the IRS to avoiding even the appearance of political decision-making. Lerner made her apology at a meeting of the American Bar Association's exempt organization committee in Washington on Friday.

Suzanne Ross McDowell, a partner with Steptoe & Johnson who heads that committee, said the IRS has been inundated with new applications for tax-exempt organizations ever since the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 to allow direct corporate and union spending on independent political advertising.

""But there is a lot of uncertainty about how you draw the line between intervention in a political campaign, and other activities that are not intervention in a political campaign, such as issue advocacy,"" she said.

""These are very tough questions, and I don't think any of us have the answer.""

Richard Briffault, a campaign-finance expert at Columbia Law School, said the IRS has a legitimate responsibility to examine whether organizations that receive tax protections have appropriately limited their political activity. But, as non-profits proliferate, the agency has been pressured to play a larger role in helping to uncover donors who critics say choose to fund social-welfare groups just to hide their political contributions.

""If Congress were to develop more effective rules for campaign-finance disclosure … some of this problem would go away,"" Briffault said. ""That doesn't look like it's happening anytime soon.""

It's an outcome that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has worked hard to avoid, for the sake of his party's reputation. But Boehner, short on time and tactics, may have no other choice now than to let calamity physics work its will.

For the past week, warnings over the possibility of a shutdown have rung out. Jonathan Chait advised just last week that ""a government shutdown is more likely now"" because the time in which to actually deal-make around it is quickly elapsing. Not that a deal seemed likely. As one source, positioned to suss out the state of negotiations, told Jonathan Cohn, ""The breakdown is more extensive than you've heard ... There is no discussion going on at all at this point.""

And Peter Weber cautions, ""Brace yourselves,"" because everyone's incentives seem to align in such a way that makes a shutdown a fait accompli. President Barack Obama thinks the shutdown will add political capital to his coffers. Democrats believe it will improve their position to bargain on the budget. Tea party Republicans believe the conventional wisdom -- which holds that the GOP's brand loses out in the event of a shutdown -- is wrong, and that they actually have the leverage. The Hill reports that ""at least 43 conservatives want the GOP leadership to go for broke"" over this.

Standing at the center of all of this is House Speaker John Boehner, who has, thus far, attempted to stave off a shutdown on the grounds that it would be bad for the GOP's brand. But he might be all out of options.

His most recent gambit was to try to get the House to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning, with a sidecar resolution attached that would defund Obamacare. The idea is to give his caucus colleagues another chance to vent their disapproval of Obamacare without imperiling the federal government. At the same time, Boehner has extended the notion that there will be time enough for hostage-taking when the debate over the debt ceiling is enjoined. (Of course, there's no indication that Boehner thinks a debt ceiling row would be any better for the GOP than a shutdown, but if his colleagues accepted this plan, he would at the very least buy some time.)

The problem, however, is that the more raucous members of his caucus have rejected Boehner's ""continuing resolution with a side of Obamacare defunding,"" and call this plan a ""sell-out."" Boehner is further hamstrung by the fact that his colleagues have turned the ""Hastert Rule"" -- which holds that the speaker can't bring anything to the floor for a vote without first securing a ""majority of the majority"" -- into official House GOP dogma.

All of this brought Boehner to his lowest point last week, when he vented his frustrations at reporters, saying, ""Do you have an idea? They'll just shoot it down anyway."" So now, as The New Republic's Noam Scheiber posits, Boehner might just let his colleagues take aim at their own collective foot.

Back in March, Scheiber mapped out the strategy that Boehner's been using to move important business through the House and survive -- both as a House speaker and as a guy tasked with keeping his party's standing from collapsing. It goes something like this:

First Boehner stakes out a position so extreme or impractical that he effectively marginalizes himself from any negotiation with Democrats. At that point, Democrats begin to bargain with Boehner's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Once they strike a deal, it passes the Senate with overwhelming support. This is the cue to Boehner to troop before his caucus and lament that they fought the good fight for as long as they could, but now even their fellow Republicans have turned on them. If it is their will to hold out, then Boehner will obey it. (Always best to give crazy people the illusion of agency.) But he can no longer in good faith recommend this path. Invariably, the lunatics fold.

But with those same lunatics in full revolt against Boehner's continuing resolution gambit, that particular jig is up. So Scheiber now reckons that Boehner has no choice left but to stop treating the symptoms and fully feed the disease:

Now, don’t get me wrong: Boehner clearly prefers to avoid a government shutdown. He's spent months figuring out how to do that, fully aware of the political debacle it would entail. Unfortunately, it's now clear that the only way he can induce the political isolation he typically relies on to prod his caucus into semi-rational action is by shutting down the government and inviting the public backlash he's been so desperate to avoid. Boehner simply has no other way of talking sense into his people, no other hope of making the House GOP governable. And so, in the end, a shutdown is in Boehner's interest, too.

The hopeful possibility here, according to Scheiber, is that now maybe Boehner's GOP antagonists will ""sober up before we take on the substantially higher-stakes proposition of avoiding a debt default."" That would, indeed, be a welcome occurrence.

But contending against this possibility are electoral fundamentals. The GOP goes into the midterm elections with a very strong hand. The vagaries of redistricting, and the fact that the bulk of the Democratic base has sequestered itself into a limited number of urban districts, means that there literally might not be enough votes in the right districts to threaten any of the GOP dead-enders. And a government shutdown may not actually be enough of an apocalypse to alter the underlying electoral plate tectonics.

So there's a good chance that Boehner's plan will simply further tarnish the GOP's standing, without providing sufficient motivation to push his colleagues in a saner direction.

But as Boehner himself has asked, do you have a better idea?

The Tea Party Express Is Coming For You, Saxby Chambliss (R)!","So my shear hatred towards U.S. Senator Saxby ""Chicken Hawk"" Chambliss (R. GA) is no secret here. In fact thanks to all you wonderful people, you made my hate letter to Chambliss my most recced diary:

http://www.dailykos.com/...

Well it looks like Amy Kremer, chairman of the national Tea Party Express and a Georgia resident shares my hatred for Chambliss as well but for different reasons:

http://blogs.ajc.com/...



“And we’re a red state, we deserve a conservative senator, a conservative senator that would stand with [Sens.] Marco Rubio [R-Fla.] and Rand Paul [R-Ky.] and Mike Lee [R-Utah] who all voted ‘no’ for this bill.” - Ann Kremer, chairman of the national Tea Party Express, 1/3/13

Kremer is pissed that Chambliss voted for the recent fiscal cliff deal which involves tax increases so that's why she hates him. I hate him because of what he did to this great man in 2002:The best part is Chambliss is shitting his pants now more than ever:

http://blogs.ajc.com/...



Based on what he told reporters in a conference call this morning, I guess Saxby Chambliss is taking talk of a primary challenge seriously:

Junkyard dogs wearing helmets and chin straps while drawing lines in the sand? - Jay Bookman for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, 1/4/13

Yeah, ok Chambliss. Teabaggers might be crazy and stupid but they know you're all bark and no bite. Plus lets not forget that the Libertarian vote took away decent chunk of your vote back in 2008 causing you to go up in a runoff with Democrat Jim Martin.

Now I do want to see Chambliss go down in the primary, that's the first part of what I like to think of as the Max Cleland Karma Pay Back but the second part is taking back this seat for the Democrats. Right now, there hasn't been any names showing any interest. Yes Blue Dog Democratic Congressman John Barrow and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed have been mentioned but they're not really interested. I've heard a lot of names mentioned from Former Governor Roy Barnes to Jimmy Carter's son, Jason Carter to even the idea of Cleland himself running for the Senate. PPP showed us that Cleland is the only one who comes the closest to beating Chambliss. For some reason the PPP had them tied. Now against a more conservative, Tea Party Republican like Congressman Tom Price, Democrats have a much better shot. In looking for our ideal candidate to take on Chambliss, PPP offers this advice:



-Chambliss' cross over appeal to Democrats would make him hard to defeat in a general election. But given the very real possibility of him losing to an extreme conservative candidate in the primary it might benefit Democrats to get a Joe Donnelly caliber candidate who doesn't have a lot to lose into the race, just in case... - PPP, 12/4/12

My advice to Georgia Democrats is this: nominate someone who is open to immigration reform. Yes, you need a centrist Democrat who can appeal to white voters but even Cleland, who voted for the Bush Tax Cuts, was pro-environment, pro-choice and most importantly, pro-immigration reform. Voter turnout is key for Democrats to win this seat against a crazy teabagger and Georgia's changing demographics show great potential for a Democratic victory:

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",California probe of campaign donations sheds light on ‘dark money’,"SACRAMENTO — Tony Russo had a multimillion-dollar problem.

The Republican consultant and his team had raised piles of cash to use in California politics as last November’s election approached. But a wrinkle in state law meant he couldn’t spend it in the final two months of the campaign without jeopardizing the anonymity he had promised his rich donors.

So Russo turned to what he called “the Koch network.” He asked a political consultant who has worked with billionaire Republican contributors Charles and David Koch to shuttle the money through an Arizona nonprofit. That group, which is not required to reveal its donors, could send cash to California causes without names attached.

But things went from bad to worse. Although Russo handed over $25 million, only about $15 million ended up back in California. And when the money surfaced, it sparked an investigation by state authorities, who last month levied $16 million in penalties against the Arizona group and three others.

The case offers a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of politically active nonprofits, which have played an increasing role in elections nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court eased campaign rules in 2010. They provide donors a way to influence elections by piping major money around the country until it resurfaces — without their fingerprints — in a campaign.

Advocates of transparency in government call it “dark money.”

Russo declined to be interviewed by The Times. But he and his colleagues detailed their experience for California investigators, conversations that were recorded in hundreds of pages of transcripts.

Those records and other documents released by authorities show a convoluted money trail. They also show the risks of operating in a political world so intricate that even Russo didn’t fully understand how it worked when he threw in his donors’ money.

“There’s all kinds of groups all over the country that I wouldn’t even know,” Russo said.

::

California Republicans faced two major battles last year: a fight against Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax hike and a push to pass a measure that would limit unions’ political fundraising.

Russo did not think the state party was up to the task. He envisioned an independent advertising pitch to voters that would tout economic destruction wrought by tax increases and political havoc caused by powerful California labor unions.

To bring in the big money needed for a statewide television campaign, Russo worked with GOP consultant Jeff Miller, lead fundraiser for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and for Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. Miller declined to be interviewed by The Times.

The Fisher family, of the clothing firm Gap Inc., contributed more than $9 million. San Francisco investor Charles Schwab gave $6.4 million, and Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad sent $1 million.

The money went to a Virginia nonprofit that would use it to pay for the ad blitz and be allowed to keep the contributors secret. Nonprofits, unlike political action committees, are not required to identify their donors under federal law.

Many donors did not want to “put their name on … this fight because they didn’t want to face the retribution of the unions,” Miller told state investigators. Deep-pocketed labor groups were planning major campaign efforts in 2012, and some conservatives were wary of crossing them.

But by the time the money was pouring in, summer was turning into fall. If the donations were spent after early September, there was a risk that the veil would have to be lifted on those who wrote the checks, in accordance with California’s complex campaign laws.

That’s when Russo turned to Republican strategist Sean Noble, who has worked as a consultant for the Koch brothers and whom he had met on a trip to Las Vegas the year before.

Noble heads the Center to Protect Patient Rights, an Arizona nonprofit known as a clearinghouse for conservative causes. In 2010, the organization had distributed more than $55 million to 26 groups allied with Republicans to help them in the midterm elections.

Robert Tappan, a spokesman for Koch Industries, confirmed that Noble has worked for the Koch brothers as a political consultant. Charles and David Koch did not play any role in California campaigns last year, Tappan said.

Noble declined to speak with investigators, according to Gary Winuk, enforcement chief at the California Fair Political Practices Commission, and he did not answer requests for comment from The Times.

Noble had already helped Russo with hundreds of thousands of dollars for political research and focus groups. Now Russo needed a different kind of assistance.

He wanted the Virginia group, Americans for Job Security, to transfer the millions he had raised with Miller to Noble’s center, and he wanted Noble to relay the money to California campaign committees, obscuring the money trail.

There were risks. Russo and Miller would forfeit control of the donations, and they knew little about Noble. But donors had recommended him, the pair told investigators. And “we were running out of options,” Miller said.

Advertisement

On Sept. 10, the Virginia group sent about $4 million to Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights. Within a few days, the center routed roughly the same sum to an Iowa nonprofit, which sent it to a newly created California campaign committee.

Russo and Miller then directed $20.5 million more to the center, for a total of nearly $25 million.

The state documents show that one of the donors working with Russo and Miller, whose name was crossed out, emailed Charles Koch to ask for his direct assistance.

“It would be great if you could support the final effort with several million,” the donor wrote, adding that “Sean Noble from your group has been immensely helpful,” and “I look forward to seeing you on a golf course.”

::

A month before the November election, the whole operation came crashing down.

At that point, Noble had routed about $4 million to a California campaign committee. Russo sent him a text message asking for more cash, and $11 million was quickly delivered to the Small Business Action Committee, a California PAC fighting higher taxes and supporting the anti-union measure.

The money had come from an obscure Phoenix nonprofit, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which had received it from the Center to Protect Patient Rights.

An $11-million donation attracts immediate attention, even in a state as large as California. Americans for Responsible Leadership refused to tell the Fair Political Practices Commission, California’s ethics watchdog, where the money originated, and the agency launched an investigation to determine whether disclosure laws had been violated.

That heat created a problem. When Russo next asked Noble to transfer money, Noble balked. Expressing concern about the investigation, Noble said he didn’t think he could help now, Russo told investigators.

Miller believed Noble hoped to prevent California authorities “from opening up his books,” giving them the keys to an entire network of nonprofits that were distributing money around the country.

Russo never pried another dime from Noble. Russo said he and Miller scrambled to raise more cash to make up for the rest of the funds.

Miller said he was angry. “But at that point,” he said, “we were screwed, you know, because we didn’t have any legal control.”

On election day, voters passed Brown’s tax-hike plan and rejected the anti-union measure, delivering two blows to the Republicans.

Late last month, state officials announced they were fining the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership a total of $1 million for violating California law. The groups should have disclosed that the center was the source of the campaign money but had failed to do so, authorities said.

The Small Business Action Committee and another California campaign group were ordered to pay the state $15 million, equivalent to the amount of money state officials said was improperly reported. The Iowa group that was the conduit for $4 million was not fined because it is more established in California politics, Winuk said.

Russo, sitting in his lawyer’s Sacramento office in July, told authorities he still wasn’t sure what happened to the $10 million that never came back to California.

Courtesy KnotstheFilm.comKnots: A Forced Marriage Story is driven by a noble aim: to give voice to the voiceless. Director Kate Ryan Brewer’s documentary (May 7, in theaters) concerns three women from different geographic, religious and social backgrounds who found themselves in comparable circumstances—namely, being bullied into matrimony with strangers by their parents and cultural leaders, with no way out. It’s a familiar tale of misogynistic coercion except that in this case, the disparate victims in question didn’t reside in the Middle East, India, or another foreign land where such practices are more common. On the contrary, they took place right here in the United States.That such rancid behavior still goes on in various parts of this country probably won’t come as an enormous shock to many, especially given the recent success of Netflix’s Unorthodox, which dramatized the based-on-real-events efforts of one Hasidic Jewish woman to flee her Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and, with it, her arranged marriage. Nonetheless, Knots: A Forced Marriage Story shines a spotlight on what remains an intensely pressing issue, since today, only four states (Delaware, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) limit marriages to individuals who are 18 and over, and 10 states have no minimum age limit at all for tying the knot. The result is a recurring paradigm in which women are susceptible to being trapped in permanent captivity, cut off from the larger world (and the legal rights that might empower them), and denied any recourse for escape. Is Rapper Blueface’s OnlyFans ‘Cult’ Exploiting Young Women?Knots: A Forced Marriage Story provides a comprehensive cross-section of religious victimization.

Nina was married off at 18 to a random man hand-selected by her father, which was basically the same fate that befell California native Sara, whose Muslim father was part of an outfit known as the Group that saw fit to pair her with a 28-year-old stranger when she was only 15 years old. Fraidy, brought up in New Jersey’s Orthodox Jewish community, suffered similar hardship, compelled by her parents, her rabbis, and those in her insular enclave to marry a man whom she barely knew.While the particulars of their experiences were somewhat different—Nina was told that disobedience made her, for all intents and purposes, a “witch,” whereas Fraidy was simply conditioned and shamed into complying—Knots: A Forced Marriage Story makes clear that the basic mechanisms of subjugation were the same in all three cases. The common link binding this trio is that they all hailed from extremist religious environments. Yet puzzlingly, that facet goes largely unexplored here. To contextualize her first-hand narratives, director Brewer provides a cursory recap of 20th century American cultural attitudes toward child marriage, which goes some way toward illustrating how onerous laws about the practice first got on the books.However, not for a second does the filmmaker directly address the fact that her subjects were casualties of fanatical faiths that indoctrinated members about female subservience and then established women’s powerlessness through oppressive and domineering rules and demands.This is ignoring the elephant in the room, and it’s exacerbated by Knots: A Forced Marriage Story’s refusal to even verbally identify Sara as Muslim; a quick glimpse of Arabic writing is the only overt clue to her religious background. Such a willful lack of specificity abounds in Brewer’s documentary, which glosses over much-needed details at myriad turns. Whether refraining from referencing Nina, Sara, and Faidy’s husbands by name, or discussing the means of their eventual liberation in vague terms, the proceedings feel at odds with themselves, trying to intimately probe these horror stories while simultaneously maintaining a measure of arm’s-length detachment that—even if it’s designed to protect Nina, Sara, and Faidy in some way—proves frustrating.Sara and Nina, consequently, come across as sympathetic if largely unknown; there’s a nebulousness to their tales that stymies true engagement with their plights. Knots: A Forced Marriage Story does slightly better by Faidy, who openly recounts the abuse she endured from her husband, and the precise actions she took—involving fleeing in a car with her kids on the Sabbath (a big no-no), and later changing the locks on her home’s doors—to achieve the freedom she increasingly realized she needed. Alas, her account is also sometimes undercut by murkiness, such as her post-escape decision to found Unchained at Last, a nonprofit organization that aids women in situations similar to the one Faidy found herself in at a young age. Brewer depicts a few Unchained at Last press events, but largely fails to outline its origins or mission—an approach it also takes with the Tahirih Justice Center, which is never properly introduced even though its members speak on-camera at multiple points.Knots: A Forced Marriage Story is driven by virtuous intentions, and it lucidly explains how forced marriages are allowed to occur in the U.S. thanks to draconian (and inconsistent) state laws that first allow young girls to be married off—with parental consent—at early ages, and then deny them the adult right to get divorced (because technically, they’re still minors). Unfortunately, so much basic information is left out of the film that it comes across as a rough draft of a documentary. To compensate for that skimpiness, Brewer embellishes her action with cutaways to both painted illustrations that mirror Nina, Sara, and Faidy’s ordeals, and to the sight of an anguished woman dancing against a blank wall while bound up in red string—a visual evocation of forced marriage that’s awkward and unnecessary.Unlike Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s One of Us, which immersed itself in the nightmare of trying to break free from the Orthodox Jewish community, Knots: A Forced Marriage Story casts a wider net and yet comes up with considerably less. It’s a timely documentary whose formal shortcomings prevent it from getting at the bigger picture.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Asked about the oft-cited quote that 47 percent of Americans can't be persuaded to take personal responsibility, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said, ""Actually, I didn't say that ...That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.""

At a May 2012 closed-to-the-press fundraiser in Florida, Romney said, ""And so my job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon in some cases emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what it looks like.""

But Romney told Balz that the focus of his remarks was on swing voters, not on those who were already in President Barack Obama's camp. ""[I]t was saying, 'Look, the Democrats have 47 percent, we've got 45 percent, my job is to get the people in the middle, and I've got to get the people in the middle,'"" he said. ""They’ve got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived -- as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat.""

Romney's argument that the remarks were taken out of context is a new defense for him. During the campaign, he said at first that they were ""not elegantly stated"" and then that they were ""completely wrong.""

Also in the interview with Balz, Romney claimed that Obama had made a similar comment: ""And I think the president said he's writing off 47 percent of Americans and so forth. And that wasn't at all what was intended. That wasn't what was meant by it. That is the way it was perceived.""

Romney nonetheless acknowledged that the quote was ""very damaging"" to his campaign. Indeed, the Obama campaign seized on the remark, creating an ad based on it, and the former Massachusetts governor took a hit in the polls."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/20/christie-scrutinized-for-cameo-in-nj-tourism-ad/,2013-05-20 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Christie scrutinized for cameo in NJ tourism ad,"8 years ago

(CNN) - New Jersey Democrat and gubernatorial hopeful Barbara Buono released a new web video Monday–but it's not the ad getting the most attention in the Garden State these days.

Republican Gov. Chris Christie is taking heat for his role in a new tourism ad for his state following the devastating impact of Superstorm Sandy.



The television commercial, released last week, is part of a $25 million tourism campaign using federal funds to promote the Jersey Shore this summer.

So what's the problem?

Christie, who's running for re-election this year, makes a cameo in the 30-second spot, prompting some critics to say the potential 2016 presidential contender is using federal taxpayer dollars to boost his political image.

After Congress delayed sending tens of billions in relief aid to Northeastern states at the beginning of this year, Christie went on a blistering critique of Washington lawmakers during a now-famous press conference.

""We respond to innocent victims of natural disasters, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans,"" he said, adding politics was trumping the needs of U.S. citizens. ""For me, it was disappointing and disgusting to watch.""

The Star-Ledger in New Jersey noted in a biting editorial Sunday that it's not the people who are most bouncing back from the story who get to star in the tourism ad–it's the state's governor, who already gets plenty of air time and positive ratings as the public face of state recovery efforts.

""(It's) not the small business owners working to get back on their feet. Not shore residents trying to rebuild, or their kids,"" the editorial stated. ""Not even celebrities, as in the 'Fall in Love with Louisiana All Over Again ad campaign after Hurricane Katrina, which featured local stars who participated for free. Were Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi simply unavailable?""

Christie may face more questions Monday when he makes a media appearance on the Lavallette Boardwalk.

The governor and his family appear in the ad for about five seconds at the end, as they sit on the shore and declare the state is ""stronger than the storm.""

Christie has argued in defense that ""there's nothing political about the ads"" and his aides point out that the commercials won't even be running in New Jersey itself, according to the Star Ledger.

But the editorial asked that ""given Christie's presidential ambitions, is it any surprise that he'd use federal relief dollars to splash his face all over TV in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Canada – in addition to ads in print, on the radio and Internet?""

Colin Reed, a spokesman for the governor, told CNN the move was a creative decision by the Stronger Than The Storm campaign to include Christie and his wife in the ad.

""They are in a uniquely qualified position to tell a very wide audience beyond New Jersey that our state and our Shore is open for business,"" he said.

Christie saw a surge in his poll numbers during the aftermath of the storm, a popularity that he's maintained in the last six months.

Recent surveys also indicate the governor has a strong advantage over his Democratic opponent in this year's gubernatorial race.

In Buono's new web ad, the state senator takes a light-hearted approach in telling voters how to say her often-mispronounced name. She has been vastly outspent by Christie in ads."

(CNN) —

How can the leader of the Republican Party – the political party that claims to be so concerned about our freedoms – want to limit freedom of the press?

It’s shocking, but that’s exactly what Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus wants to do. Why? Because Priebus is outraged that NBC and CNN are developing TV projects about Hillary Clinton, scheduled to air in 2015.

Apparently, Priebus thinks most Americans have never heard of this Hillary Clinton person. Consequently, he fears that these TV shows could make her a household name – almost as well-known as say, Bill Clinton.

So what did he do? He sent threatening letters to the heads of NBC and CNN, informing them that “if you have not agreed to pull this programming prior to the start of the RNC’s summer meeting on August 14, I will seek a binding vote of the RNC stating that the committee will neither partner with you in 2016 primary debates nor sanction primary debates which you sponsor.”

Bottom line: Priebus is telling media outlets that if they broadcast content that the Republican Party does not like, it will freeze those networks out of the 2016 GOP presidential debates.

Dean Obeidallah

This is the same Priebus who wrote an article denouncing President Barack Obama for what Priebus called his attack on American freedoms. And it was Priebus who, during the 2012 presidential election, predicted that if Obama were re-elected, he would destroy our “way of life in America” and that “Mitt Romney has to win for liberty and freedom.”

Let’s make one thing very clear: The RNC is not just another run-of-the-mill organization threatening a boycott over media content. The RNC includes elected officials from across the nation, from governors to state officials to hundreds of members of Congress.

Will the next threat be that the RNC will block interviews with Republican officials if it objects to a newspaper, website or network’s content? Or will some outlets be subject to greater fines for Federal Communications Commission violations or be kept from offering input on proposed federal regulations that affect the media?

We cannot allow the freedom of our media to be politicized. If the Democratic National Committee had issued a similar threat to any media outlet planning to air a TV special about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, I would be adamantly opposing its conduct as well. This is truly something that should unite all media outlets – from MSNBC to Fox News and everyone in between.

Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone in the media sees it this way.

On Monday night, Sean Hannity welcomed Priebus on his Fox News show and applauded his proposal. And Priebus – in a candid moment – made it clear it was time for the Republican Party to “stand up to networks not in the business of promoting our party and not in the business of promoting our candidates.” In essence, Priebus wants every media outlet to be like Fox News or suffer the consequences.

CNN, NBC move forward on Hillary Clinton projects

As the late Justice Hugo Black noted in one of the most famous U.S. Supreme Court decisions on freedom of the press, “the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.”

NBC and CNN should not buckle to the RNC’s attempt to silence content if it does not approve. In fact, they should produce even more Hillary Clinton programs – maybe a reality show, “Keeping Up With the Clintons,” or a series simply called “Hillary!”

And Fox News is, of course, free to air “Dancing With the Marco Rubios.”

If ever an issue should unite Republicans, Democrats and independents, it’s this one. We need to make it clear to Priebus that political parties must not try to limit the freedom of our media. Such a proposal is not only dangerously wrong, it’s an affront to the very spirit of our Constitution.

Mark Sanford’s comeback try encountered severe turbulence Wednesday when the National Republican Congressional Committee withdrew its financial support less than three weeks before a special election for his former House seat.

The action by the GOP’s campaign arm came one day after a damaging allegation by Sanford’s ex-wife came to light. It accused him of a pattern of trespassing at her house in violation of their 2010 divorce decree.

“Mark Sanford has proven he knows what it takes to win elections,” said Andrea Bozek, NRCC communications director, in a statement. “At this time, the NRCC will not be engaged in this special election.” The NRCC had not yet begun advertising on Sanford’s behalf and had spent relatively little on his campaign, an official said.

Much of the Republican establishment has been holding Sanford at a distance, though he did receive the endorsement of House Speaker John Boehner this month after winning the GOP nomination in a runoff primary.

Republicans are worried that more damaging revelations about Sanford’s personal life could emerge before the election, according to a Republican official. The official confirmed an account in Politico, which first reported the NRCC’s action and quoted a GOP operative as calling the committee’s decision to abandon Sanford “an unfortunate situation” which “happens when candidates aren’t honest and withhold information.”

On Tuesday night, the Associated Press reported that the former governor has been ordered to appear in family court on May 9, two days after the election, to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating his divorce agreement.

Sanford’s ex-wife, Jenny, in a complaint dated Feb. 4, said she returned to her house on Sunday, Feb. 3, to find the former governor leaving through the back door, using his cellphone as a flashlight. She called it part of “a pattern of entering” her property “without her permission and against her wishes.” She also said that she had previously demanded that her ex-husband stop the visits and had filed a “No Trespass” letter with the local police department.

Sanford, best known for claiming that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail when he was actually visiting his mistress in Argentina, issued a statement Wednesday in response to news of his ex-wife’s accusation. In it, the former governor said that he had come to her house while she was away to watch the Super Bowl with one of their four sons, a teenager, who was at home alone.

“It’s an unfortunate reality that divorced couples sometimes have disagreements that spill over into family court,” he said. “I did indeed watch the second half of the Super Bowl at the beach house with our 14-year-old son [Blake] because as a father I didn’t think he should watch it alone.”

Sanford said he had tried to reach his ex-wife “to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and met her at the back steps under the light of my cellphone when she returned and told her what had happened.

“There is always another side to every story, and while I am particularly curious how records that were sealed to avoid the boys dealing with embarrassment are now somehow exposed less than three weeks before this election, I agree with Jenny that the media is no place to debate what is ultimately a family court matter, and out of respect for Jenny and the boys, I’m not going to have any further comment at this time,” Sanford said.

Sanford’s private life and personal failures have been at the center of his attempt to regain public office, two years after leaving the governorship. Jenny Sanford had told the Los Angeles Times/Tribune Washington bureau last month that she had refused her ex-husband’s request to run his latest campaign. And Sanford’s Argentine fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, made a surprise appearance at his victory celebration on the night of the April 2 runoff election.

The Washington Post reported that it was the first time that Sanford’s 17-year-old son, Bolton, had met Chapur. In a text message, Jenny Sanford said, “That was indeed Bolton’s first intro and both boys were quite upset and visibly so.”

On Wednesday, a Democratic super PAC released an anti-Sanford attack ad designed to remind voters of Sanford’s past, including a record fine that he paid to settle ethics charges and his international travel, including visiting Argentina.

Sanford’s Democratic opponent is Elizabeth “Lulu” Colbert Busch, a civic activist and sister of TV comedian Stephen Colbert. The winner of the May 7 special election will fill the seat left vacant when Republican Rep. Tim Scott was appointed to fill the term of Sen. Jim DeMint, who quit the join the Heritage Foundation.

Other critics have said the problem is that MSNBC has become too tame and too cerebral by adding shows like ""All In"" with Chris Hayes to its prime time line-up and moving its firebrand hosts like Ed Schultz to Saturday obscurity.

I'm sure those reasons, and probably some others I can't think of have contributed to MSNBC's precipitous decline, but they are not why I've stopped watching the cable news channel on a regular basis. The fact is that as a liberal Democrat, I can't keep walking around in a constant state of impotent rage, it's literally killing me. Watching MSNBC every night only reinforces the fact that the Republican led House, Republican led state governments and the Republican-centric Supreme Court are sending this country to hell in a handbasket and there doesn't seem to be a bleepin' thing any of us, particularly elected Democrats, can do to stop it.

As much as I admire Rachel Maddow, and next to Jon Stewart, I think she's the best thing on television, I can no longer bear to hear her excellent and thorough analysis each night of how the ""red"" states are dismantling women's rights, shredding civil rights, denying voting rights and imposing their own brand of Sharia law in legislatures that have more in common with banana republics than the constitutional democracies they are supposed to represent. It turns out that ignorance is bliss, or at least it's not the gut-wrenching, stress-filled sense of hopelessness and dispair you get from having your attention riveted nightly on inequities that you are powerless to fix.

I mean really, how many protest marches do we join, petitions do we sign, or phone calls do we make before we accept the fact that our actions have less of an impact on the laws being passed to govern our lives than a gnat landing on the back of an elephant. It turns out that watching the destruction of our democracy with charts and graphs and color commentary on television every night is a soul killing experience and it's better for my health if I avoid it.

This, of course is what separates us from right-wing conservatives. Unlike us wussy progressives, they thrive on their anger, losing an argument only fuels their hatred and whets their appetite. FOX News stays at number one in the ratings whether their candidates lose an election, or a court decision goes against them, or their majority in the house fails to derail Obamacare. In fact, watching their set-backs and disappointments paraded on TV and explained as unjust results of a liberal conspiracy only makes them grow stronger and more irrational in their sense of purpose.

Not so for me. I simply can't continue to spend my days and evenings consumed with ineffectual fury. Tuning into a nightly, technicolor recap of the decimation of social and civil rights issues that were already argued and settled a half a century ago isn't illuminating my perspective, it's breaking my heart."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/21/Alexander-Lashes-Out-at-Tea-Party,2013-08-21 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Alexander Lashes Out at Tea Party,"Facing an active campaign by grass-roots activists to defeat him in next year’s primary, Sen. Lamar Alexander penned a letter to the state’s largest newspaper defending his pragmatic, “problem solving” approach to governing. The letter in The Tennessean defends his record as a conservative who knows how to “get results.”

“Well, I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,” Alexander writes. “So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem, IF you really want to get a result, instead of just making a speech.”

It is a superficially compelling argument. It is an argument conservatives have heard for decades. Yes, the perfect can’t be the enemy of the good. Yes, we have to compromise to meet many of our goals. And, yes, a half-loaf is better than nothing.

But it begs the question. Where has Alexander’s “compromise” and “problem-solving” approach taken us? Alexander has often abetted the Democrats in the Senate, supporting their legislative agenda and providing support for Obama nominees. When has he been able to persuade Democrats to support a conservative issue? Alexander’s record suggests compromise is a one-way street, i.e. Republicans support Democrats. When do Democrats in the Senate ever repay the favor Alexander extends them?

The record of the “problem-solving” approach is fairly grim. It has given us $16 trillion in debt, ObamaCare, bailouts of Wall Street and the auto industry, trillion dollar deficits, sweeping new regulations, and government encroachment on ever more aspects of our lives.

Against this, Alexander proudly trumps his successful campaign to preserve the rights of people to fish at dams. That’s all well and good, but it isn’t exactly an even trade.

I have no doubt that Alexander is a fine man and a decent-enough Senator. Unfortunately, both he and the state’s junior Senator, Bob Corker, represent something of a wasted opportunity. Tennessee is a deeply conservative state. It is still one of only a handful of states that doesn’t have an income tax. Alexander and Corker, however, have voting records that better reflect the voters in Maine or Illinois.

There is perhaps a place for Alexander’s approach to governing. Tennessee isn’t that place."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-ferguson/hillary-clinton-documentary_b_4014792.html,2013-09-30 08:22:41-04:00,"['Founder', 'President Of Representational Pictures', 'Inc.', 'Director', 'Producer', 'Author', 'Former Consultant To The White House']",Why I Am Cancelling My Documentary on Hillary Clinton,"In late 2012, CNN Films approached me about directing a documentary. We discussed a number of potential subjects, and eventually settled on Hillary Rodham Clinton. The film would be ambitious, controversial, and highly visible. But I felt that it was important, that I was qualified to do it, and that I could be fair. CNN gave me complete control (""final cut"") over the theatrical version, and a generous budget.

And then the fun began. The day after the contract was signed, I received a message from Nick Merrill, Hillary Clinton's press secretary. He already knew about the film, and clearly had a source within CNN. He interrogated me; at first I answered, but eventually I stopped. When I requested an off-the-record, private conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Merrill replied that she was busy writing her book, and not speaking to the media.

Next came Phillipe Reines, Hillary Clinton's media fixer, who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor (as nearly all documentaries and news organizations are). When I contacted him, he declined to speak with me. He then repeated his allegations to Politico, which published them.

CNN and I decided to publicly confirm the film project to clear the air. Immediately afterwards, the chairman of the Republican National Committee announced that the Republicans would boycott CNN with regard to the Republican presidential primary debates in 2016. Shortly afterwards, the entire RNC voted to endorse this position. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me was that, quietly and privately, prominent Democrats made it known both to CNN and to me that they weren't delighted with the film, either.

Next came David Brock, who published an open letter on his highly partisan Democratic website Media Matters, in which he endorsed the Republican National Committee's position, repeating Reines' conflict of interest allegations and suggesting that my documentary would revive old, discredited Clinton scandal stories. Coming from Mr. Brock, this was rather amusing. David Brock began life as an ultraconservative ""investigative journalist,"" quotation marks very much intended, spreading scandal with little regard for truth. He first attracted attention with The Real Anita Hill, his nasty (and factually wrong) hatchet job on the woman who, during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings, said that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Years later, he apologized and switched to the Democrats.

When Brock published his letter about my film, I got in touch with several prominent Democrats who knew Hillary Clinton. I told them that this campaign against the film and against CNN was counterproductive. They conveyed this message to Mrs. Clinton personally, along with my request to speak with her. The answer that came back was, basically, over my dead body.

None of this deterred or even greatly bothered me. I flew to New York and had a two hour meeting with CNN's President Jeff Zucker and his senior staff. They were great. They asked me how I was holding up -- I said fine. They pledged their support, expressed dismay that things were so nasty, and told me to go forth and make my film. I did so.

In June, I attended a dinner for Bill Clinton, which was educational. Clinton spoke passionately about his foundation, about African wildlife, inequality, childhood obesity, and much else with enormous factual command, emotion, and rhetorical power. But he and I also spoke privately. I asked him about the financial crisis. He paused and then became even more soulful, thoughtful, passionate, and articulate. And then he proceeded to tell me the most amazing lies I've heard in quite a while.

For example, Mr. Clinton sorrowfully lamented his inability to stop the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which banned all regulation of private (OTC) derivatives trading, and thereby greatly worsened the crisis. Mr. Clinton said that he and Larry Summers had argued with Alan Greenspan, but couldn't budge him, and then Congress passed the law by a veto-proof supermajority, tying his hands. Well, actually, the reason that the law passed by that overwhelming margin was because of the Clinton Administration's strong advocacy, including Congressional testimony by Larry Summers and harsh public and private attacks on advocates of regulation by Summers and Robert Rubin.

Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor. And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie. I discovered others. In Arkansas, she joined the boards of Walmart and Tyson Foods. One of the largest donors to the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is the government of Saudi Arabia. The Clintons' personal net worth now probably exceeds $200 million, and while earned legally, both the money's sources and the Clintons' public statements indicate a strong aversion to rocking boats or making powerful enemies.

It was not always thus. When Bill Clinton became President, he and Hillary initially attempted courageous reforms: allowing gays to serve in the military, a carbon tax, health care reform. But they got their heads handed to them: Colin Powell went on television telling America that if gays served in the military, morale would suffer. And the Clintons also learned about money, because back then they had none. When they were mercilessly hounded by Kenneth Starr and Congressional Republicans, culminating in impeachment, their legal bills soared and the Clintons fell many millions of dollars into debt. (To be sure, Bill Clinton poured gasoline on the fire by lying.) It is very clear that the Clintons then decided never to be at anyone's mercy again. And since Bill Clinton first became Governor of Arkansas, the cost of Presidential campaigns has gone from $66 million (both parties combined, in 1976) to an estimated $5 billion for 2016, when Hillary will run. So more than ever, the Clintons need money and the people who supply it.

I would have loved to explore all this. But when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans -- and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration. Not even journalists who want access, which can easily be taken away. I even sensed potential difficulty in licensing archival footage from CBN (Pat Robertson) and from Fox. After approaching well over a hundred people, only two persons who had ever dealt with Mrs. Clinton would agree to an on-camera interview, and I suspected that even they would back out.

This, of course, was the real consequence, and probably the real intent, of the announcements by the RNC, Philippe Reines, and David Brock. Neither political party wanted the film made. After painful reflection, I decided that I couldn't make a film of which I would be proud. And so I'm cancelling. (Not because of any pressure from CNN -- quite the contrary.) It's a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don't think that it's a victory for the media, or for the American people. I still believe that Mrs. Clinton has many virtues including great intelligence, fortitude, and a deep commitment to bettering the lives of women and children worldwide. But this is not her finest hour."

Neither did the top of the ticket, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli, who has been downplaying his own socially conservative record in favor of a more mainstream message focused on the economy.

So how in the world did archconservative African-American pastor E. W. Jackson cinch his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia on Saturday night?

Blame Virginia’s quirky political process, a raucous convention speech and a racial undercurrent for vaulting Jackson—an also-ran in the 2012 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate—onto a stepping stone to the top job in one of the closely watched swing states in the country. Blame Cuccinelli, who steered the party away from holding a potentially more competitive primary and toward a convention that ensured his nomination but left the lieutenant governor’s slot up to only a few thousand hard-core activists to fill.

Jackson’s unexpected entrance into the Virginia statewide elections this year is one of the starkest examples of the challenges facing the GOP as it tries to broaden its appeal on the way to 2016.

“We learned a lot of lessons in 2012 that we’re trying to point out to people, but not all the people are going to listen,” said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who helped lead the national party’s sweeping examination of the 2012 election and produce a 97-page report of recommendations.

A more informal but similar soul-searching is taking place in Virginia, where the Republican establishment is worried the party will be better known for requiring women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds than for passing a sweeping transportation funding deal. A small group of Republican donors, business leaders, and former elected officials has met in Richmond twice since April about the tea-party’s movement’s impact on the GOP. According to a participant in both meetings, the group is concerned that Cuccinelli is too conservative to win a general election in state that voted twice for President Obama—and that was before Jackson joined the ticket.

Story continues

After Jackson was nominated, Fleischer posted on Twitter, “Jackson's anti-gay slurs are indefensible.” Jackson has called gay people “perverted and “very sick people.” He was less overt in his convention speech, though he referred to protecting traditional families.

“If you’re going to grow the party, it’s helpful to nominate candidates who are deeply conservative but inclusive of other people, as opposed to condemnatory,” Fleischer said. “To denounce people in such a fashion is not how you grow the party.”

Jackson's rhetoric puts Cuccinelli—whose own opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion has earned him a loyal conservative base of support—in a tough spot. He and the Republican Party have a strong motivation in keeping the politically inexperienced Jackson afloat: With control of the state Senate evenly split between the two parties, the lieutenant governor breaks tie votes.

Forced into an awkward arranged marriage, Cuccinelli’s top advisers have urged Jackson to put aside his social crusades and reinforce their campaign’s message on job growth. But until the campaign is comfortable that Jackson is on board with the plan, Cuccinelli is expected to keep his distance from Jackson after completing a two-day statewide tour with him on Tuesday.

“We are not going to be defending our running mates’ statements, now or in the future,” Cuccinelli said in a written statement on Monday that sought to strike a balance between asserting his independence and not throwing Jackson overboard. “The people of Virginia need to get comfortable with each candidate individually, and that's what this process is all about.""

Not if the Democratic Party has its way. With gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe facing a Republican-friendly electorate in November and struggling to explain his less successful business ventures, Democrats immediately seized on the nomination of the controversial minister from Chesapeake.

The Virginia Democratic Party circulated a side-by-side comparison of inflammatory quotes by Cuccinelli and Jackson on homosexuality, abortion, and President Obama. Democratic operatives also circulated a video of Cuccinelli calling Jackson a “powerful, powerful fighter for first principles” that is likely to become fodder for television attack ads. One liberal blog posted under the headline, “This is the lunatic Virginia tea-party Republicans just nominated for lieutenant governor.”

McAuliffe called Jackson and the nominee for attorney general, Mark Obenshain, Cuccinelli’s “ideological twins” in an e-mail blast on Monday. That’s expected to become central line of attack as McAuliffe tries to undercut Cuccinelli’s efforts to emphasize his agenda to cut taxes and create jobs.

""Jackson's nomination will reinforce for voters that Cuccinelli's extreme antiwoman, antigay, anti-middle class agenda will make Virginia an unwelcoming place for families and businesses,” said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association. ""Cuccinelli could have made his preference for a different lieutenant governor nominee known if he had one—like he did in the AG's race—but he didn't, because he shares the same hateful, extreme views espoused by his new running mate.""

Cuccinelli declined to intervene in the seven-candidate primary, campaign sources said, in part because he anticipated racially tinged criticism for getting in the way of an African-American candidate. Jackson joins a small but prominent circle of charismatic black conservatives that includes former presidential candidate Herman Cain and former Rep. Allen West of Florida (West, who attended the convention, endorsed one of Jackson’s rivals.)

“I am proud to say that I am not an African-American. I am an American!” declared Jackson, drawing roaring applause from convention-goers at the Richmond Coliseum. Candidates who look and sound like Jackson have a unique appeal at a time when Democrats can boast of electing the first African-American president and some of President Obama’s critics have gone so far as to question his U.S. citizenship.

While Jackson’s addition to the slate complicates Cuccinelli’s campaign, it doesn’t guarantee a tailspin. As a Harvard Law School graduate and former Marine, Jackson brings some obvious assets to the race. The top candidates run separately in Virginia, so it’s possible for a split-ticket result in November. One recent example: When Republican George Allen ran for governor in 1993, a conservative homeschooling champion, Mike Farris, won the nomination to be lieutenant governor. Allen kept his distance and won, while Farris was defeated by Democrat Don Beyer.

“It’s not clear that the bottom of the ticket will have tremendous influence on the top,” said Bob Holsworth, founding director of the Center for Public Policy and the Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Jackson is such a formidable public persona, however, that it’s hard to imagine him shrinking into the backdrop. It will be fascinating to see if the Republican Party lets him drift on his own or whether they help him be competitive.”

Democrats tried and failed to make the governor’s race a referendum on social issues in 2009 when conservative Republican Bob McDonnell led the ticket. Keeping his focus on jobs and the economy, McDonnell won in an election that laid the groundwork for the anti-Obama wave of 2010.

“Before everybody pronounces the death knell of the Republican ticket in 2013, they should remember that national dynamics and Obama’s approval numbers will have as much to do with this race as anything else,” said former Rep. Tom Davis, whose wife, Jeannemarie, ran unsuccessfully against Jackson.

Davis, a moderate, said he would back Jackson despite his antigay views. “How can I support someone who supports 'Obamacare?' ” he asked, referring to the Democratic ticket. “That’s the choice. Control of the state Senate is at stake.”"

With those words Donald Trump officially joined the ongoing battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party by aligning himself as a defender of the tea party and a merciless critic of Karl Rove and his new, controversial initiative known as the “Conservative Victory Project.”

Trump’s fiery appearance on The Mark Levin Show signaled an escalation in the very public argument that has played out over the past ten days between divergent factions of the GOP.

Trump and Levin hit Rove where it really hurts. First Trump criticized Rove’s effectiveness as a campaign strategist by slamming his SuperPAC, American Crossroads’ performance in the 2012 election: “Four hundred million dollars was wasted. They do the worst ads I have ever seen, ever.”

Levin followed up with what might be the most significant line of attack against Rove: “I would say to the wealthy donors out there, ‘Why do you keep donating to him?’ why don’t you donate to all these groups who are actually grassroots, who are actually fighting and who are actually effective?”

The combination of the influential voice of Mark Levin challenging donors to shut-down the flow of cash to the Rove machine, coupled with Trump (one of those high-profile donors) repeating FIVE TIMES the fact that Rove spent “four hundred million dollars” with no results to show for it could have a brutally devastating effect on the former Bush strategist’s balance sheet.

Trump then positioned himself as the defender of the tea party movement: “If the Republicans are going to win, they’re going to have to break away from the Karl Rove’s of the world and, frankly, get more about you know the tea party… they are great Americans, they love this country, they work so hard, and they have been so mistreated by the liberal press, the liberal media. They have been just so mistreated and made to look so bad.”

The continuing battle playing out on cable news, talk radio and on influential websites will surely continue now that Trump has entered the fray. And with stalwart Republican names like Rove and Barbour on one side and Bozell and Schlafly (now joined by Levin and Trump) on the other, this could shape up to get even uglier as the battle wages on."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/03/Rove-declares-war-Tea-Party,2013-02-03 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Rove Declares War on Tea Party,"The battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party has begun. On one side is the Tea Party. On the other side stand Karl Rove and his establishment team, posing as tacticians while quietly undermining conservatism.

Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the “biggest donors in the Republican Party” have joined forces with Karl Rove and Steven J. Law, president of American Crossroads, to create the Conservative Victory Project. The Times reports that this new group will dedicate itself to “recruit seasoned candidates and protect Senate incumbents from challenges by far-right conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts who Republican leaders worry could complicate the party’s effort to win control of the Senate.” The group points to candidates like Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Richard Mourdock in Indiana as examples of Tea Party primary picks going sideways in major Senatorial battles.

But it is American Crossroads and its ilk that have run the GOP into the ground. Spending millions of dollars on useless 30,000-ft. advertising campaigns during the last election cycle, training candidates to soften conservatism in order to appeal to “moderates,” blowing up the federal budget under George W. Bush as a bipartisan tactic – all of those strategies led the party to a disastrous defeat in 2012. The Tea Party, which may nominate losers from time to time, also brought the Republicans their historic 2010 Congressional victory. If Tea Party candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good candidates; if GOP establishment candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good conservatives. The choice for actual conservatives should be easy.

But it isn’t. The Bush insider team that helped lead to the rise of Barack Obama insists that they, and only they, know the path to victory. As the Times reports, Conservative Victory Project won’t merely protect incumbents – it will challenge sitting Congresspeople of the Tea Party variety, including six-term Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who may run for Senate. “We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Law told the Times – with whom he seems far too friendly. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.”

Law claims he’s acting under the rubric of William F. Buckley, supporting the most conservative candidate who can win. But Law is no judge of that. Neither is Rove. Their advice led to the epic Romney defeat, in which conservatives were told to vote for Romney in the primary since he was the only candidate who could win.

Grover Norquist correctly points out that the Rove mission is nonsense. “People are imagining a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Norquist. “We’ve had people challenge the establishment guy and do swimmingly.” In truth, conservatism wins elections so long as the messenger doesn’t implode. Rove’s view, however, is that conservatism takes a back seat to the best quasi-conservative messenger.

But victory for conservatives isn’t Rove’s goal. He’s a political insider par excellence, and he’s playing for his political life in the aftermath of 2012. If that means declaring war on the Tea Party, so be it.

Mark Sanford’s comeback try encountered severe turbulence Wednesday when the National Republican Congressional Committee withdrew its financial support less than three weeks before a special election for his former House seat.

The action by the GOP’s campaign arm came one day after a damaging allegation by Sanford’s ex-wife came to light. It accused him of a pattern of trespassing at her house in violation of their 2010 divorce decree.

“Mark Sanford has proven he knows what it takes to win elections,” said Andrea Bozek, NRCC communications director, in a statement. “At this time, the NRCC will not be engaged in this special election.” The NRCC had not yet begun advertising on Sanford’s behalf and had spent relatively little on his campaign, an official said.

Much of the Republican establishment has been holding Sanford at a distance, though he did receive the endorsement of House Speaker John Boehner this month after winning the GOP nomination in a runoff primary.

Republicans are worried that more damaging revelations about Sanford’s personal life could emerge before the election, according to a Republican official. The official confirmed an account in Politico, which first reported the NRCC’s action and quoted a GOP operative as calling the committee’s decision to abandon Sanford “an unfortunate situation” which “happens when candidates aren’t honest and withhold information.”

On Tuesday night, the Associated Press reported that the former governor has been ordered to appear in family court on May 9, two days after the election, to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating his divorce agreement.

Sanford’s ex-wife, Jenny, in a complaint dated Feb. 4, said she returned to her house on Sunday, Feb. 3, to find the former governor leaving through the back door, using his cellphone as a flashlight. She called it part of “a pattern of entering” her property “without her permission and against her wishes.” She also said that she had previously demanded that her ex-husband stop the visits and had filed a “No Trespass” letter with the local police department.

Sanford, best known for claiming that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail when he was actually visiting his mistress in Argentina, issued a statement Wednesday in response to news of his ex-wife’s accusation. In it, the former governor said that he had come to her house while she was away to watch the Super Bowl with one of their four sons, a teenager, who was at home alone.

“It’s an unfortunate reality that divorced couples sometimes have disagreements that spill over into family court,” he said. “I did indeed watch the second half of the Super Bowl at the beach house with our 14-year-old son [Blake] because as a father I didn’t think he should watch it alone.”

Sanford said he had tried to reach his ex-wife “to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and met her at the back steps under the light of my cellphone when she returned and told her what had happened.

“There is always another side to every story, and while I am particularly curious how records that were sealed to avoid the boys dealing with embarrassment are now somehow exposed less than three weeks before this election, I agree with Jenny that the media is no place to debate what is ultimately a family court matter, and out of respect for Jenny and the boys, I’m not going to have any further comment at this time,” Sanford said.

Sanford’s private life and personal failures have been at the center of his attempt to regain public office, two years after leaving the governorship. Jenny Sanford had told the Los Angeles Times/Tribune Washington bureau last month that she had refused her ex-husband’s request to run his latest campaign. And Sanford’s Argentine fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, made a surprise appearance at his victory celebration on the night of the April 2 runoff election.

The Washington Post reported that it was the first time that Sanford’s 17-year-old son, Bolton, had met Chapur. In a text message, Jenny Sanford said, “That was indeed Bolton’s first intro and both boys were quite upset and visibly so.”

On Wednesday, a Democratic super PAC released an anti-Sanford attack ad designed to remind voters of Sanford’s past, including a record fine that he paid to settle ethics charges and his international travel, including visiting Argentina.

Sanford’s Democratic opponent is Elizabeth “Lulu” Colbert Busch, a civic activist and sister of TV comedian Stephen Colbert. The winner of the May 7 special election will fill the seat left vacant when Republican Rep. Tim Scott was appointed to fill the term of Sen. Jim DeMint, who quit the join the Heritage Foundation.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/24/1181394/-Republicans-WILL-take-the-White-House-in-2016,2013-01-24 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",How To Stop The GOP's Electoral College Scheme: The National Popular Vote,"To prevent Republicans from rigging the electoral college, we must switch to a national popular vote. And it really can be done: states worth 132 electoral votes have already pledged to allot all of their EVs to the national popular vote winner if other states, adding up to 270 EVs, pledge to do the same. With 138 EVs to go, the electoral college would be overruled by the national popular vote by 2016.

According to the National Popular Vote Project, the following states have passed legislation to make the switch:

• California (55 EVs)

• Illinois (20)

• New Jersey (14)

• Washington (12)

• Massachusetts (11)

• Maryland (10)

• Hawaii (4)

• Vermont (3)

• DC (3)

These additional states now have Democratic governors and legislatures and can now pass an NPV law:

• New York (29 EVs)

• Minnesota (10)

• Colorado (9)

• Connecticut (7)

• Oregon (7)

• West Virginia (5)

• Rhode Island (4)

• Delaware (3)

Adding these states and their 74 EVs to the total would get us to 206 EVs with 64 to go. Rhode Island actually has a Republican-turned-independent governor, but they also have massive, veto-proof Democratic supermajorities in the state house and senate. West Virginia might be tough, given its preference for Republican presidents. And in New York, six Democrats in safe Democratic districts decided to give control of the senate to a Republican-independent coalition, even though Democrats have more senate seats. New Yorkers can debate in the comments the odds an NPV bill could pass there, or the odds the Democratic majority can retake control of the Senate in 2014.

To get the rest of the way to 270 will take ballot initiatives. Fortunately, polling shows Democrats, Republicans and independents all want to abolish the electoral college, by 66-30%, 61-30% and 63-29% margins, respectively. But we can expect Republican voters to change their minds once Fox News and the GOP echo chamber tell them it's an unconstitutional, undemocratic, anti-American liberal scheme. We can also hope Democratic and independent support rises once voters see what Republicans are plotting. Here, then, are states Obama won that have workable initiative processes and aren't listed above:

• Florida (29 EVs)*

• Ohio (18)*

• Michigan (16)*

• Nevada (6)

• Maine (4)

Asterisks denote states with Republican governors and legislators where a constitutional initiative would be necessary to prevent the legislature from overturning public will. Adding these states and their 73 EVs would total 279 EVs, 9 EVs past the goal.

There are also some long-shot states — red states with constitutional initiative processes — that we can fall back on in case some blue states prove intractable. Here they are, in order of narrowest 2012 loss for Obama:

• Arizona (11 EVs) -9% margin

• Missouri (10) -9%

• Mississippi (6) -12%

• Montana (3) -14%

• South Dakota (3) -18%

• North Dakota (3) -20%

• Nebraska (5) -22%

• Arkansas (6) -24%

• Oklahoma (7) -34%

So here's what needs to be done. The quick band-aid fix is to pass winner-take-all constitutional amendments in Florida, Ohio and Michigan to block the Republican strategy. These amendments would simply declare that all of the state's electoral votes must go to the winner. That obvious and simple proposal should be popular enough to win relatively easily, and could possibly foil the national GOP plot all on its own. The next step is to pass NPV initiatives in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and Maine.

We also need to contact the governors, legislatures and state Democratic parties in New York, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Delaware and not only get them on board but find powerful champions for the cause to make sure NPV laws pass. Alternatively, NPV initiatives can be passed in Colorado and Oregon.

We also need to contact the DNC to get them organizing with the states on NPV. Also, forward this info to your favorite local and national progressive blogs, columnists, TV and radio talk hosts, political leaders and advocacy organizations.



TALKING POINT: Hi! As you may know, the national Republican party has endorsed a scheme to make it all but impossible for Democrats to win the White House, by splitting up the electoral votes of states Obama won. Under the plan, Obama would have lost to Romney last November despite winning 5 million more votes. ( tinyurl.com/gopscheme ) But there's one way to prevent this from happening, which is to switch from the electoral college to a national popular vote. Several states have already made the switch to a national popular vote. ( tinyurl.com/npvplan ) I'm urging you to please read about and support a switch in order to prevent Republicans from exploiting loopholes in the electoral college. Thank you very much!

I've added(4) to the list of states that can act legislatively. Though they have a Republican-turned-independent governor, Democrats have massive supermajorities in the state house and senate that can override any potential veto."

Jim Oberweis' plan to seek the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate could be seen as a welcome development for Republicans looking for a wealthy candidate who could help finance a challenge to veteran Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.

But instead, the prospect is inspiring fear among leaders of the moribund Illinois GOP, which is trying to reach out to women and minorities and is hobbled by its social conservatism in a deepening blue state. They are concerned his candidacy could hurt the ticket as well as the party's efforts to rebrand itself.

Oberweis, from west suburban Sugar Grove, said he expects to formally announce his decision in the next few weeks, just a year after winning his first public office: a four-year term in the state Senate for District 25. Before that he lost two primary bids for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, a GOP primary for governor, and a double loss in special and general election bids for Congress.

The win-loss record of the money manager and boutique dairy owner is not what troubles some GOP leaders. Instead, it's his history of outspokenness, gaffes and controversies. Many in the upper echelon of the Republican Party are content to have little-known, first-time candidate Doug Truax of Downers Grove take on Durbin and head the GOP ticket in fall 2014, leaving the real contest for Illinois governor.

""Jim, while he may no longer believe some of the things he said in the past, it will come back,"" said Illinois Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont, who has discouraged an Oberweis bid. ""I don't think that will help the ticket. I encouraged him to think long and hard.""

Oberweis, who has acknowledged being ""too harsh"" in his previous campaigns, said he wants people to listen to him this time.

""I hope that as time has gone on I have matured a little bit and people will listen to what I have to say now and look at what I've done in Springfield,"" said Oberweis, whose legislative record includes sponsoring two bills. One, raising interstate speed limits, became law.

Oberweis is perhaps better known lately as the member of the policy-setting Illinois Republican State Central Committee who led the move to oust the state GOP chairman, Pat Brady, primarily over Brady's public support for same-sex marriage.

But his campaign history is marked by a string of controversial moments.

Even before announcing his 2002 bid for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Oberweis angered anti-abortion activists and fellow Roman Catholics while discussing abortion. In a radio interview, he said, ""I think that right now we're getting a very, very strong symbol in the Taliban of what can happen if we try to impose our religious beliefs on others.""

In his second U.S. Senate bid, in 2004, he ran TV ads showing him flying over Soldier Field in a helicopter, contending enough ""illegal aliens"" cross the border and steal jobs to ""fill Soldier Field every single week."" That figure was strongly disputed.

Some worry that Oberweis could prove the kind of lightning rod Democrats used to their advantage in the 2012 election, seizing on controversial statements involving rape and pregnancy by Republican U.S. Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana to tarnish GOP candidates around the country.

Rep. Jim Durkin of Western Springs, the new Illinois House Republican leader, said Oberweis should do some ""soul searching."" Durkin, who defeated Oberweis for the 2002 GOP U.S. Senate nomination, said Oberweis needs to be aware that a litany of controversial statements ""don't wash away after the election"" but ""will continue on as long as you're in the public eye.""

The disagreement over Oberweis represents yet the latest schism in a Republican Party that has been split between an establishment old guard that is more moderate and a conservative wing that has sought to take advantage of a lack of powerful political officeholders to gain control.

Oberweis has been among the conservative faction, making good on his threat to run for governor in 2006 if the GOP state central committee did not make him its state chairman in 2005. He received no nominations for the top Republican post then, but in March 2010 won election to the state central committee.

Another former rival who encouraged Oberweis to run next year now says he, too, is opposed to the idea.

Chicago businessman Ron Gidwitz, a social moderate who also unsuccessfully sought the 2006 GOP nomination for governor, acknowledged he ""sort of did suggest very strongly on a number of occasions"" that Oberweis consider a U.S. Senate bid in 2014.

Gidwitz had an automated poll conducted, with very few questions, that showed Oberweis running 11 percentage points behind Durbin in a potential head-to-head contest. Gidwitz said he forwarded the results to Oberweis but encouraged him to do a more traditional and exhaustive poll on his viability before embarking on a campaign.

""I'm not persuaded as much at all that he's got much of a chance,"" Gidwitz said. ""It's not inconceivable he gets the nomination, but I don't see how he can beat Durbin. ... He's too far to the right-hand side of the road on these social issues.""

The camps of the four major Republican candidates for governor declined to weigh in on having Oberweis at the top of the ticket.

Some Republicans suggest privately that Oberweis could help draw conservative voters to the polls in a primary — something that would help like-minded candidates for governor and in races lower on the ballot.

Greg Baise, a longtime Republican who heads the Illinois Manufacturers Association, said Oberweis has the ""propensity to say things controversial that make people in the party uncomfortable"" and that ""sometimes his filters aren't as strong in how he characterizes issues.""

Still, Baise said, Oberweis represents a ""viewpoint of a large number of people"" in the GOP and noted Durbin also has committed his share of gaffes."

I support a House in which most of its members do their jobs and are rarely known to anyone other than their constituents. Of course, that’s impossible but when a candidate puts their political aspirations above their people (which is all-too-common on both sides of the aisle), they will be put on blast. When regression, not progression, is the ultimate goal; they will deserve a spot here.

So who signifies that better than Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. Representing Minnesota’s 6th district since 2006, Bachmann probably deserves no introduction for all the headlines she has very proudly generated. Yet, let’s take a look at the legislative, electoral and overall career of Michele Bachmann.



-Bringing up, for the 34th time, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

If there could be anything that will automatically earn you a place on this spot, it’s actions like these. The ACA is the law of the land and slowly become more integrated into our health care system. The fact that this cannot essentially get repealed until 2017 is noteworthy. This is a bill that’s created to throw “red meat” to national conservatives and to generate some early headlines. It’s a waste of time that could be used to well….stonewall other bills and make John Boehner weep but time nonetheless.

-The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act

This Bachmann’s other signature piece of legislation, another one that is advocating a repeal and another one that was not enacted. The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act would signify the repeal of the government ban of incandescent light bulbs.

Electoral History:

2006: Bachmann (R): 50.1%, Patty Wetterling (D): 42.1%, John Binkowski (I): 7.8%

2008: Bachmann (R): 46.4%, Elwyn Tinklenberg (D), 43.4%, Bob Anderson (I): 10%

2010: Bachmann (R): 52.5%, Taryl Clark (D): 39.8%, Anderson (I): 5.8%

2012: Bachmann (R): 50.5%, Jim Graves (D): 49.5%

Cook PVI:

R+10

Prospects:

I would say that this list should begin with Jim Graves, who gave Bachmann the closest run for her seat. Graves is a small-business owner and a local Minnesotan who nearly won even by being outspent from 10:1 margin. To learn more about Graves, check out his bio on his website here.

I believe that he is the best contender though I would like to hear what somebody from Minnesota might know.

Why We Can Do This:

The district is pretty significantly Republican but Bachmann has barely crossed over 50% of the vote, even in the tidal wave that was 2010. Now, she is an amazing fundraiser but her reputation is so well-known that I don’t think money can erase all the obstruction she has done in the House. Bachmann has reached her ceiling, it appears, so what the DFL of Minnesota might have to do is make this a very local race considering Bachmann is a highly national figure.

The fact that Bachmann has difficulties staying north of 50% gives us hope in 2014. Fundraising for the opponent could be a national exercise and if started early enough, we could see some good results.

Remember if Bachmann is out of politics, it would be a huge blow to the Tea Party and would help us regain our sanity.

To sort of paraphrase her, “Repeal and Replace Bachmann”.

(Note on this feature: We cannot sit idly as the majority Republican House does nothing. Can we guarantee that a Democratic majority would change things? Not at all. But we can try.

Hence why I’m also putting this in your hands. Share this on your Facebook, “like” candidate’s (which we will tout) Facebook pages, retweet posts from here and maybe even send it to your local Democratic Party. If we are going to take back the House, with a fairly sizable Republican majority, then it’s going to take us. The grassroots.

All campaigns are national, but stay local. It would be great to have a Democratic Party that goes back to the “50-state strategy”.

But it all starts with us, the voters. Us, the netrooters. Us, the people. Let’s start this project now and see what we are capable of.)

Well that land would be one where...



President-elect Romney would be planning his inauguration right now.

If states stop awarding votes on a winner-take-all basis, Republicans could also win — and without necessarily getting more votes. Determining Electoral College voting by congressional districts represents one obvious opportunity for Republicans: In that scenario, the effect of urban Democratic strongholds (such as those Philadelphia precincts where Obama was supported by 99 percent of voters) would be isolated. Instead of shifting the entire state’s electoral votes, those precincts would only influence their congressional districts.

Trinko can almost see it. All it would take, she writes, is:Pretty simple. There are a lot of rural low population counties that vote Republican and a smaller number of large population counties that vote Democratic. If the GOP can change the rules to take advantage of this then the 47% of Romney supporters could lord over the 53% of non-Romney supporters. Genius!

Trinko's column cites research by FairVote.com which is ironic since that group is specifically working against systems (including the electoral college) which skew the value of different citizen's votes. In fact, Fairvote is warning against what Republicans might do. They present six ideas that would improve GOP prospects and make winning possible when losing the popular vote:



it's all predicated, of course, on something I fervently hope isn't true: that Republicans in these six key states would be willing to ignore the large majority of voters who prefer a level playing field in our elections - an attitude we call on all elected officials to reject with our Stand with Voters pledge.

But Trinko is excited about these six plans, especially two which would have given Romney electoral college wins of 274-264 and 280-258. Both are based on changing rules in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia and Florida to award electoral votes proportionally by congressional district. These are states with Republican governors and legislatures.

But if these ideas won't fly, Trinko suggests a look at Fairvote's goal: a national popular vote. As she puts it, that way the GOP could win even if the number of red states declines. I think she's wrong but now might be the best time to propose this constitutional change [EDIT: See Kos's comment below]. Currently our system grants disproportionate power to small population states because they all get 3 electoral votes regardless of how small they are.

Either way, you know the GOP is heading down the wrong path if, instead of soul searching and making real changes, they are looking to game the system."

In the run-up to 2016, one of the key questions for Republicans will be how to frame, market and package the issue of immigration reform. How can they make reform palatable to the party’s dominant right wing while substantially lessening Hispanic animosity?

There is a growing body of evidence that those intent on moderating the party’s ideological rigidity, including Karl Rove and Reince Priebus, face opposition from Republican primary voters, the most powerful force in the party.

Primary voters now exercise ultimate authority. In many states and districts, Republican incumbents are more concerned about challenges from within their party than they are about winning the general election against a Democrat.

In early maneuvering for the Republican nomination, Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, and Marco Rubio, a current Florida senator, represent the Hispanic outreach wing of the party.



For a pro-immigration-reform candidate to win the Republican nomination requires an extraordinary balancing act. He (or she) must mask the core source of conflict — his support of a path to citizenship — with tough-sounding additional provisions that signal to carefully targeted opponents of immigration that the government is actually on their side despite the advent of reform.

Advocating policies advanced by hard-liners like Senator John Cornyn of Texas — a biometric entry-exit system tracking immigrants that aims to prevent visa overstays; a trigger requiring a 90 percent apprehension rate of illegal aliens; drone and other electronic surveillance to detect illegal border crossings; and prohibition of benefits for unauthorized aliens — are essential to this approach.

Polling in New Hampshire suggests that threading this needle will not be easy. The WMUR Granite State Poll, conducted with the University of New Hampshire, found that from April to July support for Rubio among Republican voters collapsed as he moved to the left, first endorsing and then voting for a relatively lenient Senate immigration bill that was supported by President Obama. Rubio went from being favored by 15 percent of Republican voters to being favored by 6 percent.

Similarly, a tally by RealClearPolitics of 11 national surveys of Republican voters taken from late November 2012 to early August of this year, found an impressive drop in the backing for Rubio as he expressed increasingly pro-immigration views. Rubio was the leading candidate in six of the first seven polls but not in any of the four most recent. The average level of support for Rubio fell from 18 percent in the earliest seven polls to 11.5 percent in the next four.

Rubio’s prospects would look even bleaker if the polling were limited to those Republicans who consistently turn out in primaries, a far more conservative group than Republicans who only occasionally cast primary ballots. Solid majorities of these more activist voters require the politicians they support to move further right on immigration.

On July 31, the Pew Research Center released a report, “Whither the GOP?” based on a poll of 1,480 Americans, including 497 respondents who are Republican or lean Republican. Among the Republicans, Pew found, 54 percent called on the party to move in a more conservative direction; 41 percent said it should become more moderate, a 13-point difference.

More important, Republicans who say that they always vote in primaries (and whose views consequently carry more weight) are much more in favor of their party’s turning in a more conservative direction. Data provided to the Times by Pew shows that 58 percent of Republicans who always vote in primaries advocate more conservative stands, while 37 percent call for moderation, a 21-point split. Republicans who do not always vote in primaries are more evenly divided, 50-44.

Insofar as support or opposition to immigration reform is a proxy for more or less positive attitudes toward Hispanics, the Pew study shows a decided tilt among Republicans. Thirty-six percent of Republican voters say that the party’s stance toward immigration is not conservative enough, compared with 17 percent who say it is too conservative. Crucially, among Republicans who always vote in primaries, the division shifts further to the right, 41-14.

The dilemma of the Republican Party as it struggles to pick its way through the immigration minefield and build Hispanic support is further complicated by the fact that polling data suggests that the most fruitful source of new voters for the party’s candidates is not Hispanics, but the white working class. It is already a Republican constituency, but the discontent of these voters with the Obama administration has been growing sharply.

Demographic data on President Obama’s favorability ratings from January 2012 to July 2013, supplied to the Times by the Pew Center, shows that among white non-college voters, Obama’s positive ratings fell sharply, from an average of 35 percent in the first 10 polls to 26 percent in the survey last month. The nine-point drop was driven heavily by white non-college men, whose rating of Obama fell 11 points, from 33 percent to 22 percent. The decline among white non-college women was 36 to 30.

This stands in sharp contrast with Obama’s favorability rating among college-educated whites, which averaged 48 percent through all 11 Pew polls.

These trends have encouraged conservatives who want Republicans to reject immigration reform and Hispanic outreach — and to instead further mobilize white voters. While not advocating this approach himself, Sean Trende, an elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, has suggested that it could prove viable. Trende wrote a four-part series discussing alternative approaches for the party. I wrote about the debate over missing white voters in a column earlier this summer.

I e-mailed Trende asking whether he agreed that the Pew polling data cited above suggested that the future course of the Republican Party may have already been decided by the depth of the conservatism of its most active voters. He replied:

There are larger forces at work here. The outsized Republican share of the white vote in 2010 – almost certainly the best showing for either party among whites in congressional races since 1822 — isn’t accidental. Whites are sliding toward minority status, and becoming more internally homogenous at the same time.

Ruy Teixeira, who specializes in analyzing political-demographic trends, has written perhaps the best description of the weaknesses of the white Republican strategy: the core target, the white working class, is “declining precipitously as a share of voters, down from 54 to 36 percent between 1988 and 2012.” At the same time, young white voters make up “the most liberal generation in the overall electorate by a considerable margin.”

Even if the Republican white strategy results in continued defeat in presidential elections, there are tactical reasons not to adopt a more liberal stance on immigration reform. The most important of these is the likelihood that geography and gerrymandering will keep the House in Republican hands through the end of this decade. In addition, the odds are even that Democrats will lose control of the Senate later this year. For many Republican politicians, shifts in Hispanic voting have little relevance to their individual re-election prospects, and the importance of Latinos in presidential contests is a secondary concern.

The real issue facing the Republican Party in presidential elections is that it needs new blood. Mitt Romney lost to Obama by a 3.85 percentage point margin, 51.06 to 47.21 — that’s 5 million votes. The party can try to boost its backing among whites, a steadily declining share of the electorate, or it can try to boost margins among Hispanics. The truth is that a winning Republican candidate will probably have to do both.

Projections of the impact of immigration reform range from Jeb Bush — “immigrants are particularly important to help create more taxpayers to fund the safety net for the large, retiring baby boomer generation” — to the Heritage Foundation’s argument that immigration reform “would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion in new spending on entitlements and social programs.”

A path to citizenship can be construed in different ways depending on who’s offering what. A green card tomorrow or “end of the line” status, which could amount to a decade in legal limbo? A requirement that “undocumented aliens” pay all owed back taxes – a possibly prohibitive sum? Fines for illegal entry ranging from $2,000 to $10,000? The need to demonstrate proficiency in English? Eligibility for health care? Public education? Student loans? What else?

A pro-immigration-reform candidate along the lines of Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio will have to figure out how to balance the conflicting interests and values of a white and Hispanic coalition, just as the Democrats from 1968 onward have struggled to maintain — and win with — a biracial coalition, white and black. It’s a tough row to hoe, as Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, and the one-termer Jimmy Carter can testify, but as Bill Clinton and Obama have more recently demonstrated, it’s not an impossible one."

Senators Fail to Head Off Primary Challenges by Tea Party Rivals,"WASHINGTON — For the past two years, Republican senators facing re-election have very deliberately spent millions of dollars, hired multiple consultants and cast scores of conservative votes with one goal in mind: avoiding the embarrassing primary conflagrations that befell their party in 2010 and 2012 and cost Republicans a chance at taking back the Senate.

It has not worked. Despite their careful efforts, some of the best-known and most influential Republicans in the Senate have been unable to shake threats from the right and have attracted rivals who portray these lawmakers as a central part of the problem in Washington.

In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, the party’s Senate leader, is fending off a charismatic and wealthy conservative challenger. In South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, one of the Senate’s most reliably conservative voices on foreign policy, is being painted by primary opponents as a veritable clone of President Obama.

In Tennessee, Tea Party activists have vowed to take out Lamar Alexander, the veteran senator, former cabinet officer and two-time presidential candidate. “Senator Alexander has never been a true conservative,” said Ben Cunningham, president of the Nashville Tea Party. “His support for the amnesty bill has caused great problems for us,” he said, referring to the Senate immigration bill. “He is at best a moderate.”"

A former Marquette classmate has written about Walker's time on the Avenue, and intimates quite clearly what has been a persistent rumor in alumni circles -- that Walker was asked to leave Marquette due to some academic shenanigans. Thus far, Walker has declined to release his college transcripts, so the question remains open. Noonan's Law applies — is it irresponsible to speculate? It would be irresponsible not to.

There are many delicious details at the link, including the college newspaper concluding that Walker was ""unfit for office"" due to his being ""sanctioned for illegal campaigning on numerous occasions, and brutal personal attacks upon his opponent’s character."" Plus, ""Walker’s campaign was secretly and systematically (stealing and) throwing out copies of the newspaper that endorsed his opponent"" (prior to the ""unfit for office"" editorial), and newspapers never like that kind of theft.

But the key bit is this:



I wish I could say definitely why he never graduated – it is a closely guarded secret. I believe the general line of thinking – that Scott Walker was caught cheating.

Well, that makes sense.

Walker was not a good student -- he has refused to release his transcripts, but his 2010 campaign said that his GPA was 2.59.

And then there's the timing issue -- Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986 and left sometime in 1990, which is four, or three and a half at least, years.

Yet he was substantially short of the credit hours required for graduation:



Walker released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. He had 94 credits and would have needed at least 36 more. The exact number of credits he needed isn't clear because students must take classes in certain areas of study to get degrees.

Somewhere along the way, Walker lost a year's worth of college credit.

Maybe, in the two years he was running for college offices, he took some incompletes that he did not make up.

Maybe his parents decided they did not want to fund a five-year plan.

Maybe Walker got caught cheating, and was told to get out of Marquette and not return.

So he didn't.

Walker's ancient history is, IMHO, far more relevant than Romney's prep-school bullying or Obama's teen-age drug use -- Walker was a far-right pol in training at Marquette, his college campaigns were wingnut, dirty and fact-free, and he moved as quickly as possible into political office.

In the words of Babu Bhatt, Walker is a very, very bad man.

And has been since Marquette.

Tom Barrett needs lots of help to retire Walker, those of you with credit cards can help here."

Jim Acosta', 'Peter Hamby']","Christie opts for special election, says voters should decide","Story highlights Christie had decision to make about filling unexpired term of late Sen. Lautenberg New Jersey will hold special election in October Decision avoids possibility of Democratic turnout boost when Christie on ballot in November Christie says his decision is not political, says he wants what is best for state, voters

(CNN) —

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie opted for a special election to fill a newly vacant Senate seat through 2014 instead of appointing a replacement through that time, saying the decision was about giving voters “a choice and a voice in the process” and was not driven by political self-interest.

While the Republican’s decision for a special October ballot could help him avoid stronger Democratic turnout in his re-election bid a month later, it also opens him up to criticism from his own party that is on the short end of the balance of power in the Senate.

Christie explained his decision one day after the Garden State’s senior senator, Frank Lautenberg, a liberal Democrat, died at 89 after an illness. Christie said he would name a placeholder as soon as possible to fill the seat until the October election.

Opinion: The last ‘swamp dog’

Democrats immediately slammed the move, asserting that Christie is wasting taxpayer money to protect his ambitions. National Republicans weren’t critical but they didn’t praise the governor, either.

Christie announced that Democratic and Republican primary elections will be held on August 13 with the general election on October 16.

The winner of the special election will serve out the final year of Lautenberg’s term, and an election for a full six-year term will occur the following November.

Christie sets October special election to replace Lautenberg

Voters should have say

While Christie said state law allowed him to name a replacement for the remaining year-and-a-half of Lautenberg’s term, he believes an appointment over that period of time was not suitable or fair.

“The issues facing the United States Senate are too critically important and the decisions that need to be dealt with too vital not too have an elected representative making those decisions who was voted on and decided on by the people of this state. These decisions should be made by an elected official who represents the will of voters of New Jersey,” Christie said.

The expense of an election is also an issue during an era of belt tightening.

The New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, an administrative wing of the Democrat-controlled state Legislature, estimates it will cost $12 million to state taxpayers to conduct a primary and another $12 million for a general election.

Analysis: Christie helps himself

New Jersey is already voting in a general election on November 5, when Christie is bidding for a second term. So some ask why doesn’t he save $12 million and schedule a special general election a few weeks later?

Christie said state law only permits the option of an October special election or an election in 2014.

Christie said “there’s no political purpose” behind his decision on the election date.

But polls show that he has a 2-1 advantage over state Sen. Barbara Buono, his Democratic challenger. And putting a special Senate election on the same day in November would most likely increase Democratic turnout, especially if Newark Mayor Cory Booker is on the ballot. Booker was considering his own run for Senate in 2014.

By placing the special Senate election in October, Christie avoids Democratic turnout tied to this issue possibly becoming a problem for him.

Democrats unhappy

National Democrats quickly blasted the decision.

“Governor Christie might not know or care how many millions of taxpayer dollars his special election gambit will waste, but the people of New Jersey certainly do. Christie should do the right thing, protect New Jersey taxpayer dollars instead of his own political career, and hold the Senate election on the same day as his own,” Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Colm O’Comartun, said in a statement.

Christie said that the costs associated with special primary and general elections “cannot be measured” against the value of an elected senator “when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year.”

State Democrats had threatened legal action if Christie pushed the election back to November 2014, but Christie’s not sure if his decision averts a legal challenge, adding, “In New Jersey, people sue over everything.”

Opinion: The last ‘swamp dog’

Christie said he has yet to decide on a placeholder. But he said he has a list in his head and that he’ll make a determination relatively soon.

“I’m looking for a person who’s going to be a good United States senator,” he said.

The outspoken governor also said it wouldn’t be fair to appoint a GOP placeholder to serve out the remainder of the late Democratic senator’s term.

“I understand the political advantage that would come to me if I was the person, the sole person, to decide who would be in the Senate representing New Jersey for 18 months, but I just did not feel comfortable doing that,” he said.

Christie didn’t say at the news conference whether the placeholder will be allowed to run in the special election, but a source close to the governor told CNN, “Legally the appointee could run if he or she wanted to, but would have to go through the election process.”

Republicans not praising Christie

National Republicans weren’t criticizing Christie’s decision, but they weren’t praising it, either.

“I am sure the governor exercised whatever option he had in the best interest of his state and I won’t question the path that he has chosen,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

Christie’s decision could complicate his already-strained relationship with national conservatives, which could spell trouble if he decides to run for president in 2016.

“I was disappointed he didn’t pick a Republican to fill out the rest of the term, but not surprised,” said Katon Dawson, the former Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party.

“Chris Christie has always done what’s best for Chris Christie in New Jersey,” added Dawson, whose state is traditionally one of the first to cast ballots in the presidential primary process.

Many on the right are still upset with Christie’s praise of President Barack Obama personally and the federal response in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, just days before last November’s presidential election.

Republican: ‘Debilitating stupidity’

While Christie’s approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama, saying it contributed to the defeat of GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And Democrats were quick to point that out.

“Republicans have not won a Senate race in New Jersey in more than 40 years. Their only shot was an appointee who had a year and a half to establish themselves before an election in 2014,” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter said. “With this news, I assume operatives at the NRSC are busy planning Christie’s defeat in Iowa and New Hampshire right now.”

Meanwhile, the rival National Republican Senatorial Committee pointed toward what could be a divisive Democratic primary.

“Democrats will now face an ugly primary sprint between Cory Booker, Rob Andrews and Frank Pallone – all with substantial war chests and a healthy dislike for each other,” NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said. “Corey Booker did not want to have to wrap this up in two months.”

Democratic Congressman Rush Holt may also make a bid for the Senate seat.

Speaking immediately after him, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky declared, “The G.O.P. of old has grown stale and moss-covered.” A “new G.O.P.,” he said, “will need to embrace liberty in both the economic and the personal sphere.”

The yearly assembly of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, is a showcase of the Republican Party’s top presidential prospects, whose reception before a crowd of critical, future primary voters and volunteers is watched carefully by party leaders, donors and news media handicappers."

That yet another one exists, and that like others one of their top priorities is defeating not-conservative-enough Karl Rove and demanding a more radical conservatism of their conservatives, is not too surprising. That they seem to be in opposition to uberconservative Grover Norquist is a bit more surprising, but I suppose Norquist has gone out of favor now that people in the movement have started to suspect him of secret Muslimizm.

The list of people who participate in these ""Groundswell"" strategizing sessions, however, has a definite B-grade flavor to it.



One of the influential conservatives guiding the group is Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a columnist for the Daily Caller and a tea party consultant and lobbyist. Other Groundswell members include John Bolton, the former UN ambassador; Frank Gaffney, the president of the Center for Security Policy; Ken Blackwell and Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council; Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch; Gayle Trotter, a fellow at the Independent Women's Forum; Catherine Engelbrecht and Anita MonCrief of True the Vote; Allen West, the former GOP House member; Sue Myrick, also a former House GOPer; Diana Banister of the influential Shirley and Banister PR firm; and Max Pappas, a top aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right's messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags; plotting strategy on in-the-headlines issues such as voter ID, immigration reform, and the sequester; promoting politically useful scandals; and developing ""action items.""

Groundswell members saw immigration as a life-or-death issue. ""If we lose on immigration,"" the post-meeting memo noted, ""we lose on every other issue. […]"" The group also reviewed how best to oppose the confirmation of Tom Perez, Obama's nominee for labor secretary. Groundsweller's claimed that Perez, then a senior Justice Department official, supported ""Muslim Brotherhood organizations and Shariah."" (One Groundswell memo maintained that Perez ""is extremely antagonistic toward whites."") A third agenda item that Wednesday morning was beating back the effort to end the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay scouts. […] The post-meeting memo suggested Twitter hashtags to push: #CantTrustObama, #PoliticsOverPublicSafety, #SequesterLies.

The Groundswellers feel that they too often lose the political narrative to their progressive rivals. One memo that circulated among members declared, ""We must reclaim the language and put 'a face' on our messages; tell stories. Write articles on 4th grade level!""

Oh, well if you've got John Bolton, the Family Research Council and Allen West thinking up your strategy, I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that. Also featured prominently are various Breitbart apparatchiks, so you know it's top-notch stuff.Oh God, stop, you're killing me. #HashtagBasedStrategizingA troupe of Rove-hating conservatives who spend their days talking about Sharia conspiracies. I'm beginning to see why this group is secret: I think it's so they don't get teased. Also, members literally seem to get something called ""brownie points"" for putting out the group's message, which in any other context would probably be humiliating for all involved. Not them, though!Some of you have almost managed 3rd grade level, so don't lose hope. Practice! You'll get there eventually.

There's one place I have to disagree with David Corn's reporting on this story. He refers to some of the persons involved as ""journalists,"" citing Breitbart ""News"" participants and others. I don't think you can claim that; the Breitbart group does not do ""journalism,"" they do something … else. Their namesake made the brand on pushing falsified ""pimp tape""-style stories to gullible peers. While it would indeed be alarming if ""journalists"" were coordinating strategies with the likes of Ginni Thomas, Frank Gaffney (snicker), John Bolton (cackle) and Allen Freaking West (it hurts, stop, I need a moment!), none of the columnists, ""researchers"" or Fox News hangers-on named in the story really pass as ""journalists"" in the conventional sense of the term. They might claim otherwise, but that doesn't make it true, and we really shouldn't just accept such claims at face value.

The Breitbarters seem to play a substantive role in the group, which gives you an indication of the caliber of minds at work here, and is probably one force behind the group's apparent routine of thinking up good-sounding storylines first, then bothering with the ""evidence"" later. I am not thinking there is much to fear from this particular peanut gallery, but it might be interesting in the future to watch their promotion of certain themes and how they collect their ""brownie points"" for reinforcing each other's messages. Hell, we can give them ""brownie points"" ourselves, right? Ten points to Slytherin, guys, but come up with a really good hashtag and I'll make it 15. #MelonSizedCalves?

Routinely, senators give unanimous consent to waive the rule so the committee can carry out the chamber's—and the country's—business. But today, Republicans refused unanimous consent to let the Judiciary Committee meet. The committee has a busy schedule, with votes scheduled for 15 judicial nominees who have testified before the members and answered follow-up written questions. Among those are nominees for vacancies designated as judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. Each one of the nominees has been fully vetted and has the support of their home state senators, including Republicans Mark Kirk (IL), Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran (KS), Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker (TN), Roy Blunt (MO), and Pat Toomey (PA). [...] If the committee is not able to meet until next week—the last week the Senate is expected to be in session—and Republicans force the nominees to be held over, then they'll be stuck in committee at year's end. Since that will be the end of a session of Congress, absent unanimous consent to do otherwise, Senate rules require the nominees to be sent back to the president for renomination in the next session. That would force all of these nominees to repeat the committee voting process all over again, where once again the GOP could find new ways to slow them down.

Senate Republicans aren't just forcing all night sessions to exact their revenge on Democrats for invoking the nuclear option and ending the filibuster on nominations, they've escalated the fight to preventing the Judiciary Committee from even meeting Can anyone doubt that Republicans will continue to do anything they can to force these nominations to expire before the end of the year? They'll do whatever possible to block these nominees for as long as possible. This means that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chair of the Judiciary Committee, is going to have to be willing to establish new rules, or ignore existing ones as much as is in his power to do so.

That's going to include ending the ""blue-slip"" tradition. That's the tradition of asking the home state senators of a nominee to support the nomination by signing off on a ""blue slip."" Leahy says that he intends to continue to honor the tradition because he ""assume[s] no one will abuse the blue slip process like some have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees on the floor of the Senate."" If they're going to abuse the rules to keep his committee from meeting, they're going to abuse blue slips. Leahy is going to have to act to allow his committee to function again."

Well, a girl can dream, can’t she?

You know how it goes. You wake up smiling at the memory of love, and then you realize that the nose nuzzling your neck belongs to the dog that needs to go out. It is not, in fact, your birthday. And you have not, alas, been notified that a recently discovered document at Buckingham Palace identifies you as the rightful heir to a vast fortune and several well-managed countries.

Which is to say, Congress went home without doing much of anything.

As everyone knows, Republicans are to blame. They are the obstructionists, the just-say-no enemies of women, immigrants, health care for the poor, shoes for the born and equality for gay whales, to mention a few.

This “narrative,” as they say, is pure propaganda. President Obama achieved huge legislative victories (Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, bailouts, two Supreme Court appointments) when he had hefty majorities in Congress. Once those margins were lost or reduced in the 2010 election, the president’s focus shifted to scoring political points by shouting, “Obstruction!” In truth, no serious efforts have been made toward compromise because it is in neither side’s political interest.

This is not to say that the GOP is problem-free. Far from it. The tea party/libertarian express poses a serious threat to the party and, therefore, the nation. (Don’t we really want two healthy parties?) Then again, stepping back just a tad, what we’re witnessing is perhaps an inevitable generational realignment.

Think maverick.

Remember when John McCain was the bad boy, always going his own way? Thinking for himself? Talking candidly with the press? (Out of respect for seniority, we’ll lurch past his temporary lapse of judgment in 2008.)

Actually, McCain wasn’t that much of a maverick, a nickname first suggested in 1989 by Dan Casey, then- executive director of the American Conservative Union, which consistently gave the senator respectable marks for conservative votes.

Today, as time would have it, McCain is Mr. Establishment. He not only lunches with the enemy but dines with the president. Isn’t this how life goes? Teenagers eventually grow up and become their parents. McCain is the GOP grandpa swatting at ankle-biting upstarts such as fellow Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

They are the new, out-of-the-box mavericks. And the squabbles that threaten to shut down the government come Oct. 1 may be part of a larger generational struggle to redefine the party. Suicide isn’t as catchy as “Winning!” — but, as Rush Limbaugh has suggested, at least it’s a stand.

Cruz and Paul, whom McCain once called “wacko birds,” have threatened to shut down the government unless Obamacare is defunded. (On Friday, McCain said that both Cruz and Paul would be “viable” presidential candidates in 2016. Hardly a ringing endorsement, but — something.)

Obviously, Obama won’t sign off on a budget that defunds his chief achievement. But the alternative of Republicans reforming Obamacare isn’t appealing because they don’t want to help save it. The threatened shutdown, however, is more tilting at windmills than slingshots against giants.

Either Cruz and Paul have sincerely deluded themselves about the political consequences of a shutdown or, plausibly, they don’t really think they can cause a shutdown and would never have to suffer the consequences. Meanwhile, they score political points with the base by blaming the GOP “sellouts” when the establishment adults keep the trains running on time.

Even if these newbie mavericks were successful in their defunding effort, it would only be a temporary “win,” since funding comes up annually. Moreover, such a temporary victory would give Democrats a far-reaching advantage. Thereafter, responsibility for any dissatisfaction with the health care system would shift to the GOP.

Alternatively, the old maverick could prevail.

Dropping from his cockpit, the flight-suited McCain strides toward the microphone, pausing briefly to high-five wingman Lindsey Graham and crew member Kelly (Ayotte, not McGillis), and announces: “We passed a bipartisan budget today that ends sequestration, includes significant spending cuts and a tax overhaul. Eleven million illegal immigrants have been invited to become legal residents and begin a rigorous path toward citizenship. We have accepted Disney World’s offer to revamp the nation’s infrastructure and mass transportation systems. With the president’s blessing, Switzerland has agreed to fix Obamacare. That’s it. Enjoy the rest of your summer.”

In our dreams.

I want my money back. Last October, I gave $2,500 to support Heidi Heitkamp’s campaign to become North Dakota’s junior senator. A few weeks later, she won a surprise victory. I have had a long career in government and politics, but I don’t donate heavily to political campaigns. When I contribute, it’s because I know the candidate well or am really impressed with the person. Heidi Heitkamp was one of the latter: She struck me as strong-willed, principled and an independent thinker. But this week, Heitkamp betrayed those hopes. ... Polling has shown that nine in 10 Americans and eight in 10 gun owners support a law to require every buyer to go through a background check on every gun sale. In North Dakota, the support was even higher: 94 percent. Yet in explaining her vote, Heitkamp had the gall to say that she “heard overwhelmingly from the people of North Dakota” and had to listen to them and vote no. It seems more likely that she heard from the gun lobby and chose to listen to it instead.

Marco Rubio showed his true yellow colors last week, joining 45 other cowards to defeat Senate legislation designed to stop criminals from buying firearms online and at gun shows. The vote was nauseating. So is Rubio. A few days earlier, he’d admitted to Fox News that he hadn’t read the complete bill that would expand federal background checks of gun buyers, but he was opposing it anyway. Other pertinent materials that Rubio obviously didn’t read included a recent New York Times sampling of nut jobs, convicted criminals and even one fugitive who purchased assault rifles and other weapons over the Internet.

Carl Hiaasen touches base with the ""reasonable"" GOP alternative.Funny how some people actually hold senators responsible for their own actions. It's almost treating them like... adults.

Ross Douthat hits one of those rare weeks when I agree with him.

...we discovered another world last week. Two, actually — both somewhat larger than Earth, circling a star with the sadly unromantic name of Kepler 62, 1,200 light-years away. These planets are not the first Earth-like bodies astronomers have discovered, but their size and position make them particularly promising candidates to have liquid water — and with it, perhaps, some form of life. But their promise only adds to a mystery that’s been building the further our probes and telescopes have pushed into the unknown. If Earth-like planets are relatively common, as scientists increasingly believe, then where are all the Earth-like civilizations?

Douthat's take on the Fermi Paradox (that ""where is everyone"" question) are all pretty bleak. I prefer a nursery analogy. The grown ups are keeping us out of the galactic mainstream until we mature a bit. Or maybe we just haven't learned to stroke their things. Moving on...

Thomas Friedman only makes it on this page about one every two Friedman units. So what's he up to today?

Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It’s worth recalling: What are we trying to do? We’re trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth — infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness.

The best place to start is with a carbon tax. A phased-in carbon tax of $20 to $25 a ton could raise around $1 trillion over 10 years, as we each pay a few more dimes and quarters for every gallon of gasoline or hour of electricity. With that new revenue stream, we’d have so many more options. One, preferred by Republicans like the statesman George Shultz and the Nobel laureate Gary Becker, is to make the carbon tax “revenue neutral.” It could be offset entirely by a rebate or by cutting tax rates for every U.S. citizen and corporation, which would increase spending. Another option, the one I’d prefer, would devote half the carbon-tax revenues to individual and corporate tax cuts, use a quarter for new investments in infrastructure, preschool education, community colleges and research — which would create jobs now and tomorrow — and then use a quarter on deficit reduction.

... here's another good bipartisan idea that the tax committees should consider: a new federal tax on emissions — more frequently called a carbon tax. We already know that we use more energy from oil, gas and coal than we really need. (America consumes the equivalent of about 48 barrels of oil per person per year; Germany, with the healthiest economy in Europe, consumes just 26.) We know that lower consumption would make us less dependent on other countries for energy, a goal every president since Richard Nixon has pursued. We know that oil and coal produce air pollution, which we'd like to reduce. And we know that those fuels emit carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. Economists call the hidden costs of energy consumption — the prices of climate change, pollution and national security — ""externalities."" They're real costs, but they're not included in the price of the gasoline you put in your car or the electricity you use at home.

Friedman's column overfloweth with the kind of overwriting, self praise and calls for a ""radical center"" that you expect from the flatman, but there is this... Doyle McManus also talks carbon tax (and does it much better). Phillip Roth praises the home room teacher he had when he was twelve. Doesn't sound like something that would catch your attention? Did I mention it was Phillip Roth?

NY Times Magazine talks with another of my favorites.

On a recent Saturday morning in February, two dozen or so scent hounds streamed through the streets of St. Buryan, a small village in Cornwall, England. Behind them drifted a loose formation of men and women perched atop well-groomed horses and wearing boots, breeches and hunting coats. As the fox hunt clopped through town, John le Carré, the pre-eminent spy writer of the 20th century, sipped from a paper cup of warm whiskey punch, doled out by a local pub to riders and spectators. At 81, he remains an enviable specimen of humanity: tall, patrician, cleanlimbed, ruddy-complected. His white hair is floppy and well cut, so much so that the actor Ralph Fiennes, who starred in the 2005 film version of le Carré’s novel “The Constant Gardener,” badgered him for the name of his barber.

le Carré comes off as crusty, snooty, and brilliant. He comes off as le Carré.

Dana Millbank is worried about the new Tea Party fan favorite.

Is there nobody who can tell Ted Cruz to shut up? The young senator from Texas has been on the job for about 100 days, but he has already turned the Senate’s ancient seniority system upside down and is dominating his senior Republican colleagues. He’s speaking for them on immigration, guns and any other topic that tickles his fancy; Republican leaders are seething at being outshone yet are terrified of challenging him. ... GOP lawmakers encouraged the rise of the tea party, which now dominates Republican primaries and threatens the same leaders who nurtured it. Cruz’s fellow Texan, John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, could face a primary challenge next year and therefore can’t afford to cross Cruz, who beat an establishment Republican in the 2012 primary. Likewise, the Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is up for reelection and has to keep on the good side of tea party favorites such as Sen. Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, and Cruz.

Perhaps those leaders are too busy getting stroked to bother with Cruz. (No, I'm not letting that go.)

You're an average voter in Pennsylvania. The night before Election Day, your wallet goes missing, leaving you without immediate access to any of the identification you'll need to vote at your local precinct the following morning. This would be a problem under <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#PA"" target=""_hplink"">Pennsylvania's proposed photo ID law</a>, since <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-ruling_n_1919187"" target=""_hplink"">blocked by a state judge</a>. While many people in this situation may have backup forms of identification, <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-law_n_1652469"" target=""_hplink"">studies have shown</a> that a significant percentage of would-be voters don't. The state's safeguard against the immediate disenfranchisement of people in this situation would be a provisional ballot cast on the day of the election. But this doesn't mean your vote counts, yet. Anyone who casts a provisional ballot is required to ""appear in person at the county board of elections"" within six days of the vote to provide proof that their ballot was valid. If you're able to take time away from your job to do this, the process still requires a would-be voter to either show up with valid ID -- a replacement driver's license <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/fees/index.shtml"" target=""_hplink"">would cost $36</a> and considerable time -- or to sign an affirmation that you are indigent and not able to afford the fees associated with acquiring a photo ID. Even if you make a rapid and somewhat expensive turnaround to get a replacement ID -- or alternatively swear under oath that you are too poor to pay for such a document -- there is no guarantee that your vote will end up counting. Many elections are largely decided before provisional voters have a chance to verify their validity, which could serve to discouraging them from following up with election officials or leave them effectively disenfranchised. In 2008, <a href=""http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/2008 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Report.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">only 61.8 percent</a> of all provisional ballots cast were fully counted.

It was striking not because of the content made public by the Fair Political Practices Commission -- it mimicked what California Democrats have been saying for years -- but because of the author, Republican consultant and fundraiser Jeff Miller.

True, his memo was written the day after November’s dual losses, when Miller and his team failed to defeat Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax measure and also failed to supersede it with one of their own. And Miller has in the past criticized the party, so insiders might not find his comments startling.

But they remain a bleak, and now public, assessment for the state party.

“Over the last two decades, California’s working class has slowly migrated out of the state and Latino and women voters are completely disenfranchised with the Republican Party. There are only a few pockets of conservative voters left in the state and they are only able to help carry the day for Republicans in ultra-low turnout elections on issues where campaign spending is at parity or to the Republican advantage, and where the Democratic and union grass-roots apparatus is not activated,” Miller’s memo said.

“There is no good way to sugarcoat this. ... The Republican label is anathema to younger voters, women and Latinos -- growing voter blocs with real significance to future elections.”

“We are going to be on permanent defense in California for the foreseeable future,” the memo went on, “and even then, we will need to pick our battles wisely and not spread ourselves too thin. While playing defense, we’re going to have to try and force the Democrats into making mistakes that we can use to score small victories and build momentum.”

Miller, who could not be reached for comment Friday, noted that as Republicans have weakened in the state, labor unions have remained a potent pro-Democratic force. And the GOP traditional funding base, the corporate world, “has been little help in the overall fight” due to its desire to work with the dominant Democrats, he wrote.

Miller intended the memo to be seen by clients -- at the bottom is a notation indicating it is to be considered confidential -- but the document was included in paperwork for the FPPC investigation that resulted in state officials levying a record $16 million in penalties on conservative groups that funneled money into the 2012 state elections.

Part of the payment is a combined $1 million in fines agreed to in a settlement with two Arizona nonprofits, one linked to billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch. The rest of the money is equivalent of the donations they received, which regulators said had been improperly reported.

As far as the future for California Republicans goes, the party continues to try to grapple with the dilemma that has confounded it for two decades: how to appeal to new blocs of voters without alienating its mostly white, mostly conservative base.

Miller, for his part, voted with his feet. He moved to Austin, Texas, where he has been working with Gov. Rick Perry to recruit California businesses to his new home state.

Along with Perry, he attended the state Republican party convention earlier this month in Anaheim. Perry, a once-and-future presidential prospect, has focused on economic development as a playable card for the GOP nationally, a strategy that avoids some of the cultural issue disputes that have driven Californians from the party.

Perry declined when asked to dissect the California party’s troubles, but alluded to opposition to comprehensive immigration reform.

“The California Republican Party needs to take a look at their policies, the words that they use,” he said. “I would suggest that that matters.”

It’s divided over how best to shrink the federal budget and how to undo President Obama’s healthcare law. It hasn’t been notably successful at either, which helps explain why the GOP’s standing in the eyes of most voters has plummeted to depths not seen in three decades of modern polling.

None of this was planned, of course; parties don’t flirt with political suicide on purpose. But it wasn’t accidental either. Behind the GOP crackup over the government shutdown lies a much bigger battle for control of the party.

And the most important actors aren’t Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and the tea party members of the House who brought us the government shutdown. The party rift’s chief driver is a constellation of hard-line conservative fundraising groups, led in part by a former senator most Americans couldn’t pick out of a lineup, Jim DeMint of South Carolina.

When DeMint resigned from the Senate in January to become president of Washington’s Heritage Foundation, many were mystified; he was abandoning a safe seat with four years left in his term, all to run an aging conservative think tank across the street.

But DeMint has quickly turned Heritage — especially its new lobbying arm, Heritage Action for America — into a powerful engine of pressure on Republicans in Congress to move further to the right and reject almost any form of compromise with Obama.

“There’s no question in my mind that I have more influence now on public policy than I did as an individual senator,” DeMint told NPR recently.

It was Heritage Action that focused tea party conservatives in the House on the idea of using this fall’s long-scheduled votes on federal spending to try to “defund” Obamacare, and the group then organized a summer-long campaign (starring Cruz) to publicize the idea.

Meanwhile, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a separate political action committee that DeMint founded, played the role of enforcer, publicly attacking GOP members of Congress who didn’t fall in line. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans broke with the hard-liners on a procedural vote, the fund accused them of “betraying their principles.”

“Nobody worked harder to fund Obamacare in the Senate than Mitch McConnell,” the group said in a statement posted on its website and emailed to donors

The drive to defund Obamacare hasn’t accomplished much so far, but that doesn’t appear to worry Heritage Action’s 31-year-old CEO, Michael A. Needham, who said last week that the group’s long-term goal was to transform the GOP, which he called “the allegedly conservative party.” The government shutdown, he insisted, was a step on “a path to electoral success.”

After Mitt Romney lost the presidential election last year, Needham told a group of reporters that “the Republican establishment’s response … [was] to raise taxes, pass amnesty [by which he meant immigration reform], pass gun control and not fight on Obamacare.” Instead, he said, “The Republican Party should start authentically leading based on the values that their voters have” and “become a more populist party … that stands up for core conservative values.”

In other words, the party should oppose new taxes, immigration reform, gun control and, of course, Obamacare.

Heritage Action’s one concession to pragmatism so far has been an announcement that it wouldn’t oppose a short-term measure to lift the federal debt ceiling while budget talks continued.

There have been insurgent movements in American political parties before, of course. Goldwater conservatives broke with the party’s mainstream in 1964, and antiwar liberals divided the Democratic Party during the Vietnam War.

Those earlier movements, like this one, aimed to change their own parties first, on the assumption that voters wanted a purer form of politics.

But here’s what’s different about DeMint and his allies: They are eager to target Republican incumbents, even to the point of challenging them in Republican primaries. In addition to calling out McConnell, the Senate Conservatives Fund has denounced Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), all of whom will face tea party primary opponents next year.

And DeMint is helping to build an impressive and apparently permanent infrastructure of fundraising organizations with the avowed goal of displacing the GOP’s traditional business backers. The goal, as Needham put it, is “to take on cronyism and the way K Street [lobbyists] run this town.”

But they should expect some push-back. Some of those K Street Republican lobbyists told me last week they were already organizing to support endangered incumbents, including McConnell, and plan to do some “primarying” of their own, funding moderate GOP challengers to several tea party members of the House, including two Michigan Republicans, Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio.

As a result, some of the toughest, most expensive campaigns in next year’s congressional election cycle may not be between Republicans and Democrats but in primaries that pit Republicans against each other — with the future of the GOP at stake.

Ronald Reagan, an icon to both sides in this fight, said to GOP volunteers in 1967: “There is room in our tent for many views. It is not your duty, responsibility or privilege to tear down or attempt to destroy others in the tent.”

Congress will investigate the IRS%27 enhanced scrutiny of Tea Party-related groups

The controversy could derail any IRS efforts to crack down on tax-exempt groups active in politics%2C observers say.

%27Social-welfare%27 nonprofits spent more than %24250 million in 2012 federal elections

WASHINGTON —The political firestorm over the Internal Revenue Service's admission that it targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny during the 2012 election could jeopardize separate efforts underway in Congress to force the agency to crack down on non-profit political organizations, observers say.

Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, immediately denounced the IRS after a top official acknowledged that organizations that included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status were singled out for additional questioning. The Republican-controlled House plans an investigation.

The scandal erupted Friday when Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, apologized for the enhanced scrutiny of Tea Party-related groups' tax-exempt applications. She told reporters Friday that the actions were undertaken by low-level employees in Cincinnati, and that she learned of the additional scrutiny through news reports last year.

A draft timeline of events compiled by the agency's inspector general, however, indicates Lerner was briefed about the additional scrutiny in 2011.

""This is going to be fodder for partisan warfare in Congress,"" said Richard Hasen, a campaign-finance expert who teaches law at the University of California-Irvine. He said congressional hearings are justified.

""At the very least, it's a distraction for the IRS,"" he said. ""At the most, it will significantly dampen efforts to rein in shadowy"" groups.

Campaign-finance watchdogs, along with a handful of mostly Democratic lawmakers, have put increasing pressure on the IRS to more closely monitor the actions of self-described ""social welfare"" organizations — arguing these groups have abused the tax code to mask their funders.

These tax-exempt groups can conduct political activity, but it cannot be their primary function. Experts say that groups are spending as much as 49% of their money on politics, instead of a minimal amount.

In the 2012 election, social welfare groups — led by Crossroads GPS, an organization linked to Republican strategist Karl Rove — spent more than $254 million on last-minute advertising to shape the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political money.

None disclosed its donors.

Bills in the House and Senate would require top donors to put their names on any political advertising they helped fund. Previous efforts to pass similar measures have failed. Proposed legislation introduced last month by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also would give the IRS the power to temporarily revoke the tax-exempt status of serious violators.

Wyden said political operatives are ""masquerading as tax-exempt social welfare groups.""

""The IRS has refused to take on its clear responsibility to interpret and enforce the existing law when it comes to these tax-exempt 'social welfare' groups that injected massive amounts of dark money into the 2012 elections,"" he said.

David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, which favors fewer campaign-finance regulations, said the IRS incident ""proves Congress should not pass pending legislation to give the IRS more power over advocacy or political groups.""

""The agency abuses that power, doesn't understand the need to exercise it with caution, or is simply incompetent to exercise it with care,"" he said.

David Vance of the Campaign Legal Center, one of the campaign-finance watchdog groups urging the IRS to investigate social-welfare groups, said that ""the goal of this political storm is to scuttle the IRS cracking down on the larger abuses.""

""I hope this doesn't cause them to turn around with their tail behind their legs and leave the field,"" he said.

The controversial IRS action disclosed Friday did not involve groups that had already secured their tax-exempt status and were active in politics. Instead, IRS officials decided to subject conservative groups to additional questions as they reviewed the organizations' applications for tax-exempt status.

Lerner, who heads the IRS Exempt Organization section, said workers inappropriately assumed that any group with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in its name needed more scrutiny for political activity just because of its name. About 300 groups that had applied for tax-exempt status were put into a ""bucket"" of cases needing further scrutiny, and of those, about a quarter had Tea Party affiliations, she said.

Lerner said what happened in Cincinnati won't affect the agency's ability to investigate other tax-exempt groups for improper political conduct. Officials who conduct those reviews are ""used to looking at organizations in a very different way,"" she said.

Those reviews are done by staffers in Dallas, who submit allegations to a review panel, which decides if further investigation is warranted. She said the episode has further sensitized the IRS to avoiding even the appearance of political decision-making. Lerner made her apology at a meeting of the American Bar Association's exempt organization committee in Washington on Friday.

Suzanne Ross McDowell, a partner with Steptoe & Johnson who heads that committee, said the IRS has been inundated with new applications for tax-exempt organizations ever since the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 to allow direct corporate and union spending on independent political advertising.

""But there is a lot of uncertainty about how you draw the line between intervention in a political campaign, and other activities that are not intervention in a political campaign, such as issue advocacy,"" she said.

""These are very tough questions, and I don't think any of us have the answer.""

Richard Briffault, a campaign-finance expert at Columbia Law School, said the IRS has a legitimate responsibility to examine whether organizations that receive tax protections have appropriately limited their political activity. But, as non-profits proliferate, the agency has been pressured to play a larger role in helping to uncover donors who critics say choose to fund social-welfare groups just to hide their political contributions.

""If Congress were to develop more effective rules for campaign-finance disclosure … some of this problem would go away,"" Briffault said. ""That doesn't look like it's happening anytime soon.""

SC-01 (in green)

Today's the big day for the special election in South Carolina's 1st congressional district, which, thanks to the presence of two candidates with much higher profiles than your usual House race contestants, is one of the most attention-grabbing House specials we've seen in years. The candidates, of course, are Republican Mark Sanford—who represented a predecessor to this district in the 1990s before becoming governor in 2002 and then going on to even greater celebrity for his Appalachian Trail-hiking exloits—and Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, who benefits from having a famous brother, Stephen Colbert, in her corner.

After a spate of initial polls giving Colbert Busch the lead against the badly damaged Sanford (with leads as high as 9, in Public Policy Polling's late-April poll of the race), things have settled down into a dead heat in the last few weeks. That's seen in not only a poll from conservative blog Red Racing Horses, which found a 46-46 tie, but also PPP's most recent poll from this weekend, which gives Sanford a 47-46 lead. If anything, these results show Sanford with a perceptible advantage heading into today: PPP found that the remaining undecided voters broke in favor of Mitt Romney in the 2012 election by a 59-25 margin.

While that's disappointing given the previous ECB-friendly polls, it shouldn't be too surprising. That kind of reversion to the mean is usually what happens in strongly partisan districts like this one (it went 40 percent Obama, 58 percent Romney in 2012; only three House Democrats represent districts redder than this one, and they're all entrenched veterans).

That may be particularly pronounced with PPP's previous poll; the one that showed a 9-point lead was taken right after the news about Sanford's trespassing at his ex-wife's property came out, and it seemed like Republican responses to the poll were particularly muted at that point. With that incident already sliding down the memory hole, enough Republican partisans have swallowed their pride and re-activated, to put Sanford within reach of a win. (Also not helpful: the presence of a Green Party candidate, who's pulling 4 percent in the most recent PPP poll, potentially enough to tip the balance of the race in Sanford's direction.)

Let's take a look at the counties that will be involved in tonight's election, below the fold."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/01/Mitch-McConnell-Time-for-GOP-establishment-to-stand-up-to-conservatives,2013-12-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Mitch McConnell: Time for GOP Establishment to 'Stand Up to' Tea Party,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican up for re-election in 2014, told the Washington Examiner in an interview published Friday that he believes it is time for the GOP establishment to stop conservatives and Tea Partiers.

McConnell argued it is “utter nonsense” for groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), which has endorsed his primary challenger businessman Matt Bevin, to argue that Republicans like him in Congress are not fighting hard enough to defeat Democrats. In the interview, McConnell focused on deriding Tea Partiers for leading the effort to defund Obamacare–something that, coupled with the Democrats’ refusal to compromise on the soon-to-fail Obamacare, resulted in a government shutdown.

“The Senate Conservatives Fund is giving conservatism a bad name,” McConnell told the Examiner for the piece titled “The Establishment Fights Back: Mitch McConnell leads GOP battle against Tea Party insurgents.”

“They’re [SCF] participating in ruining the [Republican] brand,” McConnell said. “What they do is mislead their donors into believing the reason that we can’t get as good an outcome as we’d like to get is not because of a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, but because Republicans are insufficiently committed to the cause–which is utter nonsense.”

McConnell had not only personally opposed, during the shutdown, the effort from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to defund Obamacare, he actually whipped votes against them, according to a Congressional source. Cruz and Lee had staked their battle on a key cloture vote that would have, if McConnell had united the Republican Party to deliver 41 votes against the use of taxpayer money to fund Obamacare, stopped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from using a procedural ploy to fund Obamacare with just 51 votes.

McConnell voted with the Senate Democrats in favor of cloture and reportedly whipped the Senate GOP conference to join him. While a majority of Senate Republicans–25, including McConnell–voted to allow Reid to procedurally fund Obamacare with just 51 votes cloture, 19 stood with Cruz and Lee. Those 19 Republicans included senior GOP senators like Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

McConnell made an argument for what he termed “electable” candidates that he deems necessary to win back the U.S. Senate for the GOP. “To have the kind of year we ought to have in 2014, we have to have electable candidates on November ballots in every state–people that don’t scare the general electorate and can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home,” McConnell said in his interview with the Examiner. “We can’t just turn the other cheek and hope for the best. It didn’t work in 2010 and 2012 so we’re going to try something different in 2014.”

McConnell is now, according to Bloomberg News, getting financial backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in his reelection campaign against Bevin.

“The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pouring money into a television advertising campaign defending Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whose primary fight against a Tea Party-backed rival is shaping up as a test of establishment efforts to reclaim the Republican Party,” Bloomberg reported last Wednesday. “The business lobby will spend about $180,000 on a 10-day statewide blitz beginning Dec. 2 on behalf of McConnell, a five-term Republican, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not be identified because the ad buy hasn’t been announced.”

The Chamber of Commerce is leading the GOP establishment’s efforts to undercut the Tea Party movement and is the tip of the spear–along with Crossroads GPS’s Karl Rove–of the establishment’s efforts to strike back against the surging grassroots conservatism across America.

Bevin has been gaining steam lately, partly due to McConnell’s mistakes in attacking conservatives and also by wrapping up a series of key grassroots support elements like an 85 percent victory in the Boone County, KY, GOP straw poll right before Thanksgiving. In an interview last weekend with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Sunday, Bevin described his primary challenge against McConnell as a “microcosm” of the national fight between the Tea Party movement and the GOP establishment.

Rather than embracing conservatism, McConnell’s strategy has been to attempt to isolate and excoriate SCF for backing Bevin. McConnell has been largely unsuccessful in doing so, as his actions have garnered him attention and criticism from other Tea Party-minded organizations who say attacking SCF is attacking the entire conservative movement.

Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin and Tea Party Express chairwoman Amy Kremer both say it is unfair to attack SCF and try to separate the organization, which was founded by Heritage Foundation president former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) and whose help has directly led to the elections of Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT), among many others.

McConnell’s latest slip-up, as it is being portrayed by Bevin, is a quote that appeared in the Bowling Green Daily News, in which McConnell said that he would be open to allowing Obamacare to remain the law of the land provided significant changes were made to it.

McConnell said “he is not averse to talking about changes [to Obamacare], provided they are significant ones,” the paper reported.

“I’m just not going to throw somebody a lifeline (by extending the deadline for signup) just to get someone through the election,” McConnell said.

In response to that comment, Bevin held a conference call with reporters both in national and in Kentucky media to point out the Senate Minority Leader has essentially abandoned his previous promises to repeal Obamacare “root and branch.”

“We really want to call attention to the fact that there really is nothing conservative about his approach and there is really nothing with respect to what the American people want, which is a repeal,” Bevin said on the call, according to the Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Kentucky."

Spencer Bachus Won't Seek Reelection,"After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.

After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.

Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”

This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.

“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”

During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.

“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”

Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits.

“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.

Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight."

Rand Paul feud could make Christie president,"The chart below is quite illuminating. Texas is the only red state that gets back less than it sends to Washington. Of course Texas' wealth of natural resources can hide a lot of its intrinsic dysfunction.

The above chart and many others have been circulating over the internet for years. They are modified as new data becomes available. One would think that every time a red state politician started grandstanding about smaller government, the mainstream media would ask them if they realized their stance was disproportionately harming their states. In fact, the chart demonstrates a particular pathology that is systemic mostly with red states. One must wonder why the mainstream media’s objective journalists do not feel compelled to investigate this reality with in depth reporting and specials.

Rand Paul inadvertently opened that door for debate. Most importantly, since the argument was made by a Republican to a Republican it runs the risk of being heard by Republicans. Had these facts been articulated by Democrats or liberals, no one on the right would be listening to them or be receptive of learning the fact that Kentucky, as well as all but one red state, are very dependent on the federal government.

Conventional wisdom by most in the mainstream media and other talking heads is that Chris Christie cannot make it out of a Republican primary because he is not conservative enough. Some believe his acceptance of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion was one of the nails in his presidential coffin.

Christie has already earned his conservative bona fides. He cancelled a much-needed tunnel project. He lambasted unions even as some unions endorsed him likely for political reasons. He has revived his tax cut proposal that gives most of its benefits to the top 1 percent. He attacked the Supreme Court decision for ruling that key parts of DOMA were unconstitutional.

If Christie decides to run for president, he will win the Republican primary. He is a conservative and made the minimal political moves in a Blue State to remain so. He is willing to defend his policies even if he has to destroy the false narratives of his red state rivals. He will make them the fake conservatives for preaching small government even as they are on the dole. He will spin his acceptance of Obamacare Medicaid expansion as a fiscally responsible move on a bill that had conservative origins. Christie will use the social-welfare red state reality and make any additional austerity proposed by the right-wingers an attack on the red state middle class. He will make himself the only adult in the room.

Republicans want the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six elections. 2016 is likely the last election they can win without revamping their party. While the far right claims that the party is not sufficiently to the Right, most Republicans know better. If they were willing to elect Mitt Romney, the governor that actually passed Massachusetts’ version of Obamacare, they surely would be willing to elect Christie who uses it to benefit his indigent (and make money for insurance companies, hospitals, and drug makers).

Ultimately the real question is, can Chris Christie beat Hillary Clinton? As a blue state conservative Republican who uses his brashness when questioned to deflect from the actual policies, as a mainstream media darling, and as a recipient of poor mainstream media scrutiny and in depth analysis, the answer is yes. If Hillary Clinton is tied to Bill Clinton and a narrative is constructed with his Glass Steagall sin, the answer is yes.

If, however, the country buys into two tenets Hillary will win. If the country believes the truth that governance by testosterone has been a failure to the middle class and that conservative policies by Republicans and Democrats alike decimated the middle class, then Hillary Clinton will win.

The exuberance of many that assume that because of demographic changes a Republican cannot win the presidency is false. A Republican like Gov. Chris Christie can."

Mrs. Bachmann, defiant as ever as she insisted that she would have won re-election had she tried, said the legal inquiries had nothing to do with her decision. She vowed to continue to fight for the principles she said she holds dear: religious liberty, traditional marriage, family values and opposition to abortion.

“I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term,” she said in a gauzy network-television quality video posted on her campaign Web site. “They always seemed to attempt to find a dishonest way to disparage me. But I take being the focus of their attention and disparagement as a true compliment of my public service effectiveness.”"

Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group that has injected itself into a number of intra-GOP fights in the past, launched a new digital campaign on Wednesday attacking a number of House Republican lawmakers and soliciting submissions for potential conservative challengers.

Launched by Club for Growth Action, the group's super PAC arm, the Primary My Congressman site features a list of nine representatives deemed insufficiently conservative.

In a statement, the Club for Growth said they hoped the push would ""raise awareness of Republicans In Name Only (RINOs) who are currently serving in safe Republican seats.""

“Big government liberals inhabit the Democratic Party, but they are far too common within the Republican Party as well,” Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said. “The Republicans helped pass billions of dollars in tax increases and they have repeatedly voted against efforts by fiscal conservatives to limit government.""

The site features profiles for Reps. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Rick Crawford (R-Ark.), Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), Steve Palazzo (R-Miss.), Martha Roby (R-Ala.), Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), Renee Elmers (R-N.C.) and Aaron Schock (R-Ill.).

http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/why-republicans-miss-the-realists/,2013-07-31 00:00:00,['Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Opinion Editorialsandoped Oped Columnists Rossdouthat Index.Html'],Why Republicans Miss The Realists,"Chris Christie’s comments attacking Rand Paul and other right-wing civil libertarians, extracted by my colleague Jonathan Martin in an Aspen forum last week, have generally been interpreted as setting Christie up as a spokesman for Republican hawks in a looming 2016 battle over the party’s direction on foreign policy. On Friday, Politico’s Alexander Burns ran down some polling numbers that help explain why the more hawkish perspective is no longer an obvious political winner, even in a G.O.P. primary:

… there are also more than a few daunting data points for the anti-Paul coalition within the GOP – signs in public opinion research that the country has moved substantially from the Bush-era national security consensus. A Washington Post poll this week showed 67 percent of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting, including a bare majority of Republicans. An extensive Pew survey published Friday found a mixed public attitude on surveillance: half of Americans said they approve of the government’s information-collecting, but 56 percent said courts weren’t providing adequate oversight and a 47-percent plurality said the government had done too much to limit civil liberties. And public polls consistently show public hesitation about possible U.S. intervention in Syria …

As Matt Yglesias pointed on Twitter, those Pew numbers on civil liberties included a striking turnaround since 2010 (not 2008, as one would expect if it were all just a partisan swing) among Tea Partiers and conservatives, who now tilt more sharply than G.O.P. moderates in favor of the proposition that the government has traded too much liberty for security. So as odd as it is, especially for anyone who experienced the Bush era, to hear a non-interventionist Republican attacking a tough-on-terror Republican for being too “liberal,” given the current shape of Republican opinion Rand Paul’s framing of his debate with Christie is defensible: By invoking 9/11 to defend the N.S.A.’s surveillance programs, the New Jersey governor was arguably attacking Paul from the left.

With the Bush-era categories thus scrambled, it will be extremely interesting to see how this plays out. The good news for Republicans is that the debate itself is a sign of intellectual health: After the foreign policy failures of the Bush era, the party needs a vigorous internal argument about national security — at least if it ever hopes to regain the public’s trust on those issues, instead of just recycling cliches about toughness and resolve a la the Romney campaign. But the bad news is that in the short term, this argument has the potential to open a real cleavage in the right-of-center coalition. I don’t think John McCain would actually endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016 because I don’t think Rand Paul will actually be the G.O.P. nominee, but neither do I think McCain is just making an empty threat in this interview: A G.O.P. primary campaign carried out along the lines of his Senate feud with Paul really would have the potential to fracture the party’s general-election unity.

With that being said, the “hawk vs. libertarian, McCain vs. Paul” binary is also not the only way a savvy Republican politician might approach these debates. For instance, there is no necessary reason why, having taken the pro-N.S.A. position on one front, a figure like Christie would also need to support an American military intervention in Syria or a permanent U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Indeed, from a purely political, poll-reading perspective he would have every reason to cast his domestic tough guy routine as an alternative to foreign warmaking: Both the country and his party may be divided on civil liberties, but there’s a clear American and Republican consensus against, say, adding Syria to the list of American kinetic military actions. Whatever you think of the position that George W. Bush was right about the war on terror but wrong about regime change, it’s a potential sweet spot for a conservative politician trying to appeal to a war-weary party and country both.

However, I’m doubtful that Christie will ultimately take this kind of split-the-difference tack, because with the eclipse of foreign-policy realism within the G.O.P. there’s a shortage of potential advisers and influencers who represent any kind of middle way between crusading interventionism and Paul-style libertarianism. And if that debate does end up splitting the party in 2016, it could be a case study in why the Eisenhower/Nixon/H.W. Bush realists were so useful to the Cold War-era G.O.P., and why the party misses them today.

The realists weren’t particularly liked by anyone else within the conservative tent: They were too squishy for the Birchers and later too cautious for the neocons, too internationalist for the party’s Jacksonian base, too pro-defense spending for the libertarians, too Arabist for pro-Israel Republicans, too willing to use force for the paleocons and Buchananites. (This is part of why Eisenhower’s presidency is criminally underrated within his own party.) And there were many non-foreign policy reasons why their influence diminished over time: They were mostly social liberals and economic moderates, and as time went by and WASP Republicanism waned as a force in our politics, they increasingly lacked any electoral constituency to speak of on the right.

But their persistent role in Republican administrations, from Ike’s two terms down to Robert Gates’s tenure as Bush’s defense secretary, was deeply important to the G.O.P.’s longstanding advantage on foreign policy. By embodying a version of internationalism that clearly put the national interest first, and a form of Daddy-Party toughness that didn’t necessarily entail starting wars willy-nilly, the realists both helped the party manage its internal tensions on foreign policy — bridging divides between isolationists and advocates of “rollback,” paleocons and neocons — and present a credible, competent and non-scary face to the American public as a whole.

That’s something the post-Bush party has thus far failed to do. And if any 2016 candidate wants to unite their party on foreign policy rather than just polarizing it, reaching for the realist legacy might be a decent place to start."

Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) - Former Gov. Mark Sanford finished first in Tuesday's crowded Republican primary for the U.S. House special election in South Carolina, CNN projects. However, Sanford fell well short of the 50% margin needed to avoid a runoff.

The former governor will compete against Curtis Bostic, a former Charleston councilman, in a runoff election in two weeks. The third place finisher, state Sen. Larry Grooms, conceded the race Wednesday.



""Are you guys ready to change things in Washington, D.C.?"" Sanford said to supporters at his campaign headquarters in Charleston on Tuesday night. All four of his sons attended the party.

""What we've earned is the honor of being on the playing field here for the next two weeks,"" he added, asking the crowd to redouble their campaign efforts. ""Indeed, we are at that tipping point.""

On the Democratic side, CNN projects Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of comedian Stephen Colbert, won the nomination.

""This is absolutely incredible. What a wonderful night,"" she told supporters at a victory party in Charleston, South Carolina. ""It's the start of a new beginning, right?""

The longtime area businesswoman was considered the favorite on the Democratic side over opponent Ben Frasier. She'll compete against the Republican nominee in the general election in May.

The winner of the special election will fill the U.S. House seat vacated by now-Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican appointed to fill the Senate spot that Jim DeMint left last month.

""I am ready to go to Washington, D.C. to be your voice, so we're going to do that,"" Colbert Busch said.

The Republican primary ballot featured 16 candidates, including Sanford and Teddy Turner, son of CNN founder Ted Turner.

Sanford's re-entry into politics comes after an extramarital affair derailed his marriage and political career. As governor, he infamously told the public in 2009 he was hiking the Appalachian Trail while he was actually traveling to Argentina to carry on the affair.

He and his then-wife, Jenny, were divorced in 2010 and Sanford finished his second term in January 2011.

Sanford is asking the public for a second chance, and in his own informal poll of the voters, he said he's finding an openness to forgive, if not forget.

In an interview Tuesday night, Sanford said his first-place finish was ""incredibly humbling.""

""There's this amazing reservoir of human grace out there that's a reflection of God's grace, and I've seen it first hand,"" he said, adding that he looks forward to a ""spirited contest"" during the runoff.

Sanford's colorful not so distant past was far from the only distraction in the race.

Turner had family ties, deep pockets and a sudden rise in some internal polling. All that made him a big target.

Opponents filled mailboxes with attack ads on Turner, with some tying the candidate to one of his father's ex-wives, Jane Fonda.

""You know it's absolutely amazing how dirty the game is, how expensive the game is. It just doesn't make sense,"" Turner said.

John Avlon, a CNN political contributor whose family has lived in South Carolina for decades, said Sanford's honesty about his imperfect personal life has made him more relatable to voters.

""There is an affection for a guy who admits he's a sinner and asks for forgiveness, especially down here,"" Avlon said.

Despite his transgressions, the former governor insists he is worthy of the public trust. Sanford maintains he learned some important life lessons after wondering off-trail.

""Oddly enough, I think you learn from the valleys of life rather than the peaks,"" Sanford said.

In other words, we want government to back off and not infringe upon our rights. I think there will be a lot of us who start saying ‘GOP, if you abandon us, we have nowhere else to go except to become more independent and not enlisted in a one or the other private majority parties that rule in our nation, either a Democrat or a Republican.’ Remember these are private parties, and you know, no one forces us to be enlisted in either party.”

One of the few uncertainties left about the modern Republican Party is the precise date and time they will devolve into cannibalism. For those of you that are making your own predictions, here's actual Republican vice presidenting candidate Sarah Palin answering a Fox News viewer's Twitter question (yes, I know) on whether she might consider abandoning the dirty rotten liberals in the GOP and forming a new ""Freedom Party"" for the nation's real conservatives Yeah, I'm not seeing Sarah Palin follow through on something that sounds like so much work.

The problem here, I'm beginning to realize, is that John McCain taught her the word ""maverick"" and she loved the notion so much that she's now devoted her entire life to an extended sketch on the topic. Suddenly, being lazy is a virtue, and being a stubborn, ignorant crank is the patriotic ideal? There have been people who have been stubborn, ignorant cranks all their lives and have been waiting that whole time for a party to acknowledge their contribution to American freedomz; they must be absolutely giddy now that it's an actual movement.

So deep within the conservative bowels of the party, there's a deep growling sound: These damn Republicans are too liberal. They're infringing our rights just like the Demmycrats. They're not tearing down our stop signs and unpainting the crosswalks; they're not sympathetic enough to every crackpot conspiracy theory that gets sent through the conservative wires along with the desperate pleas from flighty African nobles and bored Russian women; they're not entirely allowing us to shoot poor people for sport, though you can't say we haven't made great strides on the subject. No sir, what we need here is an even meaner, dumber party. That'll fix everything.

Rep.-elect Mark Sanford will be in court Thursday%2C accused of trespassing by his ex-wife

Sanford had prickly relations with GOP leadership when was previously in Congress

Democrats promise to make his ethical baggage a continued issue for the GOP

Republican Mark Sanford won South Carolina's congressional special election Tuesday, but the results may not conclude the drama of a disgraced former governor on the outs with his own party.

Sanford's quest for public and political redemption after an extramarital affair succeeded with voters Tuesday, who returned him to a congressional seat he left in 2001. Sanford will fill the seat vacated when Rep. Tim Scott was appointed to the U.S. Senate in January.

On Thursday, however, Sanford will appear in a televised court hearing to answer a charge of trespassing from his former wife. Then he'll head to Washington, where he made few friends during his previous three terms in office bucking the Republican leadership.

Sanford defeated Elizabeth Colbert Busch, despite her backing by national Democratic organizations and fundraising help from her brother, comedian Stephen Colbert.

The victory in what had been seen as a tight race means the district, centered on Charleston, ""is a safe Republican district … and Democrats have not a lot of hope going forward,"" says political scientist Danielle Vinson of Furman University in Greenville, S.C.

""I don't see him having a lot of trouble if he can just shut his mouth about his private life and stop making an enemy of his ex-wife."" If he can't, Vinson says, ""the frustration with being a national punch line is pretty high in that district.""

Sanford won nomination for the special election over a field of 16 Republicans, so there is no lack of potential primary challengers in 2014 should he continue to make embarrassing headlines.

During his previous terms in Congress, Sanford stuck to his fiscal hawk positions even when he clashed with Republican leaders.

""I don't suspect he'll be any better a colleague than he was 15 years ago,"" said Mark Tompkins, a political scientist at the University of South Carolina. ""He doesn't change those spots, but on the other hand, he'll vote for Republican leadership. The election … really does get him on the path to overcoming his current liabilities. And that's a big deal.""

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, congratulated Sanford on Twitter on Tuesday night on his victory, and Republicans said it proved the unpopularity of national Democrats.

Sanford was late-night-comic fodder in 2009 when he told staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail and instead headed to Argentina to visit his mistress.

He paid a $70,000 ethics fine for spending public money on personal travel. He is now divorced and engaged to his Argentine girlfriend.

""The House Republican caucus has added yet another ethically challenged embarrassment who will be an albatross around the neck of every Republican forced to answer for Mark Sanford's embarrassing and reckless behavior,"" said House Majority PAC Executive Director Alixandria Lapp.

The PAC backed Colbert Busch with $450,000 in ad spending.

Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who runs the House Democratic campaign effort, said ""House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face.""

Democrats ""laid siege"" to the district because Charleston County, one of five in the district, voted for Obama, says county GOP Chair Joe Bustos. Sanford's win, ""is not a green light that future elections can be taken for granted at all.""

Sanford was initially favored to win the special election when he prevailed in the primary, but revelations that his ex-wife had filed a complaint alleging he trespassed at her home brought him a wave of bad publicity. The national Republican House campaign operation pulled its support, and polls suddenly showed Colbert Busch ahead by 9 percentage points before Sanford closed the gap.

Sanford campaigned with a cardboard cutout of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and tried to tie Colbert Busch tightly to national Democrats. In the final week of the campaign, South Carolina's two senators endorsed him and Gov. Nikki Haley appeared at a fundraiser on his behalf. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Tea Party favorite, also endorsed Sanford."

EMILY%27s List and National Organization for Women step up efforts on behalf of Christine Quinn

Quinn would be first woman mayor of New York City

National women's groups are stepping up their efforts in the New York City mayors race to support City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and denounce former Congressman Anthony Weiner for his lewd online behavior.

The women's poliitcal group EMILY's List is sending out an e-mail to supporters Friday saying ""New Yorkers deserve better than the circus their mayoral race has turned into."" The e-mail, written by communications director Jess McIntosh, was sent under the subject line ""I don't want to talk about Carlos Danger"" - a reference to the pseudonym Weiner allegedly used for some of his on-line trysts.

EMILY's List, which specializes in raising money for female candidates, extolled Quinn's qualifications and encouraged supporters to contribute to Quinn's campaign.

Thursday the National Organization for Women hosted a rally with Quinn in New York and NOW President Terry O'Neill said ""Mr. Weiner does have a problem and his behavior is sexist. Let's be clear: It is not respectful of women,"" according to the New York Daily News.

EMILY's list and the New York chapter of NOW had previously endorsed Quinn for the race, saying she is the most qualified candidate and hailing the historic possibility of election the first woman mayor of New York City.

Sonia Ossorio, president of NOW of New York City said Friday that Weiner has clearly demonstrated that he does not have the judgement or maturity to be mayor.

She added that the saga brings to mind Susan B. Anthony who spent decades crusading for women's right to vote. ""She fought for our vote,"" Ossorio said, ""and to think that a woman would squander their vote on someone like Anthony Weiner who doesn't take public office seriously, who is unfit and who has made a mockery of elected office, and who has done it by disrespecting woman . . . I feel embarrassed for our culture.""

Weiner resigned his seat in Congress in 2011 after it was revealed that he had sent lewd text messages and images to women on-line. This week he acknowledged that he had continued to engage in graphic on-line exchanges even after he left Congress. Thursday he said he may have exchanged texts with as many as ten women overall.

Weiner has rejected calls to quit the mayor's race, saying he believes New Yorkers are more interested in what he can do for the city than his boorish behavior, which he says is now behind him."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/john-boehner-right-wing-groups_n_4445626.html,2013-12-14 00:00:00,['Senior Congressional Reporter'],John Boehner's Budget Outburst Shows Right-Wing Groups Have Jumped The Shark,"WASHINGTON -- With an emphatic ""Are you kidding me?!"" aimed at right-wing Washington groups, House Speaker John Boehner this week may have finally pronounced the verdict that activist outfits, prosperous amid the tea party movement, have jumped the shark.

The Ohio Republican lashed out twice at organizations that have invited themselves to the tea party since 2009, blasting groups like Club for Growth, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks and others on Wednesday as ""ridiculous"" for opposing a bipartisan budget deal before they even saw it.

And Thursday he declared, albeit two months after the fact, his stunned disbelief that some of their leaders admitted they knew their bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government last fall would fail. Boehner accused them of ""misleading their followers,"" and using House Republicans and the American people to promote themselves.

""Frankly, I just think they've lost all credibility,"" Boehner told reporters at his weekly news conference.

Maybe they have, and maybe they haven't. But Boehner was at least declaring war on the well-funded agitators who have given him agita for three years. And he marked the 16-day government shutdown showdown as the moment they hopped over the line to absurdity -- much the way the aging TV show ""Happy Days,"" stretching for fresh plot lines, infamously put the leather-jacketed character ""Fonzie"" on water skis to leap a man-eater.

The question now is whether Boehner's outburst -- and more importantly the subsequent overwhelming vote for the budget deal -- means the influence of such outside groups will simply collapse, or whether it will limp along for years like the old '70s sitcom did.

Few senators leaving the Capitol Friday (the House already had recessed for vacation) were willing to answer that question directly, but some seemed to suggest that such organizations would no longer have as easy a time reaching out to scuttle key deals, as they did during the October shutdown battle.

""I think many people are realizing that many of the outside groups exist for one reason, and that is to raise money,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told HuffPost, echoing Boehner's charge. ""They have nothing to do with policy -- never did. If the goal posts are set, they'll move 'em … There's almost nothing that can be done to satisfy some of the groups.

""I think that people have begun to see through the antics of many of these groups,"" Corker added.

The issue is especially relevant -- and fraught -- for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who runs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which could win back the Senate by netting six seats in 2014. The NRSC can fairly blame tea party candidates for costing them at least five seats in the previous two election cycles, including Nevada in 2010 and Indiana in 2012. To avoid a replay, it must deal with primary challenges in seven or eight contests, and secure candidates with crossover appeal against the many red state Democrats they've targeted.

On the one hand, Moran wants the energy the tea party brought in 2010. On the other, he doesn't want all-or-nothing candidates who embrace the shutdown model.

""Hard for me to ever complain that Americans get involved in our government and encourage us to do things, one way or the other. I'm for more participation, not less,"" Moran said. But he added that while lawmakers should listen to outside interest groups, ""we need to make certain that we don't make decisions based upon that alone.""

For the 2014 contests, that means Moran will do what he can to ensure tea party purity is not the litmus test. ""What I'm hoping is that people will decide that they are interested in supporting a candidate that can win not just a primary, but also a general election,"" he said.

He doesn't believe -- and neither apparently does Boehner -- that most voters want absolutist politicians.

""I think there's a large group of American people, voters, who are interested in seeing this place work, seeing the Senate and House function, who dislike the constant political bickering that goes on here,"" Moran said. ""We at every opportunity -- without foregoing our principles -- ought to demonstrate that we can govern.""

Moran said he didn't like the budget deal that made the GOP strife so prominent this week, but he also did not say that he would try to obstruct the deal the way many Republicans -- led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- did during the October showdown.

Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action -- the campaign arm of the Heritage Foundation -- denied it was more interested in itself, asserting that the organization's efforts were indeed about promoting conservative policy.

""We just want to make sure lawmakers are having an honest, fact-based discussion with their constituents,"" Holler said.

And he argued the influence of groups like his merely suffered a dip during the House passage of the budget bill they robustly oppose. ""I do think there was an element of fatigue here in Washington, where people were tired, and that tends to happen, but then the American people are tired of Washington,"" Holler said.



He predicted that the conservative base would come around to the organization's way of thinking on the budget agreement, and that Republican lawmakers would have trouble explaining why they were willing to trade across-the-board spending cuts in 2014 and 2015 for proposed cuts in 2022 and 2023.

""If they can explain that to their constituents, then they're in good shape. If they can't explain it to their constituents, chances are they're going to have a little bit of trouble,"" Holler said.

A more telling moment than this week's House budget vote (and next week's in the Senate), he said, would come in January when lawmakers have to pass the $1.012 trillion spending bill the budget prescribes.

""It'll be an interesting dynamic, and I think when this comes to a head will be in January,"" Holler said. ""That sort of massive bill rolling through a Republican-controlled House is going to be really painful for a lot of these guys.""

And he predicted that if the GOP leaders ignored the disapproving opinions of the outside groups, conservative voters would see that as a betrayal they would remember next fall.

""The reason what we say matters, the reason what Club (for Growth) says matters, the reason why FreedomWorks has influence is because people outside of Washington trust us. And those conservative activists are also voters and constituents,"" Holler said.

""These conservative activists are smart, and they tend not to forget when they're cast aside,"" he added. ""There's a whole lot of open questions here about how is this going to play out in 2014.""

At least some outside Republican consultants think Boehner essentially answered those questions by declaring Republicans would no longer be slaves to self-appointed guardians of conservative doctrine and their vote scorecard. The speaker had to go along with the fall shutdown strategy to show once and for all that the path of the outside groups leads to a dead end, they said.

""I think that once they headed down that road in September, that [Boehner] decided the only thing he could do was give them all the rope he could,"" said long-time GOP operative Rich Galen, with the implicit idea that the groups hung themselves in what turned out to a deeply unpopular gambit.

Boehner's dramatic denunciation served not just to say he was back in charge, but also to tell the broader spectrum of voters and major donors that they could trust the GOP again, Galen said.

""I think it's less Fonzie, and I would look at it more as a Sister Souljah moment,"" Galen said, referring to then-Arkasas Gov. Bill Clinton's calculated denunciation of rap artist Sista Souljah in 1992 when he wanted to reassure moderates he wasn't a left-wing ideologue.

But Galen also suggested the ""Happy Days"" comparison is correct, in that there's no un-jumping the shark of the government shutdown.

""It's the peak of their influence, not just with the tea party members,"" Galen said. ""Their influence over legislation is probably permanently damaged.""

FBI officials executed a search warrant at former state Sen. Kent Sorenson’s home two weeks ago and confiscated computers and other materials connected to presidential campaign politics, his lawyer told The Des Moines Register today. “We were not notified that he was the target of any investigation,” attorney Theodore Sporer told the Register. “They took computers and things that would be used to verify or validate communications with presidential entities.”

“It wasn’t a ‘raid,’” Sporer told the Register. “They executed a search warrant that, frankly, we anticipated was coming.” The FBI on Wednesday, Nov. 20 were at Sorenson’s home for several hours and took computers belonging to his children, as well, Sporer said. “I assume it’s just kind of a dragnet to sweep for anything they could possibly find,” he said. “They’re very thorough.”

For those new to this story, Sorenson has some influence in Iowa politics. He worked for Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign before jumping ship to go over to Ron Paul's.

It is not legal to pay a member of the Iowa state Senate to work on your Presidential campaign, but the Bachmann campaign allegedly did just that, and laundered the money through a Colorado firm. Sorenson is also alleged to have asked for money to change over to the Paul campaign, and received a check for $25,000 and an EBT of $73,000 from them.

He is also alleged to have stolen an email mailing list of Iowa Christian home schooling advocates and used it on behalf of Michele Bachmann's campaign.

He might as well have been talking to one of the statues in the Capitol. Republicans have made it clear that erecting hurdles for Mr. Obama is, if anything, their overriding legislative goal.

There is no historical precedent for the number of cabinet-level nominees that Republicans have blocked or delayed in the Obama administration. Chuck Hagel became the first defense secretary nominee ever filibustered. John Brennan, the C.I.A. director, was the subject of an epic filibuster by Senator Rand Paul. Kathleen Sebelius and John Bryson, the secretaries of health and human services and commerce, were subjected to 60-vote confirmation margins instead of simple majorities. Susan Rice surely would have been filibustered and thus was not nominated to be secretary of state.

Jacob Lew, the Treasury secretary, was barraged with 444 written questions, mostly from Republicans, more than the previous seven nominees for that position combined. Many were ridiculous and had nothing to do with Mr. Lew’s fitness for office, such as a demand to explain the Treasury’s social media policies, or questioning an infographic on the department’s blog eight months ago.

Gina McCarthy, the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, is being blocked by Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri until he gets the answers he wants on a local levee project. And Thomas Perez, nominated to be labor secretary, is being held up by Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, who is angry about the Justice Department’s enforcement of voting rights laws. By comparison, there were four filibusters of cabinet-level positions during George W. Bush’s two terms, and one under President Ronald Reagan."

The gay Republican was referring to GOProud’s exclusion from participation at CPAC for a second year in a row, banned as an official sponsor. LaSalvia attended CPAC as a guest of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sponsor of CPAC which hosted a panel Thursday on which LaSalvia appeared, “A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet.”

At the packed panel, attended by younger CPAC members, including quite a few conservative gays and lesbians, conservative commentators and activists on the panel who support marriage equality, including CNN pundit Margaret Hoover and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, made the case for gay marriage as a conservative value. Earlier in the day Senator Marco Rubio, criticized those who would call him a “bigot” for not supporting same-sex marriage, underscoring the tension the issue continues to cause among conservatives. LaSalvia, for his part, however, agreed with Rubio, making a similar statement during the panel discussion and getting applause from the audience. (Scroll down to listen to the full interview)

“It’s truly about what people think conservatives think of gay people,” LaSalvia said in an interview on my SiriusXM radio program. “Kicking us out of CPAC doesn’t help. People aren’t going to vote for you if they think you hate their family and friends.”

“How do we have a winning coalition in the future, in a world that has gay people in every single family,” LaSalvia continued, a day before GOP Senator Rob Portman reversed his position and came out for marriage equality because his son had come out as gay. “It’s broader than marriage equality. It's about, 'Do you support my loved ones?' I think that a lot of the establishment leaders are out of touch with America and with their own base. There are a few folks in the establishment that don’t like gay people.”

Asked why GOProud endorsed candidates like Mitt Romney, who supported an constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, said that was old news.

“Mitt Romney is as relevant as Mike Dukakis is now,” he said. “So let’s not talk about the past. I know that it’s embarrassing to call yourself a Republican right now. I’m embarrassed to call myself a Republican right now. The question is, 'Are we going to be able to build new coalition that can win, that includes gay people, or not? Are they going to become the Dixiecrats or are they gong to go on and win elections?'”

Gay marriage became legal Monday in New Jersey

New Jersey is 14th state to permit gay marriage

Several took vows immediately after midnight

ASBURY PARK, N.J. — Hours after same-sex couples lined up Monday across the state to marry, Gov. Chris Christie dropped his administration's efforts to end gay marriage.

Christie and his Acting Attorney General John Hoffman had filed an appeal to the State Supreme Court after a lower court ruled that same-sex couples could begin to get married in New Jersey at midnight Monday, but Christie withdrew the appeal Monday morning.

A statement from Christie's office noted that when the State Supreme Court denied the governor's efforts to delay same-sex marriages, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote in the denial that ""same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today.""

""Although the governor strongly disagrees with the court substituting its judgment for the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people, the court has now spoken clearly as to their view of the New Jersey Constitution and, therefore, same-sex marriage is the law,"" the governor's statement said. ""The governor will do his constitutional duty and ensure his administration enforces the law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court.""

Meanwhile, across the state, same-sex couples began marrying shortly after midnight Monday.

Karen and Marcye Nicholson-McFadden have spent the past decade fighting for their right to wed.

Some guests, about 50 in all, were brought to tears as they watched the Nicholson-McFaddens and two other couples wed under a full moon in the cold wind outside the Paramount Theater here.

""It's utterly pure and complete relief to finally be here because it's been a crazy long road,"" said Karen Nicholson-McFadden after marrying Marcye Nicholson-McFadden, her partner of 24 years. They spent a weekend of uncertainty after their town clerk refused to issue them a marriage license but opened up at 8 p.m. Sunday when she got additional direction from the state on issuing the licenses.

The Aberdeen, N.J., women were plaintiffs in the lawsuit that brought same-sex marriage to the state. The couple immediately picked up their license and drove to Newark, N.J., to get a judge to waiver the 72-hour waiting period.

""We were all over the state of New Jersey in the last six hours,"" Karen Nicholson-McFadden said.

Asbury Park Councilwoman Amy Quinn and her partner, Heather Jensen, together 10 years, had a joint ceremony with couple Steven Brunner and Daniel Baum.

The Rev. Thomas Pivinski, a former Catholic priest who now is an Episcopal minister, officiated each wedding and said the state's recognition of gay marriage was long overdue.

""I think it's wonderful,"" Pivinski said. ""I am just very grateful that the state has recognized the equality of all people."" He planned to marry his civil-union partner of 20 years Monday night.

In Lambertville, N.J., Mayor David DelVecchio pronounced Beth Asaro and Joanne Schailey as spouses in the minute after midnight.

""We're floating on air,"" Asaro, a city councilwoman, said after the ceremony. ""We're not an exception anymore."" The women, partners for 27 years, were having their second ""first."" In 2007, they became the first couple in New Jersey to be joined in a civil union in another midnight ceremony also performed by DelVecchio.

Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, D-Trenton, the state's first openly gay legislator and the first sponsor of same-sex marriage legislation, presented the couple with a bottle of Egalite, a New York sparkling wine created in support of lesbian and gay equality. Back in January 2012, Christie had called Gusciora ""numb nuts"" over a comment from the assemblyman that likened the struggle for gay rights to the civil-rights movement.

Lambertville's City Clerk Cindy Ege said she has received 13 same-sex marriage license applications and, before the ceremony announced she would be present until 1 a.m to accept more applications.

In Red Bank, N.J., Ed Zipprich and John Paul Nicolaides, partners of 17 years, were the first couple to be married there. The men took their vows at 12:05 a.m. before 40 friends and family members.

""We wanted to be first,"" Nicolaides said moments after saying ""I do.""

Zipprich and Nicolaides filed their application for a marriage license in the borough at 12:01 a.m. Friday so their midnight marriage would be possible.

Borough Clerk and Registrar Pam Borgi said she received the new template for same sex marriages licenses at 6:30 p.m. Friday.

""We had that window of opportunity, and we knew when we went to get our license that we might be getting our $28 dollars back,"" Zipprich said.

The same-sex license asks for the names of the spouses instead of bride and groom. Another difference: Gender identities such as male and female are replaced by Partner A and Partner B.

Red Bank Mayor Pasquale ""Pat"" Menna threw open the doors of Borough Hall for the ceremony to take place.

""It's an historic moment,"" Menna said. ""People want to be a part of history. This is so great that after midnight so many people showed up.""

Zipprich, 53, and Nicolaides, 49, were married by Colleen Mahr, the mayor of Fanwood, N.J., and also a close friend of the couple.

""I thought a lot about this moment. These marriages were not possible the day before, and it was special to bear witness to it,"" Mahr said.

Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince

A Michigan member of the Republican National Committee said Thursday he will not resign after posting an article critical of gay people on his Facebook page, despite calls from members of his own party that he step down. Dave Agema, who served as a state representative from 2007 until December posted an excerpt from an article titled ""Everyone Should Know These Statistics On Homosexuals"" on his Facebook page Wednesday. A group of 21 Michigan Republicans, including local precinct delegates and members of the University of Michigan College Republicans, has called it ""deplorable.""

The big problem Republicans face in trying to rebrand their party as more tolerant and inclusive is, of course, all the damn Republicans The so-called article was in fact just a particularly vile and hateful screed , claiming things like ""part of the homosexual agenda is to get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle,"" that gay Americans are obsessed with ""recruiting children"" and so forth. This also is a good representation of how the party base operates, which is to base all of their deep policy decisions on ""obviously insane stuff they read on Facebook."" Anyway, the Michigan party chair and Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus both had to come out with new statements about treating people with dignity and respect and so on, though I'm almost positive they just have a form letter for that by now.

How many of these stories have we had, just in the last few days? Priebus brags about a new effort to spend $10 million for outreach in minority communities, a number which probably is going to need to be doubled after Don Young's foul ""wetbacks"" comments on Thursday. He might get more bang for the buck if he spends that kind of money on Shutting Your Damn Trap lessons for all current members of the Republican hierarchy. Or not; it's not clear it's a lesson any of them could learn, no matter how much effort you put into it.

Conservatives are increasingly split on gay marriage

Annual conservative conference hosted a gay marriage discussion

Some Republicans say it is not a key issue for GOP voters

WASHINGTON — A day after advocating greater federal rights for same-sex couples, Republican mega-donor Foster Friess took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday and told the crowd, ""Chick-fil-A values are American values!""

That's fast food chain Chick-fil-A, which was the center of controversy last year when its president said in an interview that he supported ""traditional"" marriage.

Add gay rights to the list of issues Republicans are wrestling with at CPAC, where the libertarian strain of politics mixes with Christian conservatism, sometimes in the same person.

On Thursday, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman announced he now supports same-sex marriage; a pro-same sex marriage panel discussion drew a supportive crowd at CPAC; and Friess said in an interview that he felt the federal Defense of Marriage Act shouldn't restrict the right to inherit a gay partners' assets tax-free.

""I think it's unfair that people can't give assets to whoever they want,'' Friess told the news site BuzzFeed. ""When I die, my assets can go to my wife. And a gay person — you ought to have a system where maybe you can just say, 'You can give your assets to anybody you want.' ""

When Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke, he phrased the matter of gay marriage as an issue for states to decide, although he has previously said he opposes same-sex unions. ""Just because I believe that states should have the right to define marriage in a traditional way does not make me a bigot,'' he said — and got a big ovation. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another possible 2016 candidate who whipped up the crowd here, has also said he thinks the question belongs to the states and the federal government should not regulate marriage at all. Portman said he changed his views on the issue after his son told him he was gay.

The gay marriage discussion at the conference was not even an official CPAC event — instead it was hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an event sponsor.

""There are a few people in our movement who just don't like gay people. In 2013, that's just not OK any more,'' said Jimmy LaSalvia, founder of GOProud, a gay conservative organization that was not invited to CPAC but was included in the panel discussion.

The question is whether same-sex marriage rises to the level of a ""gateway issue"" — that is, whether opposition to same-sex marriage causes voters not to consider supporting Republicans.

Republican consultant Liz Mair cited an analysis of polling by Freedom to Marry, an organization supporting same-sex marriage, showing 51% of Republicans under age 30 support gay marriage. ""There's something that needs to be addressed here, and it needs to be addressed now,"" she said

LaSalvia told the CPAC crowd that the perception of intolerance ""contributes more to conservatives' image problem than anything else.""

In an interview, John Brabender, political consultant for former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who opposes same-sex marriage, says a focus on the issue would distract from Republicans' economic message.

""There's a segment of Republicans that probably has shifted on that,"" Brabender said. ""The mistake we can make is making this (issue) the core battle."" For most Americans, same-sex marriage is not a top issue, he says. For Republicans to focus on it — like focusing too much on maintaining corporate tax breaks — ""gives the sense to too many Americans that we don't care about their lives.""

Republican support of gay marriage might draw new supporters, National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg said during the panel discussion, but at a cost. ""You're going to have to show me where we're going to replace the 30 million evangelicals and social conservatives who will leave,"" if the party embraces gay marriage."

Rick Perry (R) stood before conservatives gathered at a Faith and Family Rally in Austin on Tuesday and spoke about what he perceives as a sustained attack on their values by gay rights activists.

“This is a very unsettling time in our nation’s history,” Perry said, according to the Associated Press. “These are the days when a person is vilified when they state that they believe fundamentally that marriage is between one man and one woman.”

Perry spoke just hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments on Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban. On Wednesday, the justices will consider a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

Perry went on to suggest that the decision by LGBT rights advocates to fight for equal treatment was proof that they were themselves intolerant.

“The underlying problem is that there is this very vocal, very litigious minority of Americans willing to legally attack anybody who dares utter a phrase or even a name that they don’t agree with,” he said. “In a twisting of logic, they insist on silencing the religious in the cause of tolerance. Now I ask you, where is the tolerance in that?”

The Austin American-Statesman reports that a heckler in the back of the crowd disagreed with Perry's remarks, yelling that the governor was finished politically.

Perry has been a consistent opponent of gay rights throughout his tenure as governor. He's supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and helped usher through a 2005 state ballot amendment that officially defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. During his 2012 GOP presidential campaign, Perry put his fight against gay rights front and center with a campaign ad that quickly became one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.

On Tuesday, Perry told reporters that Texas was ""fairly clear about where"" it stands on gay marriage.

""The people of the state of Texas, myself included, believe marriage is between one man and one woman,” Perry said, according to the Dallas Morning News."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/29/students-want-ben-carson-replaced-as-commencement-speaker-after-gay-marriage/,2013-03-29 00:00:00,[],Students want Ben Carson replaced as commencement speaker after gay marriage remarks,"Johns Hopkins students are campaigning to have Dr. Ben Carson pulled from this year's commencement speaker line-up, in response to comments the well-known neurosurgeon, a critic of the Obama administration, made about gay marriage.

Carson has since said he apologizes for having offended anyone and indicated he might withdraw from the commencement role, though he says his words are being misconstrued.

Carson -- who rocketed to political fame after criticizing President Obama's policies during the National Prayer Breakfast, which Obama attended -- made the gay marriage comments on Fox News Tuesday night.

Host Sean Hannity asked Carson his opinion on same-sex marriage, given the Supreme Court's consideration of two gay marriage cases this week.

""Marriage is between a man and a woman,"" Carson said. ""It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality -- it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition.""

Students accused Carson of effectively comparing ""gay relationships with pedophilia and bestiality.""

The Health and Human Rights Student Group began circulating a petition, linked out of its Facebook page, challenging Carson's selection as the 2013 commencement speaker for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

""At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education. Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers,"" the group said. ""Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation.""

The group cited his gay marriage comments, but also his comments at the National Prayer Breakfast -- Carson was hailed by conservatives, and even landed a speaking role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, for his remarks in February.

The commencement address may be in doubt.

Asked about the students' objections, Carson on Friday told MSNBC it's ""their day and the last thing I would want to do is rain on their parade.""

Asked whether he's told the university he would not deliver the address, Carson said he was ""waiting for appropriate channels.""

Carson also told the Baltimore Sun that people ""have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying.""

He added: ""Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone. But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/22/boycott-fever-targets-florida-ignores-other-stand-your-ground-states/,2013-07-22 00:00:00,[],"Zimmerman verdict spurs talk of Florida boycott, ignores other 'stand-your-ground' states","Black lawmakers and other groups are trying to harness outrage over the George Zimmerman verdict into a national indictment against the state of Florida, seeking to organize an Arizona-style boycott against everything from tourism to orange juice.

But there's one striking difference.

While Arizona had passed first-of-its kind legislation against illegal immigration when the uproar started over that state, Florida is hardly unique. At least 22 states have ""stand-your-ground"" laws -- which allow people to use deadly force to protect themselves often without any compulsion to retreat, and are at the center of the post-verdict controversy.

And in the case of Zimmerman, his attorneys didn't even use the law as part of their defense.

Some officials, like Attorney General Eric Holder, are calling for a review of all stand-your-ground laws. But those specifically backing a Florida boycott seem to be hinging their sudden distaste for the Sunshine State on the Zimmerman verdict -- which was reached by a jury of six people.

After civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called for people to ""isolate"" Florida, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio warned that the move would damage tourism and stoke more division in the country.

""Jesse Jackson has a history of saying outrageous things, divisive things. I would hope this would be a time when our country would come together and try to unite people and not divide people by saying things that are patently false and outrageous and offensive,"" he told MyFoxOrlando.com.

The boycott push comes following the not guilty verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch captain who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012.

The rush to wield the boycott hammer against the entire state's economy has caused hesitation among some Democrats. Maryland Rep. Donna Edwards told ""Fox News Sunday"" that such a move could be ""devastating"" to some communities in the state, though other members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- of which she is a part -- have taken up the call.

Such boycotts can, in fact, be very costly to states. When critics of the Arizona immigration law began canceling trips and conventions there in 2010, it cost millions.

The Center for American Progress issued a report finding that roughly $45 million in lodging revenue was lost in the four months after passage. When transportation, entertainment, retail and other business were factored in, the lost revenue added up to more than $140 million, according to the study.

Florida foes now see that kind of buying power as leverage to punish the state, a move that is prompting a social media battle between them and Florida's defenders.

Even the tourism-themed Visit Florida Facebook page has become a forum for online sniping over the verdict and stand-your-ground laws.

The latest post on the site -- one touting National Ice Cream Day -- almost immediately garnered the comment: ""not til they fix the law that helped kill trayvon martin.""

Another commenter posted ""good grief"" in response: ""Can't even enjoy a post about ICE CREAM and we have to read the negative comments about the SYG law.""

Those pushing for a boycott are doing what they can to make it a national movement.

MoveOn.org has gathered thousands of signatures on a petition backing a boycott, alleging the state is ""not a safe place to vacation.""

Members of California's Legislative Black Caucus also are weighing in. State Democratic Rep. Chris Holden said last week he planned to introduce a resolution calling for repeal of the stand-your-ground law -- in Florida -- while calling for a boycott in the meantime."

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who claimed earlier this year that he'd be willing to file articles of impeachment over Obama's gun control push, addressed the development in a statement, stressing that Nugent would be available for media interviews after Obama's speech.

""I am excited to have a patriot like Ted Nugent joining me in the House Chamber to hear from President Obama,"" the congressman said. ""After the address I'm sure Ted will have plenty to say.""

Nugent has been one of Obama's most inflammatory critics, taking an increasingly combative tone in the wake of the president's new push to reduce gun violence. He drew nationwide backlash for comments made last year in which he called for attendees at a National Rifle Association rally to ""ride into that battlefield and chop [Democrats'] heads off in November."" He also said he would be ""dead or in jail by this time next year"" if Obama is re-elected. The Secret Service later visited the entertainer and said they had resolved the issue, but an unbowed Nugent didn't tone down his rhetoric.

Speaking earlier this year about Obama's proposed measures to address gun violence, Nugent suggested that he and his buddies were prepared for an armed rebellion against an ""evil, dangerous"" Obama, whom he accused of preparing a broad plan to confiscate guns.

Stockman could end up having a lot on his plate on Tuesday evening, apart from any potential excitement provided by his guest. His office has also announced that the congressman will fact-check the president's address in real time over Twitter.

UPDATE: 4:10 p.m. -- Asked by the New York Times if he'd be armed at the State of the Union, Nugent said he planned to ""demilitarize"" before entering the Capitol.

AZ Gov. Jan Brewer, seen here doing her state proud

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on Monday signed legislation forcing municipalities to resell firearms from gun buy-back programs rather than destroy them, closing a loophole in the conservative state's laws. Brewer, a Republican and staunch gun rights advocate, signed the bill preventing local governments from melting down the weapons obtained from these popular civic events. Before the new law, the state had allowed such firearms to be destroyed.

You really have to hand it to Arizona Republicans. If your philosophy is that government can't possibly do anything right, it only makes sense that you'd spend all your time being willfully incompetent This had become a bit of a big deal in Arizona, because Arizona gun nuts saw all those guns getting taken off the streets and had a sad. Yes, we know America has been having issues of late, what with murdered kids and assassination attempts against congresspeople and the like, but won't somebody think of the guns? Those poor, lonely guns? How dare you give people cash for their guns, and then melt them down for scrap, you government monsters! That's like a gun abortion! You're all anti-murder gun murderers!

Or something. Anyway, now all that's solved with the brilliant new Arizona Republican plan. What Arizona will do from now on is hold gun buy-back programs to get guns off the streets, including (by nature of the events) potentially damaged or otherwise unsafe weapons that the owners want to get rid of because they are damaged or unsafe, and then sell them right back again for (presumably) less money because FISCAL RESPONSIBILITAH. Yes, of course it's stupid, but now it's the law. (It's very much akin to the equally brilliant Arizona idea to sell their own capitol building, then lease it back at a higher cost. Yes, they actually did that. The average IQ of Arizona Republicans is apparently only a fraction of the average Arizona daily temperature.)

So at long last, Arizona guns are safe again, and Arizona towns will find themselves in the very patriotic position of removing old and damaged weapons from their neighborhoods only to sell them right back again, and nothing can possibly go wrong from that. Now if you'll excuse Jan Brewer, she has to get a start on the newest conservative plan for Arizona. They're going to fill in the Grand Canyon to make the Colorado River easier to reach. They'll need a lot of dirt, of course, but don't worry—there's a lot of dirt down at the bottom of the Canyon already, so they reckon they'll just use that.

That is both the good news and the bad news for Republicans who are hoping to use Obamacare as their prime attack point in the 2014 congressional elections.

For the GOP, continuing glitches in the online delivery system for the new national healthcare market reinforce the argument that the Obama administration has tried to do too much, too fast without really understanding the enormity of the job. That is the upside for Republicans. The downside is that there is obviously a demand for the product Obamacare is trying to deliver and, by the time the election rolls around, millions of voters may have forgotten the website bugs. Instead, they may be pleased that healthcare coverage is no longer out of reach for them and they will not want to see it taken away by a Republican Congress.

Conversely, there are a large number of voters who are not especially happy with the healthcare reforms. Many people who buy their own health insurance have been told their old policies are being discontinued and they must buy a more expensive alternative. Others have found their new insurance does not allow them to continue with the same medical care provider. They are upset now; will they still be angry next November?

My friend Mark might be. He is one of those who is seeing his healthcare rates spike. Mark got a letter from his insurance company a few weeks ago stating that, because of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the cost of his coverage would almost triple. He went online to look for a better deal in the marketplace but could not find a plan that offered any savings. Then, a few days ago, his insurance company sent another letter announcing they had miscalculated; his rate was still going up, but not by nearly as much.

Mark’s conclusion, fair or not, echoes the suspicion many people have: The insurance companies are using Obamacare as an excuse to jack up rates and increase their profits.

On the other side of the ledger, there’s a young man I know named Daniel. He is a college student, too old to be on his parents’ plan, too lacking in income to buy his own coverage -- until now. Sunday, Dan signed up online. It took him just 45 minutes (he could have done it in under a half hour if he had not needed to track down an elusive number connected to his student loans). Lucky for him he is in a state with a smoothly operating exchange. Even luckier, he now has healthcare coverage and, because of his income level, does not have to pay a cent.

The rough reality is that people like Mark are paying more so that people like Daniel can get the healthcare they could not afford before Obamacare kicked in. Plenty of folks, especially Republicans, would insist this is not fair. But consider what the alternative has been.

A couple of years ago, Daniel suffered an appendicitis attack. Fortunately, he was rushed to a hospital and got immediate, expert care. He also got a bill for $30,000 that he could not pay. So, as hospitals have done for many years when giving care to those who could not afford insurance, they waived the huge fee and recouped the loss by billing other patients and their insurance companies at excessive rates.

Will that change now that nearly everyone will be insured? Will costs come down and benefit everyone? Will the complexities of the new healthcare system continue to be a source of glitches, goof ups and aggravation or will it all smooth out over time? Will Americans understand that those of us who are healthy and better off financially have always subsidized the cost of caring for those who are ill and poor and that this new system is an attempt to rationalize that process?

Since those questions and many more have yet to be answered, no one can really say if Republicans will be able to ride the anti-Obamacare bandwagon to victory next fall. By betting against universal healthcare, they might just as easily prove to be big losers."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-mocks-gop-crazy-obamacare-predictions-164348603--finance.html,,[],Obama mocks GOP for 'crazy' Obamacare predictions,"LARGO, Maryland (AP) — With just five days to go before Americans can begin signing up for health care under his signature law, President Barack Obama on Thursday ridiculed Republican opponents for ""crazy"" doomsday predictions of the impact and forecast that even those who didn't vote for him are going to enroll.

With polls showing many Americans still skeptical of the law known as ""Obamacare,"" the president went back to the basics of explaining how nearly 50 million uninsured Americans will be able to buy coverage in new government-run exchanges while mocking Republicans for trying to block its implementation. ""The closer we get, the more desperate they get,"" Obama argued.

""The Republican party has just spun itself up around this issue,"" Obama said. ""And the fact is the Republicans' biggest fear at this point is not that Affordable Care Act will fail. What they're worried about is it's going to succeed.""

House Republicans are inserting provisions that undermine the health care law into a short-term spending measure needed to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1 and into legislation that would increase the government's borrowing ability, which the Treasury says will hit its limit in mid-October.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday that Obama is trying to sell the law to a skeptical public.

""It must be frustrating for the president that folks seem to keep tuning out all the happy talk anyway,"" McConnell said. ""This law is a mess. It needs to go. It's way past time to start over.""

Obama won loud applause from a friendly audience at Prince George's Community College in the Washington suburbs when he vowed that he wouldn't let Republicans block the law. ""We are going to see it through. The Affordable Care Act is here,"" Obama said.

The six-month enrollment period for the exchanges starts Tuesday, with consumers in most of the country able to comparison shop between plans online. The Obama administration needs millions of Americans — especially young, healthy people — to sign up in order to keep costs low for everyone.

Story continues

The White House said Prince George's County, Md., has a high rate of uninsured, with about 16 percent of residents under 65 without insurance. Obama's audience was full of the young people he is targeting for enrollment.

Obama acknowledged there would be glitches in getting the exchanges up and running, and even as he was speaking administration officials were quietly telling key interest groups to expect initial problems signing up online for coverage. Small businesses will not be able to enroll online starting Oct. 1 when new health insurance markets go live and will have to enroll by paper, and the Spanish-language version of its healthcare.gov website will be not be ready to handle enrollments for a few weeks. An estimated 10 million Latinos are eligible for coverage.

Three-and-a-half years after Obama signed the bill into law, his nearly hourlong speech showed he's still having to educate consumers about what will be available to them and convince them to sign up. He predicted success once people learn they can save money or get insurance for the first time.

""Even if you didn't vote for me, I'll bet you'll sign up for that health care plan,"" Obama said.

Obama said Republicans want ""to shut this thing down before people find out that they like it.""

Obama didn't call out any of his Republican opponents by name, but he laughingly taunted some of their arguments. He mentioned House Speaker John Boehner's prediction right before the bill was signed into law in March 2010 that ""Armageddon"" was impending. He quoted Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who said earlier this month that ""Obamacare is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress."" He cited Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's appeal to colleagues on the House floor six months ago to ""repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.""

And he quoted New Hampshire state Rep. Bill O'Brien's declaration in August that Obamacare is ""a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850."" That was met by a chorus of gasps and boos from the largely black audience.

""Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back,"" Obama said. ""I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up.

""All this would be funny if it wasn't so crazy,"" Obama said."

This, apparently, is Mr. Weatherford's definition of The Golden Rule

In the morning speech explaining his resistance to expanding health coverage for the poor, Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, told the House and Senate, meeting in a joint session on the Legislature’s opening day, about his family’s circumstances when he was 15 and his brother, Peter, age 2, died of cancer after surgeries and a year’s worth of treatment had drained the family’s savings. His father, who was self-employed, and his mother, who home-schooled the family’s nine children, faced a “mountain of medical bills,” Weatherford, 33, said. The family was uninsured. “It was the safety net that picked my family up,” Weatherford said. “I will continue to believe in – and fight for – a strong safety net for Florida.” Hours after his speech, when asked to expand on his story, Weatherford told reporters that his family didn’t receive Medicaid.

Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford is a rising star in conservative political circles. Yesterday, the 33-year-old Republican appeared to burnish those credentials, receiving a standing ovation after delivering a passionate speech decrying Gov. Rick Scott's decision to take advantage of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. The Palm Beach Post reports Weatherford initially said he didn't know precisely who paid for the care, but later in the day a staffer soon told The Palm Beach Post that the cost had been written off by medical professionals as charity care. That story supported the premise of Weatherford's argument: Instead of expanding money pits like Medicaid, Florida should fight for the safety net that helped his family when it was in need.

As you'll see below the fold, the only problem with the story is that it wasn't true."

The site’s homepage now carries a direct link to the state insurance exchange Covered California, as well as more prominent links to Covered California on the “Learn More” tab and the “I don’t have insurance” tab.

Opponents of the Affordable Care Act never stop producing new tricks to undermine the reform’s effectiveness. But leave it to California Republicans to reach for the bottom. Their goal appears to be to discredit the act by highlighting its costs and penalties rather than its potential benefits.

The device chosen by the Assembly’s GOP caucus is a website at the address coveringhealthcareca.com. If that sounds suspiciously like coveredca.com, which is the real website for the California insurance exchange, it may not be a coincidence. Bogus insurance websites have sprung up all over, aiming to steer consumers away from legitimate enrollment services. Just a couple of weeks ago California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris shut down 10 bogus insurance sites, some of them with names very similar to the real thing. She must have overlooked the GOP’s entry.

To be fair, the California GOP announced its website in August. But some members have recently stepped up their promotion of the site. The site has a featured spot, for example, on the homepage of Assembly Republican Leader Connie Conway (R-Tulare). Conway’s spokeswoman, Sabrina Lockhart, says other members may be pointing their constituents to the site “as a resource” to help them navigate the new law.

If that’s so, constituents needing useful information about how to deal with the Affordable Care Act would be well advised to look elsewhere. As an aid to understanding and navigating the Affordable Care Act’s new requirements and opportunities for coverage, the GOP site is worse than useless. Finding a link there to the Covered California website, which after all is the main place residents can go to obtain insurance in the individual market, is a chore -- there isn’t a link to it at all on the GOP page.

Instead, you’re offered links labeled “I already have health insurance,” “I don’t have health insurance,” or “I’m an employer.” The second link, which presumably covers most residents looking for help through the act, leads to a page dominated by a calculator for the penalties imposed for not buying insurance -- not exactly what you need if you’re already looking for insurance. If you have the patience, you can find a link to Covered California toward the bottom of the page.

As for the quality of information provided on the site, it’s questionable; that’s a charitable way of saying that some of it is dead wrong.

For example, the website claims that the Affordable Care Act will increase the federal deficit, asserting that the “non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in a March 2012 report that coverage expenses under the Affordable Care Act will cost the country a total of $1.76 trillion total by 2022 and add over $1 trillion to the federal deficit.”

Is that so? The site links to this report by the CBO, which states on page 2 that the act will “on net, reduce budget deficits over the 2012–2021 period.” Get it? Reduce the deficit, not add to it. The GOP’s nasty trick is to consider only the costs of coverage, without netting out the cost reductions and new revenues in the law. Oh, by the way, the CBO also projects that the ACA will reduce the number of uninsured people in the United States by more than 30 million. That’s a plus, by most reckoning.

The GOP website’s digest of recent news articles is led, at the moment, by a Wall Street Journal op-ed by a San Diego businesswoman who claimed to be one of Obamacare’s “losers.” As we pointed out in this closer look at her story, her life may well be saved by the Affordable Care Act’s outlawing of insurance exclusions for preexisting conditions. (She’s a cancer survivor.)

One can certainly sympathize with the California GOP’s desire to become relevant again to the lives of Californians, who have all but voted the party out of existence in the Golden State. Given that California is one of the real bright spots in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, one might think that the state’s Republicans would recognize its value to voters, instead of trying to fill their constituents’ heads with irrelevancies, misinformation, and misrepresentations. One would be wrong."

If you spend any time watching cable news networks you've seen Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-FL)attempt to whip up grassroots support for his increasingly unpopular defund Obamacare campaign. True to the teabagger audience Cruz is aiming for, this ad is as full of lies as every other attack they've made on the law.fact checker counts the ways

First up, this statement from the ad: ""Democratic Senator Max Baucus, the lead author of Obamacare, says it’s a huge train wreck.""



Ever since the Montana senator, a key writer of the bill, uttered the phrase “huge train wreck” during an April 17 budget hearing, his words have become a major GOP talking point. But Baucus’s comment has been taken out of context—and he has since said that his concerns have been addressed. [...] In other words, no more train wreck. In fact, contrary to Cruz’s suggestion, Baucus is still highly supportive of the law. [...] Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Baucus’s new stance “makes no difference, it’s what he said. We still agree with his original assertion that it’s a train wreck.”

Well, of course new facts make no difference to Cruz, just like old facts don't make any difference. Facts in general aren't really a priority for the guy. Why should they be a priority? You obviously don't need them to get elected to statewide office in Texas.

Cruz also says in the ad, ""The president is quietly granting Obamacare waivers to big corporations,"" citing a New York Times article that doesn't focus on waivers. As Kessler points out, the article the ad is misusing is about the delay the administration announced in implementing the employer mandate in the law. Not a waiver, a delay. Yeah, facts again.

Finally, Cruz leaps on statements by Teamsters President James Hoffa and other union leaders, saying that even big labor admits that the law will ""destroy the foundation of the 40-hour week that is the backbone of the American middle class."" It's true that labor officials, while praising the law's ultimate goals, have complained about the possibility that employers will cut worker's hours to avoid the law. That's part of what the delay in the employer mandate was all about, giving employers more time to figure this out. But so far the only evidence for that comes from a few highly publicized and politicized claims by big employers, nothing more.

So, it's official, according to the Washington Post. Ted Cruz is a big, fat liar. Not that you need the WaPo to tell you that. All you need is to see Ted Cruz open his mouth."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/14/Ryan-We-Demanded-Individual-Mandate-Delay-on-Obamacare,2013-10-14 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Ryan: We Demanded Individual Mandate Delay on Obamacare,"Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), chair of the House Budget Committee, told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Monday morning that House Republicans had demanded a one-year delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, along with an end to congressional exemptions, while offering a six-week debt ceiling hike to allow room for negotiations on broader budget issues. The offer was made to President Barack Obama last Thursday.

President Obama, said Ryan, listened but declined to respond. In the meantime, Ryan said, it became clear the president was negotiating separately to obtain more favorable terms from Senate Republicans, trying to “jam” the House Republicans in the process. Ryan told Sykes that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had “overplayed their hand” in attempting to prolong the crisis to maximize political damage to Republicans.

Ryan described the delay to the individual mandate as an “obvious” step to take, given that technical issues with the Obamacare exchanges might prevent the mandate from being enforced at all. “We could have spent the weekend putting an agreement together that says we’re gonna deal with the debt, we’re gonna deal with this economy, and we’re gonna fix these big flaws in Obamacare, or at least give people delays in these penalties.”

Instead, he said, the President and his party had declined, believing that they had a “partisan advantage.” In response to new demands from Democrats to cancel the sequester cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, Ryan declared: “We are not going to give on these spending numbers.” He said that there were some areas of agreement on changes to entitlements, but that Democrats wanted to spend more money and preserve Obamacare.

Ryan said that he believed the strategy of attempting to defund Obamacare had been a mistake, because the government shutdown would not have prevented Obamacare from being implemented. “It’s an autopilot spending program,” he said, saying that the idea Obamacare could be defunded was a “false impression.” He added, however, that the focus needed to shift to the damage Obamacare was causing to consumers and the economy.

“I do believe that we can still get some changes made to Obamacare that help provide some relief to working Americans,” Ryan said. He was optimistic that the House would craft a workable plan for avoiding default following a meeting of the GOP caucus on Monday evening. “I didn’t go to Congress to kick the can,” he said, noting that his biggest fear was that “a handful of Republicans” in the Senate would join Democrats to “jam” the House."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/07/georgia-obamacare_n_4400772.html,2013-12-07 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Top Georgia Democrat Fights To Prove Obamacare Can Overcome Deep South Resistance,"WASHINGTON -- For Democrats like Stacey Abrams, Georgia's House minority leader, advocating for the Affordable Care Act in a strongly conservative state is a daunting task. Her Republican colleagues, who control the state legislature, are staunch opponents of the law, and Gov. Nathan Deal is one of 20 GOP governors who rejected the Medicaid expansion.

That alone would seem like enough for state Rep. Abrams and her Democratic colleagues to tackle, but it doesn't end there. Last month, U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, another Georgia Republican, chaired a congressional oversight hearing in Gainesville during which a handful of cherry-picked witnesses spoke only of being harmed by the health care law.

Georgia is also home to Ralph Hudgens, the Republican state insurance commissioner who drew sharp criticism this week when a camera caught him likening pre-existing conditions to a car wreck in which the driver is at fault. Hudgens also bragged to a crowd of fellow Republicans in August about GOP efforts to destroy the law.

""Let me tell you what we’re doing [about Obamacare]: everything in our power to be an obstructionist,"" Hudgens said.

But despite the litany of obstacles facing Obamacare in her state, Abrams said that Georgians are ""hungry for information"" on what the law means for them and how they can sign up. She has made it her mission to bring that directly to them, by leading events explaining the Affordable Care Act to people across Georgia, many of whom have spent decades waiting for access to health insurance.

""What we have is that people are hungry for information. They desperately want to know what's going on,"" Abrams told The Huffington Post in an interview Thursday. ""They want to know how this impacts them because they realize, whether they're Democrat or Republican, they are going to be held accountable for getting health insurance.""

""But even more importantly, they want it,"" she added. ""A lot of the communities we're speaking to have been denied access to health care either because of cost or because of pre-existing conditions or because they didn't have an option.""

Since August, Abrams and her colleagues have reached out to discuss Obamacare on 40 occasions, from town hall meetings to teleconferences. Unlike most local events with state legislators, Abrams said empty seats are hard to come by at the Obamacare forums, prompting her to extend the activities through January.

""A big part of it is how we frame it. There isn't the hostility to us sharing this information,"" she said, noting that their primary objective is to arm individuals with information about the law, not to discuss its politics.

A typical event consists of legislators translating the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, down to such basics as explaining deductibles and co-pays to individuals who have never had health insurance before. Now that the functionality of Healthcare.gov has improved, Abrams and her team have launched ""Enrollment Saturdays"" for people to come in and access both the technology and the human navigators who can help them sign up on the health care exchange.

States such as Texas and California have adopted similar outreach tactics, underscoring how critical on-the-ground operations are to meeting the law's primary objective of expanding coverage to the uninsured.

Abrams conceded the problems that plagued the Obamacare rollout over the last couple of months, including the website glitches and the news of canceled policies, left people disappointed and ""didn't help matters at all."" She and her colleagues spent a great deal of time in their early events directing constituents to the telephone hotline rather than the website, but added that the struggles haven't dissuaded people from wanting to sign up.

""People get sick and they want to get care,"" she said. ""The challenges with the rollout did not change what for some people has been a 10-, 20- or 30-year wait to actually have access to health care. This is a miracle for them.""

Early data for November has shown a surge in the number of enrollments, although the White House is still lagging behind its target of 7 million by the March 31, 2014, deadline.

As part of ongoing efforts to boost enrollment, the administration gathered state legislators from across the country Wednesday for a briefing on the Obamacare exchanges. Abrams was in attendance and shared her story, which was met with loud applause, according to a senior administration official.

The White House meeting also focused on the law's Medicaid expansion, which Georgia Gov. Deal refused on the grounds that his state can't afford it -- even though his decision will cost Georgia nearly $3 billion in lost funding by 2022. Supporters of the law point out that the federal government will cover the entire cost of the expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share declines until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and future years.

A study released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, titled ""Nobody Wins,"" detailed the impact on states where governors rejected the Medicaid expansion. ""There are no states where the taxpayers would actually gain by not expanding Medicaid,"" Sherry Glied, lead author on the study, told USA Today.

Georgia falls into the category of states whose residents are most in need of the Medicaid expansion. An estimated additional 410,000 would qualify in Georgia, where gaps in coverage abound.

Financial pressures in states where Medicaid wasn't expanded have also put many public hospitals at risk, including as many as 15 facilities in Georgia. Just this year, hospitals in Folkston, Richland and Arlington, three of the state's rural towns, permanently closed their doors.

Abrams hopes such events will put public pressure on Gov. Deal to reverse his decision.

""If we say no to the Medicaid expansion, we are saying yes to shutting down our hospitals,"" she said."

Sens. Mike Lee%2C Ted Cruz and other lawmakers to rally Sept. 10 on Capitol Hill

Effort to withhold funding for health care law divides Republicans

President Obama%2C Senate Democrats likely to block any attempt to deny funds for law

WASHINGTON — As the summer recess for Congress heads to a close, Tea Party groups are trying to pressure Republicans to withhold funding to implement President Obama's health care law this fall.

A cross-country anti-""Obamacare"" tour that began Tuesday highlights a divide among Republicans, with some key House and Senate leaders trying to avoid a government shutdown that could damage the party and label the GOP as obstructionist ahead of the 2014 elections.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calls the idea of blocking funding for the health care law a ""non-starter,"" and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., says the prospect of shutting down the government over the law is the ""dumbest idea"" he has ever heard.

On the other side are rank-and-file lawmakers, many of them elected with Tea Party support in 2010, who want to thwart Obama's signature domestic achievement before key provisions take effect. They say they won't support any bill to fund the government that doesn't bar spending for the health care law.

""There's a real concern about the lack of courage of folks who don't want to stand up to something,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a proponent of denying funds for the law. ""Sometimes you just have to do the right thing — that should be more important than winning the next election.""

Oct. 1 is the launch date for open enrollment under the health care law and the date when health insurance exchanges in states will begin to help people find and buy insurance coverage.

That date coincides with the start of the new fiscal year. If Congress doesn't pass a temporary resolution funding the government or adopt year-long spending bills to fund federal agencies, then a shutdown would occur.

It is hard to see success for the anti-Obamacare effort. The Supreme Court last year upheld the constitutionality of the insurance mandate. The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass any legislation blocking funding, and President Obama won't sign any measure that does so.

Tea Party groups, led by For America and the Tea Party Patriots, believe their push will help attract grass-roots support and pressure some Republicans. ""This may well be the last opportunity to pull the law back,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. ""If we don't … stop spending on the law, the law may become completely cemented.""

The Tea Party groups started Tuesday with a news conference in Lexington, Ky., in the backyard of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. An event will be held Wednesday in Austin to get the attention of Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader. Sarah Palin, a Tea Party favorite and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, endorsed the Tea Party strategy Tuesday.

The effort culminates with a Capitol Hill rally on Sept. 10 featuring Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas.

Cornyn's spokesman says the Texas senator, who is up for re-election next year, is not unsympathetic to concerns about the health care law. ""Sen. Cornyn has been fighting Obamacare tooth and nail for the better part of four years,"" said Drew Brandewie, a Cornyn spokesman.

That's not enough for the Tea Party groups. Martin wants McConnell and Cornyn to sign on to a letter saying they will not support a resolution to fund the government or any appropriations bill if it includes money for the health care law. At least a dozen Republicans have either signed the letter circulated by Lee or publicly stated their support.

Eighty House Republicans — representing more than one-third of House GOP members — recently sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner saying they support withholding government funds for the health care law.

Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said the Tea Party approach could be effective on someone like Cornyn, who must balance home-state interests with his duties as a national Republican leader. ""Constituents look at House and Senate leaders as potentially compromised by their institutional responsibilities,"" Jillson said.

Democrats say the GOP's divide on Obama's health care law helps them.

""The Republican Party is fighting an all-out civil war,"" said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which ""will ultimately prevent them from taking the majority next year.""

the move comes as a surprise coming from a governor who has insisted he won’t implement the Obamacare reforms, and who slammed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for touting the law during a trip to the Lone Star State earlier this month. “With due respect, the secretary and our president are missing the point: It’s not that Americans don’t understand Obamacare, it’s that we understand it all too well,” Perry said at the time. “In Texas, we’ve been fighting Obamacare from the beginning, refusing to expand a broken Medicaid system and declining to set up a state health insurance exchange.” [Source]

More than 25 percent of Texas residents are uninsured. No one would believe that in the home of one of the best medical centers in the world (Texas Medical Center), that over one quarter of its population do not have insurance and receive substandard medical coverage. It won’t be long before the Texas medical establishment forces the hand of Texas politicians as they lose billions to other states.

The Texas Republican governor and legislature have done nothing to solve Texas health insurance problem. They have not offered alternatives to the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act nor have they done anything to provide incentives to control the cost of health insurance.

This should really not be a surprise. Gov. Perry has a habit of speaking out against federal government handouts in public even as he begs for government handouts behind the scene. When the fertilizer plant exploded in West, Texas, a private company that was privy to virtually no state regulations, he vehemently complained when his requests for government handouts were initially denied.

The Affordable Care Act will be a marked improvement to the current state of the health insurance market in the United States. In fact in the states that have been proactive in adopting all aspects of Obamacare, it is proving very successful. Instead of running around the country maligning the new law, Perry should stay in Texas and fix its many problems that are undermining the Texas working middle class even as the Texas wealthy do well."

There is no doubt whatsoever about what Republicans, personified by Ralph Hudgens, are doing here. They are using and abusing the powers they possess in order to sabotage this law.

We can compare their behavior to that of Democrats after the passage of Medicare Part D—championed by George W. Bush. Democrats, although most of them opposed the law, engaged in no such attempts to sabotage its rollout. They fought on the floor of the House and Senate, but once they lost, they accepted that the law is the law in a democracy. But that's not how Republicans operate.

Perhaps the most egregious and potentially effective measure in the effort to obstruct Obamacare comes out of the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week submitted a request for a huge amount of irrelevant information from navigators—the people whose job it is to guide and educate citizens about how Obamacare can work for them. The fact that Republicans at the state and federal level have focused on throwing up roadblocks in the way of the navigators shows just how important they will be to the success of Obamacare.

The request from the Energy and Commerce Committee came in less than a month before the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges go live on Oct. 1, and serves no purpose other than to drain time, energy and resources away from navigators in the run-up to that date. Of course, the Committee has largely targeted states where the highest percentage of the population lacks insurance. In case you were wondering, yes, Texas is the worst offender. Go conservatism!

Law professor and health reform advocate Timothy Jost had this to say about the House's efforts:

Look at item 6 and the accompanying sheet defining documents subject to the request. This could include hundreds of documents and emails and could take days to locate and compile. It might have been reasonable to ask them to describe what they do and how they intend to do it. This is a much more intrusive and extensive request. It is also important to note that most of these organizations are doing this on a comparative shoestring, and this is the busiest time in their existence. They just got their grants, they are concluding cooperative agreements with HHS, they are hiring, training their employees, getting them certified, setting up security systems, making contacts, and even to have to take a day off to respond to this is too much. And the committee knows this. This is not about gathering information. It is about trying to stop a program. (Emphasis mine)

The time has come to put a stop to these kinds of actions. The Republicans have taken a power that is designed to be applied reasonably and judiciously, namely Congress' authority to oversee the executive branch, and abused it beyond recognition. They have twisted that authority into an instrument to defy democracy, to render null the laws passed by the people's elected representatives.

This abuse cannot be allowed to stand. It is a perversion of democracy. The time has come to fight back. What can we do about it? If I were the president, I'd want to do whatever was in my power to fight back. And here's my idea:

Yes, Congress has the power to issue these demands for information. There is no limit on their oversight power, other than that they cannot violate a citizen's civil liberties. In fact, if the navigators do not comply, they can be held in contempt of Congress, a federal charge. Fine. But the President can checkmate this move with one of his own.

The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, describes the President's power to pardon, according to which he or she:



shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.

There is no other limit on that power. The president can issue a pardon as soon as a crime has been committed, there is no need to wait for any charges to be brought.

President Obama should announce that:



1) The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee to the Obamacare navigators is nothing more than a blatant attempt to prevent Americans from obtaining health insurance. 2) The request is part of a broader Republican scheme to sabotage Obamacare -- which is the law of the land. 3) The request is an abuse of power, plain and simple. Our government cannot function properly if one side is allowed to abuse its power in order to prevent duly enacted laws from functioning properly.

The president should declare that, for these reasons, he authorizes all the targeted parties to ignore the request from the House of Representatives. Furthermore, he will issue immediate, full, and complete pardons to anyone that the House attempts to prosecute for ignoring their request, or any other similar requests that the President deems equally abusive and designed to sabotage duly passed laws.

This would be a serious step, and it is not one I advocate lightly. Of course, Barack Obama wouldn't the first president to try and get around a congressional subpoena. We are talking about something different here, however, than what George W. Bush did. Congressional oversight is about checks and balances, making sure that no branch of government gains too much power. The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee is part of an attempt by one party to undo legislation even though it lacks the votes to do so. If they succeed, there will be no point to even having elections. What I have proposed is a defensive measure, one that fights fire with fire rather than something designed to cover up misdeeds.

When one side keeps punching below the belt, the other side eventually has no choice but to do whatever it can to defend itself. In this case, the White House would be defending its signature law, which really means defending the people who wouldn't be able to get health insurance without it. Furthermore, the president would be defending democracy against an opponent that has shown time and again that it does not care how it obtains power.

The Marquess of Queensbury and his rules ain't welcome at this contest. It's a street fight. It's time for the White House to get ugly. Long past time.

The question for President Obama is the same one the Chicago beat cop put to the G-Man in The Untouchables:

What are you prepared to do?

In Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and more recently in North Africa, I’ve met many, many people who are trying to figure out how to translate that elusive concept “the will of the people” into the practical matters of government: taxation, public spending, defense, law and order, garbage collection. Over and over again, I’ve watched them construct institutions designed to translate the mystical into the practical: parliaments, presidencies, court systems. Sooner or later, they all learn that the act of voting is a necessary but insufficient component of democracy. Without legitimate representative and executive institutions — bodies that can translate the will of the people into concrete policies — democracy always fails.

From my perch overseas, I’ve also been watching the run-up to the government shutdown in Washington. At times, I have tried to explain it to bemused foreigners. Many of them think, mistakenly, that Americans are having an argument about the budget or the deficit. I have to put them straight: This is an attempt by one part of the U.S. political system to use the budgetary process to stop the implementation of a single law, the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). If my interlocutors come from democratic countries, they then look puzzled.

If they read the commentary pouring out of Washington, they are even more confused, as am I. What surprises — and shocks — me is how many people who have written, blogged or self-righteously tweeted about the results of various polls on these events, as if they matter. Do 47 percent of Americans oppose Obamacare? Do 73.7 percent oppose Obamacare? Do 97 percent of Republicans hate Obamacare even more than they hate death and taxes? Who cares? In a functioning democracy, it doesn’t matter what the majority happens to think at any given moment. What matters is what the legitimate, representative, legal institutions have already decided.

I am not an expert on the economics of health care, so I don’t know whether the Affordable Care Act is ultimately going to be good or bad for the United States. I am very glad that it will help poor, uninsured Americans get access to doctors, hospitals and medicine. I’m worried that it may be too expensive and will further extend U.S. indebtedness.

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

But I also recognize that, at this point, what I think doesn’t matter. The Affordable Care Act passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by the president. It was confirmed by the Supreme Court. The president who sponsored the health-care reform was then sent back to the White House after an election during which that reform was a major topic of debate.

Obamacare is the law, as confirmed by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of our political system. A portion of one of those branches is not now legally or morally empowered to change that law by holding other parts of the government hostage, no matter how strongly its members or their constituents feel. So how is it possible that so many Americans, including some who have been elected to Congress, no longer understand this principle, which is fundamental to our political system and vital to the functioning of democracies? I repeat: Democracy is not designed to reflect majority opinion. It is designed to filter majority opinion through legitimate institutions and to translate it, through agreed procedures, into policy.

Plenty of people outside the United States understand how strange this debate has become. A couple of days ago, an American Egyptian (@salamamoussa) tweeted that it was “Impressive how everyone in #US follows the law even in the face of extreme political vandalism by an irrational fringe. #Egypt.” I think he meant this comment ironically, but actually, he was right. In many parts of the world — Egypt, for example — members of the “irrational fringe” who tried to subvert the political system by overturning a law already confirmed by three branches of government would be called “insurgents” or “coup plotters,” and their behavior would lead to arrest, prison or worse.

But because Americans, even irrational Americans, no longer use violence to achieve their goals, and because this process is still — just barely — taking place within the boundaries of those institutions and because the protagonists still observe the language — if not always the spirit — of the law, the result is peaceful. That is indeed impressive. But it is a narrow achievement.

Americans are paying a high price for this week’s events. The cost of shutting down the federal government, for a few days or even a few weeks, pales in comparison to the damage done to the credibility of the United States abroad — and the credibility of democracy itself.

(CNN) —

The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work.

Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance.

The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.

But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans – those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance.

Officials announced Thursday that 700,000 people have applied for insurance plans in both the 36 states that are using a federally run health care exchange and the 14 states running their own exchanges.

Obamacare website ‘fixable’ by end of November

But don’t apply that 700,000 application figure to the 7 million enrollment goal. For starters, there’s no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan.

And those 700,000 applications include Medicaid enrollments.

Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance.

As the law was originally envisioned, more than half of the uninsured people in the United States – 24 million or so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation – who would be getting insurance through Obamacare would have been getting Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level – about $27,000 for a family of four – isn’t eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, so Medicaid is effectively their only option.

So it’s not necessarily a bad thing if more than half of the people getting insurance under Obamacare so far are getting Medicaid. But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.

Related: Finger-pointing over Obamacare

Should it be alarming that so many of these 700,000 new applications are people trying to get Medicaid and not private insurance?

Not yet, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

“There’s nothing in what we’ve seen to suggest anything like that,” he said. “Whether you’re able to be eligible for Medicaid or not is totally dependent on your income.”

But he did admit “Some of the numbers we’ve seen, preliminary, early numbers, do seem a little out of whack.”

But he said there’s a reason for that.

“In these small handful of states, they’re aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid,” Salo said.

Salo pointed to people who the states already know are on food stamps receiving some other kind of state or locally funded health program.

“You know who they are, you know what their income is, you know they’re OK accepting government benefits. If you go after these guys, there should be no surprise that these people are being enrolled.”

Also, in some states, Medicaid coverage starts immediately, meaning there may be more of an incentive to enroll early because you get coverage sooner than on the private market where no matter when you enroll in the first two and a half months coverage still starts on January 1.

In Arkansas they’ve insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1. But in a novel twist they’re doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.

Related: Obamacare more than a phone call away

And Oregon has been approved to use food stamps and other metrics as a prequalifier for Medicaid enrollment. So the state sent letters to uninsured welfare recipients that detailed simple steps to enroll in Medicaid – i.e. just sign a form and mail it back or call a hotline. This has resulted in tens of thousands of enrollees. But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance. It’s the one state that elected to fix the glitches in its website before going live.

It may very well be that not enough people – particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy – are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.

But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/27/Cns-open-revolt-house,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],CNS News: House Members in Open Revolt,"CNS News is reporting that a group of 21 House members have sent a letter to all GOP Senators, warning them against a cloture vote on the Continuing Resolution. A vote on cloture would give Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) the ability to remove the defunding Obamacare provision included in the CR. The House conservatives who signed the letter stated that they consider a cloture vote the same as a vote in support of Obamacare.

“it is highly likely that Majority Leader Harry Reid will move to amend the House-passed CR and remove the language from the bill that defunds Obamacare before sending it back to the House. “As you are also aware,” the conservatives wrote, “such a motion can only proceed if three-fifths of the Senate invokes cloture and allows this amendment process to begin. Simply put, the only chance that Senator Reid has to pursue this course of action is if six or more Republican Senators join the Democrats in voting to invoke cloture. “Therefore,” the House conservatives said to every Republican senator, “it shall be our policy to regard any cloture vote that gives Senator Reid a green light to reinstate Obamacare into this CR the same as a vote for Obamacare itself.”

The cloture vote will come today and requires 60 votes. It will allow debate to end on the Continuing Resolution and proceed to toward a final vote. Reid controls 54 votes, while the GOP has 46 so should the Senate GOP stand together the cloture vote would be stalled. According to Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), who authored the letter, “until Harry Reid guarantees a 60-vote threshold on any amendment including his amendment to add back Obamacare” the Senate GOP should vote against cloture. Otherwise a simple majority of the Senate could vote to continue Obamacare funding.

It is unlikely Reid would use the Senate rule requiring 60 votes on amendments to the CR.

Signers of the letter include: Dave Schweikert (R.-AZ), Charles Boustany, M.D. (R.-LA ), John Culberson (R.-TX ), Steve King (R.-IA), Ted Yoho DVM (R.-FL ), Thomas Massie (R.-KY), Lynn Westmoreland (R.- GA), Jack Kingston (R.-GA), Jeff Duncan (R.-SC), Paul Broun M.D. (R.-GA ), Ron DeSantis (R.-FL), Michele Bachmann (R.-MN), Matt Salmon (R.-AZ), Steve Stockman (R.-TX), Louie Gohmert (R.-TX), Walter Jones (R.-NC), Scott Garrett (R.-NJ), Scott Perry (R.-PA), Mark Meadows (R.-NC), Tim Huelskamp (R.-KS).

House GOP leaders voted early Sunday to delay implementation of Obamacare for one year

Senate Democrats and President Obama oppose any attempt to dismantle the law

The government will shutdown on Tuesday if no stopgap spending bill is enacted

WASHINGTON — Congress moved the nation closer to a government shutdown on Tuesday as House Republicans voted early Sunday 231-192 to advance a stopgap spending measure to delay implementation of President Obama's health care law for one year.

""We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown,"" House GOP leaders said in a joint statement.

The House voted just past midnight ET to send the bill back to the Senate following a day of vigorous debate over the Affordable Care Act, which begins open enrollment on Tuesday.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., countered that the public had litigated the health care law in 2012 with the re-election of Obama and accused Republicans of ""rampant irresponsibility"" that increased the prospects of an Oct. 1 shutdown.

""By the way, we won this debate in the election,"" Hoyer said on the House floor, ""But (Republicans) refuse to accept the results of the election.""

The House also voted 248-174 to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices enacted to help pay for implementation of the law.

The House then voted unanimously on a separate measure to ensure that the U.S. military continues to get paid if the government shuts down. Because no annual spending bills have been enacted, a shutdown would stop the flow of paychecks to troops.

Members of Congress, however, would continue to be paid if a shutdown occurs.

But the House GOP amendments affecting the Affordable Care Act face certain defeat in the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he will not support any bill that dismantles the law. Obama also said he would veto any such bill in the unlikely event it reaches his desk.

In a statement, Reid called the House's action ""pointless"" and reiterated that the Senate will reject the GOP's latest version of the stopgap bill.

""After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one: Republicans must decide whether to pass the Senate's clean (bill), or force a Republican government shutdown,"" Reid said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney called the plan ""reckless and irresponsible"" and said, ""Any member of the Republican Party who votes for this bill is voting for a shutdown.""

The House also voted to extend the length of the funding resolution by one month from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, and included a controversial ""conscience clause"" that would delay a requirement under the health care law that employers provide health insurance that covers contraceptives for women.

House Republicans expressed confidence that the latest strategy could hold more promise in the Senate than their original effort to defund the health care law. ""I think there are some senators over there who may be in cycle that secretly want a one-year delay and we just got to find the right mix that enables them to justify that vote,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C.

However, during Senate votes this week, all 54 Senate Democrats stuck together to strip out language defunding the law. Republicans would need 14 Senate Democrats to break party ranks to side with all 46 Senate Republicans, and there is no indication those votes exist. Even if they did, the president has said he would veto any legislation to undermine the law.

House Republicans' maneuvering is unlikely to force the tough political votes on Senate Democrats they are seeking. Reid can use Senate procedures to table the two amendments in one vote, requiring only a 51-vote majority, on Monday. If that occurs — as expected — the stopgap bill remains in the House, increasing pressure on Boehner to allow an up-or-down vote on the floor to avoid the shutdown.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said Democrats stand ready to provide votes to help moderate Republicans pass the Senate-passed stopgap bill. However, Boehner would likely lose most of his lawmakers and faces internal party pressures to hold firm against the health care law.

Reid warned Republicans that the only way to avoid a shutdown was to approve the Senate bill. ""This is it. Time is gone. Our rules are different than the House,"" he said Friday. The Senate is not in session this weekend.

""We're getting closer to a shutdown, but if the Senate acts as quick as it's capable we can avoid that. Let's see what they send back to us,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., on Saturday. ""We're working the process the way we're supposed to work it.""

Further fueling fears of a shutdown was Reid's acknowledgment that House and Senate leaders are not communicating. In previous budget clashes, behind-the-scenes negotiations were underway. ""We've made it very clear that the only way to solve this problem is just accept what we've done, just accept it,"" he said.

Boehner's office said Friday that they had not heard from Obama all week.

Most of the public would not feel the effects of a shutdown immediately. Government operations considered essential, like mail delivery, air-traffic control and Social Security and Medicare, would continue unabated, but national parks and museums would close. Certain government employees would not get paid, but they would receive back pay when the government reopens. A short-term shutdown is unlikely to cause much long-term economic damage unless it drags on longer.

House Republicans are also working separately to put together a legislative package tied to an impending vote to raise the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit, that will hit Oct. 17, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. The bill would suspend the debt ceiling through the 2014 elections in exchange for a one-year delay of implementation of the health care law and instructions on how to overhaul the federal tax code without raising additional revenue.

The package includes a grab bag of perennially popular GOP legislation that is unpalatable to Democrats, such as construction of a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, and increasing means testing for Medicaid recipients.

The package has also divided House Republicans for a number of reasons, forcing leaders to delay initial plans to vote on the package this weekend. Many lawmakers want to resolve the stopgap spending bill first, while others are concerned that the package does not include enough long-term deficit reduction.

Obama has maintained that he will veto any legislation that seeks to delay or defund his signature domestic achievement, and Democrats have vowed not to negotiate over the debt ceiling. There is no precedent for a U.S. debt limit default, but there is consensus that it could have sweeping, negative consequences for the U.S. economy."

But that's only half the story.

After I was successfully enrolled (which by the way only took half an hour for myself, my wife, and my three offspring), I was almost instantly given the news that I qualify for coverage! Yay! followed by a page of other news about the new law. I've been keenly interested so I was already aware of most of that information.

The one exceptional item - the thing that I am convinced has Republicans foaming at the mouth - was buried at the end of that page.

Here's an actual screenshot from my session:

Do you see it? Do you understand why the Republicans have been so anxious to ""kill the bill?"" Pronouncing the website a train wreck, trying to keep people away?

Here, let me make it a little easier to see:

Still can't see it? Let me zoom in real close:

Right there, on that page, is everything the Republicans hate: a program designed to help people of modest means, run by the government - AND giving those same people an opportunity to exercise their franchise.

If there really was a left-wing conspiracy funded by George Soros, I'd put in an expense request to get the list of people who had created an account on healthcare.gov, and around October 1, 2014 I'd mail them each a postcard with a very simple message:

You know that health plan that you signed up for last year? Democrats made that happen. Not a single Republican voted for it. In fact Republicans did everything they could to keep it from happening. Remember that when you vote.

Demonstrating that government(when the right people are in charge) - and then telling the people that same government just helped that they can do something togovernment working? No wonder the Republicans are in a frenzy.

As a follow-up - as noted in the comments, just because people can register to vote does not necessarily mean they will exercise that right - either by habit, or because of obstacles Republicans are trying to put in the way. In either case, the answer is the same: stay engaged. Don't agonize, organize!

UPDATE 2 10:00am 11-Dec-2013 (scoop apparently doesn't like my Chrome installation, either)

First, let me apologize for leaving out the VA/Tricare option from the poll. ""Tricare for all"" would be an excellent improvement to our health care delivery system.

Several commenters noted that the ACA would be saving their families a lot of money starting next year. Others pointed out that due to the increased competition, their employer-sponsored plans were going to be MUCH cheaper, saving the company and employees thousands of dollars.

By coincidence (and I don't believe in coincidence), I got an email this morning from Families USA, an advocacy group that has been pushing for better healthcare for all Americans. They have set up a website and a Facebook campaign to make it easier to share these kinds of success stories. So if you have one to tell, please do!

It was a delight to read. From the opening paragraph, the relentlessness is apparent



What is it about Obamacare that compels seemingly intelligent people to explode in bubbling spasms of stupid? Are they misinformed? Unable to see past the rage-fueled partisan sweat dripping into their eyes? Or just plain dishonest?

At this point, it has become obvious that history will look back on the four-year war on Obamacare as one of the saddest, most bizarre, and most dishonestly embarrassing episodes of our time. I have given up trying to understand the vehement opposition of so many who cannot offer up truthful reasons for their objections, and instead fuel the hatred and fears of the uninformed with the most illogical, mendacious, and fundamentally bizarre arguments that have ever been marshaled. By comparison, Joe McCarthy’s McCarthyistic McCarthyism was an exercise in reason.

The time may well have come to reconsider whether (McGaughy) should ever be taken seriously again. That is, if you have in the past. In fact, her new diatribe suggests either she has a really bad doctor or she needs to see a good one... know that there are plenty of social conservatives who consider sex to be something icky that should never be discussed or something immaculate that shouldn’t be enjoyable, but the reality is, good doctors ask about sex. That is not an Obamacare requirement—it is something that medical students learn in their first year when studying how to take a history and physical of a patient....This is part of what is called “social history,” and it is a critical part of any medical examination. That involves smoking history, use of alcohol, other drug use, and, yes, sex. The discussion of sexual matters is not so the doctor can run off into the next room and giggle about pee-pees. It is an essential part of any medical exam because it can be a key contributor to someone’s health.

Safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency? What a nightmare! Betsy, you better call (the company) right now and let them know that their system to make medical care better does not have your stamp of approval because—hell, I don’t know. You never explain a reason other than to suggest that the next Edward Snowden will leak everyone’s health-care information before fleeing to Russia.

The piece then highlights what I have been saying for a long time about the GOP and their attacks on Obamacare: That they are going to look terrible in the future once the history is told.The piece then goes down the list - death panels, government takeover of health care, Washington dictating treatments and on and on and on. It goes after the lies, the conservative academics who push out purported ""independent analysis"" that is bogus, and on and on and on. Recently, conservative nut Betsy McGaughy argued that Obamacare would force doctors to ask patients about their sex lives and bemoaned the horrors of electronic medical records. The Vanity Fair piece responds:Then, on medical records, the piece notes that the largest health care company in the world uses them, and boasts that they ""improve 'safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care."" Then the author writes:I can't quote anymore without violating fair use, but it is a lengthy piece worth a read. Plus, it is apparently just part one. The second part about the truth of Obamacare is going to be posted next week."

USA TODAY

The president launches another campaign to convince the public of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act

Obama said he%27ll make sure the law works %27if I have to fight another three years%27

Republicans criticize the law%2C dismiss White House efforts to rally support for it

WASHINGTON — After spending much of the past two months on the defensive as a result of the rocky rollout of his health care law, President Obama began a pre-holiday campaign Tuesday to boost enrollment now that the troubled online health exchange has been largely repaired.

The White House, the Democratic National Committee and the pro-Obama political group Organizing for Action say they will spend the next few weeks highlighting how Americans benefit under the law. Consumers must be enrolled in a health care plan by Dec. 23 to be on the insurers' rolls Jan. 1.

In a speech to mark the beginning of the effort, Obama took aim at Republican lawmakers who have repeatedly called for repeal of the law and have attempted to use the troubled implementation to take shots at several vulnerable Democratic lawmakers up for re-election in 2014 who supported the Affordable Care Act.

""We're not repealing it as long as I'm president,"" said Obama, who was flanked by Americans who have benefited from aspects of the law. He said, ""If I have to fight another three years to make sure that this law works, then that's what I'll do.""

The publicity blitz for Obamacare comes after the administration claimed victory in achieving its goal of getting the glitch-riddled HealthCare.gov website working for the vast majority of Americans by Nov. 30. Consumers are still experiencing some delays on the site, but the White House said there were more than 1 million visitors to the site Monday.

Though the administration can claim it has made huge strides improving the website — which serves as the online exchange for 36 states that refused to create their own exchanges — Obama is not out of the woods.

Some of the enrollment data insurers received from Americans who have signed up through the health care exchange contain errors — meaning some consumers might not be able to access the benefits Jan. 1 when they're scheduled to go into effect.

Republicans seized on a report released Tuesday by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that ""critical"" pieces in security controls failed during testing and that the Internal Revenue Service's fraud detection system may not be capable of identifying ACA refund fraud.

The report was completed more than two months ago, and the IRS noted in a response that it has taken steps to bolster its fraud detection.

""The president's health care law continues to wreak havoc on American families, small businesses and our economy,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said before Obama spoke. ""And it's not just a broken website.""

After the improvements to the website, the White House is set to resume stating its case to the public that it is working to meet a huge demand from Americans for affordable health care.

Obama said he hopes to focus attention back on the benefits of the law — something he said has been lost with all the attention on the website's problems.

As a result of the law, the president said, Americans are benefiting from bans on insurers setting lifetime benefit limits. He said 7 million seniors and Americans with disabilities have saved $1,200 on prescription drug costs and 9.5 million families have received refunds from their insurers.

""What's important for everybody to remember is not only has the law helped millions of people, but there are millions more that stand to be helped,"" Obama said. ""And we got to make sure they know that.""

Several polls have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the law, but a majority are opposed to a total repeal.

Boehner criticized Obama as being out of touch with what Americans want, but he declined to commit to vote on replacing the president's health care law next year with a Republican plan.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed the president's effort to trumpet the law. The senator's office noted that the latest effort marks at least the 13th attempt at a public relations blitz for the law since 2009.

""Another campaign-style event won't solve the myriad problems facing consumers under Obamacare,"" McConnell said before Obama's speech.

Obama charged that McConnell and fellow Republicans are disingenuous for repeatedly calling for repeal but not offering a viable alternative for helping Americans without insurance.

""If, despite all the millions of people benefiting from it, you still think this law is a bad idea, you got to tell us specifically what you'd do … to make insurance more secure,"" Obama said. """"You can't just say the system was working with 41 million without health insurance."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/opinion/a-population-betrayed.html,2013-10-04 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],A Population Betrayed - The New York Times,"It is outrageous that millions of the poorest people in the country will be denied health insurance because of decisions made mostly by Republican governors and legislators. These people will neither qualify for their state’s Medicaid program for the poor nor for subsidized coverage on new insurance exchanges that are being established in every state by the health care reform law.

Their plight is a result of the Supreme Court’s decision last year that struck down the reform law’s mandatory expansion of Medicaid and made expansion optional. Every state in the Deep South except Arkansas has rejected expansion, as have Republican-led states elsewhere. These 26 states would rather turn down incredibly generous federal funds that would finance 100 percent of the expansion costs for three years and at least 90 percent thereafter than offer a helping hand to their most vulnerable residents.

As Sabrina Tavernise and Robert Gebeloff reported in The Times on Thursday, two-thirds of the country’s poor, uninsured blacks and single mothers and more than half of the uninsured low-wage workers live in those states. The reform law originally sought to help poor and middle-income people through two parallel mechanisms. One was a mandatory expansion of Medicaid (which in most states cover primarily children and their parents with incomes well below the poverty level) to cover childless adults and to help people with income levels above the poverty line. Those with slightly higher incomes would be eligible for federal subsidies to buy private policies on the new insurance exchanges.

That approach fell apart when 26 states decided not to expand Medicaid, at least for now. There is no provision in the law to provide health insurance subsidies for anyone below the poverty line because those people are supposed to be covered by Medicaid."

Next step, fake emergency rooms.

California Republicans are desperate and shameless. In the past two weeks, GOP Assembly members have sent mailings out on what appears to be the state's dime to their constituents about health insurance. Only, they don't direct those people to CoveredCA.com to sign up. Instead, they send them to their own astroturf version with the url CoveringHealthCareCA.com. On their version, there are links to negative articles and twisted messages intended to sour people on signing up for health insurance before they ever land at the official health exchange site.

If you click on the ""Don't have health insurance"" tab on the front page, you're taken to a page that puts all the focus on the penalty and none on the benefits. In fact, they have a ""penalty calculator"" on that page, rather than a premium calculator.

Republicans are horrible people. Period. A fake health care site. A fake health care site intended to discourage the people on their own mailing lists from getting health insurance because fuck them, that's why.Other bits of logic include explaining to young people that by getting insurance they'll be subsidizing sick people, the goddamn leeching bastards. (On the other hand, if you cannot grasp that the central point of all insurance is pooling a little money from a large group of people in order to insure some level of security for those people in the pool that have something very bad happen to them, including for example you, perhaps removing you from the gene pool is not entirely a bad thing. If you are so nasty a person that you can't live with the thought of insuring yourself because it means some other person might get healthcare using one one hundredth of a cent of your money, the world will certainly not be missing you much after you are gone. Godspeed!)

This is yet another of the reasons the current incarnation of the Republican Party is little more than a political oozing sore. There is probably a downside to trying to kill off your own voters to score a momentary political point, but let's just say the members of the party brain trust in my state could meet in a closet and still have enough room for the vacuum and boxes of Christmas decorations."

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: The White House Comedy Club,"While the nation’s attention has been riveted on the Keystone Congress, the executive branch was busy developing its own comedy routine. Picture the cast (you know the characters) shrugging their shoulders in unison: “Who, me?”

This would be the response to the glitch-rich health-care rollout, for which no one seems responsible. “Beats me. I thought it was working!” This would also be the response to the eavesdropping scandal, which soon could become an international showdown. “Who knew?” Hint: He used to work at the National Security Agency (NSA) and now lives in Russia.

Not least, the shrug also would be the response to a White House rumor that a certain Republican House leader said to President Obama during a government shutdown meeting, “I cannot even stand to look at you.”

Except no one said it. Shrug.

The rumor kicked off uncharacteristically glitch-free when Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) heard it from what he apparently considered a reliable source and posted it on his Facebook page. Early rumor embellishments suggested that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was the demon source, which later was clarified to impugn Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) who denied it.

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

In fact, no one said it, according to a White House official, who attributed the untruth to a “miscommunication” during a report by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Of course, Reid told the entire Senate Democratic caucus, identifying Sessions as the evildoer. Durbin did not name Sessions in his post.

Voilà! A rumor is born. Roll cameras. The White House regrets the “misunderstanding.” Cut.

Meanwhile, the “rollout,” a term forever tarnished by the ineptitude displayed since Oct. 1 when Americans were finally going to be able to sign up for “affordable” (translation: I buy, you pay) health insurance, has been an embarrassment. Even if one is inclined to grant the benefit of the doubt (because technology can be a beast), evidence suggests that the “glitches” were the result of poor judgment and bad decisions.

But whose?

Four contractors hired to set up the computer system testified during congressional hearings that system testing began just two weeks before the launch date — and the test failed. Part of the problem was a decision not to allow customers to browse anonymously, as most people doubtless would prefer. Privacy and all that (chortle, chortle). Instead, people had to fill out forms before they could take a peek at the merchandise — an unmanageable burden to a system inadequate for the immense demand.

Who made that decision? The contractors testified they didn’t know who made the decisions or who was responsible for correcting problems. One can blame the computer guys, of course. Or demand the head of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, under whose supervision the Affordable Care Act falls. But ultimately, the responsibility for the popularly known “Obamacare” rests with the person who insisted in the midst of a historic recession, a global financial meltdown and record unemployment that we needed to overhaul the entire health-care industry.

Not to drone on, but yet another “meanwhile” demands attention: A photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the front page of Friday’s Wall Street Journal saves writers a thousand words. She may be giving the evil eye to a photographer as she arrives at a European Union summit in Brussels, but it perfectly captures sentiments she has expressed upon learning of a report that the NSA had been listening to her cellphone conversations.

Not only Merkel but as many as 35 world leaders may have been targets of our eavesdropping, according to Britain’s Guardian newspaper. They are not amused.

Consequences, which include potential damage to a transatlantic free trade agreement, are yet to be fully imagined. What we cannot avoid registering is that we look like not the glimmering city on the hill but a ship of untrustworthy fools.

We reportedly eavesdrop on our allies and force citizens to buy insurance through a system we can’t manage. We concoct character-smearing rumors and attach them to our political adversaries. And that’s just the executive branch. Most important, we have damaged our bonds of trust with nations we need to keep as friends.

Any one of the above would make for a very bad week in governance. Combined, they suggest an uncomfortable conclusion to the world we purport to lead: The lights are flickering in the city on the hill, and our ship of state is foundering.

For the Wall Street Journal and Forbes' Avik Roy, these and other HHS contingency measures designed to help consumers manage the transition to new policies during the rocky rollout of the health insurance exchanges mean ""backdating Obamacare,"" a ""government takeover"" which treats carriers like ""battered wives.""

But the frothing at the mouth conservatives would be advised to swallow their bile. After all, when the disastrous launch of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program left over six million seniors without their drug coverage in January 2006, President Bush ordered America's insurance companies to pay for their prescriptions while the fiasco was straightened out. And as it turned, dozens of states--most of them led by Democratic governors--had to step in cover billions more in drug costs until the Bush HHS could fix the system that left patients, pharmacists and physicians alike frustrated and confused.

As the New York Times reported on January 16, 2006 (""President Tells Insurers to Aid Ailing Medicare Drug Plan""):



With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug. The actions came after several states declared public health emergencies, and many states announced that they would step in to pay for prescriptions that should have been covered by the federal Medicare program. Republicans have joined Democrats in asserting that the federal government botched the beginning of the prescription drug program, which started on Jan. 1. People who had signed up for coverage found that they were not on the government's list of subscribers. Insurers said they had no way to identify poor people entitled to extra help with their drug costs. Pharmacists spent hours on the telephone trying to reach insurance companies that administer the drug benefit under contract to Medicare. Many of the problems involve low-income people entitled to both Medicare and Medicaid. In a directive sent to all Medicare drug plans over the weekend, the Bush administration said they ""must take immediate steps"" to ensure that low-income beneficiaries were not charged more than $2 for a generic drug and $5 for a brand-name drug. In addition, it said insurers must cover a 30-day emergency supply of drugs that beneficiaries were taking prior to the start of the new program. In an interview yesterday, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that ""several hundred thousand beneficiaries who switched plans"" in December may have had difficulty filling prescriptions in the last two weeks.

The Bush administration's desperation and insistence, as Roy would put it, that ""insurers to cover up for its mistakes"" was understandable. As the Washington Post reported on January 14, 2006 , ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. Two days later, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue:"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/opinion/krugman-the-spite-club.html,2013-06-07 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Spite Club - The New York Times,"House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal ObamaRomneyCare — the Affordable Care Act, which creates a national health insurance system similar to the one Massachusetts has had since 2006. Nonetheless, almost all of the act will go fully into effect at the beginning of next year.

There is, however, one form of obstruction still available to the G.O.P. Last year’s Supreme Court decision upholding the law’s constitutionality also gave states the right to opt out of one piece of the plan, a federally financed expansion of Medicaid. Sure enough, a number of Republican-dominated states seem set to reject Medicaid expansion, at least at first.

And why would they do this? They won’t save money. On the contrary, they will hurt their own budgets and damage their own economies. Nor will Medicaid rejectionism serve any clear political purpose. As I’ll explain later, it will probably hurt Republicans for years to come.

No, the only way to understand the refusal to expand Medicaid is as an act of sheer spite. And the cost of that spite won’t just come in the form of lost dollars; it will also come in the form of gratuitous hardship for some of our most vulnerable citizens."

Have those steadfast on obstructing and delaying the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) not understand that they will be causing the suffering and likely deaths of many because of their failed ideology. What do they have to offer citizens if they were miraculously able to stymie Obamacare? The answer is the same it has been for decades; nothing.

What is true is that over the last several months Republican politicians have been in a competition with themselves. It has been a competition as to who can be the most aggressive in obstructing the President on every issue. At no time is the well-being of American citizens considered. It has been simply a visceral hate for the President and his policies no matter how many people it helps.

Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens (R) is the latest candidate attempting to out macho other Republicans in what he is doing to obstruct Obamacare. When one listens to the thrill in his voice on how he intends to attempt to stymie the health insurance exchanges, it is rather scary. It is hard to believe that politicians would attempt to use the law in Jim Crow fashion to cause actual harm to the citizens of their state. What is even scarier is the response, the applause, and cheers by the audience. Can they not see the evil in their actions?

The Affordable Care Act made provisions for ‘navigators’. These are people hired by organizations to help people purchase health insurance policies. The federal government is offering training programs and grants to help create these ‘navigators’. In order to obstruct this process, Hudgens says in the video below,

The problem is Obamacare. We’ve got to now determine what we can do to solve that problem. Let me tell you what we are doing; everything in our power to be an obstructionist. You have probably have heard about the exchanges. Well exchanges are coming to Georgia, not the state is not setting them up. The federal government is going to set them up. But we have passed a law and with the help of senator McCoon and others, we have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance.The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we’ll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we’re going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write ‘navigator test’ on it

He has also stated that Georgia has passed a law that forces insurance companies to state specifically that any rate increases are not the fault of the Governor, general assembly, or department of insurance but because of Obamacare. In other words irrespective of reasons, he forces insurance companies to lie.

Americans are waking up. Several town halls have proven that the expectations many Republicans had that opponents of Obamacare would storm town halls did not materialize. In fact the opposite has occurred (see here and here).

One can only hope that Democrats fight with this same intensity promoting Obamacare. Moreover one hopes the Democrats will campaign on Obamacare during the 2014 campaign. There is ample video of many Republicans who in order to placate the Tea Party overtly take positions on Obamacare that hurt the well-being of their constituencies. As Obamacare is rolled out successfully in states that put the well-being of their citizens ahead of ideology, state run by obstructionist will kick them out of office as citizens realize they were lied to.

The site’s homepage now carries a direct link to the state insurance exchange Covered California, as well as more prominent links to Covered California on the “Learn More” tab and the “I don’t have insurance” tab.

Opponents of the Affordable Care Act never stop producing new tricks to undermine the reform’s effectiveness. But leave it to California Republicans to reach for the bottom. Their goal appears to be to discredit the act by highlighting its costs and penalties rather than its potential benefits.

The device chosen by the Assembly’s GOP caucus is a website at the address coveringhealthcareca.com. If that sounds suspiciously like coveredca.com, which is the real website for the California insurance exchange, it may not be a coincidence. Bogus insurance websites have sprung up all over, aiming to steer consumers away from legitimate enrollment services. Just a couple of weeks ago California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris shut down 10 bogus insurance sites, some of them with names very similar to the real thing. She must have overlooked the GOP’s entry.

To be fair, the California GOP announced its website in August. But some members have recently stepped up their promotion of the site. The site has a featured spot, for example, on the homepage of Assembly Republican Leader Connie Conway (R-Tulare). Conway’s spokeswoman, Sabrina Lockhart, says other members may be pointing their constituents to the site “as a resource” to help them navigate the new law.

If that’s so, constituents needing useful information about how to deal with the Affordable Care Act would be well advised to look elsewhere. As an aid to understanding and navigating the Affordable Care Act’s new requirements and opportunities for coverage, the GOP site is worse than useless. Finding a link there to the Covered California website, which after all is the main place residents can go to obtain insurance in the individual market, is a chore -- there isn’t a link to it at all on the GOP page.

Instead, you’re offered links labeled “I already have health insurance,” “I don’t have health insurance,” or “I’m an employer.” The second link, which presumably covers most residents looking for help through the act, leads to a page dominated by a calculator for the penalties imposed for not buying insurance -- not exactly what you need if you’re already looking for insurance. If you have the patience, you can find a link to Covered California toward the bottom of the page.

As for the quality of information provided on the site, it’s questionable; that’s a charitable way of saying that some of it is dead wrong.

For example, the website claims that the Affordable Care Act will increase the federal deficit, asserting that the “non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in a March 2012 report that coverage expenses under the Affordable Care Act will cost the country a total of $1.76 trillion total by 2022 and add over $1 trillion to the federal deficit.”

Is that so? The site links to this report by the CBO, which states on page 2 that the act will “on net, reduce budget deficits over the 2012–2021 period.” Get it? Reduce the deficit, not add to it. The GOP’s nasty trick is to consider only the costs of coverage, without netting out the cost reductions and new revenues in the law. Oh, by the way, the CBO also projects that the ACA will reduce the number of uninsured people in the United States by more than 30 million. That’s a plus, by most reckoning.

The GOP website’s digest of recent news articles is led, at the moment, by a Wall Street Journal op-ed by a San Diego businesswoman who claimed to be one of Obamacare’s “losers.” As we pointed out in this closer look at her story, her life may well be saved by the Affordable Care Act’s outlawing of insurance exclusions for preexisting conditions. (She’s a cancer survivor.)

One can certainly sympathize with the California GOP’s desire to become relevant again to the lives of Californians, who have all but voted the party out of existence in the Golden State. Given that California is one of the real bright spots in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, one might think that the state’s Republicans would recognize its value to voters, instead of trying to fill their constituents’ heads with irrelevancies, misinformation, and misrepresentations. One would be wrong."

Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, has infuriated Democrats this week by commandeering the Senate floor, demanding a vote on his amendment repealing federal contributions to help pay for lawmakers’ health care coverage. But Democratic senators are preparing a legislative response targeting a sordid Vitter episode. If Vitter continues to insist on a vote on his proposal, Democrats could counter with one of their own: Lawmakers will be denied those government contributions if there is “probable cause” they solicited prostitutes. According to draft legislation obtained by POLITICO, Democrats are weighing whether to force a Senate vote on a plan that would effectively resurrect Vitter’s past if the conservative Republican continues to press forward with his Obamacare-bashing proposal.

Recall the latest GOP game to embarrass Democrats over Obamacare and threaten shutting down the government? Central to this effort is a Republican senator who should know something about public embarrassment, Louisiana's David Vitter. He's held up Senate work for a week, as it's tried to pass an energy bill, by insisting on his Obamacare amendment. For once, Democrats are playing some hardball in return, and have decided to show the good senator that the game works both ways.One word: diapers.

That'd be a nice reminder for everyone, as Vitter contemplates a run for governor of Louisiana in 2015. For right now he's all bluster, saying this is Harry Reid ""acting like an old-time Vegas mafia thug, and a desperate one at that."" But all that bluster might not be backed up by Vitter's fellow Republicans, who might not want to champion their sleazy colleague on the Senate floor.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leaders-confounded-stopgap-spending-bill-195923220--politics.html,,[],GOP leaders confounded on stopgap spending bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — GOP leaders eager to avoid blame for a possible government shutdown next month appear confounded by conservatives' passion for using fast-approaching deadlines to derail the implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, conceded Thursday his plan was all but dead for quickly passing a temporary spending bill that also defunds Obamacare, make the Senate vote on each idea separately and then send only the portion for keeping the government open to the White House for the president's signature.

Meanwhile, new freelance effort by rank-and-file Republicans to condition keeping the government open or preventing a debt ceiling default on delaying Obamacare for a year hit a brick wall of opposition from Democrats vowing to never let the health care law be delayed or unraveled.

Nonetheless, some Republicans floated the idea of postponing all of the unimplemented portions of the new law for a year — including a requirement that virtually everyone buys health insurance and with new tax subsidies to help many people pay for it — in exchange for raising the government's borrowing cap and easing tens of billions of dollars in broad, automatic spending cuts.

""Let's give them something and then we get something in exchange,"" Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said. ""We give the administration the debt ceiling increase they want. We give them maybe some sequestration dollars that they would like to have. And in exchange we delay Obamacare, which I think the president should want. ... He's already delayed big chunks of it. It's not ready for implementation.""

The administration has delayed a provision of the health care law requiring larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers. State exchanges through which people can purchase health insurance are set to begin operation Oct. 1.

Washington faces two key deadlines in coming weeks. The first is Oct. 1, when a stopgap spending measure will be needed to fund federal agency operations such as employee salaries, equipment and other costs. Without new spending authority, non-essential government operations would shut down for the first time since 1996. Even if the government shuts down, however, Social Security, Medicare and other so-called mandatory programs would continue to operate on autopilot.

Story continues

The other, far more important must-pass measure looms later in October and would increase the government's borrowing limit so it can pay all of its bills, including Social Security benefits, interest payments on government debt, and payments to local governments and government contractors. Defaulting of those obligations would have far greater consequences for both the economy and the political fortunes of the politicians that bear the blame from voters.

The White House vowed again Thursday that it will do everything in its power to protect and defend Obama's health care law, his most significant accomplishment in office.

""We will not accept anything that delays or defunds Obamacare,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

""It's not going to happen. It's the law of the land. It's been upheld by the Supreme Court,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""So anybody who ties the operations of the government or the debt ceiling to trying to defeat Obamacare is really in favor of shutting down the government and having us default on our debt.""

The chaos on Capitol Hill forced House leaders to tell lawmakers they'll likely have to scrap a vacation set for the week of Sept. 23 so they can be available to work out a short-term spending bill to keep the government running past the Oct. 1 start of the new budget year.

On Tuesday, GOP leaders proposed a plan to advance the measure through the House coupled with a provision to derail implementation of the new health care law but allow the Democratic Senate to send it on to the White House shorn of the ""defund 'Obamacare'"" provision as long as there was a vote on it. That got poor reviews from some conservatives who don't see it as fighting hard enough to block Obamacare.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is privately proposing a one-year delay of Obamacare implementation as part of the stopgap funding bill. The flaw in that strategy is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., could win a vote to strip the Obamacare provision out in the Senate and send it straight back to the House.

""There are a lot of members with a lot of ideas,"" Boehner said. ""And we're going to continue to talk to all of them.""

The speaker met Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew — an adversary from the 2011 budget and debt negotiations — and presented him with a list of examples in which debt ceiling legislation has been paired with budget cuts. Such examples including budget pacts in 2011, 1997 and 1990.

""For decades the White House, the Congress have used the debt limit to find bipartisan solutions on the deficit and the debt. Now these types of changes were signed into law by Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton — and President Obama himself two years ago,"" Boehner said. The administration says is won't negotiate on the debt limit after Republicans used it in 2011 to demand spending cuts.

On numerous other occasions, including seven instances during the administration of George W. Bush, Republicans have delivered support for debt ceiling increases without any spending cuts attached. That's what the administration and Democrats are demanding now, and they're confident that Republicans have less leverage than they think.

""If push comes to shove on debt ceiling, I'm virtually certain they blink,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""They know they shouldn't be playing havoc with the markets."""

And, y– you know– I think what’s important to recognize is that– we’ve already cut– $2.5– $2.7 trillion out of the deficit. If the sequester stays in, you’ve got over $3.5 trillion of deficit reduction already.

And, so, we don’t have an immediate crisis in terms of debt. In fact, for the next ten years, it’s gonna be in a sustainable place. The question is, can we do it smarter, can we do it better?

It was a delight to read. From the opening paragraph, the relentlessness is apparent



What is it about Obamacare that compels seemingly intelligent people to explode in bubbling spasms of stupid? Are they misinformed? Unable to see past the rage-fueled partisan sweat dripping into their eyes? Or just plain dishonest?

At this point, it has become obvious that history will look back on the four-year war on Obamacare as one of the saddest, most bizarre, and most dishonestly embarrassing episodes of our time. I have given up trying to understand the vehement opposition of so many who cannot offer up truthful reasons for their objections, and instead fuel the hatred and fears of the uninformed with the most illogical, mendacious, and fundamentally bizarre arguments that have ever been marshaled. By comparison, Joe McCarthy’s McCarthyistic McCarthyism was an exercise in reason.

The time may well have come to reconsider whether (McGaughy) should ever be taken seriously again. That is, if you have in the past. In fact, her new diatribe suggests either she has a really bad doctor or she needs to see a good one... know that there are plenty of social conservatives who consider sex to be something icky that should never be discussed or something immaculate that shouldn’t be enjoyable, but the reality is, good doctors ask about sex. That is not an Obamacare requirement—it is something that medical students learn in their first year when studying how to take a history and physical of a patient....This is part of what is called “social history,” and it is a critical part of any medical examination. That involves smoking history, use of alcohol, other drug use, and, yes, sex. The discussion of sexual matters is not so the doctor can run off into the next room and giggle about pee-pees. It is an essential part of any medical exam because it can be a key contributor to someone’s health.

Safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency? What a nightmare! Betsy, you better call (the company) right now and let them know that their system to make medical care better does not have your stamp of approval because—hell, I don’t know. You never explain a reason other than to suggest that the next Edward Snowden will leak everyone’s health-care information before fleeing to Russia.

The piece then highlights what I have been saying for a long time about the GOP and their attacks on Obamacare: That they are going to look terrible in the future once the history is told.The piece then goes down the list - death panels, government takeover of health care, Washington dictating treatments and on and on and on. It goes after the lies, the conservative academics who push out purported ""independent analysis"" that is bogus, and on and on and on. Recently, conservative nut Betsy McGaughy argued that Obamacare would force doctors to ask patients about their sex lives and bemoaned the horrors of electronic medical records. The Vanity Fair piece responds:Then, on medical records, the piece notes that the largest health care company in the world uses them, and boasts that they ""improve 'safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care."" Then the author writes:I can't quote anymore without violating fair use, but it is a lengthy piece worth a read. Plus, it is apparently just part one. The second part about the truth of Obamacare is going to be posted next week."

Herszenhorn'],"Saying He’s Pro-Russia, McCain Criticizes Putin","MOSCOW — In a combative essay published Thursday in the online newspaper Pravda.ru, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, declared himself to be “pro-Russian” but delivered a blistering attack on President Vladimir V. Putin, describing him as presiding over a failed petro-state and as a quasi dictator who rules “by corruption, repression and violence.”

Mr. McCain’s article was intended to answer an Op-Ed column by Mr. Putin in The New York Times on Sept. 12 that made the case against President Obama’s threatened military strike on Syria. Mr. Putin’s column, in which he presented Russia’s position as defending international law and respect for state sovereignty, generated fierce debate, including praise and accusations of hypocrisy.

While Mr. Putin’s article focused more generally on American foreign policy, Mr. McCain, who has long been a sharp critic of the Kremlin, focused squarely on the Russian president himself. In his introduction, though, Mr. McCain made an effort to dispel the idea that he is anti-Russian, a perception that is widespread here.

“I am not anti-Russian,” Mr. McCain wrote. “I am pro-Russian, more pro-Russian than the regime that misrules you today.”"

(CNN) – It would be ""regrettable"" if the identities of the men photographed with Sen. John McCain in Syria this week are confirmed to be individuals responsible for a year-old kidnapping, the Arizona senator's office said in a statement Thursday.

There has been confusion and conflicting reports about who exactly the men pictured with McCain are, and whether or not they were involved in last year's kidnapping. CNN has been unable to confirm the identities of the men in the photograph. Nonetheless, McCain's office was quick to reject speculation the Republican knowingly met with men accused of the abduction.



McCain entered the war-torn country on Monday and met with commanders of the Free Syrian Army, who are fighting forces loyal to Bashar al Assad for control of the country. He was the first U.S. senator to travel to Syria since the civil war broke out there two years ago, and told CNN after leaving that his conviction the U.S. must become more involved in the country's conflict had intensified.

Opponents of a greater U.S. role in Syria say the presence of terrorists among the rebels should prevent lethal aid from being delivered to opposition forces.

A report in the Beirut-based Daily Star newspaper suggested a photo released by McCain's office from the trip showed the Arizona senator standing alongside two men accused of kidnapping 11 Lebanese Shiite pilgrims in May 2012.

The paper cited family members of the kidnapped pilgrims – along with one pilgrim who was kidnapped himself and later released – identifying Mohamad Nour and Abu Ibrahim in one of the handout photos from McCain, which the Republican also posted to Twitter.

Important visit with brave fighters in #Syria who are risking their lives for freedom and need our help pic.twitter.com/tx4uX572ZP — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 28, 2013

But on Thursday, McCain's communications director Brian Rogers strongly denied that McCain would knowingly pose next to men he knew were responsible for kidnapping pilgrims.

""None of the individuals the Senator planned to meet with was named Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim,"" Rogers wrote in a statement. ""A number of other Syrian commanders joined the meeting, but none of them identified himself as Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim.""

The Washington-based group Syrian Emergency Task Force, which helped coordinate the trip, did not arrange any meetings with the men named as kidnappers, Rogers said.

""A number of the Syrians who greeted Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with him, and as always, the Senator complied,"" he continued. ""If the individual photographed with Senator McCain is in fact Mohamed Nour, that is regrettable. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Senator in any way condones the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims or has any communication with those responsible. Senator McCain condemns such heinous actions in the strongest possible terms.""

The kidnapping in question took place in May 2012. The pilgrims - all men - were detained by an armed group in northern Syria after crossing the border from Turkey. They were on their way back from visiting holy sites in Iran.

The pilgrims' wives were not detained but sent to the city of Aleppo; from there they returned to Lebanon.

McCain's trip to Syria underscored a long-standing debate among U.S. lawmakers over whether the U.S. should provide arms and other lethal aid to rebels in Syria.

McCain has been the leading voice in Congress calling on President Barack Obama to ramp up support for Syrian rebels, who now receive nonlethal aid like food and medicine from the United States. In early April that aid was stepped up to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is considered defensive in nature.

In their meeting with McCain, leaders of the Syrian rebel forces pressed the United States to provide them with weapons to continue their fight against Assad. They specifically said they need ammunition, as well as antitank and antiaircraft weapons, McCain said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.

""They do not understand why we won't help them,"" he told Anderson Cooper.

A bipartisan measure that would allow lethal weaponry to ""vetted Syrian groups"" passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month. The ""Syria Transition Support Act"" also calls for military training and both lethal and non-lethal arms for vetted groups; a $250 million ""transition fund each year"" through fiscal year 2015, and sanctions on oil sales to al-Assad.

But dissenters from both parties have expressed concerns about lethal arms ending up in the hands of terrorists, who could later use them against Americans or other allies of the United States. Republican Sen. Rand Paul has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. intervention in Syria, part of his broader anti-interventionist stance. In an opinion article for CNN.com, Paul wrote Wednesday that arming the rebels would be ""complicated and dangerous"" and ""could actually help the extremists.""

He also took subtle jabs at McCain, pointing to the senator's switch in support from former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to the rebels seeking his demise.

Among the groups that worry U.S. leaders is the al-Nusra Front, which is designated by the United States as a pro-al Qaeda terrorist group. Members of the organization have joined the rebels in their fight against Assad.

McCain told CNN Wednesday that members of the extremist group currently represent only 7% of the 100,000 total rebel forces.

""We can help the right people,"" he said. ""Is there some risk involved? Absolutely. But is the status quo acceptable?""

(CNN) – The new era in America's war on terror - described by President Barack Obama in a major address Thursday - worries some Republicans, who say the phase-down could leave the country vulnerable to still-persistent threats from abroad.

In his remarks, Obama insisted the fight against terrorists must shift to reflect current threat levels, which he described as having evolved since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The global ""war on terror,"" launched in the aftermath of those attacks, must end, ""like all wars,"" the president maintained.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I think this is the most significant foreign policy address ever given by this president,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""At the same time I found many parts to it disturbing for many reasons.""

Chief among his concerns was Obama's call for a return to what McCaul described as a ""pre-9/11 mentality,"" a mindset the Republican argued could lead to a dangerous level of unpreparedness as threats emerge from sources other than al Qaeda.

""I couldn't disagree with him more on that,"" McCaul said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

In his remarks Thursday, Obama described al Qaeda as ""on the path to defeat"" in its longstanding bases of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but warned the terror group's affiliates in other countries still posed lethal threats to Americans.

But those groups, Obama said, are ""less capable"" than the larger al Qaeda, and are focused more on operating in the countries where they're based, rather than planning an attack on the American homeland.

Attacks on America are still being planned, the president warned, and ""our nation is still threatened by terrorists."" Yet the current threat has vastly changed in the decade-plus since the war on terror began, he said.

""We have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11,"" the president said.

McCaul said Sunday the intelligence he's seen as chairman of the homeland security panel suggests a more serious danger than Obama described.

""I think the rhetoric sort of defies the reality in terms of the threat level that we've all been briefed on,"" he said. ""I mean, the narrative is sort of that, you know, al Qaeda is on the run, they're defeated, let's claim victory, war's over. And then let's go back to a pre-9/11 mentality.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, argued a scaled-down war footing could send the wrong message to potential enemies.

""What do you think the Iranians are thinking? At the end of the day, this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine, making such a speech at a time when our homeland is trying to be attacked literally every day,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""I've never been more worried about our national security as I am right now. This speech did not help,"" Graham added.

""I see a big difference between the president saying a war is at an end and whether or not you've won the war,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, added on CBS ""Face the Nation."" ""We can claim it's at an end but this war is going to continue and we have tremendous threats throughout that are building, not declining, building.""

In his address Thursday, Obama noted the difficulty in balancing Americans' freedoms during wartime, a task Sen. Dick Durbin argued Sunday would be made easier as the country's terror stance shifts.

""You find in a warlike atmosphere that you end up compromising some basic values and basic freedoms and liberties,"" Durbin, D-Illinois, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" in his defense of Obama's speech. ""That's what the president reminded us. I'm not going to take lightly the terrorism threat against the United States. But if we're constantly thinking of this in the context of war, we stand a very real risk of doing things which compromise our values and freedoms.""

Another Obama ally, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on CBS the shift away from war that Obama advocated Thursday was a suitable reflection of how threats have changed in the past decade.

""I think the president did a very, very smart pivot realizing we're not going to let up on terrorists but at the same time we're going meet the changes in the world,” he said."

(CNN) —

The United States hasn’t abandoned Robert Levinson, the retired FBI agent described by his wife as the “longest-held American hostage,” Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday.

“There hasn’t been progress in the sense that we don’t have him back. But to suggest that we’ve abandoned him or anybody … is simply incorrect and not helpful,” Kerry told ABC’s “This Week.” “The fact is that I have personally raised the issue, not only at the highest level that I have been involved with, but also through other intermediaries.”

Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007 during a business trip, purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling. However, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported Thursday that contrary to what the State Department and Levinson’s family have said for years, Levinson actually was working for the CIA in Iran. And a source involved in the matter told CNN there’s proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover, and under contract, while also working as a private investigator.

White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip

That allegation doesn’t sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

“What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson,” McCain said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “If that’s true, then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees didn’t know about other activities, which have been revealed by (NSA leaker Edward) Snowden – maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of Congress over our different intelligence agencies.”

Iran’s government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. During a September interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson’s family.

“We don’t know where he is, who he is,” Rouhani said. “He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him.”

McCain: CIA did not tell Congress the truth about Levinson

Kerry said the United States is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive. A “number of different channels” are “being worked aggressively,” he said.

Iran’s previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as “proof of life.”

In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia.

This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, “We have every reason to believe that he’s alive and that the Iranians control his fate.”

Asked whether he believes the Iranian government is responsible for Levinson’s disappearance, Kerry said he thinks the government “has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.”

McCain said he was “confident we are doing everything that we can” to get Levinson released from Iran,

He added that any negotiations in Levinson’s case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

Here is how Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman summarizes Bush's legacy in a 27-Apr-2013 post on his NYT blog:



The Great Degrader I’ve been focused on economic policy lately, so I sort of missed the big push to rehabilitate Bush’s image; also, as a premature anti-Bushist who pointed out how terrible a president he was back when everyone else was praising him as a Great Leader, I’m kind of worn out on the subject. But it does need to be said: he was a terrible president, arguably the worst ever, and not just for the reasons many others are pointing out.

Think about his two main “achievements”, if you want to call them that: the tax cuts and the Iraq war, both of which continue to cast long shadows over our nation’s destiny. The key thing to remember is that both were sold with lies. ... their selling of the [tax] cuts offered what amounted to an expert class in how to lie with statistics. Basically, every time the Bushies came out with a report, you knew that it was going to involve some kind of fraud, and the only question was which kind and where. And no, this wasn’t standard practice before. Politics ain’t beanbag and all that, but the president as con man was a new character in American life.

Even more important, Bush lied us into war. Let’s repeat that: he lied us into war. I know, the apologists will say that “everyone” believed Saddam had WMD, but the truth is that even the category “WMD” was a con game, lumping together chemical weapons with nukes in an illegitimate way. And any appearance of an intelligence consensus before the invasion was manufactured: dissenting voices were suppressed ... ... right there you have something that should block Bush from redemption of any kind, ever: he misled us into a war that probably killed hundreds of thousands of people, and he did it in part for political reasons. There was a time when Americans expected their leaders to be more or less truthful. Nobody expected them to be saints, but we thought we could trust them not to lie about fundamental matters. That time is now behind us — and it was Bush who did it.

In addition to the usual list of policy catastrophes, Krugman thinks Bush infected us with an enduring malignancy:And,PK is not mincing words."

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) offered to the immigration bill. It would require border security before America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants are granted amnesty.

Reid filed a motion to “table” the amendment, a move that he used to quickly push for an up-or-down vote. A vote in favor of tabling the amendment would kill it. A vote against tabling the amendment would allow it to move through for debate. Essentially, a vote for Reid’s motion is a vote against securing the border before amnesty. Likewise, a vote against Reid’s motion is a vote for securing the border before granting amnesty.

The Senate Reference guide describes a motion to table as: “The motion is used to dispose quickly of questions the Senate does not wish to consider further.”

Reid’s motion to table the amendment passed 57-43, with Gang of Eight Republican Sens. John McCain (R-AZ). Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) voting with Reid. Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor voted against Reid in favor of border security before amnesty, as did Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH). Ayotte had previously indicated support for the Gang of Eight bill.

Reid’s decision to derail an open process on the immigration bill comes during the first week of debate on what will likely drag on until close to the Fourth of July recess. Losing Grassley’s support up front on process is dangerous for Reid, too, as Grassley is a key Republican leader on issues that involve immigration.

On the floor on Thursday, Grassley argued that the “so-called open and fair process” the Democrats and the “Gang of Eight” Republicans have promised “is a farce.”

“This is not the right way to start off on a very important bill,” Grassley said."

Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a subcommittee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, has re -filed a resolution to form such a select committee. Only Speaker John Boehner can allow the formation of a House Select Committee.

Other Republicans were unsure of their support for a select committee. “You know, I don’t think so. We’re still under the review of our committee right now, so we’re still conducting our investigation. We haven’t finished it yet. I’m not exactly sure where the foreign affairs committee is yet, but I know they are still doing their review,” said Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, when Breitbart News asked if he would support Wolf’s effort.

Wolf sent a “dear colleague letter” to Republican House members on Friday asking for their support for his resolution. Wolf expressed the necessity for the select committee so that Benghazi survivors could have a venue to put forth their accounts without risking their jobs or face prosecution from the Justice Department.

Boehner and Rogers are both part of Congress’ “super 8,” both parties’ top leadership in the upper and lower chambers. They, as well as chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, are all privy to classified information about the Benghazi attack.

Rogers also disagreed with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) regarding Paul’s assertion that the CIA annex in Benghazi was a site that Americans were running guns to “out of Libya into Turkish hands.”

“We have looked at all of that. I can find no information that substantiates that, but if it were there, I would want to find it,” Rogers said.

On January 24, Speaker Boehner told conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, regarding Paul’s remarks, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, both told Breitbart News they knew nothing about the gunrunning from the CIA annex to which Paul was referring.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said in November that he did not find it necessary for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi attack after Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) had announced the need for one.

The three senators, who are all part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a statement on Monday threatening to place a hold on John Brennan, Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director, if the administration did not release more information about the Benghazi attack.

The statement included a litany of what remains known and unknown about the attacks, as well as contradictory statements made by administration officials in congressional testimony.

Senators are expected to vote on Brennan’s nomination in committee on Tuesday."

Someone get this pundit a calculator.

Rightwing columnist/professional “amnesty”-hater Ann Coulter continued to rail against the possibility of any immigration reform that would create a pathway to citizenship in a column published last week, using faulty math to press her case.

Arguing, as she has in the past, that Republicans should avoid trying to cultivate Hispanics because they lean Democratic, Coulter offered the following calculation:

Can I see the math on that? I can see why bringing in 30 million new Democratic voters would be good for the Democrats, but how does it help Republicans? Maybe conservatives shouldn't blindly trust the calculations of the guy who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.

This “math” is based on a few incorrect assumptions. She presumes that every undocumented immigrant currently in the country or projected to come here over the next decade is Hispanic, will become a citizen and eligible to vote, and will proceed to vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.

Coulter doesn’t explain how she arrived at her figure, but it's unrealistically high. The total number of undocumented immigrants in the country right now stands at about 11.1 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would lead to a net increase of 9.6 million people in the United States over the next 10 years. That totals 20.7 million, not 30 million.

But not all undocumented immigrants are Hispanic. Some 81 percent of immigrants residing illegally in the United States come from Latin America, according to the Pew. The CBO doesn't specify where the 9.6 million new U.S. residents, both unauthorized and authorized, would come from, but working from the assumption that it's comparable to the figure for unauthorized immigrants, we can drop that figure still further to 16.8 million.

Not all of them would become citizens if the immigration reform became law, however. The proposed law specifies a 10-year-long process from legal residence to citizenship. Not everyone will go through it. Under current law, only 56 percent of legal residents become naturalized citizens with the power to vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That would bring the figure down to 9.4 million, though there’s no sure way to know what naturalization rates will look like in the future.

Latinos also face a major problem with voter turnout. Only 48 percent of Hispanics voted in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- a much smaller figure than the number of blacks (66.2 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (64.1 percent). Even more worrisome for Hispanic voters, that low turnout figure represents a drop from 2008, when 49.9 percent of Latino voters made it to the polls. Such low turnout would once again cut the potential Latino voter impact, to about 4.5 million.

Lastly, Latinos do not vote “80 percent against Republicans,” as Coulter claims in her column. They vote differently depending on the candidate in front of them.

GOP contender Mitt Romney fielded 27 percent of the Hispanic vote last year, the worst performance for a presidential candidate since Bob Dole’s run in 1996.

But George W. Bush -- who unlike Romney spoke some Spanish and supported immigration reform -- won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004."

(CNN) - Former Rep. Ron Paul, normally known for his online popularity, drew criticism Monday for asserting a political opinion in a tweet about the Navy SEAL who was killed at a gun range this weekend.

[tweet https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/298477312876355585%5D



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The three-time presidential candidate and longtime congressman from Texas is known for his staunch opposition to U.S. military involvement. While he doesn't describe himself as an ""isolationist,"" he has won favor among libertarians for opposing military intervention in other countries.

Kyle, 38, had claimed a record number of sniper killings in Iraq and said in an interview that he had no regrets about the 160 people he shot during his five combat tours in Iraq.

The former SEAL with two silver stars was an outspoken defender of Second Amendment rights and also helped form a foundation that assisted military veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle was killed along with another veteran, Chad Littlefield. The two had arrived at the shooting range together Saturday with the suspect, Eddie Ray Routh.

In a post to Facebook Monday night, Paul elaborated more on his comment.

""As a veteran, I certainly recognize that this weekend's violence and killing of Chris Kyle were a tragic and sad event. My condolences and prayers go out to Mr. Kyle’s family,"" the post stated. ""Unconstitutional and unnecessary wars have endless unintended consequences. A policy of non-violence, as Christ preached, would have prevented this and similar tragedies. -REP""

While Paul has also been known as an advocate for gun rights, his comment earlier on Twitter quickly drew fire for going over the line.

Paul, also a doctor, has a record of defending gun ownership. Weeks after the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school shooting, the former congressman posted on his congressional website that he agrees ""more guns equals less crime"" and that ""private gun ownership prevents many shootings.""

He also came out against calls for more gun control, saying people should not view ""government legislation, especially at the federal level, as the solution to violence."""
http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-obama-preparing-name-comey-fbi-231838985.html,,[],AP sources: Obama preparing to name Comey to FBI,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is preparing to nominate former Bush administration official James Comey to head the FBI, people familiar with the decision said Wednesday.

Three people with knowledge of the selection said Obama planned to nominate Comey, who was the No. 2 in President George W. Bush's Justice Department. The three people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the selection ahead of Obama's announcement, which was not expected immediately.

Comey became a hero to Democratic opponents of Bush's warrantless wiretapping program when Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it. Bush revised the surveillance program when confronted with the threat of resignation by Comey and current FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is stepping down in September.

Comey's selection was first reported by NPR and was not expected to be announced for several days at least. Senate confirmation will be needed.

The change in leadership comes as the FBI and Justice Department are under scrutiny for their handing of several investigations. Obama has ordered a review of FBI investigations into leaks to reporters, including the secret gathering of Associated Press phone records and emails of a Fox News reporter. And there have been questions raised about whether the FBI properly responded to warnings from Russian authorities about a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. The agency, meanwhile, is conducting a highly-anticipated investigation into the Internal Revenue Service over its handling of conservative groups seeking tax exempt status.

Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation.

Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the same sensation as drowning.

Story continues

Earlier in his career, Comey served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, one of the nation's most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines of terrorism, corporate malfeasance, organized crime and the war on drugs.

As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. military personnel.

Comey led the Justice Department's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities, focusing on crimes committed with guns.

He was general counsel at Connecticut-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates from 2010 until earlier this year, when he left and became a lecturer and researcher at Columbia Law School.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had not heard from the White House about Comey's nomination, but that he was concerned about Comey's hedge fund connections.

""If he's nominated, he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry,"" Grassley said. ""The administration's efforts to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal, and his agency would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues.""

Comey was at the center of one of the Bush administration's great controversies — an episode that focused attention on the administration's controversial tactics in the war on terror.

In stunning testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought Bush's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft.

Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality.

Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time.

The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said.

""I couldn't stay if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the Department of Justice had said had no legal basis,"" Comey told the Senate panel.

A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later.

The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, who was the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House chief of staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general.

Comey testified that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital.

When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment.

Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said.

""I was angry,"" Comey told the panel. ""I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general.""

Stop defending traitors!!! Idiot dimwit, stop defending the traitor Chuck hagel. First, he is a ""republican"" so you don't owe him anything. Second, there is plenty of proof that he is a soviet-style communist and possibly an iranian spy. Hagel hates the american military and he also hates jews and Israel. What do you think would happen if Hagel was given all the power? He would immediately start feeding military secrets to Iran and Hezbullah, or even Al Qaida. He would also try to get American soldiers killed in every possible way. The safest thing to do would would be to block the hagel nominiation and them let him retire to Saudi-arabia. Ask yourself if youwould want your son to serve in a military commanded by the Ayatollah? Hagel is evil, he is a traitor and he will use his power to destroy America if givent he chnace.

It would do you well to study your history before opening your mouth again. Eugenics, sir. Eugenics were hard scientific facts. To question it was to question scientific authority of the time. Research it, you might learn something. But lets get more basic. Flip your ignorant, confined little world. Science itself was to question the ridiculous religious law of the time. People had to question the ""authority,"" what people were taught as fact and truth, in order for there I be any ""science"" with what you feel such ignorant passion to defend. Science does not nor will it ever need your protection, sir. You are incredibly ignorant and presumptive to think it does. But your lack of intelligence will surely keep you from responding to this email, as you lack the courage to actually debate something like this. And instead, you resort to monologues of hate, with which you will die clinging to. I wish you a short, uncomfortable life.

All of you are so very pathetic. Why do you live in America? Liberalism -- an affliction brought about by low self-esteem and aggressive self-loathing. These poor souls attempt to mask their dark secret with phony compassion for people they deem as inferior because of the color of their skin. The appearance of compassion is all that matters to a liberal. This manifests itself in many ways, but chief among them is people must be made aware of the liberal's good deeds so their self-loathing can be abated for the moment. If no one is around, then the junkie liberal doesn't get their ""fix"" and they become angry, violent, childlike adults who claim ""victimization"" as an excuse for anti-social behavior.

In any case, notice what's missing from all of these? Nothing homophobic. I wonder if my hate mail has dried up because the homophobes have thrown in the towel. If so, then I lay the blame squarely on the gay rights movement—your recent victories have been so definitive, so overwhelming, so crushing, that you have beaten the homophobes into quiet submission.

Senate Republicans block vote on Hagel nomination

Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Chuck Hagel’s nomination as secretary of defense on Thursday, launching an unprecedented filibuster and a severe rebuke to the White House.

Falling one vote shy of the 60 needed to move forward on the nomination, the Hagel filibuster brought stark condemnations from President Obama and Senate Democrats for its precedent-setting nature -- the first time a defense secretary nominee had been filibustered. The setback came during what many believe is a critical period for the Pentagon as it winds down troops from Afghanistan and implements costly budget cuts.

It was also a hard slap to a former colleague and member of the chamber.

Asked about the Senate vote during an online “fireside hangout,” Obama said that he expects that Hagel will be confirmed. But he slammed Senate Republicans for their “unprecedented filibuster” of a defense chief nominee.

“What seems to be happening, and this has been growing over time, is the Republican minority in the Senate seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything,” Obama said. “Well, that’s not the rule.”

He added that “it’s just unfortunate that this kind of politics intrudes at a time when I’m still presiding over a war in Afghanistan and I need a secretary of defense who is coordinating with our allies” on U.S. strategy in the region.

Republicans predicted they would relent to a simple majority vote, guaranteeing confirmation, later this month -- but only if they see more information about Hagel’s post-Senate foreign policy speeches and his work in private investment groups. Senior Republicans initially scoffed at those demands, first raised by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), as unnecessary, but now party leaders hold them up as the main cause for delay.

Even if Hagel is eventually confirmed, the process marked another escalation in long-running nomination wars dating to the 1980s, now crossing into an area that has long been the most bipartisan on Capitol Hill: national security.

The Hagel fight also demonstrated the Republican fixation on the events surrounding the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya that killed four American diplomats. GOP senators have clung to the tragedy as cause for holding Hagel’s nomination hostage in exchange for more details about the attack.

Such demands are commonplace in the Senate but are usually reserved for lower-level Cabinet posts or for deputy-secretary positions, not for the person who is in charge of overseeing more than 2 million service members — 66,000 of them in battle in Afghanistan.

“This isn’t high school, getting ready for a football game or some play that’s being produced at high school,” Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said during an angry floor speech Thursday morning. “This is - we’re trying to confirm somebody to run the defense of our country, the military of our country.”

The final tally Thursday was 58 votes to end the filibuster to 40 against, but actually 59 backed Hagel because Reid changed his vote to no so that he could use parliamentary rules to quickly reconsider the nomination when the Senate returns from its Presidents Day break Feb 25.

Reid called for the vote Thursday, despite pleas by several Republican senators to delay the vote until after the holiday recess. By calling the vote, Reid set up the Senate to block President Obama’s choice to lead the Pentagon, a stinging slap at a former colleague and member of that chamber.

Reid had initially called for a vote on Friday -- which Democrats and Republicans then agreed should be sped up to Thursday -- to highlight what Reid sees as unprecedented Republican obstruction. Democrats said the Republican push for a delay, even a brief one, was designed to allow more time to bloody the nominee and that, in fact, the GOP will never be satisfied with the amount of information released about Hagel.

Democrats said they also pressed ahead with a vote to fill the Cabinet position quickly, as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta steps down and heads to California. But Democrats conceded that if Hagel is blocked, they will try again after the recess.

“If we don’t bring it to an end today, then there will be another vote a week from Tuesday,” Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the armed services committee, said before the vote. But, he added, “the world is too dangerous to have this period of uncertainty.”

Earlier Thursday, Reid announced that Republicans had secured enough votes to mount a filibuster on the confirmation.

But a number of Republicans who believe it is bad precedent for a defense secretary nominee to face a 60-vote threshold said they would be willing to vote to end debate on the nomination if the White House provided further answers to several lingering questions.

Democrats can return to the issue after next week’s recess, when a number of leading Republicans have said they will vote to close off debate, allowing the Senate to move ahead to an up-or-down vote on the nomination, requiring only 51 votes for confirmation.

“I think that during the break is sufficient time to get any additional questions answered,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said before the vote Thursday. “And I will vote for cloture on the day we get back, and I believe that enough of my colleagues would do the same,”

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told reporters that cutting off debate is “premature.”

“When we come back from the recess 10 days from now, senators should have had sufficient time to consider Senator Hagel’s nomination, and I will vote to have an up-or-down vote,” Alexander said. “I know of many of my colleagues who think that’s enough time. It would be better for the institution and the country if we had enough time to consider Senator Hagel and then have an up-or-down vote, so we don’t get into a habit of making it look like we’re suing the filibuster to block Cabinet nominees. That’s not the case here.”

Earlier in the day, Democratic aides confirmed that senior Republicans told them late Wednesday that GOP leaders had at least 41 Republicans to block the planned Friday vote. A senior GOP aide confirmed that some Republicans who had publicly opposed filibustering what has traditionally been a key national security post with bipartisan support were now withholding their votes for answers from the White House.

“The members still await the information they want,” the senior aide said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s leadership team deliberations.

Speaking immediately after Reid in the morning, McConnell (R-Ky.) ignored mentioning a filibuster and instead focused his remarks on the automatic spending cuts set to hit March 1 — which will include $46 billion slashed from the Pentagon’s 2013 budget.

Leading Republicans, including McCain, have said they would drop the filibuster effort if the White House gives them more information about the actions President Obama took during an eight-hour siege at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11. The attack killed the U.S. ambassador to the country and three other Americans.

Democrats, however, have suggested that Republicans are only focusing on Benghazi to slow the confirmation process so that Hagel — known for a mercurial temperament and as an impulsive decision-maker in the past — would withdraw his nomination.

A spokesman for Hagel suggested he would stay and fight, as did a spokesman for the president, who was flying to a domestic policy event in Georgia.

“We urge the Republicans in the Senate to drop their delay,” Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said. “There is a clear majority in the United States Senate for senator Hagel’s confirmation. These delaying tactics are unconscionable, and they should end right away.”

White House counsel Kathryn H. Ruemmler sent McCain a letter Thursday that largely reiterated the facts found by an accountability review board that examined the Benghazi attack. She added that then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was in contact with the Libyan leadership during the attack “to coordinate additional support to protect Americans” there, noting that Obama called the Libyan president the next day to discuss the security situation in the area.

“We continue to urge the full Senate to act swiftly and confirm senator Hagel,” Ruemmeler wrote.

McCain said Thursday that he was satisfied by the White House response to his question but that he believes other senators still have pending inquiries.

“We are working on and having negotiations now, trying to smooth this thing out and get it done,” McCain said. “I have said all along that we had to have the concerns of senators addressed. I’m hopeful that we can get those concerns addressed and still move forward with a 51-vote vote, because we have never required 60 votes on a secretary of defense.”

On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Reid warned forebodingly that if Hagel was not confirmed Friday, the Pentagon would be without an official leader.

“In less than two hours, our country will be without a secretary of defense,” Reid said. “It’s shocking that my Republican colleagues would leave the nation without a fully empowered secretary of defense.”

The Pentagon says otherwise. Defense Secretary Panetta “believes Senator Hagel should be confirmed as quickly as possible, and plans to stay in office until he is confirmed,” Pentagon spokesman George Little said.

Panetta did little to hide his frustration Thursday about Hagel’s embattled nomination. Hosting former secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the Pentagon for what Panetta had hoped would be his last day on the job, he said he was counting the days until he flies home to California— for good.

After calling Clinton’s visit a “great Valentine’s Day present for all of us here,” Panetta joked that there was one more item on his wish list.

“The second-best Valentine’s present would be to allow Sylvia and I to get the hell out of town at the end of the day,” Panetta said, referring to his wife. “I feel like it’s “Groundhog Day” around here.”

During his time on the Senate floor Thursday, Reid slammed Republicans for demanding more information on Benghazi from Hagel and the White House, calling claims that Hagel had not been forthcoming in his testimony during his confirmation hearing “outlandish.”

However, the Obama administration's Department of Justice has moved to request that such Bush-era officials, and the former President, be shielded with immunity.

Per Inder Comar:



In court papers filed today, the United States Department of Justice requested that George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz be granted procedural immunity in a case alleging that they planned and waged the Iraq War in violation of international law. Plaintiff Sundus Shaker Saleh, an Iraqi single mother and refugee now living in Jordan, filed a complaint in March 2013 in San Francisco federal court alleging that the planning and waging of the war constituted a “crime of aggression” against Iraq, a legal theory that was used by the Nuremberg Tribunal to convict Nazi war criminals after World War II.

Saleh's suit alleges that President Bush and his administration falsified pretenses for the war, failed to get international approval, and began planning for the possibility of an invasion before 2000.

However, the Obama administration would like to shield the ex-President and his officials from such prosecution, arguing that everything done was performed within the scope of their various governmental roles.

Meanwhile, Bradley Manning – now Chelsea Manning – will be spending 35 years in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes.

Crimes Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their ilk helped choreograph.

Courtesy KnotstheFilm.comKnots: A Forced Marriage Story is driven by a noble aim: to give voice to the voiceless. Director Kate Ryan Brewer’s documentary (May 7, in theaters) concerns three women from different geographic, religious and social backgrounds who found themselves in comparable circumstances—namely, being bullied into matrimony with strangers by their parents and cultural leaders, with no way out. It’s a familiar tale of misogynistic coercion except that in this case, the disparate victims in question didn’t reside in the Middle East, India, or another foreign land where such practices are more common. On the contrary, they took place right here in the United States.That such rancid behavior still goes on in various parts of this country probably won’t come as an enormous shock to many, especially given the recent success of Netflix’s Unorthodox, which dramatized the based-on-real-events efforts of one Hasidic Jewish woman to flee her Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and, with it, her arranged marriage. Nonetheless, Knots: A Forced Marriage Story shines a spotlight on what remains an intensely pressing issue, since today, only four states (Delaware, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) limit marriages to individuals who are 18 and over, and 10 states have no minimum age limit at all for tying the knot. The result is a recurring paradigm in which women are susceptible to being trapped in permanent captivity, cut off from the larger world (and the legal rights that might empower them), and denied any recourse for escape. Is Rapper Blueface’s OnlyFans ‘Cult’ Exploiting Young Women?Knots: A Forced Marriage Story provides a comprehensive cross-section of religious victimization. Michigan’s Nina was raised in a strict community known as the Christian Patriarchy Movement that prized dowdy old-fashioned clothing and conservative ideas about gender roles, with men in charge of everything and women relegated to dutiful servants. Nina was married off at 18 to a random man hand-selected by her father, which was basically the same fate that befell California native Sara, whose Muslim father was part of an outfit known as the Group that saw fit to pair her with a 28-year-old stranger when she was only 15 years old. Fraidy, brought up in New Jersey’s Orthodox Jewish community, suffered similar hardship, compelled by her parents, her rabbis, and those in her insular enclave to marry a man whom she barely knew.While the particulars of their experiences were somewhat different—Nina was told that disobedience made her, for all intents and purposes, a “witch,” whereas Fraidy was simply conditioned and shamed into complying—Knots: A Forced Marriage Story makes clear that the basic mechanisms of subjugation were the same in all three cases. The common link binding this trio is that they all hailed from extremist religious environments. Yet puzzlingly, that facet goes largely unexplored here. To contextualize her first-hand narratives, director Brewer provides a cursory recap of 20th century American cultural attitudes toward child marriage, which goes some way toward illustrating how onerous laws about the practice first got on the books.However, not for a second does the filmmaker directly address the fact that her subjects were casualties of fanatical faiths that indoctrinated members about female subservience and then established women’s powerlessness through oppressive and domineering rules and demands.This is ignoring the elephant in the room, and it’s exacerbated by Knots: A Forced Marriage Story’s refusal to even verbally identify Sara as Muslim; a quick glimpse of Arabic writing is the only overt clue to her religious background. Such a willful lack of specificity abounds in Brewer’s documentary, which glosses over much-needed details at myriad turns. Whether refraining from referencing Nina, Sara, and Faidy’s husbands by name, or discussing the means of their eventual liberation in vague terms, the proceedings feel at odds with themselves, trying to intimately probe these horror stories while simultaneously maintaining a measure of arm’s-length detachment that—even if it’s designed to protect Nina, Sara, and Faidy in some way—proves frustrating.Sara and Nina, consequently, come across as sympathetic if largely unknown; there’s a nebulousness to their tales that stymies true engagement with their plights. Knots: A Forced Marriage Story does slightly better by Faidy, who openly recounts the abuse she endured from her husband, and the precise actions she took—involving fleeing in a car with her kids on the Sabbath (a big no-no), and later changing the locks on her home’s doors—to achieve the freedom she increasingly realized she needed. Alas, her account is also sometimes undercut by murkiness, such as her post-escape decision to found Unchained at Last, a nonprofit organization that aids women in situations similar to the one Faidy found herself in at a young age. Brewer depicts a few Unchained at Last press events, but largely fails to outline its origins or mission—an approach it also takes with the Tahirih Justice Center, which is never properly introduced even though its members speak on-camera at multiple points.Knots: A Forced Marriage Story is driven by virtuous intentions, and it lucidly explains how forced marriages are allowed to occur in the U.S. thanks to draconian (and inconsistent) state laws that first allow young girls to be married off—with parental consent—at early ages, and then deny them the adult right to get divorced (because technically, they’re still minors). Unfortunately, so much basic information is left out of the film that it comes across as a rough draft of a documentary. To compensate for that skimpiness, Brewer embellishes her action with cutaways to both painted illustrations that mirror Nina, Sara, and Faidy’s ordeals, and to the sight of an anguished woman dancing against a blank wall while bound up in red string—a visual evocation of forced marriage that’s awkward and unnecessary.Unlike Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s One of Us, which immersed itself in the nightmare of trying to break free from the Orthodox Jewish community, Knots: A Forced Marriage Story casts a wider net and yet comes up with considerably less. It’s a timely documentary whose formal shortcomings prevent it from getting at the bigger picture.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, most assuredly crushing this already shaken child.

According to ProgressivePopulist.org:



Josie's father is currently in deportation proceedings and she is undergoing therapy to deal with the anxiety.

The whooping and cheering of this Tea Party crowd must have been devastating to Josie. I want to cry for her. I want to hold her. I want to tell her how frightened I would be if I were in her shoes. I want to square off with everyone who cheered her family's demise, and ask them, ""Have you no compassion???"". And I want her Congressman to care. But clearly he doesn't, so I want to do everything I can to help a Democrat win that seat in Congress.

As it turns out, Congressman DesJarlais is quite embattled with scandal. According to Raw Story:



Desjarlais is a former physician and anti-choice crusader who was fined $500 by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners after it came to light that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs with female patients. When one woman became pregnant, the staunch anti-abortion conservative pressured her into terminating the pregnancy. Another patient charged that Desjarlais prescribed narcotic painkillers to her for recreational use and frequently smoked marijuana with her.

But court transcripts released the week after last November's election revealed that he admitted under oath to eight affairs, encouraged a lover to get an abortion and used a gun to intimidate his first wife during an argument.

Enter State Senator Eric Stewart.

According to The Murfreesboro Post:



Less than a week after winning the Democratic Party primary, state Sen. Eric Stewart is pushing for his Republican opponent to participate in three debates... ...As of Tuesday afternoon, DesJarlais had not yet commented on whether he has decided to participate in the debates...

""When nursing mothers are torn from their babies, when children come home from school to find their parents missing ... when all this is happening, the system just isn't working and we need to change it,"" Obama declared during his first run for president in 2008. A year ago, he told a Texas audience that deportation should target ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes; not families, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.""

My first question for Senator Eric Stewart: How would he respond to young Josie Melina? Let's hope it would be a compassionate response. Something like what Obama might say Which brings us back to the plight of Josie Melina and her family.

I began to search for answers for this young girl and her family. I came away from my research even more despondent for Josie than when I began. I ran across an AP article written almost exactly a year ago titled, ""Parents Deported, What Happens to US-Born Kids?"" In heart-wrenching detail it describes what can happen to these families.



Nearly 45,000 such parents were removed in the first six months of this year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Behind the statistics are the stories: a crying baby taken from her mother's arms and handed to social workers as the mother is handcuffed and taken away, her parental rights terminated by a U.S. judge; teenage children watching as parents are dragged from the family home; immigrant parents disappearing into a maze-like detention system where they are routinely locked up hundreds of miles from their homes, separated from their families for months and denied contact with the welfare agencies deciding their children's' fate. At least 5,100 U.S. citizen children in 22 states live in foster care, according to an estimate by the Applied Research Center, a New York-based advocacy organization, which first reported on such cases last year. And an unknown number of those children are being put up for adoption against the wishes of their parents, who, once deported, are often helpless to fight when a U.S. judge decides that their children are better off here.

This is the easy part of the story, as this part is filled with statistics and data. The rest contains anecdotal stories that will tear your heart out. I encourage everyone to read this article, as hard as it is.

I leave you with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network's video of the entire exchange between a very brave Josie Melina, her despicable Congressman, and the horrendous Tea Party response. I'm sure this video will work wonders for the Republicans as they reach out for the Hispanic vote:"

He and three other Republican lawmakers declared — without the benefit of evidence — that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be considered an enemy combatant, not a criminal, and should be held by the military without access to a lawyer or the fundamental rights that distinguish this country from authoritarian regimes.

Mr. Graham’s reckless statement makes a mockery of the superb civilian police work that led to the suspect’s capture, starting with a skillful analysis of video recordings of the marathon. The law enforcement system solved the case swiftly and efficiently, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police, and as shocking as the attack was, there is no reason civilian prosecutors, defense lawyers and courts cannot continue to do their work — especially since they have proved themselves far better at it than the military.

Mr. Tsarnaev is a naturalized American citizen, an inconvenient fact for the pressure-him-at-Gitmo crowd. He cannot be tried in a military commission, a legal system reserved for aliens. Even to be held by the military without trial would require a showing that he is associated with a declared enemy of the United States, such as Al Qaeda or the Taliban. So far there isn’t any visible connection between the Tsarnaev brothers and anyone more malevolent. Their Islamic or Chechen heritage alone is hardly proof of jihadist intent.

Fortunately the Obama administration has ignored the posturing and declared that Mr. Tsarnaev, like all citizens and even alien terrorists captured on American soil, will be tried in the federal courts. He will soon be charged with terrorism under federal statutes, and will be represented by the federal public defender’s office."

USA TODAY

General is the commanding officer at Fort Jackson%2C S.C.

Female general from Missouri will serve in the interim

Pentagon has been rocked by sexual assault%2C harassment cases

WASHINGTON — The Army announced Tuesday that it has suspended the top general at Fort Jackson in South Carolina over allegations of assault and adultery, the latest in a string of sex scandals to rock the military.

It was not clear whom Brig. Gen. Bryan Roberts struck or with whom he was involved. Fort Jackson conducts basic training for 60% of the Army's incoming women recruits.

This is not a case of sexual assault or harassment among soldiers, according to Army spokesman George Wright.

According to his Army biography, Roberts is a 29-year veteran. Before assuming command in April 2012, he served in Iraq as head of a unit training Iraqi soldiers. Adultery is a crime under military law.

While the investigation is ongoing, Brig. Gen. Peggy C. Combs, Commandant of the U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School, Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., will serve as the interim commander until the investigation is complete and the issue resolved.

Adultery is punishable under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Army documents show, if three legal criteria are met. An Army member must have had sexual intercourse with someone and either the soldier or sexual partner had to be married to another person at the time. Finally, under the circumstances the conduct had to be determined to be counter to good order and discipline in the military or to bring discredit to the armed forces.

Earlier this month, an Air Force officer in charge of sexual-abuse prevention, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, was arrested near the Pentagon, accused of drunkenly groping a woman. His trial is slated for July. Two weeks ago, the Pentagon announced that incidents of sexual assault had jumped 35% from 2010 to 2012, hitting 26,000.

A soldier responsible for sexual assault prevention at Fort Hood in Texas, Sgt. 1st Class Gregory McQueen, is under investigation for sexual assault and running a prostitution ring, while Lt. Col. Darin Haas, who led Fort Campbell's sexual harassment prevention office, was removed from his job last week after threatening his ex-wife.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has said the sexual abuse crisis in the military threatens its ability to conduct its mission. He has ordered re-screening of sexual abuse prevention trainers and recruiters and directed an inspection of military facilities for degrading and offensive material.

President Obama said the problem of sexual harassment and assault poses a threat to national security."

But will any of the reform plans that include a ""pathway to citizenship"" for illegal immigrants solve the problem? I voted for President Barack Obama twice and I support the DREAM Act. But as a former foreign service officer who has issued thousands of visas to immigrants who played by the rules, I believe there are several things Americans need to know before they decide where they stand on immigration reform.

It's not just 11 million people. A substantial percentage of illegal immigrants are here alone, and once they get green cards, they will be able to petition for their wives and children to join them in the U.S. And if they become U.S. citizens, they will also be able to petition for their siblings and parents. Those migrants, in turn, can petition for their relatives and so on. Not all of the immigration preference categories are immediate, but within 10 to 15 years, legalizing 11 million migrants could result in possibly 30 million new arrivals.

Shadowy people aren't going to ""come out of the shadows."" One of the primary justifications for the so-called path to citizenship is that it's unwise for us to have people living here who might want to do us harm and not know who they are. But the notion that criminals or terrorists will come forward and submit to a series of government background checks is fanciful.

Jobs Americans won't do? Proponents of an amnesty for illegal immigrants often claim illegal immigrants do tough, low-paying jobs that Americans and legal immigrants won't do. This notion is flawed now but will be demonstrably false after an amnesty. Illegal immigrants are currently limited to working for employers who pay in cash and don't ask questions, but with an amnesty, they'll be competing for jobs in the mainstream labor market with less educated Americans, who are already struggling with wage stagnation and a tight labor market.

Affirmative action. Once immigrants from Latin America and Africa have legal status, they'll benefit from affirmative action programs. A 2009 Pew Research poll revealed that just 22 percent of white Americans support giving preferential treatment to minorities to redress discrimination. And I suspect that a huge majority of Americans would oppose allowing preferences in employment or college admission for illegal immigrants.

We already have guest worker programs that don't work. The Senate plan calls for more guest workers with the hollow promise that employers will be able to petition for them only if they can demonstrate that Americans are ""unavailable or unwilling"" to fill the positions. We already have the H-2A visa, a numerically unlimited guest worker program for farm workers, the H-2B visa for unskilled workers, the H-1B visa for high-skilled workers and a host of other visa opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs and even religious workers. Employers know how to game the system to create a phony case that American workers are unavailable. The new system will only intensify the ""in-sourcing"" trend where U.S. employers import cheaper guest workers for jobs they can't outsource.

Strain on social services. Legalizing millions of mostly poor people, many of whom have no job security or health insurance, will put a strain on already strapped social services agencies. A study by the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that 57 percent of immigrant households (legal and illegal) used at least one welfare program in 2009. Illegal immigrants aren't eligible for most benefits, but once this group has legal status, they'll be eligible for the full range of benefits.

A surge of document and identity fraud. Amnesty applicants will have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops to secure green cards, and those who don't qualify will scramble to create a paper trail to meet the requirements.

Half the problem won't be addressed. Up to half of all illegal immigrants in the U.S. are visa overstays. Most abuse tourist visas, but the Senate plan won't fix the overstay problem. The framework calls for an entry-exit system, but it doesn't specify how overstays will be located and removed. In 2012, about 75 percent of all tourist visa applicants were approved, and in Mexico the figure was 90 percent. Even if the border is secured, rampant abuse of temporary visas will continue as long as lax visa issuance is the norm.

Amnesty beneficiaries won't be ""joining the back of the line."" The plan refers to a ""line"" even though no such thing exists. In most cases, migrants qualify to live here based on a family relationship or a job. The Senate plan speciously claims that illegal immigrants won't receive their green cards until ""every individual who is already waiting in line for a green card ... has received their green card.""

When an American citizen files a petition for a foreign sibling to join him in the U.S., for example, the average wait time for that migrant to get a green card is 12 to 14 years. No serious plan is going to ask amnesty beneficiaries to wait a decade or longer to get a green card.

The plan will vindicate those who broke the law. I had the pleasure of issuing immigrant visas to applicants who jumped through all of the hoops and waited years in their home countries to come to the U.S. legally. Any plan that provides the same prize to those who flouted the law is a mistake. The message to the hundreds of millions around the world who aspire to live in the U.S. will be clear: Those who broke the law still got green cards. Their decision to come illegally will be perceived as a smart one in their home countries, which will only encourage more illegal immigration.

Washington (CNN) - Only four out of 10 Americans believe President Barack Obama can manage the federal government effectively, according to a new national poll.

And a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday morning also indicates that 53% of Americans now believe that Obama is not honest and trustworthy, the first time that a clear majority in CNN polling has felt that way.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the survey, conducted last Monday through Wednesday, 40% say the President can manage the government effectively. That 40% figure is down 12 percentage points from June and is the worst score Obama received among the nine personal characteristics tested in the new poll.

""A lot of attention has focused on the President's numbers on honesty in new polling the past three weeks, but it looks like the recent controversy over Obamacare has had a bigger impact on his status as an effective manager of the government, and that may be what is really driving the drop in Obama's approval rating this fall,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.

Does being an effective manager count more than honesty?

""Just ask Bill Clinton, whose overall approval ratings remained high during and after the Monica Lewinsky scandal because three-quarters of all Americans thought he could get things done, even though only about one in five said he was honest,"" Holland added.

Obama's woes are not limited to honesty and his managerial skills. Fifty-six percent say he is not a person they admire, and an equal number say he does not agree with them on important issues. Fifty-six percent also say he does not inspire confidence, and 53% don't view him as a strong and decisive leader. All of those figures are all-time records for Obama in CNN polling.

There is a silver lining in the poll for the President: He's still seen as someone who cares about ordinary Americans, six in 10 say he has a vision for the country's future, and seven in 10 say he is likable–his best attribute of the nine items tested in this poll. But the numbers are down for both admiration and likeability.

""It's clear that views of Obama as a person - once his strong suit - have taken a hit in October and throughout 2013,"" said Holland.

The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

And that’s just this week alone.

“Lost in the back and forth this week regarding whether or not to shut down the government over ObamaCare was a real debate about all the other things that this bill will fund,” Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said in a statement Friday.

Coburn, a fiscal hawk who publishes an annual “Wastebook” report, says the funding bill Congress is currently considering is chock full of head-scratching, taxpayer money-wasting government grants. They include: 35 wine projects, including 10 grants to support wine tasting, radio ads about New Jersey blueberries and funding for Organizing Maple Weekend in Massachusetts, with festivities that include a recipe contest.

Coburn also took a swipe at fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who spent 21 hours on a non-filibuster filibuster earlier this week when he spoke against funding ObamaCare.

“When some senators were using flawed and pretend ‘filibuster’ tactics to defund ObamaCare that were destined to fail, they should have instead been focusing on how the CR wastes scarce taxpayer dollars by funding, for example, studies about how Americans view the filibuster,” Coburn said.

Calls to Cruz’s office for comment were not returned.

Elsewhere,"" Coburn continued, ""just this week the government celebrated Christmas in September by funding numerous Christmas tree projects across the country plus a number of other stupid projects like junkets for Chinese wine connoisseurs and a maple syrup recipe contest.”

In the past, Coburn has come down hard on Congress for agreeing to fund grants from the National Science Foundation that included $516,000 for scientists to develop an eco-ATM that will give out cash in exchange for old cell phones and other electronics as well as another $349,862 for a study that checks out of the effects of meditation and self-reflection for math, science and engineers majors.

NSF spokeswoman Dana Topousis has defended the grants to FoxNews.com in the past, and says Coburn shouldn’t get caught up quirky names of projects but instead try to see beyond it.

She pointed to one project in 1996 called “BackRub,” a search engine research project by Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin that eventually would go on to become Google."

When Barack Obama first took the presidential oath four years ago, his clan seemed poised to redefine the very contours of a first family, with a sprawling, international, multiracial, multireligious group. But the Kenyan family at the climax of his memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” has rarely been seen or heard from since the first inauguration, and instead the Obamas tell a far more conventional tale about a nuclear family.

In the student interview last week, Mrs. Obama shared a few updates from life at home, painting her usual portrait of a tightly knit, education-minded family. The president recently missed a parent-teacher conference for the first time, she told Maggie and the other student reporters. Malia and her parents are currently making a project of reading classic American novels together, from “Catcher in the Rye” to “Tender is the Night.” Now that Malia is getting older, she is recommending more music to her mother, recently introducing her to the pop singer Elle Varner.

As the Obama daughters filled television and computer screens in recent days, some commentators predicted that they would be more visible during their father’s second term, now that they were older. But the reverse could be true: the Obama girls are moving into the highly fraught realm of adolescence, with all of its social and academic demands.

“Now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway, so I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house,” the president said in a White House news conference last week.

The rituals of the teenage years — dates instead of play dates, college tours instead of ice cream stops — may require more privacy and protection, not less. Malia will not depart for college until the final months of her father’s term, and Sasha will be a 15-year-old high school student."

Why did so many Republicans vote in defiance of their speaker on such a critical bill? Well, the legislation cut $20.5 billion from the food stamp program over the next 10 years, five times more than the cuts approved in the Senate farm bill. That provision had drawn a veto promise from President Obama and ensured strong Democratic opposition. But you see, most of those 62 Republicans voted no because in their minds, those cuts weren't nearly deep enough. In fact, they refuse to vote in favor of the bill until the food-stamp program is taken out of the farm bill altogether, so they can more easily cut the program into confetti. That's why groups such as the Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation were celebrating the bill's defeat as a major victory. [...] That's interesting in its own right, but it also tells us something about the future of the immigration bill in the House. House leadership crafted a farm bill that they believed was conservative enough to pass with Republicans and a relative handful of farm-state Democrats behind it. But more than 60 Republicans still said nope, that sorry piece of RINO legislation isn't even close to conservative enough. The result? No farm bill, a humiliated speaker, and a House of Representatives unable to perform duties that for most of our nation's history have been pretty routine. Given that performance, what are the odds that Boehner will be able to pull together a majority of the GOP caucus -- that's 118 Republicans -- plus 100 Democrats to pass a far more controversial and high-profile immigration bill?

[E]conomies do change over time, and sometimes in fundamental ways. So what’s really different about America in the 21st century? The most significant answer, I’d suggest, is the growing importance of monopoly rents: profits that don’t represent returns on investment, but instead reflect the value of market dominance. Sometimes that dominance seems deserved, sometimes not; but, either way, the growing importance of rents is producing a new disconnect between profits and production and may be a factor prolonging the slump.[...] You might suspect that this can’t be good for the broader economy, and you’d be right. If household income and hence household spending is held down because labor gets an ever-smaller share of national income, while corporations, despite soaring profits, have little incentive to invest, you have a recipe for persistently depressed demand. I don’t think this is the only reason our recovery has been so weak — weak recoveries are normal after financial crises — but it’s probably a contributory factor.

These might be as sweeping as planning out sources of water for the West — including desalination plants and more recycling and required efficiency in water use — or as specific as a community identifying cooled buildings where the elderly and other fragile people can go during prolonged hot spells and providing transportation to get them there. It might also include planning for crop losses and other flood-related damage in the Northeast, where precipitation has increased 67% over the past 50 years, or building levees and drainage. Expensive? Very. But the price of doing nothing would be far greater. And that's worth remembering when President Obama releases his expected proposal for reducing the carbon footprint, which will almost surely include new restrictions for coal-burning plants, the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Adjusting to climate change will require clear thinking and significant investment, but if the nation sticks its collective head in the sand, it will find that sand covered by rising seas.

I’m a pro-pipeline senator. As a former mayor of Richmond, a city with a gas utility, I think it makes no sense to be anti-pipeline. But I oppose the Keystone XL project. Although the president’s decision is technically over whether to allow a pipeline to deliver oil from Alberta to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the real issue isn’t the pipeline. It’s the wisdom of using tar sands oil. By most accounts, oil from tar sands is 15 to 20 percent dirtier than conventional petroleum, and the process of extracting and refining it is more difficult and resource-intensive. With so many cleaner alternatives, there is no reason to embrace the use of a dirtier fuel source.Approving the pipeline would send a clear signal to the markets to expand the development of tar sands oil. Such an expansion would hurt our nation’s work to reduce carbon emissions. We have to make energy cleaner tomorrow than it is today. That’s why the president should block Keystone.

Switching topics, Paul Krugman at The New York Times examines how the American economy has changed into one that has a major disconnect between profits and production:On the issue of climate change, The Los Angeles Times praises New York Mayor Bloomberg for thinking ahead and preparing society now for the effects of climate change: Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), meanwhile, says President Obama should block the Keystone pipeline:"

Social media have transformed Congress’s younger generation. (While much of the Senate is arguably too old to know how to use the TV remote, three of the four leaders of this week’s faux filibuster are 42.) Twitter in particular makes politicians even more self-obsessed than they used to be. “Talking about tomorrow’s #DefundObamacare vote tonight on Hannity. Be sure to tune in!” twittered Senator Ted Cruz on Thursday.

Cruz kept demanding that the Senate “listen to the American people,” but he really meant that they should listen to his Twitter followers. A politician riding on a wave of tweets feels as if the nation is cheering his every word, even when the nation is actually reading the sports page while a select splinter of hard-core supporters manically pound away on their smartphones. A hundred thousand people cheering you on in the social media feels like a mass movement. But this is a gigantic country. You can find 100,000 people who believe in a secret plot by Belgium to corner the market on beetroot.

Richard Baker, the co-author of “The American Senate,” says the late Senator Robert Byrd waged a war against cellphones on the Senate floor: “When he entered the room, there was this whooshing under the desks.” But Byrd is gone, and now we have Ted Cruz.

3. Zombie apocalypse. Only possible explanation.

On Friday, the Senate finally managed to vote to keep the government running until mid-November, when we’d get to do this all over again. It’s now up to the House, which will be having an unusual working weekend while the Republicans decide whether to pass the Senate bill and move on, or festoon it with anti-Obamacare amendments.

The majority whip, Kevin McCarthy, suggested that his colleagues might want to join him for an evening showing of the movie “Prisoners.” One Republican aide worried that the media might read too much into the title, what with the country being held hostage to the House’s current psychosis and all. The media are actually disappointed that McCarthy passed up “Insidious” and “Despicable Me.”

Cynics would say that keeping the government going for a few more weeks is just the kind of modest, uncontroversial proposal that automatically vanishes into the black hole that is the current House of Representatives. But maybe there’s hope. After all, on Friday the House members did show they could pass legislation in a purposeful, bipartisan fashion. They approved a bill naming a building in Virginia after a deceased federal worker."

(CNN) —

Satire and mockery are part of politics. Sometimes they attack not the policy but the person, going from nuanced to nasty. But surely not “everything goes.” Promoting violence and applauding abuse – there’s just no excuse for it.

The latest uproar occurred at the Missouri State Fair, when a rodeo clown wearing an Obama mask invited the crowd to cheer if they wanted to see “Obama run down by a bull.”

“As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them,” Perry Beam told USA Today, “…they bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says ‘Here’s our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama. They mentioned the president’s name, I don’t know, 100 times…” Beam was there with his wife and a foreign exchange student who got a lesson in American political “civility.”

The reaction was bipartisan. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a and Sen. Claire McCaskill, both Democrats, weighed in with disapproval. And Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, said on Twitter he found the performance “disrespectful.”

That’s an understatement. “We are better than this.” One hopes so.

JUSTIN LAROSE/CNN Donna Brazile

What are we to make, though, of a Slap Hillary website, suspiciously resurrected by an anti-Hillary PAC? The PAC sent out tweets to reporters in hopes, I suspect, of stirring up the red meat base, get publicity, and solicit money. It provocatively asked journalists, “Have you slapped Hillary today?”

First posted 13 years ago, the site shows a cartoon of Hillary’s face. When a button is pressed, a hand slaps her so hard she reacts like a bobble doll, her head bouncing from side to side as her eyes cross.

The “SlapHillary Team,” which hosts the “game,” says they are “a grass roots, nonprofit organization.” BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski did some research and found its treasurer, Christopher M. Marston, is a Republican campaign finance consultant and former member of the Bush administration.

The Super PAC defended itself and posted a link to a “Slap Palin” website. The PAC isn’t contrite, saying on its website, “We didn’t see the liberal media bemoaning this “Slap Palin” game when it came out! They only care when it’s the candidate they support for president.”

There’s something suspicious about the “Slap Palin” site – a paucity of comments, just 19 in 2008 and only two last year, indicates a set-up. A little more research revealed that the “Slap Palin” is hosted on a computer at the same address in downtown Washington that hosts a “Slap Clinton” and “Slap Obama” site.

We can perhaps relegate the “Slap Palin-Clinton-Obama” anonymous owner to the fringe. But what are we to say when a former administration official and current campaign consultant to one of the major parties promotes violence against public figures?

It doesn’t matter if the website – or rodeo clown – encourages violence against a Democrat or a Republican, a male or female. It’s wrong. It’s vile. It’s one of the few true evils in politics.

Those who promote or approve “slapping” or “shooting” or “running over by a bull” any public official should be shamed and shunned. Virtual violence needs to be denounced and never justified because it’s political.

Still, given the extent of domestic violence – 25% of American women will experience domestic violence in their lives – encouraging people to slap or abuse female elected officials is particularly pernicious. Slapping women so hard their heads bobble is not a game, not even virtually.

We need to go further, and condemn activities that show no respect for elected officials.

Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas’$2 36th District issued an invitation to the rodeo clown to appear at a rodeo in his district. “Liberals want to bronco bust dissent,” Stockman said. “But Texans value speech, even if its speech they don’t agree with.” This isn’t about liberals or conservatives, Congressman; it’s about respect for elected officials, and coupling violence with ridicule.

It’s one thing to use free speech to parody or satirize a politician, and another to couple violence with a deliberate showing of disrespect.

When Harry Truman was campaigning in his home state of Missouri (where the rodeo clown performed), he took questions from a high school audience. A teenage boy asked him a question about their town councilman, called him, “Our local yokel.”

Truman lit into the boy. Politics is a noble art, Truman said. It’s difficult to forge consensus and lead fighting factions for the common good. But this is what politicians do. They deserve respect. The boy was chastened, and apologized.

Knowing, however, that a public scolding by a man of his stature could affect the boy’s self-esteem for a long time, Truman talked with him after the assembly, and invited him to write and tell him about his grades. They corresponded until the boy graduated college.

We have to make our civic discourse civil again. We have to recognize that virtual violence masquerading as ridicule is vicious; it’s a toxic atmosphere we allow by our silence. We hear a lot about what’s wrong with Washington. What’s wrong isn’t Washington. It’s us.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-infighting-fierce-even-western-strongholds-132911234--election.html,,[],GOP infighting fierce even in Western strongholds,"MONTPELIER, Idaho (AP) — Republicans have made the Mountain West a stronghold, which is why brewing party brawls in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah are bedeviling loyalists who yearn for GOP unity.

Closely watched elections this month in Virginia and New Jersey did little to resolve the growing struggle between tea partyers and the Republican establishment. Now, some of the sharpest infighting is shifting to the rugged Big Sky region, where the tea party scored its first major victory, ousting a veteran Republican U.S. senator in a Utah party convention three years ago.

""We have to have this fight,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican facing a tea party challenger next May as he seeks a ninth House term. The struggle will continue well into the next presidential race, he said.

Simpson and three-term U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi from neighboring Wyoming are chief targets of tea party and anti-establishment groups that prize ideological purity above all, even if it leads to legislative defeats. It's not enough, these groups say, that both men hold top ratings from conservative organizations such as the National Rifle Association.

Republicans run little risk of losing congressional races to Democrats in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. But if longtime incumbents such as Simpson and Enzi can fend off their GOP challengers next year, the results conceivably could lessen the tea party's zeal and reputation nationwide. That might encourage mainstream Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who are considering running for the White House in 2016.

On the other hand, a new string of tea party victories could ignite a full-blown Republican civil war and embolden anti-establishment champions such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

All across the country, Republicans are watching to see where big donors, especially from the business world, will put their money and energy.

In Idaho, the Club for Growth is backing Simpson's challenger, lawyer Bryan Smith. The group helped topple GOP incumbents last year, including longtime U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whose seat eventually fell to a Democrat.

Story continues

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sometimes spars with the Club for Growth, has yet to say which candidates it will support. Simpson, however, was a featured speaker at a chamber event this month in Washington, D.C.

If nothing else, next year's congressional elections in the Rockies hold the potential for fierce, even nasty confrontations between elected Republicans and their challengers.

In Wyoming, ""it's time for a new generation of leaders,"" says Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her differences with Enzi, 69, seem largely stylistic and generational. She calls Barack Obama the ""most radical"" president ever. The soft-spoken Enzi rarely employs such bombast, even if he routinely opposes Obama's initiatives.

Cheney's decision to oppose Enzi has dismayed many prominent Republicans and opened painfully personal rifts. Her father is a hero to many Wyoming conservatives. But many other well-known Republicans, including U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, have rallied to Enzi's side.

Enzi's supporters call Cheney, who lived for years in Virginia, a carpetbagger and opportunist. They gleefully point to her early missteps, including a late property tax payment and a $220 fine involving her application for a fishing license reserved for longtime state residents.

Cheney is airing a TV ad that calls her five children ""fifth-generation Wyomingites.""

In Idaho, Mike Simpson is a burly, cigarette-smoking dentist whose district sprawls eastward from Boise to the Wyoming-Utah border, nearly 300 miles away. Snow-streaked mountains tower above hard-pressed former railroad towns and tourist-driven ski and snowmobile resorts. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama here by a 2-to-1 margin in 2012.

Simpson, a more gregarious talker than Smith, likes to say, ""I'll put my conservative credentials against anybody's."" He notes that he voted 40 times to halt or delay Obama's health care law.

But unlike Idaho's other three members of Congress, Simpson didn't vote to continue last month's partial government shutdown beyond 16 days. Tea partyers insisted the shutdown go on, even though it was hurting the Republican Party's image.

They also note that Simpson joined House GOP leaders 11 months ago in backing a resolution that raised taxes on the rich, but not on the remainder of Americans.

Those were common-sense agreements that averted worse outcomes, Simpson said at a suburban coffee shop in Boise, the state's biggest city.

Because nearly all Republicans strongly oppose higher taxes, increased regulations and the president's health care law, he said, the party's split ""is over strategy, not philosophy."" The next two elections, Simpson said, will determine ""whether the Republican Party is going to be a governing majority, or whether we're going to resign ourselves to be an ideologically pure minority.""

That sounds like surrender to Smith.

The incumbent, he says, is part of Washington's ""go along to get along"" crowd.

In interviews and public settings, Smith sticks to tea party talking points. On a recent blustery night in a bare-bones meeting hall in southeastern Idaho, Smith told a small gathering it's impossible to defund the health law as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. Nonetheless, he said, he proudly sides with those ""who are willing to stand up and fight for conservative principles,"" even if their efforts have no legislative chance.

Smith, whose speaking style is earnest and deadpan, has yet to prove he can raise enough money and excitement to beat Simpson. But some conservative state legislators, including Idaho Rep. Janet Trujillo, support him.

Trujillo rejects claims that Republicans can't win presidential elections unless they temper their rhetoric on social issues, especially when addressing minority, female and young voters. ""The party is going to have to get back to its conservative roots,"" she said, and candidates such as Smith can help do that.

The GOP's internal angst in the West also reaches U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. He's the one who rocked Republican circles in 2010 by ousting U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett in a state party convention. Lee accused Bennett of being too conciliatory with Democrats.

Establishment Republicans, including big fundraisers for Romney, are openly criticizing Lee's recent take-no-prisoners tactics, including his doomed efforts to bar money for what Republicans call ""Obamacare.""

Lee's Senate website now depicts a bridge symbolizing efforts to close ""the gaping hole"" in the Republican Party ""that separates the grass roots from establishment leaders.""

Trent Clark, a former Idaho GOP chairman, says the loss of manufacturing and ranching jobs in many Western areas contributes to social unease and an openness to the tea party's ""throw out the hierarchy"" message. Many Idahoans detest a $17 trillion federal debt, he said, and they ""feel there is no more room for compromise"" in Washington's budget talks.

But Republicans who refuse to cut the best possible deals with Democrats, Clark said, ""are not being strategic."" He said he backs politicians such as Simpson ""who can make some headway on these issues.""

That's the idealism vs. pragmatism decision that millions of Republican voters must make in upcoming primaries. It already troubles Dennis Turner, one of the 18 people who showed up for Smith's public forum in Montpelier this month.

At 81, Turner's face is as craggy as the land he ranched and farmed until two years ago. His conservatism is just as deeply etched. He told Smith that the United Nations ""is trying to take over, with the help of our president, and ruin the Second Amendment and take our guns from us.""

That makes Turner a true-blue tea partyer and Smith supporter, right? Maybe not.

In an interview, Turner said he generally likes Smith's politics, but he thinks Simpson has done a good job in Congress. If Smith replaces Simpson as the Republican nominee, Turner said, Democrats might have a chance to win the seat, even in Idaho.

Asked whether he prefers Simpson or Smith, Turner thought a moment and said, ""I wouldn't make that call just now.""

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Senators turn the tables on Caymans investor Jack Lew,"President Obama won reelection in part by beating up on his opponent for receiving big corporate payouts in exchange for dubious work and for socking away money in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands.

So it’s a bit, well, rich that Obama chose as his new Treasury secretary a man who received a big corporate payout for dubious work and who socked away money in the Cayman Islands.

This awkward fact pattern forced a role reversal Wednesday on Capitol Hill, as Obama’s nominee, Jack Lew, came before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing. Republicans expressed outrage about his compensation and his investment — in other words, giving him the Mitt Romney treatment. And Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), an outspoken foe of offshore tax havens, helped Lew defend himself.

In Washington, where you stand on an issue depends on where you sit.

Lew, who was White House chief of staff while Obama’s campaign was pummeling Romney over his pay and taxes, received a $945,000 bonus in January 2009 after a brief tenure at Citigroup — just as the bank announced huge losses and took a taxpayer bailout. Lew also invested $56,000 in a Citigroup venture-capital fund registered in the Cayman Islands — registered in the very building, in fact, that Obama labeled “the largest tax scam in the world.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pressed Lew to “explain why it might be morally acceptable to take close to a million dollars out of a company that was functionally insolvent and about to receive a billion dollars of taxpayers’ support.”

Grassley also asked Lew to justify investing his money in one of the 12,000 businesses based in Ugland House, a five-floor building in Grand Cayman. “There’s a certain hypocrisy in what the president says about other taxpayers and then your appointment,” the senator observed.

Lew’s explanation was Romneyesque. “I was an employee in the private sector compensated in a manner consistent with other people who did the kind of work that I did in the industry,” he said, justifying his payout. As for his offshore investment: “I reported all income that I earned. I paid all taxes due.”

In a sense, none of this matters. Lew’s confirmation isn’t in doubt, a fact supported by the way he sauntered down the hall to his hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, hands in pockets. His answers were often vague but cheerful sentiments (“I would look forward to working with you and others on a bipartisan basis to think through these ideas”).

Lew’s best defense on the Caymans matter was that he lost money on the investment, so there were no taxes to be avoided. But this only proves that he wasn’t necessarily good at selecting tax havens. And his plum job at Citigroup, which Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said has been called “a political trophy position,” is a fine example of the revolving door between government work and private-sector lucre.

Obama frequently mentioned Ugland House on the campaign trail in 2008. Baucus held a hearing on it that year, saying that the place had “a lot to do with tax evasion” and the $345 billion gap “between the taxes legally owed and the taxes timely paid.”

But on Wednesday, it was the Republicans’ turn to display a poster of Ugland House, a modern white structure with palm trees in front. “Mr. Lew,” said Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.), savoring the irony, “welcome to what some of the press have described as the Grand Cayman Ugland House rehab and restoration hearings.”

This time, it was Baucus’s task to inoculate Lew against charges that he was associated with the very structure Baucus had identified with tax evasion. “Did you know at the time it was Cayman?” he asked. “When did you divest? . . . Did you pay taxes on that investment?”

Lew’s claims that he didn’t know where the fund was based and that he lost money on the investment didn’t quiet the Republican questioners.

“It’s no wonder that maybe you and the president haven’t proposed legislative solutions to what you consider, or what the president considers, a tax scam,” Grassley observed.

Lew argued that “the tax code should be constructed to encourage investment in the United States.”

“Ugland House ought to be shut down?” Grassley asked.

“Senator, I am actually not familiar with Ugland House,” the witness pleaded. “I understand there are a lot of things that happen there.”

Yes, and, according to the man who nominated Lew, these things are tax scams.
