In More Than Three Decades At The Paper', 'She Has Served As Bureau Chief In Latin America']","Afghanistan gains will be lost quickly after drawdown, U.S. intelligence estimate warns","A new American intelligence assessment on the Afghan war predicts that the gains the United States and its allies have made during the past three years are likely to have been significantly eroded by 2017, even if Washington leaves behind a few thousand troops and continues bankrolling the impoverished nation, according to officials familiar with the report.

The National Intelligence Estimate, which includes input from the country’s 16 intelligence agencies, predicts that the Taliban and other power brokers will become increasingly influential as the United States winds down its longest war in history, according to officials who have read the classified report or received briefings on its conclusions. The grim outlook is fueling a policy debate inside the Obama administration about the steps it should take over the next year as the U.S. military draws down its remaining troops.

The report predicts that Afghanistan would likely descend into chaos quickly if Washington and Kabul don’t sign a security pact that would keep an international military contingent there beyond 2014 — a precondition for the delivery of billions of dollars in aid that the United States and its allies have pledged to spend in Afghanistan over the coming years.

“In the absence of a continuing presence and continuing financial support,” the intelligence assessment “suggests the situation would deteriorate very rapidly,” said one U.S. official familiar with the report.

That conclusion is widely shared among U.S. officials working on Afghanistan, said the official, who was among five people familiar with the report who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assessment.

Some officials have taken umbrage at the underlying pessimism in the report, arguing that it does not adequately reflect how strong Afghanistan’s security forces have become. One American official, who described the NIE as “more dark” than past intelligence assessments on the war, said there are too many uncertainties to make an educated prediction on how the conflict will unfold between now and 2017, chief among them the outcome of next year’s presidential election.

“I think what we’re going to see is a recalibration of political power, territory and that kind of thing,” said one U.S. official who felt the assessment was unfairly negative. “It’s not going to be an inevitable rise of the Taliban.”

A senior administration official said that the intelligence community has long underestimated Afghanistan’s security forces.

“An assessment that says things are going to be gloomy no matter what you do, that you’re just delaying the inevitable, that’s just a view,” said the official. “I would not think it would be the determining view.”

U.S. intelligence analysts did not provide a detailed mapping of areas they believe are likely to become controlled by specific groups or warlords in coming years, said one of the officials. But the analysts anticipate that the central government in Kabul is all but certain to become increasingly irrelevant as it loses “purchase” over parts of the country, the official said.

Some have interpreted the intelligence assessment as an implicit indictment of the 2009 troop surge, which President Obama authorized under heavy pressure from the U.S. military in a bid to strengthen Afghan institutions and weaken the insurgency. The senior administration official said the surge enabled the development of a credible and increasingly proficient Afghan army and made it unlikely that al-Qaeda could reestablish a foothold in the country where the Sept. 11 attacks were plotted.

“By no means has the surge defeated the Taliban,” the official said, but its stated goal was to “reverse the Taliban’s momentum and give the government more of an edge. I think we achieved that.”

A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which issues intelligence estimates, declined to comment. Officials at the White House declined to speak about the NIE’s findings. In an e-mailed statement, a senior administration official said intelligence assessments are “only one tool in our policy analysis toolbox.”

“One of the intelligence community’s principal duties is to warn about potential upsides and downsides to U.S. policy, and we frequently use their assessments to identify vulnerabilities and take steps to correct them,” the statement said. “We will be weighing inputs from the [intelligence community] alongside those of the military, our diplomats and development experts as we look at the consequential decisions ahead of us, including making a decision on whether to leave troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.”

The Obama administration has sought to get permission from Kabul to keep troops that would carry out counterterrorism and training missions beyond 2014. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States and has made demands that Washington calls unrealistic.

Karzai’s intransigence has emboldened those in the administration and Congress who favor a quick drawdown. The latest intelligence assessment, some U.S. officials noted, has provided those inclined to abandon Afghanistan with strong fodder.

NIEs are issued periodically, normally ahead of a major policy decisions. One issued in 2008 was seen by international diplomats as having presented an “unrelentingly gloomy” picture of the state of affairs in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable that was released by WikiLeaks.

Another one issued in 2010, when the U.S. troop surge was at its peak, also offered a decidedly grim assessment. U.S. war commanders have submitted rebuttal letters to make note of their disagreements or highlight success stories they felt were not being taken into account.

The issue came to a head when Gen. David E. Petraeus left command of the international coalition in Kabul to take the helm of the CIA in 2011. He instructed analysts at the agency, which plays the dominant role in shaping NIEs, to consult more closely with commanders on the ground as they put together future war zone intelligence estimates. The directive was seen by some as an affront to the agency’s mandate to provide policymakers with independent, fact-based analysis.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the commander of international troops in Afghanistan, chose not to submit a rebuttal to the latest NIE, according to two U.S. officials. A spokesman for the general said he would not comment on the report.

Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Afghanistan experts in and out of government have a range of outlooks. The optimists see Afghan security forces expanding their territorial control until the Taliban is forced into a peace deal. Pessimists fear the government could eventually lose control of the capital and other big cities. Biddle said he predicts a stalemate for years to come.

“Whether it’s a worse or better stalemate depends on the rate at which Congress defunds the war,” he said."

""We believe this was an act of piracy,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, adding that U.S. officials were closely monitoring the situation and seeking more information.

""At this point, we do not have information that would indicate this was an act of terrorism,"" Harf told reporters in a briefing. ""Obviously, our concern at this point is for the safe return of the two U.S. citizens.""

Pirate attacks off Nigeria's coast have jumped by a third this year as ships passing through West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a major commodities route, have come under threat from gangs wanting to snatch cargoes and crews.

The U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot (67 metre) vessel owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore, was attacked early Wednesday, UK-based security firm AKE and two security sources said. The company was not immediately available for comment.

A U.S. defense official said the State Department and FBI were leading the American response to the incident. A second defense official said the U.S. Marine Corps has a small training unit in the region but it was not clear if it would get involved.

However, representatives for the Nigerian Navy said they were aware of the incident and taking action. ""We have directed the central Naval Command to see to their rescue. So our men are on top of the situation,"" spokesman Kabiru Aliyu told Reuters.

U.S. Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and are working with local authorities there to strengthen their ability to patrol the region and better share information.

The White House said on Thursday it is increasingly concerned about the rise in piracy off the coast of West Africa.

""More broadly, we are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing.

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has called the region a potential ""hot spot"" after a visit to four countries surrounding the gulf in August. He told Defense News in September the Navy was working closely with Gabon, Senegal, Sao Tome and Ghana to help fight an increase in illegal trafficking of drugs, people and arms.

""The piracy threat is spreading even further through the waters of West Africa, and the attacks have been mounting, even as global rates of reported piracy are at their lowest since 2006,"" said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks.

CONTRAST TO HORN OF AFRICA

Unlike the dangerous waters off Somalia and the Horn of Africa on the east coast of Africa, through which ships now speed with armed guards on board, many vessels have to anchor to do business off West African countries with little protection.

This makes them targets for criminals and raises insurance costs. Kidnapped sailors and oil workers taken in Nigerian waters are usually released after a ransom is paid.

In a separate incident, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Tuesday when armed robbers attacked a vessel carrying construction workers in the creeks of oil-producing Rivers state, the army said on Thursday.

Piracy has regained attention in the U.S. recently since the release of a movie earlier this month chronicling an April 2009 hijacking of a U.S. ship by Somali attackers.

The incident involved a cargo ship seized off the Horn of Africa later rescued by the U.S. Navy, which sent two ships and Navy SEALS to intervene."

USA TODAY

Snowden writes open letter to %27people of Brazil%27

Says he wants asylum in return for technical help

Letter was published online in the %27Folha%27 newspaper

Edward Snowden has written an ""open letter to the people of Brazil"" offering to help Brazil's government investigate allegations of U.S. spying, but on the condition that he be granted permanent political asylum.

The letter was first published Tuesday in Brazil's Folha newspaper.

""I've expressed my willingness to assist where it's appropriate and legal, but, unfortunately, the U.S. government has been working hard to limit my ability to do so,"" the letter says.

The letter was first made available on the newspaper's website in Portuguese. USA TODAY read a version of the letter using online translation software. It was subsequently posted on Facebook by an account apparently belonging to David Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Brazil-based American journalist who was the recipient of thousands of documents detailing the National Security Agency's spying programs.

It was not entirely clear from the letter whether Snowden was suggesting that the South American nation should grant him asylum in return for help in probing claims that the U.S. has spied on Brazil.

""Until a country grants me permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak out,"" Snowden writes in the letter.

He says that, ""Many Brazilian senators agree and asked me to help their investigations into suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.""

In response to a tweet Tuesday, Greenwald told USA TODAY that ""if media outlets want to report what they think is the ""sub-text,"" that's fine — but they should report its actual content."" Earlier, Greenwald characterized many media summaries of the letter to Brazil as ""wrong.""

On Monday. Snowden said he felt vindicated by a federal judge's ruling that the collection of data by the National Security Agency was most likely unconstitutional.

""Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights. It is the first of many,"" the former NSA contractor said in a statement.

Snowden has been granted asylum in Russia until next summer.

""Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world. Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. And the NSA doesn't like what it's hearing,"" he says in Tuesday's letter."

White House has said it%27s likely chemical weapons were used

Israeli officials confirm airstrike on Syria

So far%2C the U.S. has limited aid to humanitarian purposes

President Obama said on Friday he does not foresee a situation in which deploying U.S. troops to Syria would be helpful.

""As a general rule, I don't rule things out as commander in chief, because circumstances change,"" Obama told reporters during his visit to Costa Rica on Friday. ""Having said that I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria — American boots on the ground in Syria — would be good for America but would also be good for Syria.""

Obama's comments come a little more than a week after the White House said it is very likely that Syrian President Bashar Assad had used chemical weapons against his people. The president had previously set use or transfer of chemical weapons by Assad as a ""red line"" that would elicit an unspecified response from the Obama administration.

Obama, however, has cautioned that more proof is needed before the United States escalates its involvement in Syria.

The two-year conflict in Syria has left more than 70,000 dead, according to U.N. estimates. While the U.S. has provided tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to rebel groups, the Obama administration has thus far resisted arming the resistance.

""In terms of any additional steps we take, it's going to be based number one on the facts on the ground, number two what's in the interest of the American people and our national security,"" Obama said. ""As president of the United States, I am going to make those decisions based on the best evidence and after careful consultation. Because when we rush into things, when we leap before we look, then not only do we pay a price, but we often also see unintended consequences on the ground. It's important for us to do it right and that's exactly what we're doing right now.""

Late Friday, U.S. officials told the Associated Press that Israel launched an airstrike into Syria. The airstrike, first reported by CNN, came hours before Obama's news conference in Costa Rica.

It did not appear that a chemical weapons site was targeted, and one official said the strike appeared to have hit a warehouse.

Israeli officials confirmed the airstrike on Syria hours later, according to AP, saying it targeted a shipment of advanced missiles.

""Israel is determined to prevent the transfer of chemical weapons or other game-changing weaponry by the Syrian regime to terrorists, specially to Hezbollah in Lebanon,"" Israeli Embassy spokesman Aaron Sagui said in an e-mail to the AP late Friday.

Korean War veteran Merrill Newman was removed from his flight Oct. 25

China%2C Sweden and former N.M. governor Bill Richardson are trying to help

The wife of an elderly Korean War veteran seized from a plane in North Korea after touring Pyongyang pleaded for his release Friday and Secretary of State John Kerry called his detention ""disturbing.""

Lee Newman, wife of Merrill Newman, asked that North Korea ""return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family,"" according to the San Jose Mercury News.

Newman left his home in Palo Alto, Calif., last month to visit North Korea with a friend, Bob Hamrdla, a retired history professor at Stanford University. They toured parts of the country with official tour guides.

But when departing by plane on Oct. 26 a uniformed North Korean officer boarded, asked Newman for his passport, then told a stewardess Newman had to leave the plane, according to his son, Jeffrey Newman. Hamrdla said his detention ""has to be a terrible misunderstanding.""

The detention is one of multiple ""disturbing choices by the North Koreans,"" Kerry told MSNBC on Friday. The North Korean government ""needs to recognize the dangerous steps it has been taking on many fronts,"" including the ""treatment of its citizens, the start-up of its nuclear reactor, (and) its rededication to a nuclear policy,"" he said.

The country ""needs to figure out where it's heading"" and to realize that the USA is not threatening or acting in a bellicose manner against it, he said.

Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and 2008 presidential candidate in the Democratic primary, told USA TODAY he too has tried to help Newman, who has not been heard from since he was pulled from his flight.

""I contacted the North Koreans a couple of days ago and expressed my concern and they promised to get back to me and they haven't gotten back to me,"" Richardson said while visiting South Africa for a conference. ""There will be more phone calls with other parties and intermediaries in the days ahead.""

Richardson helped secure the release American Evan C. Hunziker from North Korea in 1996.

Noel Clay, a spokesman for the State Department, said he could provide little about the case because of privacy concerns. The USA and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.

The Embassy of Sweden in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang represents the interests of U.S. citizens in that country and is working ""to resolve the issue,"" Clay said.

Americans who travel to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea face a restrictive experience unmatched by almost any other tourist destination.

There are many restrictions on people who visit North Korea, according to rules published on the web site for New Korea Tours, a Connecticut-based company.

""You will be under close scrutiny from the guides and security,"" the site says. ""You can only take a photograph of what the guides allow.""

Prohibited are photos of poverty, soldiers and checkpoints. Any outdoor excursion, even around the hotel grounds, require permission.

Newman studied Korean before the trip and while there sent postcards describing ""good times, good weather and knowledgeable guides,"" Lee Newman said. Before his detention, Newman had talked to North Korean officials about his experiences during the Korean War, said Jeffrey Newman, who described the conversation as ""difficult.""

He went on to acknowledge that this was unlikely to happen.

“If he wants to go somewhere and they accept him, please, be my guest,” Mr. Putin said. “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.”

He added, “Because he sees himself as a human-rights activist and a freedom fighter for people’s rights, apparently he is not intending to cease this work. So he must choose for himself a country to go to, and where to move. When that will happen, I unfortunately don’t know.”

Mr. Putin’s comments reflected an increasingly sober view of the outcome if Mr. Snowden remains in Russia. For the second time, he took pains to say that Mr. Snowden had not been recruited by Russian intelligence — an impression that could corrode Mr. Snowden’s image as a truth-teller and drive away some supporters.

“He sees himself not as a former agent of a special service but as a fighter for human rights, a sort of a new dissident, someone similar to Sakharov, on a different scale, though,” Mr. Putin said. “But nevertheless, at his core he is a fighter for human rights, for democracy.” The reference was to the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov."

But Edward Joseph Snowden found his calling in America’s spy services, using his computer skills to rise from a lowly security position to life as a well-paid private contractor for the National Security Agency. At age 29, he rented a bungalow with his girlfriend north of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and claimed to earn $200,000 a year.

On Monday, hours after he admitted disclosing a trove of intelligence secrets to the media, Snowden checked out of the glitzy Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, where he had holed up for weeks, and dropped out of sight. Whether he has gone into hiding, is seeking asylum with a sympathetic government, or been taken into custody by U.S. or Chinese authorities is unclear.

U.S. intelligence officials scrambled to evaluate the damage and worried about whether Snowden would give away, among other intelligence secrets he claimed to know, the locations of every CIA base overseas and identities of its undercover officers. The FBI is investigating and has begun interviewing his family. House and Senate intelligence committees called urgent closed-door hearings for Tuesday.

Before fleeing, Snowden gave a 12-minute videotaped interview to the Guardian, the British newspaper that broke many of his scoops. In soft-spoken tones, he said he was determined to shine a light on what he called the federal government’s almost unlimited tracking of private citizens’ phone calls and Internet usage.

“I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,” he said to the camera.

Snowden started life in Elizabeth City, a river port along North Carolina’s coast. His family soon moved to a gray clapboard home in Ellicott City, a Baltimore suburb near the NSA’s vast headquarters at Ft. Meade. He told the Guardian that he struggled in high school and eventually dropped out. A neighbor, Joyce Kinsey, recalled him as a quiet boy who often was on his computer.

His parents are divorced. His father, Lonnie Snowden, was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, according to public records, and lives in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, part of the old Rust Belt north of Philadelphia. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, is chief deputy clerk in charge of administration and information technology at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore.

Two people who identified themselves as FBI agents visited the home of Snowden’s father and stepmother Monday afternoon in Upper Macungie Township near Allentown, Pa. Lonnie Snowden, 52, told ABC News that he last saw his son months ago for dinner and that they parted with a hug.

Susan Gross, a spokeswoman for Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Md., said an Edward Joseph Snowden took classes there intermittently from 1999, when Snowden was about 15, through fall 2005. He earned a GED, a high school equivalency credential, but did not get a college degree or certificate.

In May 2004, Snowden enlisted in the Army, hoping to join the Special Forces. He took advantage of an option that allowed recruits to try out directly for the elite force without prior service. He reported to Ft. Benning, Ga., but was discharged four months later, the Army said Monday.

Recruits designated for Special Forces normally go through eight to 10 weeks of basic training, followed by an advanced infantry training course and then Special Forces assessment and selection. Snowden told the Guardian that he left the Army after he broke both legs in a training accident.

An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, confirmed Snowden’s service but said no records indicate he completed even basic training. Platt said he could not comment on Snowden’s claim that he broke his legs in training because it involved medical records.

The next year, Snowden got his start in intelligence by landing a job as a security specialist at the Center for the Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, a spokesman confirmed. The center, run by the NSA, is “dedicated to addressing the language needs of the intelligence community,” according to a university website.

After that, Snowden said, his computer skills helped him get a job with the CIA in information technology.

In 2007, he said, the CIA posted him for two years to Geneva, Switzerland, to maintain security for the agency’s computer network. He lived in an apartment block on the banks of the Rhone River where the U.S. consulate often housed employees, according to Radio Television Suisse.

The CIA considers Geneva an important spying base because it hosts so many foreign diplomats and financial institutions.

Snowden said he began to grow disillusioned with the CIA while in Switzerland. He claimed that CIA officers deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk, and then offered to fix his drunk-driving arrest if he agreed to disclose secret financial information. He didn’t say whether the banker agreed, but the scheme is straight from a CIA playbook.

“I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good,” he said.

Still, Snowden continued to move up the ranks in the intelligence community. His high-level security clearance made him easily employable in the private sector, and in 2009, he said, he left the CIA to work as a contractor at an NSA facility on a military base in Japan.

That’s when he first saw the astonishing breadth of the agency’s surveillance capabilities, he said.

Snowden became a firm proponent of civil liberties, affixing a sticker to his laptop promoting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for Internet users’ rights.

In 2012, he made two contributions totaling $500 to the presidential campaign of Ron Paul, the libertarian Republican congressman from Texas, according to federal records. Snowden listed his employer as Dell, the Texas-based computer company. A Dell spokeswoman declined to answer questions Monday about Snowden’s employment.

Sometime that year, Snowden moved to Honolulu. Last March, he took a job with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor, as an infrastructure analyst at the NSA’s huge mountaintop facility on Oahu. He rented a single-story blue bungalow in Waipahu, an upscale suburb 10 miles from the NSA facility.

Documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, who contributed to last week’s stories in both the Guardian and the Washington Post based on documents Snowden said he provided, told Salon on Monday that she was contacted anonymously by email in January this year. She denied that she encouraged Snowden to leak national security secrets.

“Are you kidding?” she said. “I didn’t know where he worked, I didn’t know he was NSA, I didn’t know how — nothing. There was no like, ‘Oh, do you think you …', no nudging. ... There’s no connection here. We were contacted, we didn’t know what he was up to, and at some point he came forward with documents.”

A handful of agency employees who gave their login details to Snowden were identified, questioned and removed from their assignments, said a source close to several U.S. government investigations into the damage caused by the leaks. Snowden may have persuaded between 20 and 25 fellow workers at the NSA regional operations center in Hawaii to give him their logins and passwords by telling them they were needed for him to do his job as a computer systems administrator, a second source said. The revelation is the latest to indicate that inadequate security measures at the NSA played a significant role in the worst breach of classified data in the super-secret eavesdropping agency's 61-year history. Reuters reported last month that the NSA failed to install the most up-to-date, anti-leak software at the Hawaii site before Snowden went to work there and downloaded highly classified documents belonging to the agency and its British counterpart, Government Communication Headquarters. It is not clear what rules the employees broke by giving Snowden their passwords, which allowed the contractor access to data that he was not authorized to see. Snowden worked at the Hawaii site for about a month last spring, during which he got access to and downloaded tens of thousands of secret NSA documents. COVERING TRACKS ""In the classified world, there is a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders. If you've been cleared and especially if you've been polygraphed, you're an insider and you are presumed to be trustworthy,"" said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert with the Federation of American Scientists. ""What agencies are having a hard time grappling with is the insider threat, the idea that the guy in the next cubicle may not be reliable,"" he added. Officials with the NSA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment due to a criminal investigation related to Snowden, who disclosed previously secret U.S. government mass surveillance programs while in Hong Kong in June and then fled to Russia where he was granted temporary asylum. People familiar with efforts to assess the damage to U.S. intelligence caused by Snowden's leaks have said assessments are proceeding slowly because Snowden succeeded in obscuring some electronic traces of how he accessed NSA records. The sources did not know if the NSA employees who were removed from their assignments were given other duties or fired. While the U.S. government now believes it has a good idea of all the data to which Snowden could have accessed, investigators are not positive which and how much of that data Snowden actually downloaded, the sources said. Snowden and some of his interlocutors, such as former Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald, have said that Snowden provided NSA secrets only to media representatives such as Greenwald, filmmaker Laura Poitras, and a reporter with the British newspaper. They have emphatically denied that he provided any classified material to countries such as China or Russia. The revelation that Snowden got access to some of the material he leaked by using colleagues' passwords surfaced as the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill intended in part to tighten security over U.S. intelligence data. One provision of the bill would earmark a classified sum of money - estimated as less than $100 million - to help fund efforts by intelligence agencies to install new software designed to spot and track attempts to access or download secret materials without proper authorization. The bill also requires that the Director of National Intelligence set up a system requiring intelligence contractors to quickly report to spy agencies on incidents in which data networks have been penetrated by unauthorized persons.

http://news.yahoo.com/russia-rejects-us-demand-snowdens-extradition-092352868.html,,[],Russia rejects US demand for Snowden's extradition,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's foreign minister bluntly rejected U.S. demands to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, saying Tuesday that Snowden hasn't crossed the Russian border.

Sergey Lavrov insisted that Russia has nothing to do with Snowden or his travel plans. Lavrov wouldn't say where Snowden is, but he lashed out angrily at Washington for demanding his extradition and warning of negative consequences if Moscow fails to comply. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Moscow to ""do the right thing"" and turn over Snowden.

""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""

The defiant tone underlined the Kremlin's readiness to challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.

U.S. and Ecuadorean officials said they believed Snowden was still in Russia. He fled there Sunday from Hong Kong, where he had been hiding out since his disclosure of the broad scope of two highly classified U.S. counterterror surveillance programs. The programs collect vast amounts of Americans' phone records and worldwide online data in the name of national security.

Kerry said Tuesday that although the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he called on Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.

""I would simply appeal for calm and reasonableness. We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is 'a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.

Lavrov claimed that the Russian government found out about Snowden's flight from Hong Kong only from news reports.

""We have no relation to Mr. Snowden, his relations with American justice or his travels around the world,"" Lavrov said. ""He chooses his route himself, and we have learned about it from the media.""

Story continues

Snowden booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight from Moscow on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he didn't board the plane. Russian news media have reported that he has remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.

A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. The organization's founder, Julian Assange, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.

A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""

He described the decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum as a choice between ""betraying the citizens of the world or betraying certain powerful elites in a specific country.""

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. had made demands to ""a series of governments,"" including Ecuador, that Snowden be barred from any international travel other than to be returned to the U.S. The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.

""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.

Some experts said it was likely that Russian spy agencies were questioning Snowden on what he knows about U.S. electronic espionage against Moscow.

""If Russian special services hadn't shown interest in Snowden, they would have been utterly unprofessional,"" Igor Korotchenko, a former colonel in Russia's top military command turned security analyst, said on state Rossiya 24 television.

The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.

The state ITAR-Tass news agency cited unidentified sources as saying that Snowden hasn't applied for a Russian entry visa and can't cross the border without it. It said that he has remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.

Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.

The Interfax news agency, which has close contacts with Russian security agencies, quoted an unidentified ""well-informed source"" in Moscow as saying Tuesday that Snowden could be detained for a check of his papers if he crosses the Russian border. The report could reflect that authorities are searching for a pretext to keep Snowden in Russia.

Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.

Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.

Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under President Vladimir Putin.

""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.

Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees."

Story highlights Media reports say the NSA tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders Key questions have emerged about what Obama knew, and his response Leaders in Europe and Latin America demand answers, say they're outraged

(CNN) —

It may not be as gripping as a spy novel, but things are heating up after the latest reports of espionage by the U.S. National Security Agency.

International leaders say they’re outraged and the Obama administration says it’s investigating.

Here are five key questions to keep in mind:

1. Are President Barack Obama’s hands clean in this?

It’s not really clear.

The Wall Street Journal reported an internal review of U.S. surveillance programs that started this summer revealed the NSA had tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders and that the White House ordered a halt to some of it.

That would suggest the President did not know about the programs for the nearly five years he has been in office.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein says neither Obama nor her panel knew the United States was collecting communications of allied leaders, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

A senior administration official separately confirms to CNN some details of the Journal report, saying the White House did not know about the program until an until an internal review over the summer, after which some of it was stopped.

Targeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone, however, did not end until quite recently, the senior official said.

2. Was Obama kept in the dark?

Another U.S. official says, however, that Obama was briefed and given detailed documents describing what’s known as the framework for the surveillance programs.

One targets leaders in specific countries, which he would have been briefed about. It’s not known if the description mentioned Merkel, but countries targeted would have been included.

It’s not reasonable to expect that the President would have been involved in or necessarily briefed on decisions about individual intelligence targets, argued another senior administration official.

Rather, the president approves a set of intelligence priorities and then it’s the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out.

The explanation was backed by a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the Obama White House.

“I really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details,” the former official said.

3. What has Obama done about it?

That’s a key question.

In a USA Today op-ed published last week, Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent “disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships.”

To address them, the President has ordered a “review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,” she wrote.

A report on that effort is due by the end of the year.

As accusations mount and the issue becomes increasingly thorny diplomatically, it’s unclear what Obama has said and done behind closed doors.

4. Who’s upset about this?

The latest spying claims have roiled leaders in Europe and Latin America, who have accused the U.S. government of breaking the law, summoned U.S. diplomats for answers and said their confidence in the United States is shaken.

In Germany, some leaders have suggested tabling discussions of a European Union free trade deal with the United States in response.

In the United States, some have dismissed the foreign leaders’ criticism as political bluster, arguing that spying is a common practice in international relations, even for allies.

5. What would the United States hope to learn?

The United States says its surveillance programs are for the purpose of foiling terrorist plots, but there are many political reasons for interest in communications of world leaders.

For example, some media reports suggest the tapping of Merkel’s phone increased in 2010, around the time of the financial crisis in the Eurozone, in which Merkel was a major player.

The U.S also wants as much information as possible about the actions of other states to make its own decisions about important foreign policy issues, such as Syria and Iran. At the end of the day, allies cannot automatically count on each other’s loyalty.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney suggested in an interview with CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that there is an interest in conducting surveillance on a country or a leader, even a clear ally.

“We do have a fantastic intelligence capability, worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns. We are vulnerable, as was shown on 9/11, and you never know what you’re going to need when you need it,” said Cheney."

In a hurriedly arranged telephone call, Mr. Obama reached Mr. Rouhani as the Iranian leader was headed to the airport to leave New York after a whirlwind news media and diplomatic blitz. The two agreed to accelerate talks aimed at defusing the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program and afterward expressed optimism at the prospect of a rapprochement that would transform the Middle East.

“Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, one based on mutual interests and mutual respect,” Mr. Obama, referring to Tehran’s nuclear program, told reporters at the White House after the 15-minute phone call. “It would also help facilitate a better relationship between Iran and the international community, as well as others in the region.”

A Twitter account in Mr. Rouhani’s name later stated, “In regards to nuclear issue, with political will, there is a way to rapidly solve the matter.” The account added that Mr. Rouhani had told Mr. Obama, “We’re hopeful about what we will see from” the United States and other major powers “in coming weeks and months.”"

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/nsa-report-outlined-goals-for-more-power.html,2013-11-23 00:00:00,"['James Risen', 'Laura Poitras']",N.S.A. Report Outlined Goals for More Power,"Critics, including some congressional leaders, say that the role of N.S.A. surveillance in thwarting terrorist attacks — often cited by the agency to justify expanded powers — has been exaggerated. In response to the controversy about its activities after Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, agency officials claimed that the N.S.A.’s sweeping domestic surveillance programs had helped in 54 “terrorist-related activities.” But under growing scrutiny, congressional staff members and other critics say that the use of such figures by defenders of the agency has drastically overstated the value of the domestic surveillance programs in counterterrorism.

Agency leaders believe that the N.S.A. has never enjoyed such a target-rich environment as it does now because of the global explosion of digital information — and they want to make certain that they can dominate “the Sigint battle space” in the future, the document said. To be “optimally effective,” the paper said, “legal, policy and process authorities must be as adaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit.”

Intent on unlocking the secrets of adversaries, the paper underscores the agency’s long-term goal of being able to collect virtually everything available in the digital world. To achieve that objective, the paper suggests that the N.S.A. plans to gain greater access, in a variety of ways, to the infrastructure of the world’s telecommunications networks.

Reports based on other documents previously leaked by Mr. Snowden showed that the N.S.A. has infiltrated the cable links to Google and Yahoo data centers around the world, leading to protests from company executives and a growing backlash against the N.S.A. in Silicon Valley.

Yet the paper also shows how the agency believes it can influence and shape trends in high-tech industries in other ways to suit its needs. One of the agency’s goals is to “continue to invest in the industrial base and drive the state of the art for high performance computing to maintain pre-eminent cryptanalytic capability for the nation.” The paper added that the N.S.A. must seek to “identify new access, collection and exploitation methods by leveraging global business trends in data and communications services.”

And it wants to find ways to combine all of its technical tools to enhance its surveillance powers. The N.S.A. will seek to integrate its “capabilities to reach previously inaccessible targets in support of exploitation, cyberdefense and cyberoperations,” the paper stated.

The agency also intends to improve its access to encrypted communications used by individuals, businesses and foreign governments, the strategy document said. The N.S.A. has already had some success in defeating encryption, The New York Times has reported, but the document makes it clear that countering “ubiquitous, strong, commercial network encryption” is a top priority. The agency plans to fight back against the rise of encryption through relationships with companies that develop encryption tools and through espionage operations. In other countries, the document said, the N.S.A. must also “counter indigenous cryptographic programs by targeting their industrial bases with all available Sigint and Humint” — human intelligence, meaning spies."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/23/rand-paul-snowden_n_3486455.html,2013-06-23 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],Rand Paul Warns Edward Snowden: Don't Cozy Up To The Russians (VIDEO),"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the few public officials sympathetic toward Edward Snowden, warned the national security leaker on Sunday not to cut deals or cozy up to any government at the risk of losing credibility.

""I do think, for Mr. Snowden, if he cozies up to the Russian government, it will be nothing but bad for his name in history,"" said Paul on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If he goes to an independent third country like Iceland and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this, I think there's a chance that he'll be seen as an advocate of privacy. If he cozies up to either the Russian government, the Chinese government, or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours, I think that will be a real problem for him in history.""

Paul's comments came in the midst of a hectic Sunday morning in which Snowden left Hong Kong despite requests from the U.S. Justice Department that that government turn him over for prosecution. Snowden is being charged under the Espionage Act for leaking details of U.S. intelligence operations to various news outlets, mainly the Guardian.

Hong Kong officials declined to do so, saying that the extradition request did not fully comply with its law. By the time Paul spoke to CNN, Snowden was reportedly on a plane that had just landed in Moscow. CNN was carrying a live stream of the passenger arrival area in the Moscow airport.

Paul has been one of a few public officials to praise Snowden for leaking material on the National Security Agency's surveillance operations. And despite warning Snowden not to work with the Russian or Chinese governments, Paul continued on Sunday to argue that history would judge the leaks kindly.

""I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone,"" said Paul. ""He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution, and he believes that, when James Clapper came in March, our national director of intelligence came and lied, that he [Snowden] was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying. This is a big concern of mine, because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they talk to us, because they have now admitted they will lie to us if they think it is in the name of national security."""

This is a common refrain among administration officials and some lawmakers: If only Snowden had made his concerns known through the proper internal channels, everything would have turned out well. The notion sounds reasonable, as do the memorandums Obama signed supposedly protecting whistleblowers.

But it’s a load of nonsense. Ask Gina Gray.

Gray is the Defense Department whistleblower whose case I have been following for five years. She was the Army civilian worker who, before and after her employment, exposed much of the wrongdoing at Arlington National Cemetery — misplaced graves, mishandled remains and financial mismanagement — and she attempted to do it through the proper internal channels. Pentagon sources have confirmed to me her crucial role in bringing the scandal to light.

For her troubles, Gray was fired. The Pentagon’s inspector general recommended corrective action to compensate Gray.

According to documents just obtained by Gray’s lawyer, Mark Zaid, Army Secretary John McHugh rejected the inspector general’s suggestion. McHugh wouldn’t offer Gray anything because she was on “probationary status at the time of her termination.”

Gray, who worked in Iraq as an Army contractor and Army public affairs specialist, is now unemployed and living in North Carolina.

“I went all the way up the channels,” Gray told me on Tuesday. “This is what happens when you do that.”

In response to my inquiries to the Pentagon, an Army spokesman, Col. David H. Patterson Jr., issued a statement saying that Gray’s status as a whistleblower was limited and that her firing was unrelated. “We consider the matter closed,” he said, calling the Army’s position “validated” by a federal court’s “dismissal of Ms. Gray’s lawsuit — with prejudice.”

The lawsuit was dismissed this week — because Gray dropped it. She could no longer afford the legal fees.

Sadly, Gray’s case is emblematic of the way this administration has handled whistleblowers. Obama came into office pledging transparency and professing admiration for government workers who expose abuses. But his administration has pursued more cases under the 1917 Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined (including the prosecution of National Security Agency workers who tried to register their objections through “proper” channels). And the alleged intimidation of would-be whistleblowers goes beyond those involved in sensitive intelligence. For example, diplomat Gregory Hicks told a House committee that he was demoted because he gave congressional investigators a description of the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, that was at odds with the official version of events.

Gray’s ordeal began in April 2008 after I covered the Arlington funeral of an officer killed in the Iraq war. While there, I observed a dispute between Gray and deputy superintendent Thurman Higginbotham, the man later at the center of the Arlington scandals. Higginbotham was trying to prevent reporters from observing the burial, in violation of the family’s wishes and Arlington’s regulations — and Gray, though new on the job, told him he was wrong.

Gray registered her objections internally — but loudly. She refused to sign off on a report to the Army secretary’s office that was a whitewash of the way burials were handled at Arlington because, she said, her higher-ups were violating Defense Department regulations. She began to learn of other misdeeds by Arlington management and attempted to let military officials know; in June 2008, according to one of Gray’s legal filings, she told the commanding general of the Military District of Washington about “major problems” at the cemetery, involving fraud, mismanagement and broken regulations.

Two days later, she was fired.

A 2010 report by the Pentagon’s inspector general designated Gray as a whistleblower and concluded that, contrary to regulations, Arlington management “elected to terminate her, rather than make a reasonable effort to address public affairs policy issues that she raised” or to “document performance deficiencies that ANC management later claimed formed the basis for Ms. Gray’s termination.”

After her firing, Gray passed along information about mismanagement at Arlington to three congressional offices, all of which received false assurances from the Army that everything was under control. Gray eventually provided her findings to reporters and to the inspector general, leading to the ouster of the Arlington management.

Snowden’s case is quite a bit different, and murkier; his dalliances with China and now Russia raise questions about his motives. But Gray’s case shows that Snowden was correct about one thing: Trying to pursue the proper internal channels doesn’t work.

If the Obama administration wants whistleblowers to take the “proper” route, it needs to protect them when they do.

Leon of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said the N.S.A.'s mass collection of data was probably unconstitutional. President Obama appointed an advisory committee of outside experts to review the agency’s operations; it issued a report last week that recommended curbing the agency’s data collection.

Britain’s security services, which work closely with their American counterparts, have also been deeply embarrassed by the revelations, and one of Mr. Snowden’s more striking comments in the broadcast refers to “1984,” Orwell’s celebrated novel about a state controlled by an omnipresent Big Brother.

“Great Britain’s George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information,” Mr. Snowden said. “The types of collection in the book — microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us — are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go.”

But he also argued that his actions had set off a debate that could help restore faith in those who regulate electronic communications. “The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,” Mr. Snowden said. “Together, we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.”

Mr. Snowden has spoken out publicly before, and his latest comments are in line with others he made this week. In a lengthy interview with The Washington Post, he said he had achieved what he set out to do. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished,” he said. “I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”"

Michael McCaul (R-TX) told radio’s Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that he has told House Speaker John Boehner that he must publicly promise there will be no conference committee on the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

“I am not going to go down the road of conferencing with the Senate bill and I told Boehner that he needs to stand up and make that very clear,” McCaul said on Ingraham’s program on Wednesday morning. “We’re not going to conference with the senate period.”

McCaul said that he believes a conference committee on the Senate immigration bill is a “political trap” that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are trying to set. McCaul said he does not want to be caught in the trap. “I was invited to the White House yesterday and I refused to meet with the President because I saw it as a political trap,” he said.

Boehner, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have publicly left the door open to conference, with Ryan actually publicly advocating for one. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said in July. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

The Senate bill’s principal GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), said this weekend in a Breitbart News exclusive that he is opposed to a conference committee and does not think the House should make efforts to save his immigration bill there. Rather, Rubio said, the House should focus on what Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have described as a true step-by-step piecemeal immigration reform, whereby individual pieces are passed and then implemented before other pieces are taken up by Congress."

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican congressional critics of her department’s handling of the deadly September terrorist attack in Libya.

Conservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States.

At two hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged a “systemic breakdown” cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.

Here are five things we learned from the hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees.

1. What Clinton did the day of the Benghazi attack

Clinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States.

She said the U.S. embassy was “under assault” by crowds trying to scale the wall. American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a “serious threat. Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia, she said, to “beg him to send reinforcements, which he did, to finally save our embassy.”

By 4 p.m. that day, Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack. In the coming hours, she was in meetings and spoke with staff, the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials.

Directing the U.S. response from the State Department, Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government.

She instructed her staff to “consider every option, to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could.”

Clinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi, there were “no delays in decision-making. No denials of support from Washington or from our military,” something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report.

2. U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat

Clinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing.

“Sitting here today, we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you,” she told senators. “We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting.”

Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas, in addition to a few of her own.

Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless

Specifically, Clinton has appointed a team, led by her deputy, to focus on tightening security, sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas.

The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership.

Despite the threat, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East.

“We’ve come a long way in the past four years, and we cannot afford to retreat now,” Clinton told senators. “When America is absent, especially from unstable environments, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, our interests suffer, our security at home is threatened.”

3. Clinton not shying away from a fight

Clinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.

“For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it’s personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,” Clinton said as she choked back tears. “I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children.”

But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday’s talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi, which turned out not to have taken place.

Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton, clash of titans

When Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn’t call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest, Clinton took him to task.

“With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,” Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.

“Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening,” she said.

4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya

Clinton warned the security situation in northern Mali, where international forces are battling militants, has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.

She said there was “no doubt” such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.

She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.

Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to “a very serious, ongoing threat,” Clinton said the “United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.”

Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians, Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.

“You can’t say because they haven’t done something they’re not going to do it,” Clinton said. “This is not only a terrorist syndicate, it is a criminal enterprise. So make no mistake about it, we’ve got to have a better strategy.”

5. Republicans still aren’t buying it

While their tone was generally respectful, several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton’s answers.

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, one of the administration’s toughest critics since the Benghazi attack, took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.

McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn’t read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.

Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.

McCain also blasted Clinton’s answers to questions about the administration’s claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.

“The American people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don’t deserve false answers,” McCain told Clinton.

Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend, saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens, but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.

In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts, Clinton, who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One, suggested the administration might learn another lesson.

“Just withhold. Don’t say what you don’t know for sure until it’s finally decided.”

Sanger']",U.S. Helps Allies Trying to Battle Iranian Hackers,"A directive signed by the president that surfaced Friday — the third in a series of leaked documents published by the newspapers The Guardian and The Washington Post — underscored how the Obama administration is trying to prepare itself and its allies. The leaks also revealed how the Obama administration has put in place a large Internet surveillance operation to identify terrorism threats.

The presidential directive included the declaration that the United States reserved the right to take “anticipatory action” against “imminent threats,” a reference, it seemed, to the kind of crippling infrastructure attacks that Iran appears to be working on against American and allied targets.

The new help for strengthening computer-network defenses for allies, which has not been publicly announced, closely parallels earlier efforts by the Obama administration in two volatile parts of the world. In recent years it has helped install advanced missile-defense systems and early-warning radars in Persian Gulf nations to counter Iran’s missile ability, and it has done something similar in Asia in response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

But deterring cyberattacks is a far more complex problem, and American officials concede that this effort, which will include providing computer hardware and software and training to allies, is an experiment. It has been propelled by two high-profile attacks in the past year. One was against Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s largest, state-run oil producer, and according to American officials it was carried out by Iran. That attack crippled 30,000 computers but did not succeed in halting production. The other, an attack on South Korea’s banking and media companies this spring, was later attributed to North Korea. It froze the ability of several banks to operate for days.

“The Iranian attack on the Saudis was a real wake-up call in the region,” said one senior administration official, who would not speak on the record about the American efforts to counter Iran. “It made everyone realize that while the Iranians might think twice about launching a missile attack in the region, they see cyber as a potent way to lash out in response to sanctions.”"

Gordon'],Criticism of United States’ Mideast Policy Increasingly Comes From Allies,"But the criticism by Saudi officials has been the most vehement, as they have waged a campaign against the United States’ policy in the Middle East in private comments to diplomats and reporters, as well as in public remarks by a former intelligence official.

Saudi officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the Obama administration — not just for its reluctance to do more to aid the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and not just for its willingness to engage Iran in negotiations, but also for its refusal to endorse the Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi and the crackdown on Mr. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood party.

Beyond criticism, the Saudis have been working against American policy in Egypt by providing billions of dollars in assistance to the authorities in Cairo, which has more than made up for aid the United States has withheld after the Egyptian military deposed Mr. Morsi. Mr. Kerry and other American officials have insisted that the United States was right to work with Mr. Morsi after he took office as the duly elected president.

In a speech on Tuesday at the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference held by the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, Saudi Arabia’s former spy chief and ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki al-Faisal, also complained about the White House’s decision to embrace an agreement to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons instead of carrying out a cruise missile strike against Mr. Assad’s forces.

“The current charade of international control over Bashar’s chemical arsenal would be funny if it were not so blatantly perfidious, and designed not only to give Mr. Obama an opportunity to back down but also to help Assad to butcher his people,” said Prince Turki, a member of the Saudi royal family and a former director of Saudi intelligence."

(Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The steel-gray U.S. Air Force Predator drone plunged from the sky, shattering on mountainous terrain near the Iraq-Turkey border. For Kurdish guerrillas hiding nearby, it was an unexpected gift from the propaganda gods.

Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, filmed the charred wreckage on Sept. 18 and posted a video on YouTube. A narrator bragged unconvincingly that the group had shot down the drone. But for anyone who might doubt that the flying robot was really American, the video zoomed in on mangled parts stamped in English and bearing the label of the manufacturer, San Diego-based General Atomics.

For a brief moment, the crash drew back the curtain on Operation Nomad Shadow, a secretive U.S. military surveillance program. Since November 2011, the U.S. Air Force has been flying unarmed drones from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey in an attempt to suppress a long-simmering regional conflict. The camera-equipped Predators hover above the rugged border with Iraq and beam high-resolution imagery to the Turkish armed forces, helping them pursue PKK rebels as they slip back and forth across the mountains.

As the Obama administration dials back the number of drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, the U.S. military is shifting its huge fleet of unmanned aircraft to other hot spots around the world. This next phase of drone warfare is focused more on spying than killing and will extend the Pentagon’s robust surveillance networks far beyond traditional, declared combat zones.

Over the past decade, the Pentagon has amassed more than 400 Predators, Reapers, Hunters, Gray Eagles and other high-altitude drones that have revolutionized counterterrorism operations. Some of the unmanned aircraft will return home with U.S. troops when they leave Afghanistan. But many of the drones will redeploy to fresh frontiers, where they will spy on a melange of armed groups, drug runners, pirates and other targets that worry U.S. officials.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, the U.S. Air Force has drone hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to conduct reconnaissance over the Persian Gulf. Twice since November, Iran has scrambled fighter jets to approach or fire on U.S. Predator drones that edged close to Iranian airspace.

In Africa, the U.S. Air Force began flying unarmed drones over the Sahara five months ago to track al-Qaeda fighters and rebels in northern Mali. The Pentagon has also set up drone bases in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Seychelles. Even so, the commander of U.S. forces in Africa told Congress in February that he needed a 15-fold increase in surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering on the continent.

In an April speech, Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the Pentagon is planning for the first time to send Reaper drones — a bigger, faster version of the Predator — to parts of Asia other than Afghanistan. He did not give details. A Defense Department spokeswoman said the military “hasn’t made any final decisions yet” but is “committed to increasing” its surveillance in Asia and the Pacific.

In South and Central America, U.S. military commanders have long pined for drones to aid counternarcotics operations. “Surveillance drones could really help us out and really take the heat and wear and tear off of some of our manned aviation assets,” Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said in March.

One possible destination for more U.S. drones is Colombia. Last year, Colombian armed forces killed 32 “high-value narco-terrorists” after the U.S. military helped pinpoint the targets’ whereabouts with manned surveillance aircraft and other equipment, according to Jose A. Ruiz, a Southern Command spokesman.

The U.S. military has occasionally operated small drones — four-foot-long ScanEagles, which are launched by a catapult — in Colombia. But with larger drones such as Predators and Reapers, U.S. forces could greatly expand the range and duration of their airborne searches for drug smugglers.

An invitation from Turkey

In the fall of 2011, four disassembled Predator drones arrived in crates at Incirlik Air Base in southern Anatolia, a joint U.S.-Turkish military installation.

View Graphic See where the Pentagon operates its drone fleet

The drones came from Iraq, where for the previous four years they had been devoted to surveilling that country’s northern mountains. Along with manned U.S. aircraft, the Predators tracked the movements of PKK fighters, sharing video feeds and other intelligence with the Turkish armed forces.

The Kurdish group has long fought to create an autonomous enclave in Turkey, launching cross-border attacks from its hideouts in northern Iraq. Turkey has responded with airstrikes and artillery attacks but has also sent ground troops into Iraq, further destabilizing an already volatile area. The Turkish and U.S. governments both classify the PKK as a terrorist group.

Turkey’s leaders had feared that U.S. cooperation against the PKK would wither after the Americans left Iraq. So they invited them to re-base the drones on Turkish soil and continue the spying mission from there.

Neither side has been eager to publicize the arrangement. The Obama administration has imposed a broad cone of silence on its drone programs worldwide. Pentagon officials declined interview requests about Operation Nomad Shadow.

The Turkish government has acknowledged the presence of Predators on its territory, but the robotic planes are a sensitive subject. A global survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center found that 82 percent of Turks disapprove of the Obama administration’s international campaign of drone attacks against extremists.

Officials with the Turkish Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this report.

Pilots 6,000 miles away

The drones occupy a relatively tiny corner of the sprawling base at Incirlik, according to interviews with other officials and public documents that shed light on Nomad Shadow.

The operation is staffed by about three dozen personnel from the U.S. Air Force’s 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and private contractor Battlespace Flight Services.

The drones, which began flying in November 2011, are sheltered in an unobtrusive hangar converted from an abandoned “hush house,” a jet-engine testing facility outfitted with noise suppression equipment.

“It was tight, but we could fit four aircraft inside the hangar and close the doors,” said a former Air Force official involved in Nomad Shadow who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation.

For most of their time aloft, the remote-control Predators are flown via satellite link by pilots and sensor operators stationed about 6,000 miles away, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

While in Turkish airspace, the drones cannot spy and must turn off their high-tech cameras and sensors, according to rules set by the Turkish government. It takes the sluggish Predators, with a maximum air speed of 135 mph, about five hours to reach the Iraqi border.

The Iraqi government permits the overflights. Once in Iraq, the Predators usually fly a rectangular route known as “the box” for up to 12 hours each mission as they beam video and other intelligence to Missouri.

U.S. analysts view and evaluate the footage before transmitting it to a joint U.S.-Turkish intelligence “fusion cell” in Ankara, the capital. There’s usually a built-in delay of at least 15 to 20 minutes. That would give a drone enough time to leave the vicinity if Turkish authorities decided to launch artillery rounds or airstrikes against detected PKK targets, the former Air Force official said.

From the outset, some U.S. officials have worried about the potential for botched incidents.

In December 2011, Turkish jets bombed a caravan of suspected PKK fighters crossing from Iraq into Turkey, killing 34 people. The victims were smugglers, however, not terrorists — a blunder that ignited protests across Turkey.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year that American drone operators had alerted the Turkish military after a Predator spotted the suspicious caravan. Rather than ask for a closer look, Turkish officials waved off the drone and launched the attack soon after, the paper said. Turkey’s leaders denied the report, saying they decided to attack based on their own intelligence.

The incident exacerbated simmering frustrations among officials in Ankara and Washington.

The Turkish government has long pressed the Obama administration to devote more flight hours to the operation and to sell Turkey a fleet of armed Reaper drones. But U.S. officials and lawmakers have resisted both requests.

The Pentagon has expressed concern that the Turkish military wants the fruits of the drone surveillance but has been unwilling to consult with Americans on the best ways to exploit it. “There have been a lot of U.S. attempts to help the Turks get better at fusing the intelligence with an operation,” said a former U.S. defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment.

At the same time, the former U.S. official called Nomad Shadow an overall success. The constant stream of surveillance footage has prevented PKK attacks, he said, and has enabled the Turkish military to carry out more-limited, precise counterterrorism operations instead of sending large numbers of troops into northern Iraq.

“It’s been extremely effective in preventing cross-border operations by the Turks,” the former official said.

Clues in the crash report

On Sept. 17, 2012, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Ankara to see Gen. Necdet Özel, chief of the general staff of the Turkish armed forces.

As other Turkish officials had done in previous talks, Özel pressed Dempsey for more help against the PKK, including more drone flights, according to Turkish media accounts of the meeting.

The next day, in a fit of unlucky timing, a Predator on a routine patrol experienced a sudden and complete loss of power. Drone operators at Whiteman Air Force Base could not communicate with or control the aircraft.

The drone nose-dived, dropping 11,000 feet in about four minutes before crashing into an uninhabited region, according to a U.S. Air Force accident investigation report obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act.

Before releasing the report, the Air Force redacted all geographic references to the location of the crash or where the drone was based. But parts of the report contain clues that make clear that the drone was on a Nomad Shadow mission in northern Iraq.

Transcripts of interviews with the drone’s ground crew mention that they were deployed to Incirlik with the 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. Another document identified the lost aircraft as NOMAD 01.

But the strongest evidence can be found in an appendix to the report with photographs of the accident site.

The images are outtakes from the propaganda video that the PKK posted on YouTube the day after the crash. The photos show several damaged Predator pieces. U.S. military censors carefully blocked out the faces of guerrillas posing with the wreckage."

But by attributing such an order to its top leader, North Korea tried to add weight to its threat.

“We believe they are taking follow-up steps,” said Kim Min-seok, spokesman of the South Korean Defense Ministry, referring to increased activities of the North Korean military units. ""South Korean and American intelligence authorities are closely watching whether North Korea is preparing its short, medium, and long-range missiles, including its Scud, Rodong and Musudan.”

He did not elaborate. But government officials and South Korean media said that there had been a surge in vehicle and troop movements at North Korean missile units in recent days as the United States and South Korea has been conducting joint military drills. The national news agency Yonhap quoted an anonymous military source as saying that North Korean vehicles had been moving to Tongchang-ri near the North’s western border with China, where its Unha-3 rocket blasted off in December.

North Korea might be preparing for an engine test ahead of a long-range rocket test, the source was quoted as saying. Scud and Rodong are the North's mainstay short- and medium-range missiles. The Musudan, deployed around 2007 and displayed for the first time during a military parade in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in 2010, is a road-mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range of more than 1,900 miles, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.

In an angry reaction to the sanctions that the United Nations imposed after North Korea’s launching of a three-stage rocket in December and its third nuclear test last month, the North has repeatedly threatened to strike Washington, as well as the American military bases around the Pacific and in South Korea, with nuclear-armed long-range missiles."

Editor’s note: Jonathan Adelman is a professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. The views expressed are his own.

Despite the rhetoric of the Obama administration and tougher sanctions, hard realities suggest a likely American policy of not attacking Iran but seeking to contain it.

For Iran, the benefits of nuclear weapons are significant: becoming the ninth member of the world’s exclusive nuclear club, spurring nationalist ardor at home, potentially dominating the Middle East, enhancing its leadership of the world’s neutralist bloc, offsetting the likely loss of their main Arab ally Syria and deterring an American attack. America’s desire to stop Iran, meanwhile, is constrained by many factors: withdrawal of an aircraft carrier battle fleet from the Persian Gulf, $80 billion in Iranian hard currency reserves, opposition from Russia and China, foreign efforts to help Iran evade international sanctions, American war weariness, economic malaise, Congressional hyper partisanship and the Obama policy of leading from behind.

Trying to contain a nuclear Iran avoids an unpopular military strike, regional war and harsher sanctions. And most appealing of all, containment succeeded for 40 years with the Soviet Union, culminating in its dissolution in 1991.

There is only one critical problem with the alluring temptation of containment —the Islamic Republic of Iran is no Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a global superpower, with a vast military-industrial complex and Red Army whose World War II victories helped defeat Nazi Germany. During the Cold War the Soviet Union had several thousand strategic nuclear weapons capable of destroying the United States. The Red Army dominated Eastern and much of Central Europe and threatened Western Europe.

More from CNN: Two sides remain far apart

By contrast, Iran is a second rate military and economic power. It reactivated its nuclear program in 1984 and has still not exploded its first atomic bomb. In the 1980s, even after eight years, it could not defeat Iraq, a task that the United States accomplished in three weeks in 2003. With only several hundred atomic scientists, Iran relies heavily on foreign help for its nuclear project. It possesses a modest missile force, weak army and no modern navy. Iran lags far behind Israel, with its strong air force and 100 to 200 atomic bombs, and NATO stalwart Turkey. Iran’s $13,000 GNP/capita lags far behind the United States ($49,000), United Arab Emirates ($49,000) and Israel ($32,000).

Second, Iran lacks Soviet global political influence and ideological clout. Moscow was the center of international communism that embraced one third of the world’s population. Iran’s Islamic fundamentalism resonates only among 2 percent of the world’s population (mostly 100+ million Shiites). It has few state allies (Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, Iraq?) and only two non-state actors (Hezbollah and Hamas).

Third, the Soviet Union was largely rational in its foreign policy. When the Berlin Blockade (1948), Cuban missile crisis (1962) and invasion of Afghanistan (1979) failed, it withdrew its forces. It maintained embassies in enemy countries and a hot line with Washington after 1962. Moscow conducted prolonged negotiations with the West that resulted in several treaties. Iran does not have embassies or hot lines with its “enemies,” supports international terrorism, conducts cyber attacks on Western targets and often talks recklessly of destroying Israel.

Fourth, the Soviet nuclear threat was remote, many thousands of miles away, and slowed by liquid fueled rockets that took hours to fire. Iranian rockets, on the other hand, are solid fuel and only hundreds of miles from their targets.

Finally, there is the nature of leadership. The Soviet elite were dominated by secular college graduates, heavily engineers, who had a rational international perspective. The Iranian elite are dominated by radical mullahs with a limited world view.

Containment of a nuclear power under any circumstances is a risky business. Containment even of the relatively rational Soviet Union almost led to a nuclear war over Cuba in 1962. Imagine what could happen in trying to contain an Iran lacking many of the rational aspects of the Soviet Union.

A rogue state operating outside the normal international boundaries is more likely to take radical gambles. A militarily, economically and politically weak regime, led by radical mullahs with an eschatological world view on the coming of the Mahdi, may take chances for great goals that no other state would ever take. The danger of accidental launch under presumed attack is far higher for the amateurish Iranian Revolutionary Guards than the professional officers and KGB Border Guards in charge of Soviet nuclear weapons.

As in Greek mythology, the siren song of containing a nuclear Iran is hugely tempting and alluring – but in the end may lead to shipwreck and disaster."

Special for USA TODAY

AMMAN — Concerns that U.S. military intervention in Syria would prop up extremist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda were scoffed at Thursday by leaders of Syria's opponents to dictator Bashar Assad, though analysts warn Islamic extremists are growing.

""The American strikes are not to destroy the rebels, it is to destroy the regime,"" said Hozan Ibrahim, part of the opposition movement that includes the Free Syrian Army.

""Aside from some individual cases, the rebels didn't commit any massacres. And this is not definitely not Iraq, this is not Afghanistan,"" he said. ""There aren't that many extremist groups – yet.""

""Yet"" is the point, analysts say. The longer the conflict drags on, the greater the chance that extremist groups expand in number and influence, said Jane Kinninmont, an analyst at the Chatham House think-tank in London.

""There are al-Qaeda elements active in Syria, although they weren't there at the beginning,"" Kinninmont said.

President Obama's administration insists that the vast majority of rebels in Syria are Sunni Muslims seeking to end a tyranny, not impose Islamic law. But it admits that al-Qaeda loyalists who would do such things are operating in Syria.

""I just don't agree that a majority are al-Qaeda and the bad guys. That's not true. There are about 70,000 to 100,000 oppositionists. ... Maybe 15% to 25% might be in one group or another who are what we would deem to be bad guys,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said this week in testimony before Congress.

""There is a real moderate opposition that exists. Gen. Idriss is running the military arm of that,"" Kerry said in reference to Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army that is made up of former Syrian soldiers and others.

He referred to a report from Elizabeth O'Bagy, an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War think-tank, which claimed that Islamic extremist factions are not ""spearheading the fight against the Syrian government,"" but rather that the struggle is being led by ""moderate opposition forces.""

But in rebel-held Aleppo, the BBC reported that a 14-year-old boy was executed in public by Islamists for insulting Islam.

Extremist groups have released videos over the past few months in which they kill locals in towns where they say people have violated Islamic law. Assad said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro that his fight is against terrorists.

""We are fighting terrorists. Eighty to 90% of those we are fighting belong to al-Qaeda. They are not interested in reform or in politics. The only way to deal with them is to annihilate them,"" he said.

Many Syrian fighters believe in some form of Islamic law, not an unusual stance in a Muslim country. But the uprising began in March 2011 as a challenge to the dictatorial policies of Assad, and peaceful demonstrations of Syrians called for democratic change, not Islamic law.

It was not until Assad responded by killing and arresting demonstrators that the opposition movement took up arms.

Kinninmont said the Syrian government has long been sending the message internationally that it is a force for stability and is keeping al-Qaeda and other sectarian ideological groups in check.

""It's quite ironic that the Assad government said that everyone opposed to them is a foreign-backed terrorist and over time, more foreign-backed terrorists have become involved,"" she said

Among the foreign fighters in Syria are groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, which swears allegiance to al-Qaeda and is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Also in Syria is the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and jihadists from Chechnya, Pakistan and other countries have answered the call of al-Qaeda to fight Assad.

Al-Qaeda is a Sunni Muslim terror group that seeks to establish Islamic theocracies in all Muslim countries. Its adherents have shown up in many Arab states where uprisings have taken place, such as Yemen, Iraq and Egypt, and attempted to impose its authority.

In Syria, the extremists fight in their own units and sometimes coordinate their operations with the Free Syrian Army. They have taken control of the city of A Raqqa in the north of the country, instituting a council and sharia courts.

These extremist groups are better funded, equipped and trained than local fighters, says the Free Syrian Army, which itself is made up of hundreds of independent units. The extremist fighters have made headway in some areas of Syria such as Idlib province.

As a result, Syrians are leaving areas increasingly affected by extremist clashes for control over strategic areas close to the Iraqi border in droves. Last month, thousands of refugees fled escalating violence between extremist groups and Kurdish militias as well as the Free Syrian Army in northeastern Syria crossing into Iraqi Kurdistan.

Some scoffed at these worries and said they had bigger concerns due to the anticipated military strikes by the United States in retaliation for Assad's alleged gassing of a rebel stronghold with chemical weapons.

Speaking on NBC's ""Tonight Show,"" broadcast Tuesday evening, Obama told host Jay Leno that Americans should go ahead with summer travel plans abroad despite global travel warnings. But he said they should ""show some common sense"" and recognize that some countries are more dangerous than others.

He didn't specify which countries posed the greatest threat. He also wouldn't say whether the U.S. learned of the threat through National Security Agency Surveillance programs. Nineteen U.S. embassies and consulates in 16 countries have been ordered closed to the public until Saturday.

Obama also made his first comments about National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, saying that he was ""disappointed"" that Russia granted him temporary asylum.

""There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality,"" Obama said.

Snowden, an ex-NSA systems analyst, is accused of leaking details about highly-secretive government surveillance programs. He spent several weeks in the transit zone of a Moscow airport before being granted asylum for a year.

Obama also lauded two of his former political rivals: former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

When Leno brought up a White House lunch that Clinton and Obama shared last week, Obama acknowledged that he had invited the former Secretary of State, saying Clinton ""had that post-administration glow ... when folks leave the White House like two weeks later, they look great.""

The president also discussed the status of Obamacare, and maintained that previously uninsured Americans would be eligible to sign up to receive health insurance on October 1."

Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who leaked top-secret documents about U.S. surveillance programs, fled Hong Kong for Moscow on Sunday with the assistance of the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks and asked the government of Ecuador to grant him asylum.

Snowden’s ultimate destination was uncertain, but Ricardo Patiño, Ecuador’s foreign minister, tweeted Sunday afternoon that his government had received a request for asylum from Snowden. WikiLeaks released a statement saying Snowden was “bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum.”

According to the Associated Press, Snowden is set to leave Moscow for Havana Monday on an Aeroflot flight that leaves at 2:05 p.m. (6:05 a.m. EDT).

Despite U.S. officials’ insistence that Snowden’s passport was revoked Saturday, the Hong Kong government said Sunday that he left “on his own accord for a third country.”

Aeroflot told the Associated Press that Snowden registered for the flight on Sunday using his U.S. passport.

The United States charged Snowden with espionage on June 21. Guardian via AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Ecuadoran diplomats were at Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Snowden landed aboard an Aeroflot flight about 5:05 p.m. (9:05 a.m. EDT). It was not clear whether they were meeting with Snowden or with others who accompanied him. Snowden did not have a Russian visa, according to several sources, so he was confined to a transit area within the airport.

WikiLeaks, which has published hundreds of thousands of classified documents over the past several years, said it is aiding Snowden in his bid to avoid a return to the United States. Snowden, 30, had fled to Hong Kong, where he revealed two weeks ago that he was the source of leaked National Security Agency documents. Federal prosecutors in Virginia filed espionage charges against him June 14 and had asked Hong Kong to detain him.

“The U.S. is disappointed and disagrees with the determination by Hong Kong authorities not to honor the U.S. request for the arrest of the fugitive, Edward J. Snowden,” a Justice Department spokesman said Sunday. The spokesman, who declined to be identified, added that authorities in the United States and Hong Kong had “been in continual contact” since June 10, when the Justice Department learned that Snowden was in the Chinese territory.

WikiLeaks said Snowden was accompanied on his flight to Moscow by Sarah Harrison, who the organization said is a British citizen, journalist and researcher working with the WikiLeaks legal defense team.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic investigative journalist and spokesman for WikiLeaks, said in a phone interview that Snowden would overnight in Moscow, which he described as “not a final destination.” He declined to say when Snowden would be departing or where his final stop would be.

Hrafnsson said he established contact with Snowden last week while the American was in Hong Kong. Arrangements were made for Harrison to meet Snowden in Hong Kong and accompany him out. Harrison was still with Snowden in Moscow, Hrafnsson said.

“The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden’s rights and protecting him as a person,” said Baltasar Garzón, legal director of WikiLeaks and attorney for Julian Assange, the group’s founder, who has spent the past year holed up in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. “What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange — for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest — is an assault against the people.”

View Graphic The flight of Edward Snowden

U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ongoing diplomacy regarding Snowden, said his passport had been revoked before he left Hong Kong.

The State Department said privacy laws prevented it from commenting on Snowden’s passport.

“As is routine and consistent with U.S. regulations, persons with felony arrest warrants are subject to having their passport revoked,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. “. . . Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States.”

But the Interfax news agency, quoting a Russian law enforcement source, said Snowden could continue on his journey from Moscow without a U.S. passport if the country where he was seeking asylum provided him with travel documents. Those documents could include affirmation of refugee status, Interfax reported, or even a passport from the destination country.

In a statement Sunday night, NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said: “We are disappointed by the decision of the authorities in Hong Kong to permit Mr. Snowden to flee despite the legally valid U.S. request to arrest him for purposes of his extradition under the U.S.-Hong Kong Surrender Agreement. We have registered our strong objections to the authorities in Hong Kong as well as to the Chinese government through diplomatic channels and noted that such behavior is detrimental to U.S.-Hong Kong and U.S.-China bilateral relations.”

Given Russia’s recent intense cooperation with the United States after the Boston Marathon bombing and the nation’s history of working with Russia on law enforcement matters, she added, “We expect the Russian Government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.”

Russia’s role under fire

The apparent cooperation of the Russian government in Snowden’s attempt to avoid extradition to the United States outraged some members of Congress.

“What’s infuriating here is [President Vladimir] Putin of Russia aiding and abetting Snowden’s escape,” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“The bottom line is very simple,” Schumer said. “Allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways, and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran and now, of course, with Snowden. That’s not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.”

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) agreed that Sunday’s events call “into question what kind of relationship we ever have had with China and Russia. We pretend that everything is hunky-dory when it is not. It isn’t with China. It isn’t with Russia. It certainly isn’t with Cuba, with Venezuela nor with Ecuador.”

She added: “These are countries that violate press freedoms every day. And yet [Snowden]’s seeking political asylum in those very countries where . . . if he were to pull a Snowden in these countries, they’d jail him immediately.”

Hong Kong’s government said that the U.S. request for a warrant for Snowden’s arrest “did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law” and that it had asked for “additional information.”

“As the HKSAR Government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong,” the statement said.

A senior Justice Department official disputed that claim. “The request met the requirements of the agreement,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “They came back to us late Friday with additional questions, and we were in the process of responding. Obviously, this raises concerns for us, and we will continue to discuss this with the authorities there.”

The United States had asked Hong Kong to issue a provisional arrest warrant and filed charges against Snowden, including theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

If Snowden is relocating to Ecuador, he will have limited travel options. There are no direct flights from Moscow to Quito, and many would-be layover destinations would probably heed Washington’s request to detain him. One likely exception would be Havana. There are direct flights from Moscow to Havana five days a week, including Mondays, and a direct flight from Havana to Quito on Fridays.

Patiño, the Ecuadoran foreign minister, recently said Quito would be willing to consider an asylum claim by Snowden. Speaking at a news conference in London after visiting Assange last Monday, Patiño suggested that his nation would approve such a request.

On Monday, Patiño was in Vietnam and said that the nation is “in touch with the highest authorities of Russia” about an asylum claim from Snowden, according to the Associated Press. He said that the request “has to do with freedom of expression and with the security of citizens around the world,” and that Ecuador will not make its decision based on its relationship with the United States.

“There are some governments that act more upon their own interests, but we do not,” Patiño said, according to the Associated Press. “We act upon our principles.”

He added, “We take care of the human rights of the people.”

Assange has been unable to leave the Ecuadoran Embassy because Britain has refused to provide him safe passage while he is sought by Sweden for questioning about sexual-assault allegations.

U.S. relations with Ecuador

Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has emerged as one of the most vehement critics of U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere. In 2011, his administration expelled the American ambassador in Quito to protest a cable released by WikiLeaks that alleged the Ecuadoran police force was rife with corruption.

The extradition treaty between the United States and Ecuador, signed in 1872, states that offenses of “a political character” do not warrant extradition — much like the United States’ agreement with Hong Kong.

It’s unclear whether the Chinese leadership in Beijing had any role in Hong Kong’s decision to let Snowden leave. Hong Kong is a semiautonomous region that prides itself on its independent legal system, but the government ultimately answers to the mainland, whose influence can be difficult to discern. Residents in Hong Kong are deeply resistant to any overt sign of interference from the Communist Party.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said in a statement Sunday that it had seen the reports of Snowden’s departure and would continue to pay attention to developments but did not have “specific details.” The government added that it was “deeply concerned” about reports of U.S. government cyberattacks on China, saying they “proved that China is a victim of cyberattacks.”

http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-kerrys-off-hand-remark-put-deal-syria-011440151.html,,[],Analysis: How Kerry's off-hand remark put a deal on Syria in play,"By Matt Spetalnick and Arshad Mohammed WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whether deft diplomacy or a rhetorical stumble, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has managed to crack open the door to a possible solution to the Syrian crisis that could get President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers out of a bind, save Syria from a bombing and cast Russia as peacemaker. Kerry's seemingly off-hand suggestion on Monday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad might avert a U.S. military strike if he surrendered all of his chemical weapons offered a potential escape hatch that no one had seriously proposed before - and that could end up leading nowhere. But in a sign of how desperate the United States, Russia, Syria and the United Nations are to defuse the international standoff over Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war last month, momentum for Kerry's suggestion seemed to build instantly. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov seized upon the idea, issuing a proposal for putting Syria's chemical stockpile under international control. Positive to lukewarm reaction flowed in from the White House, Assad's government and the United Nations. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties expressed hope that a diplomatic solution would help them avoid a vote to either attack Syria - a plan most Americans oppose - or go against Obama's plea for authorization to attack. By late afternoon, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 - was speaking out on the Syrian conflict for the first time, saying that a plan to rid Assad of his stock of chemical weapons had potential. Even as Obama used a half-dozen interviews with television networks to continue pressing his case for military action in Syria and made plans for a nationally broadcast speech to Americans on Tuesday night, the sudden prospect of a deal with Russia dominated the conversation in Washington. During an interview with NBC, Obama signaled that he might have to adjust his approach because of the Russian proposal. He told NBC that the proposal was ""potentially positive,"" but said that ""we have to be skeptical,"" a reflection of the many questions surrounding the plan. A 'WELCOME WRENCH' Obama and several lawmakers said it was important for Congress to move forward with its debate over authorizing U.S. military force in Syria. By all appearances, Obama has been losing that debate. Vote count estimates by The Washington Post and The New York Times, among others, indicate that far more members of Congress oppose military action in Syria than support it - a reflection of Americans' wariness of engagement in another conflict in the Middle East. The ongoing debate over military force could give the United States some leverage in any discussions of a deal with Russia, according to Obama and key lawmakers such as Arizona Senator John McCain. However, Middle East analysts said that the idea of sequestering Assad's chemical weapons almost certainly would complicate Obama's efforts to win Congress' approval for military force. ""It basically throws a bit of a wrench into the administration's approach, but it may be a welcome wrench,"" said Robert Danin, a Middle East specialist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. A 'FANTASY' PROPOSAL? Monday's drama began when Kerry, after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary William Hague, was asked by a reporter how military strikes on Syria might be averted. Kerry said that Assad ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week …. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done."" Perhaps not. But by merely floating the idea in what the State Department said was just an attempt to make a rhetorical point, America's top diplomat suddenly gave it credence. After Lavrov responded with his proposal, Kerry called him and said that U.S. officials were ""not going to play games,"" but that if the Russian proposal was serious, ""we will take a look,"" a senior State Department official said. White House officials also expressed doubts about Assad's credibility in such a deal, but acknowledged that the idea was in play. Clinton - who had met with Obama earlier in the day - then used a speech on wildlife preservation to suggest that the United States was interested in a solution that would rid Syria of chemical weapons. To some analysts, it all sounded far-fetched. A senior European security official deemed it a ""fantasy"" and said it would be ""impossible to verify"" whether Syria would give up its chemical weapons. A former senior U.S. intelligence expert said there was no full accounting of Assad's stockpile and where it is stored. NO MASTER PLAN BY KERRY For Obama, however, a deal brokered by Russia could mean at least a temporary way out of a crisis that he helped to create. Last year, Obama declared that Assad would cross a ""red line"" for U.S. action if the Syrian president used chemical weapons in a civil war that now has gone on for 2 1/2 years and killed an estimated 100,000 people. For Assad, such a deal could be a chance to delay or prevent a U.S.-led missile strike that could weaken Assad's loyalists in their fight against rebel forces. Assad would, however, be under extreme pressure to make good on any pledge to identify and relinquish his chemical weapons. And even though its Syrian ally is accused of using chemical weapons, Russia would have a chance to be seen as a peace-enabler while continuing to shield Syria from U.S. retribution for last month's gas attack. If Russia's proposal leads to a deal, Kerry's utterance that inspired the proposal could become a historic moment in U.S. diplomacy - and an ironic symbol of how his spontaneous comments sometimes have complicated the Obama administration's efforts to sell the notion that military action in Syria is necessary. Kerry, a former senator who joined the administration in February and became its most forceful voice for tougher action against Assad, faced criticism last week for initially refusing to rule out American ""boots on the ground"" in Syria before backtracking and accepting that restriction. A senior U.S. official said that Kerry's remarks Monday about Assad giving up chemical weapons were not part of some carefully crafted diplomatic strategy aimed at finding a way out of the Syria impasse. Kerry, the official said, was simply emphasizing what he saw as the unlikely possibility that Assad would give up such weapons. ""Then,"" the official said, ""it kind of took off.""

As the Obama administration and the U.S. military plot military action against Syria, they should be spending just as much time — and arguably more — considering what happens next. Once Washington crosses the threshold of action, there’s no retreating from blame for anything that follows, whether through action or inaction. And in the weeks and months to come, dangers will only deepen.

First, quick hits rarely achieve enduring political goals — and often produce more costs or unintended consequences than benefits. I’ve seen it so often before.

I lived in Lebanon in the fall of 1983 when the Reagan administration ordered the Marine peacekeepers deployed in Beirut to open fire on a Muslim militia. The commander bluntly warned Washington that a strike would have dire consequences for U.S. policy and his troops. “We’ll get slaughtered down here,” he predicted. Nonetheless, the cruiser Virginia stationed offshore fired 70 deafening rounds on the Lebanese fighters.

It was supposed to be a quick hit. It was supposed to send a warning.

But 34 days later, on Oct. 23, a yellow Mercedes truck carrying the equivalent of 6 tons of explosives drove into the Marine barracks as the peacekeepers slept. In my head, I can still hear the thundering bomb blast. It was the single largest nonnuclear explosion anywhere since World War II. It produced the largest loss of American military life in a single incident since Iwo Jima.

Four months later, the world’s mightiest military was ordered to leave Lebanon, its mission incomplete. The embryo of what became Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, had forced the retreat of American, French, Italian and British troops.

This time in Syria, Washington may again consider its action limited and specifically targeted. But Syria and its allies, notably Hezbollah, surely won’t. And they can respond in many ways.

The last five presidents have tried limited strikes with specific messages in various crisis spots, many in the Middle East. The track record is pretty sorry for both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Again during the Reagan administration, I reported on the 1986 U.S. airstrikes against Libya for bombing a Berlin disco, a hangout for American troops. Three had been killed and more than 200 injured in the blast, not all Americans. Ten days later, U.S. airstrikes sent a kinetic message to Moammar Kadafi about the costs of terrorism.

Operation El Dorado Canyon hit Kadafi’s military headquarters and other military targets in Tripoli and Benghazi, although several bombs missed their targets and hit civilian areas. The strikes did little to end the outrages. Two years later, Libya masterminded the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people. And Kadafi remained in power another quarter-century.

In 1998, I covered Operation Desert Fox, when the Clinton administration launched four days of cruise missile and bombing strikes against Iraq. Saddam Hussein’s regime had failed to comply with United Nations resolutions and weapons inspectors for a year. The goal was to “degrade” Baghdad’s ability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction and to destabilize Hussein’s hold on power.

Advertisement

The impact was negligible. Hussein held on for five more years, until the George W. Bush administration launched a ground invasion that cost hundreds of billions of dollars and nearly 4,500 American lives over the next eight years.

And in the end, the United States discovered that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction anymore.

I also covered Operation Infinite Reach, when the Clinton administration ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in 1998. It was a response to twin bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Twelve Americans had been among the 224 killed.

But a year later, I was in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden’s camps were still thriving. The U.S. strikes had made him even more popular and powerful on the terrorist circuit. And he skillfully adapted Al Qaeda’s tactics. In 2000, a suicide dinghy struck the U.S. destroyer Cole docked in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. And then the 9/11 suicide planes, the most successful attack against the United States since Pearl Harbor. Bin Laden may be dead, but the franchises born of his movement are thriving from North Africa to the Persian Gulf.

So the idea of quick hits or short campaigns is often an illusion. The one notable success was the 2011 air campaign that helped oust Kadafi. But it had the full endorsement of the Arab League, the United Nations and , NATO, which ran the international mission. Thousands of Libyans actually did the fighting, while the Transitional National Council provided a viable alternative government from inside the country. And still Operation Unified Protector lasted 222 days.

In the case of Syria, a few days of strikes against military targets may assuage moral outrage over its heinous use of chemical weapons. But they also carry the danger of widening the war by legitimizing or deepening involvement by other foreign powers, notably Iranian and Russian support for Damascus.

I lived in Beirut during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon to evict the Palestine Liberation Organization. It achieved the immediate goal, yet Operation Peace for Galilee also backfired: Iran deployed Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon and created Hezbollah, which ultimately drove out both Israeli troops and American peacekeepers. It was Israel’s first retreat — made voluntarily due to inexorable costs — in the long Arab-Israeli dispute.

So, as the U.S. and its allies take on Syria, they need to ensure that the costs do not ultimately outweigh the benefits, and that another military mission doesn’t backfire.

Spokesmen for the White House and Pentagon declined to comment.

Within the Obama administration, the way the United States extricates itself from Afghanistan has been a source of tension between civilian and military officials since Mr. Obama took office. American commanders in Afghanistan have generally pushed to keep as many American troops in the country as long as possible, creating friction with White House officials urging a speedier military withdrawal.

But with frustrations mounting over the glacial pace of initiating peace talks with the Taliban, and with American relations with the Karzai government continuing to deteriorate, it is unclear whether the Pentagon and American commanders in Afghanistan would vigorously resist if the White House pushed for a full-scale pullout months ahead of schedule.

As it stands, the number of American troops in Afghanistan — around 63,000 — is scheduled to go down to 34,000 by February 2014. The White House has said the vast majority of troops would be out of Afghanistan by the end of that year, although it now appears that the schedule could accelerate to bring the bulk of the troops — if not all of them — home by next summer, as the annual fighting season winds down.

Talks between the United States and Afghanistan over a long-term security deal have faltered in recent months over the Afghan government’s insistence that the United States guarantee Afghanistan’s security and, in essence, commit to declaring Pakistan the main obstacle in the fight against militancy in the region.

The guarantees sought by Afghanistan, if implemented, could possibly compel the United States to attack Taliban havens in Pakistan long after 2014, when the Obama administration has said it hoped to dial back the C.I.A.’s covert drone war there."

The strategy, which does not focus exclusively on cyber theft, seeks to improve coordination of existing efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies and the State and Justice departments, but it does not include new penalties or sanctions.

Obama last week signed an executive order for the government to share more classified information about cyber threats with U.S. companies that own or operate crucial infrastructure, including dams and energy and telecommunications facilities.

“We know that trade secret theft can cripple a company’s competitive advantage in foreign markets, diminish export prospects around the globe and put American jobs in jeopardy,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday.

The modest steps were announced a day after computer security company Mandiant Corp. in Alexandria, Va., released a report that says a secretive Chinese military unit has stolen digital blueprints, plans, bidding orders and other sensitive data from at least 141 U.S. and Canadian companies over the last six years. Chinese authorities in Beijing denied any involvement and questioned the report’s veracity.

Carney said the United States and other countries need to develop “an understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.”

“We repeatedly, and will continue to, raise our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military,” he said.

Briefing reporters at the White House, Robert Hormats, undersecretary of State for economic growth, called China’s theft of intellectual property “a serious and highly troubling issue.”

The White House distributed a 2011 report by the National Counterintelligence Executive office, titled “Foreign Spies Stealing U.S. Economic Secrets in Cyberspace,” that named China as a “persistent collector” of U.S. corporate secrets.

U.S. intelligence officials said China has mounted a concerted campaign to siphon intellectual property and feed it to state-sponsored industries to save on research-and-development costs.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the pace of cyber thefts from China has accelerated over the last six months.

“I think we need to confront China on this,” he said. “We need to let China know in no uncertain terms that this is a relationship-altering, continuing offense, and it will have the most serious consequences.

“We need to make it clear that they are seeking an unfair economic advantage in their cyber theft practices, and they are going to have to change those practices.”

Intellectual property also is frequently stolen by human spies, some of whom are caught and prosecuted.

The Washington Times reported Monday on emails, from late 2011 to early 2012, obtained by the nonprofit Freedom Watch after the group filed suit in federal court. They detail discussions New York Times reporter David Sanger had with the State Department before the publication of a book that revealed classified information about the so-called Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities.

In one email, Sanger reportedly pressed the State Department to cooperate by noting the help he'd gotten from other wings of the Obama administration.

""I'm getting a bit concerned about the pace of our interviews -- or lack of pace, to be more precise -- for the book,"" Sanger reportedly said in the October 2011 message to a State Department press officer. ""The White House is steaming away; I've seen [National Security Adviser Thomas E.] Donilon many times and a raft of people below. Doing well at the Pentagon. But on the list I sent you starting on Sept. 12 we've scheduled nothing, and chapters are getting into final form.""

Donilon was the national security adviser at the time, before leaving the administration in July. He was replaced by former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The nature of his discussions with Sanger are unclear.

Fox News confirmed in late June that another high-ranking official, retired Gen. James Cartwright, is under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information on the Iran program. Cartwright was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time.

Larry Klayman, director of Freedom Watch, told The Washington Times that the emails show the Obama administration had a ""super-close relationship"" with Sanger and was ""literally force-feeding him.""

At the same time, the Justice Department is investigating that and other security leaks, after having appointed two U.S. attorneys to probe them last year.

The information about the anti-Iran program was first reported in a June 2012 New York Times article adapted from Sanger's book. It revealed behind-the-scenes details on the Stuxnet program, and concern that it had spread from Iran's nuclear facilities to the Internet.

Some lawmakers claimed that senior officials in the administration must have been complicit in leaking details about the program. The administration has rejected any suggestion that it authorized the leaks for political gain."

(CNN) —

Barack Obama came to Washington to end wars. Not to start them.

That much was crystal clear only three months ago when Obama gave a keynote speech on May 23 at the National Defense University in Washington in which he called for an end to the “boundless war on terror” and “perpetual wartime footing” that has existed in the U.S. since 9/11.

Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan.

Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike

No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America’s longest war.

Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress.

During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

This is some of the context of Obama’s decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress.

In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist.

Opinion: Obama’s Syria dilemma

The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack.

But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria.

Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group.

President Bill Clinton didn’t seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group’s attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa.

Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk.

Opinion: U.S. needs U.N. approval on Syria

Syria hasn’t attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot.

That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League.

As is now well-known, there isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution.

There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a “humanitarian” mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn’t participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday.

Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a “firm international response” in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won’t take any military action itself.

The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday.

In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker.

On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama’s top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii.

For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn’t get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament.

Is it ‘High Noon’ for Obama on Syria?

Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out.

He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria’s closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program – which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons– as a grave threat to the world.

We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran’s nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party.

For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, “If not now, when?” At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?

With the planes potentially heading for the trash heap of the Afghanistan war, the chief military watchdog overseeing Afghanistan spending is launching a review into the terminated program.

""I'm very troubled with the fact we may have wasted a half-billion dollars on planes that don't work, will never be flown and will probably be scrapped,"" Special Inspector General John F. Sopko told FoxNews.com in a statement. ""We intend to get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable.""

Sopko wrote to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other military officials on Dec. 5 informing them of his office's review. Sopko said the planes are ""currently sitting unused"" at the Kabul International Airport and Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He stressed the need to ""ensure that the U.S. government does not repeat the mistakes made throughout this nearly half billion dollar program.""

Sopko has been on the warpath over military resources wasted in Afghanistan, as the U.S. prepares to withdraw most its troops from the country.

He recently reopened an investigation into a $34 million military facility in southwestern Afghanistan that he's described as entirely unnecessary.

The story of the G222 aircraft program bares similar themes.

According to the inspector general's office, the Defense Department in 2008 launched a program to give 20 G222s (C-27A) -- military transport aircraft built in Italy -- to the Afghans. The department contracted with Alenia Aermacchi North America.

But despite spending at least $486 million on the program, officials determined that those in charge did a poor job getting the spare parts needed to keep the planes working.

Further, a Pentagon watchdog reported that the planes flew only 234 of the 4,500 ""required hours"" between January and September of last year, and another $200 million potentially would be needed to buy the outstanding spare parts. Some of those parts were described as ""unavailable.""

In December 2012, the Air Force ended the contract. Several months later, officials ended the program altogether and opted to go with an ""alternate aircraft"" in the long term.

The IG's latest investigation will examine the decision to provide the aircraft to the Afghans as well as what might happen to the 20 planes idling in airfields, including the possibility of ""disposal.""

Lt. Gen. Charles Davis, top acquisition official in the U.S. Air Force, recently told Bloomberg that the planes themselves just weren't right for the environment, and probably will be ""destroyed and moved out of the country.""

Air Force spokesman Ed Gulick, though, said the fate of the planes is contingent on a pending 2014 defense bill which would allow the Pentagon to effectively take over the aircraft from the Afghan security forces.

""With this authority, DoD could undertake final disposition of the equipment, including reuse, sale, transfer, or disposal,"" he told FoxNews.com in an email.

As for the contract, he said the military did not renew the program because Alenia ""struggled to consistently meet contractual obligations.""

But the contractor claimed to Bloomberg that the company was ""proud of its work.""

According to the contractor's website, the aircraft were meant to be the ""backbone"" of the Afghan Air Force, expanding their ability to provide aid and security. The planes are able to carry up to 10 tons of cargo."

The leak of a document on the Obama administration's drone strike policy has some people in Washington playing the ""what if"" game.

What if President George W. Bush's administration had written such a document on the legality of drone attacks, even on U.S. citizens working with suspected terrorists overseas?

Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted: ""Good thing (Department of Justice) drone memo didn't come out in 2008. Candidate Obama would never have put up with stuff like that going on.""

Joe Scarborough, the former Republican congressman who hosts MSNBC's Morning Joe, said that if this were the Bush administration, there would be ""congressional hearings"" and ""articles of impeachment.""

Candidate Obama and Democrats did indeed criticize Bush-era counterterrorism policies, such as warrantless wiretaps and enhanced interrogation techniques (waterboarding).

Aides to President Obama said he is continuing the war on terrorism, authorized by Congress shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Obama ""takes the absolute necessity to conduct our war against al-Qaeda and its affiliates in a way that's consistent with the Constitution and our laws very seriously,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

The spokesman added that ""it is a matter of fact that al-Qaeda is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, operational leaders of al-Qaeda are continually plotting to attack the United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most horrifically on Sept. 11, 2001.""

The debate over Obama's drone strike policy may not end soon, as noted by the Associated Press:

""Uncomfortable with the Obama administration's use of deadly drones, a growing number in Congress is looking to limit America's authority to kill suspected terrorists, even U.S. citizens. The Democratic-led outcry was emboldened by the revelation in a newly surfaced Justice Department memo that shows drones can strike against a wider range of threats, with less evidence, than previously believed.

""The drone program, which has been used from Pakistan across the Middle East and into North Africa to find and kill an unknown number of suspected terrorists, is expected to be a top topic of debate when the Senate Intelligence Committee grills John Brennan, the White House's pick for CIA chief, at a hearing Thursday."""
http://news.yahoo.com/key-us-decision-cuba-terror-designation-coming-074500998.html,,[],Key US decision on Cuba terror-designation coming,"HAVANA (AP) — A normally routine bit of Washington bureaucracy could have a big impact on U.S. relations with Cuba, either ushering in a long-stalled detente or slamming the door on rapprochement, perhaps until the scheduled end of the Castro era in 2018.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry must decide within a few weeks whether to advocate that President Barack Obama should take Cuba off a list of state sponsors of terrorism, a collection of Washington foes that also includes Iran, Syria and Sudan.

Cuban officials have long seen the terror designation as unjustified and told visiting American delegations privately in recent weeks that they view Kerry's recommendation as a litmus test for improved ties. They also hinted the decision could affect discussions over the release of jailed U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross, whose detention in 2009 torpedoed hopes of a diplomatic thaw.

Inclusion on the list means a ban not only on arms sales to Cuba but also on items that can have dual uses, including some hospital equipment. It also requires that the United States oppose any loans to Cuba by the World Bank or other international lending institutions, among other measures.

U.S. officials agree the recommendation, which Kerry must make before the State Department's annual terror report is published April 30, has become ensnared in the standoff over Gross. The American was sentenced to 15 years in prison after he was caught bringing communications equipment onto the island illegally while working for a USAID-funded democracy-building program.

Cuba has been on the terror list since 1982, and is also the target of a 51-year U.S. economic embargo — the reason why the island of beaches, music and rum is the only country Americans cannot visit as tourists. Removal from the list would not change that.

Critics say Cuba's inclusion on the list has little to do with any real threat posed by the Communist-run Caribbean island, and they say the list has become so politicized it's useless. North Korea was removed in 2008 during nuclear negotiations that ultimately failed, and was never put back on. Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden had been hiding out, is not on the list in large part because of its strategic importance.

Story continues

Longtime Cuba analyst Philip Peters of the Virginia-based think tank the Lexington Institute said removing Cuba from the list ""makes sense ... just because it's been a specious allegation that the United States has repeated for many years ... It would improve the atmosphere.""

Others argue against rewarding Havana unless it releases Gross.

""I have long believed it's in our interest to see an improvement in relations with Cuba,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Gross's home state of Maryland who traveled with a congressional delegation to Havana last month. But ""the first step needs to be resolving Alan Gross's situation.""

Voices calling for a change in the policy are growing louder, however.

Last month, The Boston Globe cited administration sources saying high-level diplomats determined Cuba should be dropped from the list. That prompted State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland to say there were ""no current plans"" to do so, though she did not explicitly rule out the possibility.

Last week, a Los Angeles Times editorial called for Cuba's removal from the list, and other newspapers have voiced similar opinions. The Cuba Study Group, a Washington-based exile organization that advocates engagement to promote democratic change, issued a white paper in February calling for an ""apolitical"" reexamination of the terror designation.

While Kerry can review the designation even after the State Department's report comes out, Cuba's continued inclusion on the list in April would almost certainly rule out its chances of removal in 2013.

A U.S. official involved in deliberations told The Associated Press that Kerry will ultimately decide and nobody under him is in a position to predict what will happen. ""It's very much up in the air,"" he said.

But another administration official said that lifting the terror designation will be a hard sell while Gross remains imprisoned.

""It's very unlikely,"" the second official said. ""There is no consensus. And if you are on (the list), you stay on as long as there is no consensus on taking you off.""

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Ostensibly, Cuba has been designated a terror sponsor because it harbors members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, the Basque militant organization ETA and a handful of U.S. fugitives, many of whom have lived here since the 1970s.

But much has changed in recent years.

Late last year, peace talks began in Havana between Colombia and the FARC, and even Washington has voiced hope that the negotiations will end Colombia's half-century old conflict.

ETA announced a permanent cease-fire in 2011, and Madrid has not openly called for the return of any Basque fugitives. Cuba has enjoyed improved relations with Spain and Colombia in recent years, and both countries routinely vote at the U.N. against continuing the U.S. embargo.

Under President Raul Castro, Cuba has freed dozens of dissidents and has begun opening its economy and society, though it remains a one-party political system that permits no legal opposition. Castro announced in February that he would step down in 2018 and signaled a likely successor.

The time might also be ripe in terms of U.S. politics.

While in the Senate, Kerry was an outspoken critic of America's policy on Cuba, saying it has ""manifestly failed for nearly 50 years."" He called for travel restrictions to end and held up millions of dollars in funding for the type of programs Gross worked with.

His boss, President Obama, no longer has to worry about reelection or pleasing Cuban-Americans, an all-important voting bloc in the crucial swing state of Florida.

Ann Louise Bardach, a longtime Cuba observer and the author of ""Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington,"" said all the political winds would seem to point toward a reboot in relations — except for Havana's decision to hold Gross and try to swap him for five Cuban agents in the U.S.

""In a way they cooked their goose with Alan Gross,"" she said. ""The Cubans thought, 'Gee what a brilliant idea, we'll have a chit to trade.' Little did they know that they would be at this moment where you have considerable momentum to move on in Washington, and politically, because of the Gross mess, Washington can't act.""

A bed in a provincial refugee hostel and little prospect of a decent job. That is what NSA leaker Edward Snowden can expect if and when he is allowed out of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport to await word on his application for temporary refuge, Russian media observed in a flurry of articles and commentaries Monday.

The reports by the Russia Today network and the official Itar-Tass news service were replete with admonition and doom-filled forecasts. The warnings seemed to suggest that Russian officials, rather than making a no-win decision between extraditing Snowden to Washington or granting him temporary asylum, are simply dragging their feet in hopes that the political albatross decides on his own to end his monthlong limbo in the bowels of Moscow’s main international airport.

Snowden, 30, has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo since his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23, a day after his U.S. passport was revoked for his disclosure of top-secret National Security Agency surveillance programs that collect private communications data on millions. With no valid travel document, Snowden can neither clear Russian passport control and enter the capital, nor can he buy tickets to fly to another destination.

“Snowden has been living in Sheremetyevo airport for over a month, and there is no doubt that the lack of fresh air, dietary options and ability to move freely has put enormous strain on him,” Russia Today began its commentary titled “The Layover From Hell.”

It noted that should the fugitive’s July 16 application for temporary asylum be accepted, “he will have to undergo a daunting medical assessment designed especially for immigrants.” That would include screening for HIV, tuberculosis, leprosy and the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, the network noted.

Snowden will have to register his whereabouts with police at all times and will probably be limited to finding a room in a processing facility for asylum seekers far from the capital.

“There are no such facilities in Moscow, and ones in the vicinity have been flooded with refugees escaping the Syrian conflict,” human rights lawyer Elena Ryabinina told the Gazeta.ru online newspaper. She said the nearest one with vacancy was probably Perm, 600 miles east of Moscow and the site of one of Russia’s most notorious prisons.

Piling on the unsolicited advice about Snowden’s travel and accommodation woes was the spokesman for the Federal Migration Service that is reviewing his petition for asylum.

“I don’t think it is good for Snowden to travel freely in Russia, as he is a wanted man,” said the migration service press secretary, Vladimir Volokh. He observed that outside of the airport, “his personal security cannot be guaranteed.”

That is a loaded phrase implying that Russian security agents won’t be watching his back for any CIA-style operations of the type that snatched terrorism suspects off foreign streets and “renditioned” them to U.S. custody for interrogation.

Soviet-era defectors who took refuge in Russia generally suffered miserable fates, the network noted.

“Kim Philby and Guy Burgess drank themselves to death in their state-allocated flats, awaiting a world revolution that never came,” the article recalled of British double agents who defected to Moscow in the 1960s and never adjusted to their lives in exile.

Itar-Tass took a similarly warning tone in an article that sounded out Russian information technology leaders about the prospects of Snowden finding a job in his field of data analysis, if and when he gets out of the airport. IT companies “are in no haste to offer a job” to the fugitive, who would be of more use to Russian intelligence or security forces, the news agency said.

“The risk of giving a job to Snowden is that he already showed his disloyalty to the employer once,” said Yelena Semenova, a deputy director for personnel management at the Informzashchita company, a name that translates as “information defense.”

Other leading tech companies told the news service that they had no idea of Snowden’s skill level, as all that is known about him is what he has disclosed in defiance of security clearances that governed his job with NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.

Snowden is stuck in the airport “because he has been trapped,” political analyst Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the journal Russia in Global Affairs, told Russia Today. “There is a possibility that the most eventful part of his life is already behind him.... In all likelihood, Snowden will have nothing to do in Russia.”

Although members of Congress remain deeply split and polls indicate Americans oppose military action, Obama on Tuesday won the backing of the two top House Republicans, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia. He also picked up the support of the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) was already on board.

Late Tuesday, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed on language authorizing U.S. military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons in the suburbs of Damascus, while ruling out the commitment of U.S. ground forces and limiting the window for an attack to 90 days. A committee vote could come as early as Wednesday.

Earlier, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, along with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had sought to dispel the concern of some committee members that, as with Iraq, the U.S. was at risk of acting on flawed or exaggerated intelligence, or that the U.S. could be drawn more deeply into Syria’s civil war.

“This is not the time for armchair isolationism. This is not the time to be spectators to slaughter,” Kerry said.

Obama took one of the biggest gambles of his presidency Saturday when he announced he would seek Congress’ blessing for military action in hope of bolstering the limited foreign and domestic support for the mission. Substantial risk remains that rank-and-file lawmakers in the House, who sense the hostility of many Americans to more U.S. military action in the Middle East, could break with their leadership.

But Boehner urged Republican House members, usually antagonistic toward Obama, to support him because “this is something that the United States, as a country, needs to do.” He called Syrian President Bashar Assad’s alleged attack with sarin gas, which the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people on Aug. 21, a “barbarous act.”

Obama called for Congress to act promptly.

“What we are envisioning is something limited. It is something proportional,” he said in brief comments before meeting with legislators. “It will degrade Assad’s capabilities. At the same time, we have a broader strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition.”

The language crafted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and the committee’s leading Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee, calls for the use of force “in a limited and tailored manner” against military targets in Syria in response to the government’s use of “weapons of mass destruction.”

Two leaders of the Senate’s hawk faction, John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), also argued on television news shows in favor of a strike, although they remain critical of how Obama has handled the Syrian civil war.

The No. 3 House lawmakers from both parties, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) and Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), remain undecided. So do most lawmakers, who are still weighing the policy merits and the political risks of a vote that may be deeply unpopular whichever way they decide.

Two polls released Tuesday, from the Pew Research Center and Washington Post-ABC News, found that Americans remain opposed to U.S. military action in Syria.

Yet key members and aides said Boehner’s announcement provided at least a temporary momentum swing from Saturday, when many in Congress were predicting that the support Obama sought was not there. Lawmakers lining up with Obama said that if the United States did not seek to deter chemical weapons use, it would embolden Assad and his allies in Iran; hurt America’s standing around the world; and put U.S. allies such as Israel, Jordan and Turkey at risk of such attacks.

The Boehner-Cantor decision “is a game-changer for the House vote, and far more important than McCain and Graham, who lead a small minority seeking greater military involvement,” said a senior Senate aide who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The aide noted that a number of traditional hawks, such as Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), were also lining up with Obama in favor of a limited strike.

Speaking Tuesday before the Senate committee, at the first congressional hearing on the issue, Kerry, Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said inaction was unacceptable.

“The risk of not acting is greater than the risk of acting,” said Kerry, a former chairman of the committee.

He said he and Hagel, who had been in the Senate for the Iraq vote a decade ago, “are especially sensitive … to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence. And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and rescrubbed the evidence.”

Kerry said Assad had been responsible for a series of chemical weapons attacks numbering “in the teens,” which suggests the Syrian military has employed them far more than has been publicly known. Administration officials were unable to provide any immediate elaboration.

Obama’s position also drew an expression of public support from former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, who had remained silent on the issue.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the nation’s most influential pro-Israel organization, also declared itself in favor of a punitive attack. “Simply put, barbarism on a mass scale must not be given a free pass,” the group said in a statement.

Congressional attention is now focused on negotiating language for the resolution, with many members pressing to make it narrow enough to convince skeptical lawmakers it will not open the way for deeper military involvement.

In the House, Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said they were also working on a proposal.

The White House has indicated it will work with Congress on the language, aiming for a vote by the middle of next week. Officials have said they are not seeking to topple Assad or deploy U.S. troops.

Kerry signaled one possible complication on the issue when he told the Senate committee that the administration would oppose language specifically barring U.S. “boots on the ground” because that could limit U.S. options in the event of an emergency, such as a threatened chemical weapons release.

But moments later, facing objections from senators, Kerry backed off, saying the administration had no desire to insert U.S. ground troops and would work with lawmakers to find language making that clear.

Some senators worried aloud that missile strikes on Assad, even if limited, might draw the United States more deeply into the civil war if it widens to entangle U.S. allies.

“What happens if they get into it with Israel?” asked Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho). “What’s our response going to be?”

Kerry sought to assure Risch that a limited mission “doesn’t mean the United States of America is going to war.”

The administration seemed to have the support of some committee liberals with antiwar histories, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has said that her vote against the Iraq war was her proudest moment. She said a failure to act “gives Assad license to use these weapons again.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a leader of the non-interventionist GOP faction, criticized the administration for being unwilling to say whether it would go ahead with an attack if Congress voted no. “You are making a joke out of us, you are making theater,” said Paul, who threatened to filibuster the resolution.

Kerry said Obama had not decided whether he would launch the attack in the absence of congressional support.

Another public hearing is set for Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and administration officials will continue to brief lawmakers in private.

The president, who will be in Sweden and Russia until Friday, and other top administration officials are expected to make calls to wavering lawmakers to lobby them.

Lon Snowden spoke at length with Fox News about his son Edward's decision to leak sensitive security details about U.S. intelligence-gathering operations. While defending his son's integrity and criticizing the government, he pleaded with his son -- who is thought to be weathering the political storm from a location in Hong Kong -- to return home and not to leak more information.

""I hope, I pray and I ask that you will not release any secrets that could constitute treason,"" Snowden told Fox News, in a message meant for his son's ears. He added: ""I sense that you're under much stress [from] what I've read recently, and [ask] that you not succumb to that stress ... and make a bad decision.""

Further, Snowden said he would rather see his son return to the U.S. and face the U.S. justice system than stay abroad.

""I would like to see Ed come home and face this. I shared that with the government when I spoke with them. I love my son,"" he told Fox News' Eric Bolling.

Snowden claimed there are some people who want him to ""cross that line and do something that constitutes treason, or they would like to see him disappear."" But Snowden said he's sure ""that the moment he landed that there would be a line of attorneys waiting to defend him.""

Edward Snowden himself did not voice that level of confidence. During a live online chat hosted by Guardian.com on Monday, Snowden said he doesn't think he would receive a fair trial in the U.S.

""The U.S. Government, just as they did with other whistle-blowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret, criminal and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice, and it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said during the chat.

Snowden also claimed he did not reveal any U.S. operations against ""legitimate military targets,"" but rather NSA efforts against ""civilian infrastructure.""

Snowden has emerged at the center of one of the biggest security leaks in U.S. history. After The Guardian news organization and Washington Post reported on government programs that monitor massive troves of phone and Internet records, Snowden was revealed as the source of that information. According to The Guardian, Snowden continues to provide sensitive information -- The Guardian most recently reported on a British effort to hack into foreign diplomats' phones and emails during conferences, citing Snowden as the source.

Snowden could face serious charges if he returns to the U.S. Former Vice President Dick Cheney called Snowden a ""traitor"" on ""Fox News Sunday.""

But others have praised his decision to come forward, citing the civil liberties at stake.

Lon Snowden said he was ""saddened"" by his son's decision, but criticized the government for the surveillance efforts his son helped expose.

""Some people are suggesting that what's occurring is very similar to every morning the government walks up to your mailbox, or afternoon. They pull the envelopes out. They open them. They look at your mail. They copy it. They archive it in case they wanna look at it sometime in the future in case you do something wrong sometime in the future. They re-seal the envelopes, they put them back in your mailbox. And they do it every day over and over and over again.""

He continued: ""I don't want them reading my email. ... If we say, ""Oh my gosh, we're going to have to ... sacrifice our freedoms because of the threat of terrorism,' well, the terrorists have already won, because it's our freedoms that make us Americans.""

He said he's concerned his son is ""in peril,"" but voiced confidence that if he returns to the U.S., that would be best.

""I have faith in our justice system applied correctly, absolutely. You know, I would rather my son be a prisoner in the U.S. than a free man in a country that did not have ... the freedoms that are protected"" in the U.S., he said.

He complained there are a lot of misconceptions about his son, including speculation about why he chose to stay in Hong Kong. Snowden said his son was simply ""comfortable"" there and with Asian culture in general, since he used to live in Japan.

As for media reports that he's a high-school dropout, he explained that his son actually had an illness during his sophomore year -- likely mono. But after he dropped out, he said his son completed his high-school equivalency and went on to take college courses.

He said he last saw his son on April 4. ""We'd gone out to dinner,"" he said, adding that his son seemed to be carrying a ""burden.""

""We hugged as we always do. He said, 'I love you Dad.' I said, 'I love you, Ed.' And I expected to see him -- see him again,"" Snowden recalled.

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Temporary Russia asylum may end Edward Snowden airport stay ‘any day’,"MOSCOW -- Edward Snowden’s long sojourn at Moscow’s international airport may be nearing an end.

“Any day now, Snowden may get an official confirmation from the Federal Migration Service” that his application for temporary asylum is being reviewed, his attorney, Anatoly Kucherena, said in an interview Wednesday with The Times. “With this document, he will be able at last to leave the airport and properly and legally enter Russia.”

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information about U.S. Internet spying, is believed to have been biding his time for most of the last month in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport -- a notoriously dreary place that most travelers are happy to leave as quickly as possible.

He applied Tuesday for temporary shelter in Russia after President Vladimir Putin made it clear that he would not allow Snowden to be granted permanent political asylum unless the fugitive -- who is wanted by the United States on espionage charges -- stops leaking information that damages the U.S.

Putin reiterated Wednesday that he did not want Snowden’s case to further damage Russia’s already-frosty relations with the United States.

“We warned Mr. Snowden that any activity on his part causing damage to the Russian-U.S. relationship is unacceptable for us,” Putin told reporters in the far eastern Russian city of Chita. “Relations between countries, in my view, are more important than squabbles of special services,” he said, using the Russian euphemism for intelligence agencies.

At the same time, the Russian leader implied again that Russia would not bow to U.S. pressure in the Snowden case. The United States has asked for Snowden’s return, but lacks an extradition treaty with Russia.

“We cannot and we will not behave like many other countries,” Putin said. “We are an independent country and we have an independent foreign policy which we will continue to pursue. I hope our partners will take this calmly and with understanding.”

Putin also reiterated that he expected Snowden to depart in the not-too-distant future. “As far as I can see, Snowden hasn’t set a goal to stay all his life in Russia,” he said.

But Kucherena, Snowden’s Russian lawyer, said that was a possibility.

If Snowden is granted temporary shelter, he will be allowed to stay for one year, “enjoying most rights of a regular Russian citizen, including the right to work,” he said, adding that the law allows him to apply for extensions after that.

“In five years’ time, provided Snowden is still in Russia, he can apply for Russian citizenship, a possibility he doesn’t rule out,” the lawyer said. “In the meantime, Snowden will be able to freely move across Russia and live wherever he pleases in Russia.”

Kucherena said Snowden would not be able to travel abroad without losing his refugee status in Russia.

“The Iranian aircraft departed after a verbal warning,” the statement said.

The incident, which was not disclosed for two days, is at least the third time U.S. and Iranian military forces have faced off over American spy drones in the last 15 months, and it inevitably raised concerns of a more serious confrontation.

The Obama administration has stepped up military and intelligence surveillance flights near Iranian airspace and moved warships and other military assets to the Middle East in connection with the increasing Western pressure on Iran to suspend its nuclear development program.

The Pentagon said Thursday that the Predator drone was on a “routine classified surveillance flight over international waters” and was being escorted by two U.S. Air Force jets when an Iranian F-4 fighter was detected more than 16 miles away.

One of the U.S. jets flew within two miles of the Iranian warplane and made radio contact, a Defense official said.

After the incident, the Pentagon said, “the United States communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters consistent with long-standing practice and our commitment to the security of the region.”

“We reserve the right to protect our military assets as well as our forces,” the statement added.

The Pentagon initially said that the Iranian fighter jet had fled after the U.S. jet had dropped a warning flare, but that account was later corrected. “Updated reporting indicates that no flare was discharged,” the revised statement said.

In December 2011, a secret U.S. spy drone crashed inside Iran after what U.S. officials privately said was a malfunction. Iranian officials claimed they brought down the craft by jamming its guidance system. They later put out video footage of the captured aircraft, as well as aerial video they said they had taken from it.

Last November, the Pentagon said that an Iranian fighter fired multiple times at another Predator drone that U.S. officials said was over international waters but the slow-moving drone was not hit.

Schmidt']",Qaeda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence,"WASHINGTON — As the nation’s spy agencies assess the fallout from disclosures about their surveillance programs, some government analysts and senior officials have made a startling finding: the impact of a leaked terrorist plot by Al Qaeda in August has caused more immediate damage to American counterterrorism efforts than the thousands of classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor.

Since news reports in early August revealed that the United States intercepted messages between Ayman al-Zawahri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the head of Al Qaeda, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the head of the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing an imminent terrorist attack, analysts have detected a sharp drop in the terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that the authorities were monitoring. Since August, senior American officials have been scrambling to find new ways to surveil the electronic messages and conversations of Al Qaeda’s leaders and operatives.

“The switches weren’t turned off, but there has been a real decrease in quality” of communications, said one United States official, who like others quoted spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence programs.

The drop in message traffic after the communication intercepts contrasts with what analysts describe as a far more muted impact on counterterrorism efforts from the disclosures by Mr. Snowden of the broad capabilities of N.S.A. surveillance programs. Instead of terrorists moving away from electronic communications after those disclosures, analysts have detected terrorists mainly talking about the information that Mr. Snowden has disclosed."

The secret move, described briefly in a draft report by the Pentagon's inspector general, set off no alarms within the Obama administration even though it appears to have sidestepped federal rules and perhaps also the Freedom of Information Act.

An acknowledgement by Adm. William McRaven of his actions was quietly removed from the final version of an inspector general's report published weeks ago. A spokesman for the admiral declined to comment. The CIA, noting that the bin Laden mission was overseen by then-CIA Director Leon Panetta before he became defense secretary, said that the SEALs were effectively assigned to work temporarily for the CIA, which has presidential authority to conduct covert operations.

""Documents related to the raid were handled in a manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under the direction of the CIA director,"" agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an emailed statement. ""Records of a CIA operation such as the (bin Laden) raid, which were created during the conduct of the operation by persons acting under the authority of the CIA Director, are CIA records.""

Golson said it is ""absolutely false"" that records were moved to the CIA to avoid the legal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.

The records transfer was part of an effort by McRaven to protect the names of the personnel involved in the raid, according to the inspector general's draft report.

But secretly moving the records allowed the Pentagon to tell The Associated Press that it couldn't find any documents inside the Defense Department that AP had requested more than two years ago, and could represent a new strategy for the U.S. government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public scrutiny.

""Welcome to the shell game in place of open government,"" said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, a private research institute at George Washington University. ""Guess which shell the records are under. If you guess the right shell, we might show them to you. It's ridiculous.""

McRaven's directive sent the only copies of the military's records about its daring raid to the CIA, which has special authority to prevent the release of ""operational files"" in ways that can't effectively be challenged in federal court. The Defense Department can prevent the release of its own military files, too, citing risks to national security. But that can be contested in court, and a judge can compel the Pentagon to turn over non-sensitive portions of records.

Under federal rules, transferring government records from one executive agency to another must be approved in writing by the National Archives and Records Administration. There are limited circumstances when prior approval is not required, such as when the records are moved between two components of the same executive department. The CIA and Special Operations Command are not part of the same department.

The Archives was not aware of any request from the U.S. Special Operations Command to transfer its records to the CIA, spokeswoman Miriam Kleiman said. She said it was the Archives' understanding that the military records belonged to the CIA, so transferring them wouldn't have required permission under U.S. rules.

Special Operations Command also is required to comply with rules established by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that dictate how long records must be retained. Its July 2012 manual requires that records about military operations and planning are to be considered permanent and after 25 years, following a declassification review, transferred to the Archives.

Also, the Federal Records Act would not permit agencies ""to purge records just on a whim,"" said Dan Metcalfe, who oversaw the U.S. government's compliance with the Freedom of Information Act as former director of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy. ""I don't think there's an exception allowing an agency to say, `Well, we didn't destroy it. We just deleted it here after transmitting it over there.' High-level officials ought to know better.""

It was not immediately clear exactly which Defense Department records were purged and transferred, when it happened or under what authority, if any, they were sent to the CIA. No government agencies the AP contacted would discuss details of the transfer. The timing may be significant: The Freedom of Information Act generally applies to records under an agency's control when a request for them is received. The AP asked for files about the mission in more than 20 separate requests, mostly submitted in May 2011 -- several were sent a day after Obama announced that the world's most wanted terrorist had been killed in a firefight. Obama has pledged to make his administration the most transparent in U.S. history.

The AP asked the Defense Department and CIA separately for files that included copies of the death certificate and autopsy report for bin Laden as well as the results of tests to identify the body. While the Pentagon said it could not locate the files, the CIA, with its special power to prevent the release of records, has never responded. The CIA also has not responded to a separate request for other records, including documents identifying and describing the forces and supplies required to execute the assault on bin Laden's compound.

The CIA did tell the AP it could not locate any emails from or to Panetta and two other top agency officials discussing the bin Laden mission.

McRaven's unusual order would have remained secret had it not been mentioned in a single sentence on the final page in the inspector general's draft report that examined whether the Obama administration gave special access to Hollywood executives planning a film, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" about the raid. The draft report was obtained and posted online last month by the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group in Washington.

McRaven, who oversaw the bin Laden raid, expressed concerns in the report about possible disclosure of the identities of the SEALs. The Pentagon ""provided the operators and their families an inordinate level of security,"" the report said. McRaven also directed that the names and photographs associated with the raid not be released.

""This effort included purging the combatant command's systems of all records related to the operation and providing these records to another government agency,"" according to the draft report. The sentence was dropped from the report's final version.

Since the raid, one of the SEALs published a book about the raid under a pseudonym but was subsequently identified by his actual name. And earlier this year the SEAL credited with shooting bin Laden granted a tell-all, anonymous interview with Esquire about the raid and the challenges of his retiring from the military after 16 years without a pension.

Current and former Defense Department officials knowledgeable about McRaven's directive and the inspector general's report told AP the description of the order in the draft report was accurate. The reference to ""another government agency"" was code for the CIA, they said. These individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name.

There is no indication the inspector general's office or anyone else in the U.S. government is investigating the legality of transferring the military records. Bridget Serchak, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, would not explain why the reference was left out of the final report and what, if any, actions the office might be taking.

""Our general statement is that any draft is pre-decisional and that drafts go through many reviews before the final version, including editing or changing language,"" Serchak wrote in an e-mail.

The unexplained decision to remove the reference to the purge and transfer of the records ""smells of bad faith,"" said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""How should one understand that? That adds insult to injury. It essentially covers up the action.""

McRaven oversaw the raid while serving as commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, the secretive outfit in charge of SEAL Team Six and the military's other specialized counterterrorism units. McRaven was nominated by Obama to lead Special Operations Command, JSOC's parent organization, a month before the raid on bin Laden's compound. He replaced Adm. Eric Olson as the command's top officer in August 2011.

Ken McGraw, a spokesman for Special Operations Command, referred questions to the inspector general's office.

The refusal to make available authoritative or contemporaneous records about the bin Laden mission means that the only official accounts of the mission come from U.S. officials who have described details of the raid in speeches, interviews and television appearances. In the days after bin Laden's death, the White House provided conflicting versions of events, falsely saying bin Laden was armed and even firing at the SEALs, misidentifying which of bin Laden's sons was killed and incorrectly saying bin Laden's wife died in the shootout. Obama's press secretary attributed the errors to the ""fog of combat.""

A U.S. judge and a federal appeals court previously sided with the CIA in a lawsuit over publishing more than 50 ""post-mortem"" photos and video recordings of bin Laden's corpse. In the case, brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, the CIA did not say the images were operational files to keep them secret. It argued successfully that the photos and videos must be withheld from the public to avoid inciting violence against Americans overseas and compromising secret systems and techniques used by the CIA and the military.

The Defense Department told the AP in March 2012 it could not locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not find any images of bin Laden's body on the USS Carl Vinson, the aircraft carrier from which he was buried at sea. The Pentagon also said it could not find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were killed. It said it searched files at the Pentagon, Special Operations Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and the Navy command in San Diego that controls the Carl Vinson.

The Pentagon also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid. One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs in Pakistan crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind.

The Defense Department also told the AP in February 2012 that it could not find any emails about the bin Laden mission or his ""Geronimo"" code name that were sent or received in the year before the raid by McRaven. The department did not say they had been moved to the CIA. It also said it could not find any emails from other senior officers who would have been involved in the mission's planning. It found only three such emails written by or sent to then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and these consisted of 12 pages sent to Gates summarizing news reports after the raid.

The Defense Department in November 2012 released copies of 10 emails totaling 31 pages found in the Carl Vinson's computer systems. The messages were heavily censored and described how bin Laden's body was prepared for burial.

These records were not among those purged and then moved to the CIA. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. James Gregory said the messages from the Carl Vinson ""were not relating to the mission itself and were the property of the Navy."""

According to a transcript of that proceeding, a magistrate at Tsarnaev’s hospital bedside read him the Miranda warning, informing him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. But among the things we don’t know is if, or to what extent, Tsarnaev was interrogated before being informed of his rights.

Over the weekend, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. gave every indication that he intended to have Tsarnaev questioned without the Miranda warning. We have to hope that didn’t happen. The Constitution is not like a deck chair, to be brought out in good weather and then put away and ignored when the seas get rough. Tsarnaev is entitled to the same constitutional protections as any other criminal defendant.

The Constitution provides protections to all those accused of crime, including the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to counsel, the right to a speedy trial in front of a jury, and the right to have guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

FULL COVERAGE: Boston Marathon attack

There is no exception in the Constitution, or ever recognized by the Supreme Court, for especially horrible crimes or for ones that can be labeled terrorism.

But that never seems to stop officials from looking for exceptions during crises. In addition to Holder’s remarks, Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham called over the weekend for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant and tried in a military tribunal, an idea that was fortunately rejected.

Since 9/11 there has been a debate, still unresolved, as to what constitutional protections apply to those apprehended in foreign countries and held as enemy combatants. But there is no doubt that a crime in the United States must be investigated and prosecuted in accord with the Constitution.

This is not the first crime of terrorism in an American city. The anarchists of the early 20th century, the attackers in the first World Trade Center bombing and Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who were convicted of the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, to mention a few, were prosecuted and tried in compliance with the Constitution.

It is striking that in all of these instances, the government succeeded in gaining convictions in courts. In other words, complying with the Constitution is not an obstacle to successful law enforcement. The federal judiciary, and likewise state courts, have shown repeatedly that they are capable of handling such cases. And even if complying with the Constitution were to make prosecution more difficult, that would not be a sufficient reason for suspending it.

Holder said on the Sunday talk shows that the government intended to invoke the “public safety exception” that allows suspects to be questioned without being given Miranda warnings in emergency circumstances. But this exception does not apply here because there was no emergency threat facing law enforcement.

Advertisement

The emergency exception to Miranda that Holder embraced was announced by the Supreme Court in New York vs. Quarles in 1984. A woman told the police that she had been raped by a man with a gun. When the police caught the suspect in a grocery store, they saw an empty holster and no gun. The man was asked about the location of the gun, and he told the officer where to find it.

The Supreme Court ruled that, although the suspect had not yet been given Miranda warnings, the statement about the gun was admissible against him because of the urgent need to find the gun. In other words, the public safety exception applies only when police are acting in an emergency to prevent serious immediate harm. If the police needed to question Tsarnaev as to the location of other bombs, the emergency exception would apply.

But Holder has said that no such threat exists. It appears then that the attorney general’s intention to allow questioning of Tsarnaev without reading him his rights would violate Tsarnaev’s 5th Amendment rights. That could well mean that any incriminating statement he were to make would be excluded from use as evidence.

And what about the idea advanced by McCain and Graham that Tsarnaev should be treated as an enemy combatant and prosecuted in military courts? It’s unlikely we’ve heard the last of it.

Advertisement

But the Constitution does not — and should not — permit trying American civilians in military tribunals. A verdict from a military tribunal, no matter how fair the proceedings, never would have the credibility of a conviction from a federal court. More important, there is no stopping point to the erosion of the Constitution; why couldn’t any crime that caused significant loss of life be deemed an act of terror and the suspect denied constitutional protection?

Throughout American history, whenever there has been a serious threat, people have proposed abridging civil liberties. When that has happened, it has never been shown to have made the country safer. These mistakes should not be repeated. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be investigated, prosecuted and tried in accord with the U.S. Constitution.

USA TODAY

MOSCOW — National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden is ""exhausted"" and misses his American girlfriend, but has settled into a safe, undisclosed location with the help of newly acquired American friends after getting temporary asylum in Russia, according to his lawyer.

Snowden received immigration papers on Thursday from his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, and immediately jumped into a taxi with a pre-packed suitcase and headed into Moscow.

""Snowden is in a safe place. I didn't suggest it to him, it was his decision,"" Kucherena told Dozhd TV, RIA Novosti reports. ""He will decide for himself how to live his life from now on. He has friends with him, including Americans with whom he made contact via his friends from the United States when he was still in the (airport) transit zone.""

Snowden has also been assisted in Moscow by a WikiLeaks representative, Sarah Harrison.

Kucherena said the 30-year-old former defense contractor is ""exhausted"" and will need to go through a period of ""rehabilitation"" to get over the grueling experience since he arrived in Russia from Hong Kong on June 23.

""Snowden can live in a hotel or rent a flat in Russia,"" said Kucherena, according to RT.com. ""But the personal safety issue is a very serious one for him.""

Security levels are so high, Kucherena told Vesti FM radio, that Snowden ""can't go for a walk on Red Square or go fishing.""

The lawyer told Julia Ioffe of The New Republic that Snowden, after receiving the asylum papers. at first didn't seen to fully understand internally how his life had changed.

""Because he had been waiting for it for so long, he had been so worried,"" the lawyer told the magazine. ""He said, 'It can't be!' That he wouldn't believe it 'til he saw the documents. Then, of course, he was happy.""

Kucherena said that Russia has no plans to prevent Snowden from leaving the country at any moment, but added that he ""has no intention to travel abroad as of now.""

Snowden has been offered asylum by three Latin American countries — Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua — but has been unable to travel since the U.S. revoked his passport and charged him under the Espionage Act for leaking information to reporters about the NSA's worldwide surveillance and data-gathering networks.

He has said he went public with the information in order to ""correct this wrongdoing.""

In his only public statement since getting asylum, Snowden said in a statement issued through WikiLeaks: ""Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning. I thank the Russian federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.""

In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is ""extremely disappointed"" with Russia's decision to grant him a one-year political asylum.

Carney also said that President Obama, who is scheduled to visit St. Petersburg, Russia, in early September for a G-20 summit, is undecided about a side trip to Moscow for private meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Russians have said that they will not extradite Snowden, but have been assured by him that he will not leak any additional information harmful to the United States while he is on Russian territory.

Kucherena told The New Republic that Snowden has gotten ""a lot of job offers"" already in Russia.

Pavel Durov, founder of VKontakte, a Russian version of Facebook, said he would be pleased to have Snowden on board.

Otherwise, Snowden appears to be settling into life as an American ex-pat in Moscow, including local cuisine, such as the traditional Georgian bread with cheese.

""I brought him khachapuri — he really liked it,"" Kucherena told Vesti FM radio. He added that while Snowden likes Russian food, he didn't really have a chance to try it in the airport transit zone.

The young American is also aiming to get his social life back on track.

""When I told him about the people who were calling him, including girls, such Russian girls, he told me 'Anatoly, I still miss my girlfriend.'""

Julia Mills, a self-described acrobatic pole dancer who apparently had no advance warning that Snowden was leaving the country, has moved out of their home in Hawaii.

In a blog post purportedly written by Mills after Snowden's departure became public, she said, according to ABC News, ""My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass."""

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-chooses-lawyer-guantanamo-closure-envoy-200145023.html,,[],Obama chooses lawyer as Guantanamo closure envoy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has chosen a high-powered Washington lawyer with extensive experience in all three branches of the government to be the State Department's special envoy for closing down the military-run prison at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

Clifford Sloan is the pick to reopen the State Department's Office of Guantanamo Closure, shuttered since January and folded into the department's legal adviser's office when the administration, in the face of congressional obstacles, effectively gave up its attempt to close the prison.

A formal announcement of Sloan's appointment was expected Monday, according to officials briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the appointment publicly before the formal announcement.

Sloan has served in senior government positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations and is now a partner in the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP law firm. For the past several years, he has been an informal adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry, who recommended him for the post, the officials said.

""I appreciate his willingness to take on this challenge,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""Cliff and I share the president's conviction that Guantanamo's continued operation isn't in our security interests.""

The move fulfills part of Obama's pledge last month to renew efforts to close the military-run detention center at Guantanamo. That was a major promise in his 2008 presidential campaign, but it ran aground due to opposition from congressional Republicans.

In late May, Obama lifted a self-imposed ban on transferring Guantanamo detainees to Yemen, in what was a step toward closing a prison that he said ""has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law."" He said he would name envoys at both the State Department and Pentagon to try to unblock the closure process. The Pentagon envoy position has yet to be filled.

Story continues

Word of the Sloan's appointment comes follows the House's overwhelming passage Friday of a $638 billion defense bill that would block Obama from closing the detention facility. The House acted despite a White House veto threat.

The administration cited Guantanamo's prohibitive costs and role as a recruiting tool for extremists. A hunger strike by more than 100 of the 166 prisoners protesting their conditions and indefinite confinement has prompted the fresh calls for closure. Obama is pushing to transfer 86 approved detainees to their home countries. Fifty-six of the 86 are from Yemen.

Officials said Sloan, whose diverse government experience includes clerking for liberal Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and conservative prosecutor Kenneth Starr, would focus primarily on navigating between the administration and Congress to overcome the deep, largely partisan divide over closing Guantanamo.

""It will not be easy, but if anyone can effectively navigate the space between agencies and branches of government, it's Cliff,"" Kerry said. ""He's someone respected by people as ideologically different as Kenneth Starr and Justice Stevens, and that's the kind of bridge-builder we need to finish this job."""

A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.']",Two key House GOP leaders back Obama on Syria strike,"WASHINGTON – Calling the use of chemical weapons “a barbarous act,” House Speaker John A. Boehner said Tuesday he will support President Obama’s request to authorize force against the Syrian government and also said he was confident his fellow lawmakers would do the same.

The statement of support from the Ohio Republican was quickly followed by another from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), notching two critical votes for the White House in what still appears to be an uphill campaign to win majorities on Capitol Hill.

Boehner, after a meeting with the president and other senior officials at the White House Tuesday morning, said that only the United States could prevent Syrian President Bashar Assad from using chemical weapons, and that a military strike was necessary also as a signal to other potentially hostile regimes.

“We have enemies around the world that need to understand that we’re not going to tolerate this type of behavior. We also have allies around the world and allies in the region who also need to know that America will be there and stand up when it’s necessary,” he told reporters outside the West Wing.

In a written statement, Cantor called Assad’s Syria “the epitome of a rogue state” that “has long posed a direct threat to American interests and to our partners.”

He also said that a draft resolution sent to Congress by the administration “will likely change.” He said that it is up to Obama to make the case to lawmakers and to the American people that this is the right course of action -- an indication that Republican leaders will not make a concerted lobbying effort on their own to convince their members.

“Everyone understands that it is an uphill battle to pass a resolution, and the speaker expects the White House to provide answers to members’ questions and take the lead on any whipping effort,” Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman, said. “All votes authorizing the use of military force are conscience votes for members, and passage will require direct, continuous engagement from the White House.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who has expressed support for military action, acknowledged that many of her own constituents are probably opposed to military action, telling reporters after the White House meeting that “the American people need to hear more about the intelligence” suggesting that Assad’s military used chemical weapons in an attack Aug. 21 outside Damascus.

Pelosi also sought to counter the argument that Obama committed the nation to this course of action when he said that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would be a “red line.”

“President Obama did not draw the red line. Humanity drew it,” she said.

Pelosi said she would lead a discussion among House Democrats to help build support ahead of a vote next week. She said they would have to decide: “Do they want to ignore the fact that this humanitarian disaster took place or not.” She said they will have to consider what message would be sent to the international community if a vote were to fail.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in a statement that many questions have still not been answered and called on the president “to make the case not only to Congress, but to the American people, in a national address.”

The president, though, is scheduled to leave Tuesday night for Sweden and later will travel to Russia for the G-20 meeting on the world’s economy.

In addition to the public and closed hearings scheduled in key congressional committees this week, the administration will continue to brief the full membership. Vice President Joe Biden, who is key to any lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, has canceled a scheduled trip to Florida to discuss education policy.

[For the Record, 12:25 p.m. PDT: An earlier version of this online article said that Sen. John Cornyn did not attend Tuesday’s White House meeting. Cornyn was present.]

Bush.

""I believe we compromised our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law,"" said Obama at National Defense University, referring to the Bush administration's national security policy.

But Donald Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary under Bush from 2001-2006, said Obama has “blamed the Bush administration for practically everything since he took office.""

Rumsfeld said that people “kind of conflated” the Defense Department with the CIA during the Bush years.

“The Department of Defense at Guantanamo water boarded no one,” he said of the detention facility in Cuba and harsh treatment of certain terror suspects.



”Three people were water-boarded by the agency with the authority of the Department of Justice and the president,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld said the United States has not engaged terrorism ideologically in the same way it took on Communism during the Cold War.

""I gave us a D-minus, and I'm an easy grader. I would give this administration an F, because they won't even use the words,"" said Rumsfeld.

""Until today, I haven't heard people use the word jihad. I haven't heard the people in the Obama administration talk about the fact that there are people that are determined to kill innocent men, women, and children that are attacking the whole concept of the nation state,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld also took issue with Obama's assertion that al Qaeda had ""been gutted.""

""That just simply isn't true. Al Qaeda is still effective. We have killed or captured any number of al Qaeda leadership, and they get replaced. Someone comes on behind them,"" said Rumsfeld, who also acknowledged that the threat is not the same today as it was in 2001 or 2002.

But he said there are still many unknowns.

""We know the number of people that have been killed or captured. We don't know the number of people that have been recruited. We don't know the number that are being trained. We don't know the amount of money that the al Qaeda and their affiliates are raising every year from supporters,"" said Rumsfeld.

Drones were not started by the Obama administration; there were drone attacks during the Bush years as well.

""We had very few when I came into office. They were increased, and this administration has the benefit of those unmanned aerial vehicles,"" said Rumsfeld.

But Rumsfeld said that it is a very tough issue, and agreed with Obama's statement that the administration would consider options for making drone strikes more transparent, like an independent oversight board, or a special court to approve the attacks.

""Going to the Congress and discussing it with them and getting them on board for some policy - that makes sense to the American people, so that he has that kind of support. He will need it,"" said Rumsfeld.

On the topic of his new book, ""Rumsfeld's Rules: Leadership Lessons in Business, Politics, War, and Life,"" the former congressman, White House chief of staff, and two-time defense chief, responded to critics who doubt his leadership.

""These are not all Rumsfeld's rules. These are rules from people that are a lot wiser than I am. And I have collected them over my lifetime,"" said Rumsfeld. ""And I guess what I would say to people like that is read the book.""

Rumsfeld said there is one particular rule he would give to Obama.

""When I was a Navy pilot, the rule if you're lost is to climb, conserve, and confess. Get some altitude. Take a deep breath, and get on the radio and say, you're lost,"" said Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld said the administration changes its tune ""week after week after week, whether it's Benghazi or whether it's the Internal Revenue Service.""

""What you need to do is get the people in the office, sit them down, and find ground truth, because the currency a leader has is credibility,"" said Rumsfeld.

""To the extent that credibility gets eroded over time, you lose your ability to lead."""

Republican Congressman Frank Wolf wants to know why.

Kolbye addressed the GovSec West Conference in Dallas in late November and discussed various aspects of the Benghazi investigation with attendees. During his presentation, Kolbye noted that, contrary to initial reports, FBI assets were on the scene in Benghazi within a few days after the attack. Breitbart News reported that story when it broke.

Kolbye explained, “We have people in a lot of other foreign countries who are [legal attachés]. We have investigative teams that are well equipped.” In response to claims that the FBI could not access the site because of security clearance issues, he affirmed, “We were there.”

Rep. Wolf was amazed that this information didn’t reach Congress sooner. He told Breitbart News last Thursday:

I’m shocked to find that someone said that they were there in several days and all the reports we’ve had both from the administration and from the news media was that it took several weeks before they got there. Secondly, I don’t understand why this guy, Kevin Kolbye, wasn’t called as a witness by several other committees in Congress.

The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012. The Washington Post reported on September 18 that FBI agents had arrived in Libya, but later information indicated that they were delayed en route to Benghazi. On October 4, the Associated Press (AP) reported that a team of FBI agents arrived in Benghazi and stayed for only one day due to clearance issues. “Agents arrived in Benghazi before dawn on Thursday and departed after sunset, after weeks of waiting for access to the crime scene to investigate the Sept. 11 attack,” the report reads.

Kolbye’s claim that FBI staff was on-site at Benghazi flies in the face of these reports.

Rep. Wolf is leading the charge to untangle the complicated web of circumstances surrounding Benghazi. Wolf has been the driving force behind the idea of forming a Benghazi Select Committee to investigate the 2012 attack. While House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) appears unmotivated to appoint members to one, a recent McLaughlin-Caddell poll showed that two thirds of Americans want a Select Committee; this number includes 83 percent of Republicans as well as 58 percent of independents who “believe it is important for a special committee to get the truth about Benghazi.”

Speaking with Breitbart News, Rep. Wolf expressed his outrage at Congress’s lack of critical information:"

Or that military action, in some way, will assist in solving them. This is the great problem in American foreign policy. American policymakers conclude much too often that foreign affairs should be conducted with military force as the cornerstone and backbone of policymaking.

This manner of doing business with the world, with American weaponry at the forefront, limits creative decision making and forces us into increasingly costly and ineffective options. We discount or ignore other non-lethal yet aggressive tools like subterfuge, secret diplomacy, bribery, and deception. We fail to deploy some of our greatest social assets in conducting foreign affairs, such as the appeal of our popular culture, our technological ingenuity, or business acumen. We fail to think of how to creatively deploy the full arsenal of American soft power, while relying too much, too often on the hard. Into the vacuum steps others, whose power to persuade seems to go further and prove more enduring than our power to kill.

I always think of Fadl Shaker. Fadl Shaker, if you don't know him, was one of the biggest pop singers in the Middle East. Huge number of hits, millions of records sold. A dozen hit albums. Influential to young men and women from Rabat to Baghdad. Especially women. Fadl is a handsome crooner, with a buttery voice that sang of love and lust. Fadl would have been just the sort of person America would have been well to contact. The kind of influential person who could have been invited to the United States and strategically placed in some silly romantic comedy alongside some Hollywood starlet or whatever. But we didn't get to him. One of the Sunni militant sheikhs, Ahmed al-Azeer, did. Fadl is now a militant Salafist soldier. Al-Azeer has called for Jihad in Syria against the Shia and Christians. Fadl is now singing about doing just that. I can imagine, not long after we have bombed something fierce, that he will be singing about a similar Jihad against America.

There are occasions where the strategic use of military force can have a positive effect on self-defense or defense of allies. Our long-standing military deployment in Germany, for example, backing up the NATO treaty alliance has created a long stretch of almost unheard-of peace in Western Europe. But there is a good argument to be made that the Marshall Plan, perhaps the most shining example of the effective use of American soft-power, was even more effective than establishing permanent bases in the heart of Europe.

The United States can't expect to solve every problem in the world, be it genocide or civil war or terrorism, solely through the dangerous and unpredictable nature of war. Not that there isn't a place for war. In self-defense or in defense of treaty allies, war is the only solution to a military attack. This is the primary reason we have a military force, to do what what it is trained to do: protect and defend territory. Not to conduct foreign policy."

Hagel announced decision Friday afternoon

WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday the Pentagon would bolster missile defense of the U.S. homeland with the addition of 14 interceptor missiles in the face of a growing threat from North Korea.

The additional 30 missiles will bring to 44 the number of interceptors defending the United States as part of a network in California and Alaska, Hagel told reporters in a Pentagon briefing.

The decision expands the system's ability to shoot down long-range missiles in flight before they could reach U.S. territory.

James Miller, defense undersecretary for policy, said in a speech Tuesday that the Pentagon has the ability to deploy up to 14 additional missile interceptors, ""if needed."" He did not say in the speech that a decision had been made to do so.

""As we think about our homeland missile-defense posture, we do not have a 'just-in-time' policy,"" Miller said. ""Our policy is to stay ahead of the threat — and to continue to ensure that we are ahead of any potential future Iranian or North Korean ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) capability.""

Miller noted that last December, North Korea launched a satellite into space, demonstrating its mastery of some of the same technologies required for development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

""Our concern about Pyongyang's potential ICBM capability is compounded by the regime's focus on developing nuclear weapons. North Korea's third nuclear test last month is obviously a serious concern for all nations,"" he said.

North Korea recently threatened to reduce Seoul to a ""sea of fire"" and stage pre-emptive nuclear attacks on Washington.

""North Korea's shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the U.S. to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future North Korean ICBM,"" Miller said in his speech on Tuesday.

The covert U.S. training at bases in Jordan and Turkey began months before President Obama approved plans to begin directly arming the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad, according to U.S. officials and rebel commanders.

“We have stepped up our assistance, but I cannot inventory for you all the elements of that assistance,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. “We have provided and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the Syrian opposition, as well as the Supreme Military Council.”

The Supreme Military Council is the military arm of an umbrella group that represents more moderate rebel factions, including the Free Syrian Army.

The training and Obama’s decision this month to supply arms and ammunition to the rebels have raised hope among the beleaguered opposition that Washington ultimately will provide heavier weapons as well. So far, the rebels say they lack the weapons they need to regain the offensive in Syria’s bitter civil war.

The tightly constrained U.S. effort reflects Obama’s continuing doubts about getting drawn into a conflict that already has killed more than 100,000 people and the administration’s fear that Islamic militants now leading the war against Assad could gain control of advanced U.S. weaponry.

The training has involved fighters from the Free Syrian Army, a loose confederation of rebel groups that the Obama administration has promised to back with expanded military assistance, said a U.S. official, who discussed the effort anonymously because he was not authorized to disclose details.

The number of rebels given U.S. instruction in both countries since the program began could not be determined, but in Jordan, the training involves 20 to 45 insurgents at a time, a rebel commander said.

U.S. special operations teams selected the trainees over the last year when the U.S. military set up regional supply lines to provide the rebels with nonlethal assistance, including uniforms, radios and medical aid.

The two-week courses include training with Russian-designed 14.5-millimeter anti-tank rifles, anti-tank missiles, as well as 23-millimeter anti-aircraft weapons, according to a rebel commander in the Syrian province of Dara who helps oversee weapons acquisitions and who asked his name not be used because the program is secret.

The training began last November at a new American base in the desert in southwest Jordan, he said. So far, about 100 rebels from Dara have attended four courses, while rebels from Damascus have attended three courses, he said.

“Those from the CIA, we would sit and talk with them during breaks from training and afterward, they would try to get information on the situation inside Syria,” he said.

The rebels were promised enough armor-piercing anti-tank weapons and other arms to gain a military advantage over Assad’s better-equipped army and security forces, said the Dara commander.

But arms shipments from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, provided with assent from the Americans, took months to arrive and included less than the rebels had expected.

Since last year, the weapons sent through the Dara military council have included four or five Russian-made heavy Concourse anti-tank missiles, 18 14.5-millimeter guns mounted on the backs of pickup trucks and 30 82-millimeter recoilless rifles. The weapons are all Soviet or Russian models but manufactured in other countries, he said.

“I’m telling you, this amount of weapons, once they are spread across the province [of Dara] is considered nothing,” the rebel commander said. “We need more than this to tip the balance or for there to even be a balance of power.”

U.S. officials said the Obama administration and its allies may supply anti-tank weapons to help the rebels destroy armored vehicles used by Assad forces. They are less likely to provide portable anti-aircraft missiles, which the rebels say they need to eliminate Assad’s warplanes. U.S. officials fear those missiles would fall into the hands of the Al Nusra front, the largest of the Islamist militias in the rebel coalition, which the U.S. regards as an Al Qaeda ally.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry is heading to Qatar on Saturday and will talk with other governments backing the rebels. A senior State Department official told reporters Friday that the talks would include discussions about coordinating deliveries of military aid.

CIA and White House officials declined to comment on the secret training programs. Other U.S. officials confirmed the training, but disputed some of the specific details provided by rebel commanders.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Bittar, who defected as a fighter pilot from Assad’s air force last year and is now head of intelligence for the Free Syrian Army, said training for the last month or so has taken place in Jordan.

The training, conducted by American, Jordanian and French operatives, involves rockets and anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry, he said.

Between 80 and 100 rebels from all over Syria have gone through the courses in the last month, he said, but training is continuing. Graduates are sent back across the border to rejoin the battle.

Bittar complained that sufficient weapons had yet to arrive for the rebel forces and said the Americans have not yet told them when they can expect to receive additional arms.

“Just promises, just promises,” he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-begin-grapple-syria-215018877--politics.html,,[],Lawmakers begin to grapple with Syria question,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of Congress, abruptly handed exactly the war powers many had demanded, grappled Saturday with whether to sign off on President Barack Obama's plan to punish Syria for an alleged chemical weapons attack. Now with a stake in the nation's global credibility, lawmakers were seeking more information about the possible consequences of striking a region without knowing what would happen next.

The debate over what action, if any, Congress might approve is in its infancy as lawmakers prepare for a public hearing Tuesday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But the first contours began emerging within hours of Obama's announcement.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he doesn't believe Syria should go unpunished for the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus. ""But we need to understand what the whole scope of consequences is,"" he said by telephone. ""What the president may perceive as limited ... won't stop there.""

Arguing for a strategy that seeks to end Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina issued a joint statement saying that any operation should be broader in scope than the ""limited"" scope Obama described.

""We cannot in good conscience support isolated military strikes in Syria that are not part of an overall strategy that can change the momentum on the battlefield, achieve the president's stated goal of Assad's removal from power, and bring an end to this conflict, which is a growing threat to our national security interests,"" the senators said.

""Anything short of this would be an inadequate response to the crimes against humanity that Assad and his forces are committing. And it would send the wrong signal to America's friends and allies, the Syrian opposition, the Assad regime, Iran, and the world - all of whom are watching closely what actions America will take,"" they said.

Lawmakers of both parties had, for days, demanded that Obama seek congressional authorization under the War Powers Act. Until Saturday, the president showed no willingness to do so and the military strike appeared imminent. Then, from the White House Rose Garden, Obama said he would strike Syria in a limited way and without boots on the ground. But, he added, he would seek congressional approval first.

Story continues

""All of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote,"" Obama said. ""And in doing so, I ask you, members of Congress, to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment.""

With that, Obama dropped the question of Syria, the nation's credibility and the balance of government power in the very laps of lawmakers who had complained about his go-it-alone-style — but were less clear about how they would want to deal with a horrific chemical attack that the administration said killed 1,429 people, including 426 children. Other estimates of the death toll were in the hundreds.

By evening Saturday, the White House sent Congress its draft of a resolution to authorize Obama to use military force. The draft does not lay out a specific timeline or course of military action but gives Obama approval to use the military as he determines ""necessary and appropriate"" to meet its objective of preventing further chemical attacks. It also affirms the administration's view that, ultimately, only a negotiated political settlement can resolve the crisis in Syria.

An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, confirmed that the speaker's office had received the draft.

A hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plus classified and unclassified briefings for senators were being scheduled, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Saturday. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the hearing would take place Tuesday.

Both the Senate and the House planned a vote on the matter no later than the week of Sept. 9.

There's little doubt that Obama as commander in chief could retaliate against Syrian targets without approval from the American people or their representatives in Congress. He did it two years ago in Libya, but in that case, the U.S. led a NATO coalition.

Congress' constitutional power to declare war was refined and expanded by the 1973 War Powers Act, which requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of initiating military action and bars U.S. armed forces for fighting for more than a maximum of 90 days without congressional approval. President Richard Nixon vetoed that bill, but Congress overrode the veto.

Even with that power, Congress hasn't formally declared war since World War II.

Every subsequent conflict involving U.S. forces, including military conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Iraq, the Caribbean island of Grenada, Kosovo and Libya were undeclared, even though in most cases Congress did vote approval short of a war declaration — sometimes after the fact. The Korean War was fought under the auspices of the United Nations, the one in Kosovo, by NATO.

With Syria, Israel's safety was a key concern. Dealing a blow to Iranian-backed Syria could mean a retaliatory strike against a key ally staunchly backed by many lawmakers, and some said that any president would need the weight of Congress behind him in such a situation.

""The potential for escalation in this situation is so great that I think it's essential that the president not be out there on his own,"" Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said Saturday in an interview.

But that's a different question than whether to carry out such a strike. Like Cornyn, Thornberry said he wanted to know what the goals would be— and the consequences. In town halls held over the recess, he said, constituents asked him why what happened in Syria should matter to them.

""The president has to convince us,"" Thornberry said.

What to do about Syria is a politically perilous question for lawmakers, and one that has scrambled loyalties. Still uncomfortably fresh is the memory of the Iraq war and the Bush administration's justification — since disproven — that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Liberals who voted in October 2002 against giving Republican President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq over weapons of mass destruction are echoing Obama's push for punitive strikes against Syria.

Some Republicans who in the past embraced Bush's military doctrine of pre-emptive action — and repeatedly rejected Democratic attempts to end decade-plus conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan — have rhetorically grabbed 1960s peace signs in warning against the implications of U.S. intervention in the Mideast conflict.

If Obama intended to make the debate less about his leadership and more about the policy, the move to seek authorization didn't work on Rep. Peter King.

King, a New York Republican and a member of the House's intelligence committee, suggested that the president was undermining the authorities of future presidents and seeking a political shield for himself by going through Congress.

""The president doesn't need 535 members of Congress to enforce his own red line,"" King said.

Release of the detainees, who were not identified, would end a near-total moratorium on transfers since early 2012. The announcement comes less than a week before Obama is scheduled to hold talks at the White House with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi of Yemen to discuss repatriation of detainees from his country.

“As the president has said, the United States remains determined to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. He added that the decision to repatriate the two Algerians was being carried out “in consultation with the Congress, and in a responsible manner that protects our national security.”

The move leaves Obama far short of his goal of closing the prison, which now holds 166 inmates, but it was hailed by human rights advocates as a sign that the administration was making a new push after letting closure plans languish since early in his first term.

The move was “the sign we’ve been waiting for,” said Andrea Prasow, senior counter-terrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch.

The decision to send two Algerians home came after “a very senior interagency team conducted an intensive review of this matter” and recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that he approve the transfer, according to Pentagon Press Secretary George Little.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she supported the decision. “This is an important step toward closing the prison once and for all,” she said. “At a cost of $454 million annually — or $2.7 million per detainee — it is in the national security interests of the United States to transfer these detainees to their home countries.”

The two men are among five Algerians still held at Guantanamo. White House aides declined to describe what agreement, if any, had been reached with the Algerian government on the treatment of the detainees. Algeria’s security services have long been known for harsh treatment of Islamic fighters.

But when prisoners have been sent to Algeria in the past, they have been taken into custody by the government, questioned and in many cases quickly released, Prasow said.

“The crucial questions are whether the detainees want to be transferred to Algeria and whether they will face human rights violations there. Closing the detention facility must not mean transferring people to torture, indefinite detention or unfair trials,” said Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International’s Security with Human Rights campaign.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said transfer decisions were made after “detailed, specific conversations” about how the receiving country will handle the prisoners.

“The assurances must be tailored to mitigate the specific threat that a detainee may pose, and we must be convinced that the transfer is consistent with our humane treatment standards,” she said. “If we do

not receive credible assurances, the transfer does not occur.”

Transfers take about a month to process after the Pentagon signs off and Congress is notified, administration officials said. They would not say when the prisoners would be sent to Algeria.

A highly visible remnant of President George W. Bush’s counter-terrorism policies, the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba has frustrated the Obama White House. Obama pledged during his 2008 campaign to close it, saying the detention center was a “sad chapter” in U.S. history. He failed after fierce opposition in Congress to moving detainees not chosen for repatriation to a prison in the U.S.

But as dozens of Guantanamo’s detainees participated in hunger strikes to protest their indefinite confinement, as well as conditions at the prison, Obama renewed his call for Congress to close it and said he would pursue transfers and other steps to shrink the population.

Eighty-six prisoners, most of them from Yemen, were cleared for conditional transfer out of the prison in 2010. An additional 46 have been classified as impossible to put on trial.

But transfers largely ground to a halt in 2012, when the administration announced a moratorium

on sending detainees back to Yemen after determining that a plan to attack a U.S. airliner was plotted there.

Congress also required the administration to certify that transfers did not pose

a threat to U.S. security. Some lawmakers are moving to eliminate that requirement.

Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) called Friday for Congress to remove the “unnecessary and counterproductive statutory impediments that, for too long,” had impeded prisoner transfers.

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/07/iran-airs-images-allegedly-extracted-from-us-drone/,2013-02-07 00:00:00,[],Iran releases footage allegedly extracted from US drone,"Iran says it has broadcast footage on state TV allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace near the Afghan-Iran border.

The video aired late Wednesday on Iranian shows an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be a U.S. drone base and Kandahar, Afghanistan. The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran but it was unclear if that footage meant to depict the moment of the drone's seizure.

The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran.

""""We aren't able to confirm the authenticity of the video,"" a spokesman from the Department of Defense told Fox News.

""As you know, we don't provide details regarding matters of intelligence.""

Iran has long claimed it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel, seized in December 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace from its eastern border with Afghanistan, and that it's capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft.

After initially saying only that a drone had been lost near the Afghan-Iran border, American officials eventually confirmed the Sentinel had been monitoring Iran's military and nuclear facilities. Washington asked for it back but Iran refused, and instead released photos of Iranian officials studying the aircraft.

In another part of the video, the chief of the Revolutionary Guard's airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said that only after capturing the drone, Iran realized it ""belongs to the CIA.""

""We were able to definitively access the data of the drone, once we brought it down,"" said Hajizadeh.

He described the Sentinel's capture as a huge scoop for Iran, saying that at the time, Tehran did not rule out a possible punitive U.S. airstrike over the drone.

In addition, the TV also showed images of an Iranian helicopter transporting the drone, as well as its disassembled parts being carried on a trailer.

In November, Iran claimed that the U.S. drone had violated its airspace. The Pentagon said the aircraft, which came under fire but was not hit, was over international waters.

In an attempt to embarrass Washington, Iran has also claimed to have captured several American drones, most recently in December, when Tehran said it seized a Boeing-designed ScanEagle drone — a less sophisticated aircraft — after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf.

U.S. officials said there was no evidence that the latest claims were true.

Also Thursday, the semi-official Fars news agency published photos reportedly depicting a domestic production line of ScanEagle drones. The photos show several drones in a workshop.

Iran has said before that it's making ScanEagle copies and putting them into service, but has not offered proof for those claims.

Fars also quoted deputy defense minister, Mohammad Eslami, as saying that Iran has also established a ""production line for the drones in foreign countries."" He did not elaborate, and it was not clear if he was referring to Syria or Lebanon's Hezbollah group, Iran's top regional allies.

The drone capture has further escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which is under international sanctions over its suspect nuclear program.

The U.S and its allies believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon. Iran has repeatedly denied the charge, claiming its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only, such as power generation and cancer treatment.

The latest Sentinel footage came as the U.S. tightened sanctions to pressure the Iranian government to limit its nuclear program and restrictions on institutions that Washington says are stifling political dissent and censoring speech.

Among the expanded measures announced Monday by the Treasury Department is a move to deny Iran access to revenue garnered from its oil exports. Under the latest sanctions, Iran would only be able to use revenue from its oil sales in a country that purchased its crude -- now mostly big Asian economies such as China and India -- which would significantly limit its access to the money.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday rejected proposals for direct talks with United States over its nuclear program, marking the first reaction to the proposals for the one-on-one talks.

Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., are scheduled to resume nuclear negotiations later this month.

http://news.yahoo.com/wikileaks-snowden-going-ecuador-seek-asylum-170935684.html,,[],WikiLeaks: Snowden going to Ecuador to seek asylum,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Admitted leaker Edward Snowden took flight Sunday in evasion of U.S. authorities, seeking asylum in Ecuador and leaving the Obama administration scrambling to determine its next step in what became a game of diplomatic cat-and-mouse.

The former National Security Agency contractor and CIA technician fled Hong Kong and arrived at the Moscow airport, where he planned to spend the night before boarding an Aeroflot flight to Cuba. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said his government received an asylum request from Snowden, and the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said it would help him.

""He goes to the very countries that have, at best, very tense relationships with the United States,"" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., adding that she feared Snowden would trade more U.S. secrets for asylum. ""This is not going to play out well for the national security interests of the United States.""

The move left the U.S. with limited options as Snowden's itinerary took him on a tour of what many see as anti-American capitals. Ecuador in particular has rejected the United States' previous efforts at cooperation, and has been helping WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, avoid prosecution by allowing him to stay at its embassy in London.

Snowden gave The Guardian and The Washington Post documents disclosing U.S. surveillance programs that collect vast amounts of phone records and online data in the name of foreign intelligence, but often sweep up information on American citizens. Officials have the ability to collect phone and Internet information broadly but need a warrant to examine specific cases where they believe terrorism is involved.

Snowden had been in hiding for several weeks in Hong Kong, a former British colony with a high degree of autonomy from mainland China. The United States formally sought Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong but was rebuffed; Hong Kong officials said the U.S. request did not fully comply with their laws.

Story continues

The Justice Department rejected that claim, saying its request met all of the requirements of the extradition treaty between the U.S. and Hong Kong.

During conversations last week, including a phone call Wednesday between Attorney General Eric Holder and Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong officials never raised any issues regarding sufficiency of the U.S. request, a Justice spokesperson said.

A State Department official said the United States was in touch through diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries that Snowden could travel through or to, reminding them that Snowden is wanted on criminal charges and reiterating Washington's position that Snowden should only be permitted to travel back to the U.S.

Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case.

The Justice Department said it would ""pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel.""

Russia's state ITAR-Tass news agency and Interfax cited an unnamed Aeroflot airline official as saying Snowden was on the plane that landed Sunday afternoon in Moscow.

Upon his arrival, Snowden did not leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. One explanation could be that he wasn't allowed; a U.S. official said Snowden's passport had been revoked, and special permission from Russian authorities would have been needed.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said, ""Given our intensified cooperation after the Boston marathon bombings and our history of working with Russia on law enforcement matters — including returning numerous high-level criminals back to Russia at the request of the Russian government — we expect the Russian government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.""

The Russian media report said Snowden intended to fly to Cuba on Monday and then on to Caracas, Venezuela.

U.S. lawmakers scoffed. ""The freedom trail is not exactly China-Russia-Cuba-Venezuela, so I hope we'll chase him to the ends of the earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there'll be consequences if they harbor this guy,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

With each suspected flight, efforts to secure Snowden's return to the United States appeared more complicated if not impossible. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but does with Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador. Even with an extradition agreement though, any country could give Snowden a political exemption.

The likelihood that any of these countries would stop Snowden from traveling on to Ecuador seemed remote. While diplomatic tensions have thawed in recent years, Cuba and the United States are hardly allies after a half century of distrust.

Venezuela, too, could prove difficult. Former President Hugo Chavez was a sworn enemy of the United States and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, earlier this year called Obama ""grand chief of devils."" The two countries do not exchange ambassadors.

U.S. pressure on Caracas also might be problematic given its energy exports. The U.S. Energy Information Agency reports Venezuela sent the United States 900,000 barrels of crude oil each day in 2012, making it the fourth-largest foreign source of U.S. oil.

""I think 10 percent of Snowden's issues are now legal, and 90 percent political,"" said Douglas McNabb, an expert in international extradition and a senior principal at international criminal defense firm McNabb Associates.

Assange's lawyer, Michael Ratner, said Snowden's options aren't numerous.

""You have to have a country that's going to stand up to the United States,"" Ratner said. ""You're not talking about a huge range of countries here.""

That is perhaps why Snowden first stopped in Russia, a nation with complicated relations with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""aiding and abetting Snowden's escape,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

""Allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways, and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States,"" Schumer said. ""That's not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.""

It also wasn't clear Snowden was finished with disclosing highly classified information.

""I am very worried about what else he has,"" said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she had been told Snowden had perhaps more than 200 sensitive documents.

Ros-Lehtinen spoke with CNN. Graham spoke to ""Fox News Sunday."" Schumer was on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Sanchez appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Feinstein was on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Jordan is the Obama%27s final stop on a four-day visit to the Middle East

Obama called on international community to address Syria conflict



President working with Congress to provide Jordan with %24200M in aid

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Anxious to keep Syria's civil war from spiraling into even worse problems, President Barack Obama said Friday he worries about the country becoming a haven for extremists when — not if — President Bashar Assad is ousted from power.

Obama, standing side by side with Jordan's King Abdullah II, said the international community must work together to ensure there is a credible opposition ready to step into the breach.

""Something has been broken in Syria, and it's not going to be put back together perfectly immediately — even after Assad leaves,"" Obama said. ""But we can begin the process of moving it in a better direction, and having a cohesive opposition is critical to that.""

He said Assad is sure to go but there is great uncertainty about what will happen after that.

""I am very concerned about Syria becoming an enclave for extremism,"" Obama said, adding that extremism thrives in chaos and failed states. He said the rest of the world has a huge stake in ensuring that a functioning Syria emerges.

""The outcome is Syria is not going to be ideal,"" he acknowledged, adding that strengthening a credible opposition was crucial to minimizing the difficulties.

STORY:Israel apologizes to Turkey over flotilla deaths

Eager to resolve another source of tension in the region, the president earlier Friday helped broker a phone call between the Israeli and Turkish prime ministers that led to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Obama had come to Jordan from Israel, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu placed a call to Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan to apologize for the deaths of nine Turkish activists in a 2009 Israeli naval raid on a Gaza-bound international flotilla.

""The timing was good for that conversation to take place,"" Obama said.

Obama, at a joint news conference with Abdullah, said his administration is working with Congress to provide Jordan with an additional $200 million in aid this year to cope with the massive influx of refugees streaming into the country from Syria.

Abdullah said the refugee population in his country has topped 460,000 and is likely to double by the end of the year — the equivalent of 60 million refugees in the United States, he said.

Obama also said he would ""keep on plugging away"" in hopes of getting the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a peace agreement.

""The window of opportunity still exists, but it's getting more and more difficult,"" the president said. ""The mistrust is building instead of ebbing.""

On Iran, Obama reiterated that the U.S. is open to ""every option that's available"" to keep the country from developing a nuclear weapon.

He said it would be ""extraordinarily dangerous"" for the world if Iran does become nuclear capable, and he expressed his desire for using diplomatic means to halt Iran's nuclear aspirations. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

""My hope and expectation is that among a menu of options, the option that involves negotiations, discussions, compromise and resolution of the problem is the one that's exercised,"" Obama said. ""But as president of the United States I would never take any option off the table.""

Obama arrived in Jordan on Friday evening, the final stop on a four-day visit to the Middle East that included his first stop in Israel as president.

He began his visit to Amman with an apology.

""I apologize for the delay,"" Obama told Abdullah after arriving about an hour behind schedule. ""We ended up having a dust storm.""

The two leaders headed to dinner after their news conference. On Saturday, Obama planned several hours of sightseeing, including a tour of the fabled ancient city of Petra, before the return trip to Washington.

Before leaving Israel, Obama paid his respects to the nation's heroes and to victims of the Holocaust. He also solemnly reaffirmed the Jewish state's right to exist.

Accompanied by Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, Obama laid wreaths at the graves of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism who died in 1904 before realizing his dream of a Jewish homeland, and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.

He also toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, declaring afterward that it illustrates the depravity to which man can sink but also serves as a reminder of the ""righteous among the nations who refused to be bystanders.""

Friday's stop at Herzl's grave, together with Thursday's visit to see the Dead Sea Scrolls, the ancient Hebrew texts, were symbolic stops for Obama that acknowledged a rationale for Israel's existence that rests with its historical ties to the region and with a vision that predated the Holocaust. Obama has been criticized in Israel for his 2009 Cairo speech in which he gave only the example of the Holocaust as a reason for justifying Israel's existence.

""Here on your ancient land, let it be said for all the world to hear,"" Obama said. ""The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a holocaust will never happen again.""

Obama and Netanyahu met for two hours over lunch. An Israeli official said that they discussed Israel's security challenges and that, in addressing the peace process with Palestinians, Netanyahu stressed the importance of security. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic protocol.

Obama also squeezed in a stop in Bethlehem in the West Bank to visit the Church of the Nativity.

He had been scheduled to take a helicopter to Bethlehem but had to change plans due to unusually high winds. The route gave Obama a clear look at Israel's separation barrier with the West Bank, which runs south of Jerusalem and is the subject of weekly protests by Palestinians.

About 300 Palestinians and international pilgrims gathered near the Nativity Church, awaiting Obama's arrival. But a knot of protesters along the route held up signs stating: ""Gringo, return to your colony"" and ""US supports Israeli injustice.""

At a nearby mosque, Mohammed Ayesh, a Muslim religious official in Bethlehem, issued a plea to Obama in a speech to worshippers: ""America, where are your values? Where are the human rights? Isn't it time that you interfere to make it stop?""

Amid high security, Obama toured the church with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. They stopped at the Grotto of the Nativity, which is said to stand where Jesus Christ was born. About 20 children waving U.S. and Palestinian flags greeted Obama in a courtyard outside the sanctuary. He posed for photographs with Abbas and Bethlehem's mayor, Vera Baboun.

At Yad Vashem, Obama donned a skull cap and was accompanied by Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, a survivor of the Buchenwald Concentration camp who lost both parents in the Holocaust. Among his stops was Yad Vashem's Hall of Names, a circular chamber that contains original testimony documenting every Holocaust victim ever identified.

""Nothing could be more powerful,"" Obama said."

Congressional approval could prove difficult, as conservatives and liberal Democrats have expressed uneasiness with a military campaign.

About 200 members of Congress from both parties had signed letters demanding that the president seek congressional approval before pursuing any military action.

After Obama finished outlining his intentions in the White House Rose Garden, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that he was “very pleased that the president has listened to the suggestion we and many others have made to bring this authorization to Congress.”

Corker, who has spoken in support of a military strike, said it was now “imperative that he immediately begins using every ounce of his energy to make his case to the American people.”

“We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “ In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9th. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled his support for Obama’s decision, saying in a statement that “the president’s role as commander-in-chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress.”

Congress is on an extended summer break and is not scheduled to return to Washington until the second week of September. Earlier Saturday, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said in a statement, “Before any military action is taken in Syria, the president should call Congress back into session and ask for a vote on the authorization to use force.”

Obama administration officials plan to brief the full membership of Congress this weekend, the first such expanded briefing for lawmakers since the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack blamed on the Syrian government that killed 1,400 people, including at least 426 children.

Senate Republicans and Democrats will have separate conference calls Saturday afternoon with senior officials, including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

A spokesman for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate minority leader requested the call for Senate Republicans, saying that it was “important for the whole conference to have the opportunity to communicate directly with the administration on this important issue.”

Members of the House have also been invited to an in-person briefing on Sunday at the Capitol, which congressional sources also said came at the request of the House leadership. It is unclear how many members of the House would return to Washington for the briefing.

So far, only the congressional leadership and members of committees with jurisdiction over national security have participated in administration briefings.

On Thursday, 26 members of Congress took part in a more than 90-minute call with White House officials. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee were briefed on Friday.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of the strongest congressional voices demanding an authorization vote, quickly posted on his Twitter account: “Thank you, Mr. President.” He later added that it was “unfortunate” he had to thank the president “for following the Constitution and the law.”

PHOENIX -- This was supposed to be the year of immigration reform.

But with hope quickly fading that an immigration bill will pass by year's end, advocates are shifting their focus to 2014, girding for an even tougher battle as the already-contentious issue drifts into the perilous political waters of an election year.

Reform advocates are determined to keep the immigration debate alive, vowing to continue pressing lawmakers to pass immigration reform, if not this year, then next.

""We need to keep fanning the flames,"" said Eduardo Nevares, auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and immigration-reform advocate.

Until Congress acts, some activists also are increasing calls on President Barack Obama to take action on his own by stopping deportations and expanding his deferred-action program to a larger number of undocumented immigrants, not just those brought here illegally as children.

One unexpected call for such action drew widespread attention this week, when a heckler shouted at Obama as he delivered a speech in support of immigration reform at a recreation center in San Francisco's Chinatown neighborhood on Monday.

""Mr. President, please use your executive order to halt deportations for all 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in this country right now,"" the heckler shouted.

The San Jose Mercury News identified the heckler as Ju Hong, 24, a University of California-Berkeley graduate and immigrant without legal status from South Korea.

""We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. But at the same time you have the power to stop deportations for all undocumented immigrants in the country,"" Hong yelled.

""Actually, I don't,"" Obama responded.

""If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we are also a nation of laws,"" Obama continued. ""And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend I can try and do something by violating our laws. And what I am proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal you want to achieve.""

But if that doesn't work, reform supporters are also gearing up for next year's elections, when they hope to send a message by targeting Republicans in congressional districts where demographics give Latino voters more clout.

""As much as it looks bleak for action this year, we haven't given up,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that champions comprehensive immigration reform. ""If this Congress doesn't get immigration reform done, then a lot of us are going to work as hard as we can to elect a Congress in 2014 that will.""

In the meantime, reform advocates haven't completely written off this year, which started off with Obama and influential Republicans declaring their support for immigration reform.

Activists from several states have camped out at House Speaker John Boehner's Washington, D.C., office. They also have held vigils at his home and confronted him while eating at a diner.

Despite months of minimal movement on the issue, Boehner, R-Ohio, and — as recently as Sunday — House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., continue to suggest immigration reform is still alive, while being vague about a timeline for action.

But House GOP leaders are unlikely to explicitly declare immigration reform dead, recognizing the negative message such a declaration would send to Latino voters.

""Immigration reform is going to happen,"" McCarthy said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""But it's going to happen in a step-by-step method. ... The immigration system, it is broken, it needs to be fixed.""

Piecemeal approach

A step-by-step approach on immigration reform is gaining momentum after House Republican leaders refused to take up the comprehensive bill passed by the Senate in June.

But the heightened partisanship that accompanies congressional midterm elections will make passing any bill more difficult as the year progresses, analysts say.

Obama announced he is willing to go along with the House GOP strategy of passing a series of ""piecemeal"" immigration bills in a specific sequence rather than the comprehensive approach preferred by the White House and the Democrats who control the Senate. Obama said the House bills must address the same components as the Senate's bipartisan comprehensive package, which includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country in addition to addressing border security, the legal immigration backlog, new visas for foreign workers and other issues. The Senate passed its bill on June 27.

""They're suspicious of comprehensive bills, but if they want to chop that thing up into five pieces, as long as all five pieces get done, I don't care what it looks like as long as it's actually delivering on those core values that we talk about,"" Obama said at a Nov. 19 Wall Street Journal event.

Boehner dealt a blow to the morale of reform supporters when he announced House Republicans would not negotiate with the Senate on its comprehensive bill. But he has since reiterated that House Republicans are continuing to work on their own immigration bills and called Obama's comments encouraging.

Several House immigration bills have moved through committee, but so far Boehner has brought none to the floor for a vote of the full House. Other bills that would provide a path to citizenship for ""dreamers,"" the young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, and address the legal status of the broader undocumented population have yet to surface. The House dreamer legislation, which has been tentatively dubbed ""the Kids Act,"" apparently has hit a snag over whether the dreamers would be allowed to sponsor their parents and other family members for citizenship.

Cesar Vargas, director of the Dream Action Coalition, said trying to put such restrictions on dreamers could be unconstitutional and create ""a second-class citizenry"" in the United States. But despite those concerns, he called on House Republicans to introduce the legislation anyway.

""Let's see what the Kids Act is,"" Vargas said. ""If they want to introduce this act as is, with the parental ban, well, let's introduce it. Let's debate it.""

Parallel efforts

Petra Falcon, director of Promise Arizona, an advocacy group pushing for reforms that allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and citizenship, said she remains hopeful that a bill will pass in the few remaining weeks of the year. But if it doesn't, her group will push lawmakers to pass immigration reform in 2014.

In 2014, the group's main focus will continue to be applying pressure on lawmakers by building an electorate that favors immigration reform. For the past several years, Promise Arizona and other immigration-reform groups have been targeting Republican-held congressional districts in Arizona by going door to door and registering Latino voters.

""In 2014, we've got to continue broadening the electoral base,"" Falcon said.

Sharry, of America's Voice, indicated efforts to lobby the Obama administration and Homeland Security Department on deportation policy would continue parallel to political efforts.

""The president says he supports the Senate bill, and yet the administration is deporting people who would qualify for legal status,"" Sharry said. ""It's arbitrary and cruel.""

But others in the immigration-reform movement don't necessarily agree administrative action would be the best route. Some worry such a move by Obama would further inflame congressional Republican opposition to a legislative solution on immigration that many say is desperately needed.

""I hope that doesn't happen because I think that would divide the nation in a bad way,"" Nevares said.

Even dreamers who have temporarily benefited under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative say congressional action is needed now.

DACA applies to undocumented immigrants between the ages of 15 to 30 who came to the U.S. as children and who are in school or have graduated from high school.

Reyna Montoya of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition noted that in Arizona, dreamers still can't get driver licenses.

""It's just been really, really challenging to see that every day, every inaction of Congress, we see the consequences in our state,"" she said during a recent conference call with reporters.

Lizeth Arias of the Dreamers of Virginia also said dreamers need something more permanent.

""We all are pressured by the time that is passing. Our deferred action is not going to last forever,"" Arias said. ""It'll be over for most of us next year, and we must renew it. And if they decide to cut the program, then we are left again where we started: as undocumented (youths) with little possibility for a brighter future."""

Kerry expressed hope the new Iranian government would provide information on the whereabouts of the 65-year-old Robert Levinson and pushed back on the argument that the U.S. has stopped looking for the retired FBI agent.

“To suggest that we have abandoned him or anybody has abandoned him is simply incorrect, and not helpful,"" he told ABC’s “This Week.” “I think the Iranian government has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.""

Meanwhile, Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Levinson is not being held by the government and that he has “no idea” about who might have him.

Still, Zarif said his country “will certainly discuss” Levinson’s return should he be found.

The Associated Press reported last week that Levinson was working for the CIA to investigate the Iranian government, amid the U.S.’ longstanding position that he was a private citizen who traveled to an Iranian island on business.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain raised doubts Sunday about how much Iran knows about Levinson but said he was confident that his country is doing all it can to learn what has happened.

He also suggested on CNN’s “State of Union” that the Obama administration has not been totally forthcoming with information about Levinson and that the CIA “did not tell the truth to the Congress"" about the ordeal.

Kerry acknowledged the lack of progress in finding Levinson, who was last known to be on an unauthorized CIA mission on the Iranian island in 2007.

“There hasn't been progress in the sense that we don't have him back,"" he said. ""We're looking for proof of life. We're working on several processes that I'm not free to talk about. But there are a number of different channels that are being worked aggressively. … I can't tell you what happened or how the sequence was.”

On Friday, Levinson's family released a statement on the situation.

""Bob is a courageous man who has dedicated himself, including risking his own life, in service to the U.S. government,"" the statement read. ""But the U.S. government has failed to make saving this good man's life the priority it should be. There are those in the U.S. government who have done their duty in their efforts to find Bob, but there are those who have not.""

In March 2007, Levinson flew to Kish Island, an Iranian resort awash with tourists, smugglers and organized crime figures. Days later, after an arranged meeting with an admitted killer, he checked out of his hotel, slipped into a taxi and vanished.

In an extraordinary breach of the most basic CIA rules, a team of analysts -- with no authority to run spy operations – paid Levinson to gather intelligence from some of the world’s darkest corners.

The CIA was slow to respond to Levinson’s disappearance and spent the first several months denying any involvement. When Congress eventually discovered what happened, one of the biggest scandals in recent CIA history erupted.

Behind closed doors, three veteran analysts were forced out of the agency and seven others were disciplined. The CIA paid Levinson’s family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders.

But even after White House, FBI and State Department officials learned of Levinson’s CIA ties, the official story remained unchanged.

Details of the unusual disappearance were described in documents obtained or reviewed by the AP, plus interviews over several years with dozens of current and former U.S. and foreign officials close to the search for Levinson. Nearly all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive case."

http://news.yahoo.com/bin-laden-spokesman-pleads-not-guilty-plot-152021026.html,,[],Bin Laden spokesman pleads not guilty to plot,"NEW YORK (AP) — A senior al-Qaida leader and son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, captured in Jordan in the past week, pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court in New York to plotting against Americans in his role as the terror network's top spokesman.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was brought into the largest courtroom at the federal courthouse shortly after 10 a.m. and entered the plea through a lawyer to one count of conspiracy to kill Americans in a case that marks a legal victory for President Barack Obama's administration.

Black cuffs bound his hands behind him as he was led into a courtroom with about 80 spectators, mostly journalists, lawyers and court employees. He was bearded and wearing a blue prison uniform. The cuffs were taken off, and he was seated next to his court-appointed lawyer, federal defender Philip Weinstein.

Abu Ghaith was arrested overseas the night of Feb. 28, gave an ""extensive post-arrest statement"" that totaled 22 pages, and arrived here March 1, Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. Cronan said. The prosecutor gave no details on the statement.

Through an interpreter, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan asked whether Abu Ghaith understood his rights. Abu Ghaith nodded yes. Asked whether he had money to hire an attorney, Abu Ghaith shook his head no. He nodded when asked whether he had signed an affidavit describing his financial situation.

Bail was not requested, and none was set. The judge said he would set a trial date April 8. Prosecutors said a trial would last about three weeks.

The Obama administration has long sought to charge senior al-Qaida suspects in American federal courts instead of military tribunals at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it runs counter to demands by Republicans in Congress who do not want high-threat terror suspects brought into the United States.

Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait and was bin Laden's son-in-law. The Department of Justice said he was the spokesman for al-Qaida, working alongside bin Laden and current leader Ayman al-Zawahri, since at least May 2001. Abu Ghaith is a former mosque preacher and teacher.

Story continues

The day after the Sept. 11 attacks, prosecutors say, he appeared with bin Laden and al-Zawahri and called on the ""nation of Islam"" to battle against Jews, Christians and Americans.

A ""great army is gathering against you,"" Abu Ghaith said on Sept. 12, 2001, according to prosecutors.

Shortly afterward, Abu Ghaith warned in a speech that ""the storms shall not stop — especially the airplanes storm"" and advised Muslims, children and al-Qaida allies to stay out of planes and high-rise buildings. In one video, he was sitting with bin Laden in front of a rock face in Afghanistan. Kuwait stripped him of his citizenship after Sept. 11.

In 2002, under pressure as the U.S. military and CIA searched for bin Laden, Abu Ghaith was smuggled into Iran from Afghanistan, prosecutors said.

Abu Ghaith's trial will mark one of the first prosecutions of senior al-Qaida leaders on U.S. soil. Charging foreign terror suspects in American federal courts was a top pledge by Obama shortly after he took office in 2009, aimed, in part, to close Guantanamo Bay.

Republicans have fought the White House to keep Guantanamo open. Several GOP lawmakers on Thursday said Abu Ghaith should be considered an enemy combatant and sent to Guantanamo.

Generally, Guantanamo detainees have fewer legal rights and due process than they would have in a court in America but could potentially yield more information to prevent future threats.

USA TODAY

Current adviser Tom Donilon is leaving the administration

Samantha Power is nominated to replace Rice as U.N. ambassador

National security job does not require Senate confirmation

Congressional Republicans may have cost Susan Rice a job as secretary of state, but President Obama has now given her a post that could be more powerful.

In moving Rice from United Nations ambassador to national security adviser, Obama said Wednesday that she ""exemplifies the finest tradition of American diplomacy and leadership.""

She also assumes a job designed to coordinate national security policies along with the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies — a very influential position within what one analyst called a ""White House-centric"" administration.

""It's driven by the very small group of people close to the president,"" said David Rothkopf, CEO and editor-at-large of Foreign Policy magazine.

Rice — a long-time adviser to Obama — ""is already a member of that group,"" Rothkopf said.

The Rice appointment renewed Republican accusations that Obama administration officials sought to cover up details of the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya. The protests have little effect, however — the national security adviser's job does not require Senate confirmation.

Obama also announced Wednesday that he is nominating former National Security Council aide Samantha Power to replace Rice at the U.N., describing the human rights scholar as ""one of our foremost thinkers on foreign policy.""

Unlike national security adviser job, the U.N. position does require Senate approval.

Rice, 48, will replace Tom Donilon, whose work as national security adviser since 2010 won praise from a president who spoke of "" strengthening our alliances"" and ""enhancing our relationship with key powers.""

The switch comes as Obama prepares for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping; Donilon was in Beijing recently preparing for the meeting.

Donilon, 58, will stay on the job until early July, working with Obama on planned trips to Europe and Africa.

His retirement has been expected sometime this year, and Rice has long been considered the top candidate for his replacement.

Obama had considered Rice for secretary of State late last year, but appointed John Kerry instead, in part because of the controversy that surrounding the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Republicans investigating Benghazi have criticized Rice over television interviews she gave five days after the attack, attributing it to protests over an anti-Islam film. After the administration later called it a pre-planned terrorist assault, GOP members accused Rice and others of an attempted cover-up.

Rice said she discussed the attack based on the evidence known at the time, while Obama and aides accused the Republicans of politicizing the tragedy.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a potential 2016 presidential candidate, tweeted after Rice's appointment: ""I really question the President's judgment in promoting someone who was complicit in misleading the American public on the Benghazi attacks.""

The Rice appointment may also be a sign that Obama and aides believe the Benghazi investigation is behind them.

""It is certainly a very confident move on the part of the president,"" Rothkopf said.

During a Rose Garden ceremony unveiling his revamped team, Obama noted that Rice put together his foreign policy advisory team ahead of the 2008 presidential campaign.

Describing Rice as ""passionate and pragmatic,"" Obama said that ""everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity. But she's also mindful that we have to exercise our power wisely and deliberately.""

In brief remarks, Rice said she was ""deeply honored"" by the appointment, and added that ""we have vital opportunities to seize and ongoing challenges to confront.""

Among those challenges: The U.S. reaction to the civil war in Syria and violence throughout the Middle East, sometimes testy relationships with China and Russia, and completing the end of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.

James Mann, author of a book on the administration's foreign policy team called The Obamians, said the national security adviser is often ""more central"" to policy making than the secretary of state, especially in this White House.

""I think Obama wants to be his own decision maker on foreign policy,"" said Mann, author-in-residence with the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

One Republican critic — Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential election — tweeted that while he disagree with the Rice appointment, ""I'll make every effort to work with her on important issues.""

In nominating Power to be the new ambassador to the United Nations, Obama picked a former campaign aide, White House official and author who has specialized in genocide and human rights. As Obama noted, Power, 42, won a Pulitzer Prize for her 2002 book, A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide.

Power had to leave the presidential campaign in the spring of 2008 after describing then-rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as a ""monster"" who would stop at nothing to defeat Obama. Power apologized for the remark. After the election, Obama put Power on the NSC and made Clinton his first secretary of State.

Power, who was born in Ireland, said the United States plays a critical role in helping the United Nations meet its obligations. ""I have seen U.N. aid workers enduring shell fire to deliver food to the people of Sudan,"" she said. ""Yet I've also seen U.N. peacekeepers fail to protect the people of Bosnia.""

Donilon has worked for Obama throughout his presidency, first serving as deputy national security adviser. Obama appointed him to the top job in October of 2010, following the departure of James Jones.

Obama said Donilon helped improve U.S. relations with Asia, wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, slap new sanctions on Iran, and coordinate the raid that killed 9/11 architect Osama bin Laden in 2011. The president said Donilon handled a wide portfolio that ranged from trade to energy to military security. ""Tom has been instrumental every step of the way,"" he said.

For his part, Donilon praised Obama and thanked him for his appointment, calling it ""the privilege of a lifetime."""

Now, I am starting to feel a little sorry for the guy, a fugitive who has become a kind of worldwide reject, as his quest for political asylum has begun to look like the geopolitical equivalent of “Let’s Make a Deal.” He’s asked 21 countries so far to accept him. So far, no one has said “Come on down!”

In a statement posted on the WikiLeaks site this week, Snowden angrily denounced the U.S. for annulling his passport. “The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,” he wrote. “Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.”

That accusation seems specious to me, actually. An invalid passport is not a revocation of citizenship, nor has it stopped him from seeking asylum. He is more than welcome to return to his motherland, and the U.S. has offered safe passage all the way home.

But Snowden has suggested that he will not return to the U.S. unless the Justice Department agrees to let him to remain free before trial, citing the disturbing treatment of Bradley Manning, the soldier who was kept in solitary confinement for months awaiting his trial, which began last month, for disseminating classified information to WikiLeaks. A U.N. investigation found the conditions under which Manning was kept “cruel, inhuman and degrading.”

A little over a week ago, in a fascinating conference call with reporters on June 24, Snowden’s spirit guide Julian Assange, the prickly WikiLeaks founder who is holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, refused to divulge Snowden’s location. “He is in a safe place and his spirits are high,” Assange said.

But that was then.

One week later, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it clear that Snowden would be welcome in Russia only if he “stopped his work aimed at bringing harm” to the United States. A day later, the Kremlin announced that Snowden had withdrawn his asylum request.

On the same day, The Times reported that Snowden, who is presumed to be staying in a transit zone in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, had met with Russian diplomatic officials and handed them appeals for asylum in 15 countries. A Russian Foreign Ministry official told my colleague Sergei Loiko that it was “a desperate measure.”

The WikiLeaks website has reported that Snowden, in fact, has asked more than 20 countries to consider giving him political asylum.

Ecuador may have rolled up the welcome mat, but the presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia, who were in Russia this week meeting with leaders of other gas-exporting countries, seemed to offer Snowden some hope.

Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro told Russian news agencies that Snowden deserved protection, and Bolivia’s Evo Morales said his country would consider granting asylum.

“The world cannot be governed by the imperialist elite of the United States,” Maduro told reporters.

But Snowden, in his first long interviews with Glenn Greenwald, one of the reporters who broke the original story for The Guardian, said he felt certain that if the U.S. wanted to bring him home, the country would find a way to do so.

This week in Senegal, President Obama, who has done a magnificent job talking from both sides of his mouth on this issue – declaring his support of a frank public discussion on the issues raised by Snowden’s disclosures while doing his best to keep the massive and potentially unconstitutional privacy invasions secret – pooh-poohed that idea.

“I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” he told reporters. He also said he would not “start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues simply to get a guy extradited.”

But, he said, “My continued expectation is that Russia or other countries that have talked about potentially providing Mr. Snowden asylum recognize that they are part of an international community, and that they should be abiding by international law. And we’ll continue to press them as hard as we can to make sure that they do so.”

I’m just guessing here, but I think Snowden should start brushing up on his Spanish.

U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk and businessman Glenn Hutchins rounded out the foursome

Obama and David both attended a sunset cocktail party Wednesday

President Obama hit the links Saturday with comedian Larry David, the star of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, as his weeklong vacation in Martha's Vineyard comes to a close.

The president rounded out his foursome with former U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk and businessman Glenn Hutchins, a part owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team.

Obama has spent much of his vacation golfing, including a five-hour round to kick off his stay, in which David, designer Kenneth Cole, filmmaker Peter Farrelly and restaurateur Patrick Lyons made up the foursome in front of the president, the Boston Globe reports.

Obama and the Seinfeld co-creator also crossed paths on Wednesday, at a sunset cocktail party thrown in the president's honor by cable TV mogul Brian Roberts. David discussed his new movie, set in Martha's Vineyard, The New York Times reports. Attorney General Eric Holder, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett were also in attendance.

The president wraps up his vacation Sunday. He has made few public statements during his stay, although he did condemn the bloody street battles in Egypt.

1.) You basically have to be willing to devote your life to journalism if you want to break in. Treat it like it's medical school or law school.

2.) When interviewing for a job, tell the editor how you love to report. How your passion is gathering information. Do not mention how you want to be a writer, use the word ""prose,"" or that deep down you have a sinking suspicion you are the next Norman Mailer.

3.) Be prepared to do a lot of things for free. This sucks, and it's unfair, and it gives rich kids an edge. But it's also the reality.

4.) When writing for a mass audience, put a fact in every sentence.

5.) Also, keep the stories simple and to the point, at least at first.

6.) You should have a blog and be following journalists you like on Twitter.

7.) If there's a publication you want to work for or write for, cold call the editors and/or email them. This can work.

8) By the second sentence of a pitch, the entirety of the story should be explained. (In other words, if you can't come up with a rough headline for your story idea, it's going to be a challenge to get it published.)

Four years into his tenure, the onetime critic of President George W. Bush finds himself cast as a present-day Mr. Bush, justifying the muscular application of force in the defense of the nation while detractors complain that he has sacrificed the country’s core values in the name of security.

The debate is not an exact parallel to those of the Bush era, and Mr. Obama can point to ways he has tried to exorcise what he sees as the excesses of the last administration. But in broad terms, the conversation generated by the confirmation hearing of John O. Brennan, his nominee for C.I.A. director, underscored the degree to which Mr. Obama has embraced some of Mr. Bush’s approach to counterterrorism, right down to a secret legal memo authorizing presidential action unfettered by outside forces.

At the same time, a separate hearing in Congress revealed how far Mr. Obama has gone to avoid what he sees as Mr. Bush’s central mistake. Testimony indicated that the president had overruled his secretaries of state and defense and his military commanders when they advised arming rebels in Syria."

WASHINGTON -- When a less-gray-haired Sen. Barack Obama declared, early in his first presidential campaign, that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of estranged nations like Iran and Syria without preconditions, he was roundly chastised by both Democrats and Republicans alike for naivete.

But now, after six arduous, solitary years of standing by a policy of preferring accord with rogue nations over recourse to full-on war, his approach seems to be on the verge of bearing fruit.

In Syria, President Bashar Assad has agreed to open his chemical weapons program to international oversight, and eventual destruction, after a furious round of diplomacy involving Secretary of State John Kerry and top Russian diplomats. And in Iran, a new, moderate president has responded to a personal letter from Obama, engaging in direct communication for the first time in years and hinting that he might be willing to pull back from his country's controversial nuclear program in exchange for a reduction of painful economic sanctions.

None of the developments has occurred without context or notes of caution, but it's nevertheless a remarkable turn of events for a president whose foreign policy, even a month ago, appeared to be in hapless disarray. If the diplomatic tracks in Syria and Iran pan out, proponents say they could point the way to the resolution of two of the most significant international crises facing the nation, without any American-caused warfare.

""The administration's willingness to show both strength and smarts is paying off,"" said Joel Rubin, the director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund and a former State Department official, who has worked to promote conflict resolution in the Middle East through discourse.

""On Syria, the president demonstrated that there was a clear point that he did not want the regime to pass, and then took a window of opportunity to cut a deal that actually advances American security interests even more,"" Rubin added. ""An ancillary benefit has been that it's demonstrated to the Iranians that the U.S. is thinking before it's shooting, and that's a pretty new trend for the U.S.""

Next week, the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, travels to New York for the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). His arrival brings perhaps the greatest hope for a diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Tehran in recent memory, and in turn, a possible vindication of Obama's refusal to condone military strikes against the country.

The Obama administration has yet to confirm whether any United States officials plan to meet with Iranian counterparts in New York. Nonetheless, the prospect of such a meeting has diplomatic circles buzzing.

""If there's a meeting between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of UNGA, that will be huge,"" said a senior Obama administration official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations.

Such a meeting would almost certainly be held well below the presidential level, the official said, most likely between the Iranian foreign minister and a senior U.S. diplomat like Wendy Sherman, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, or Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. It's also possible that a ""chance encounter"" between Obama and Rouhani could be arranged in the halls of the UN.

""Sherman and Burns have the most experience communicating with Iran,"" said the official. ""But whoever it is, it would be a momentous meeting, because this kind of open, direct talks haven't happened in 34 years.""

The past week has seen a number of unprecedented overtures from Rouhani, including a rare interview with an American news outlet and writing an op-ed, published Friday in the Washington Post, in which he called for a new era of ""constructive engagement"" between Iran and the West.

The Iranian government also released nearly a dozen prisoners ahead of Rouhani's visit to the U.S., something that experts say often happens before international forays, but rarely includes such domestic political detainees as the women's rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was released on Wednesday.

And in his interview with NBC this past week, Rouhani said that his country had no intention of ever developing nuclear weapons, adding that he has ""complete authority"" to negotiate a deal over the peaceful components of the nuclear program.

""This is probably the best opportunity that I can think of [for a breakthrough],"" said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council and a longtime advocate of the U.S. taking a less heavy-handed approach to diplomacy with Iran. ""Right now, Rouhani has unprecedented flexibility.""

Skeptics have suggested that Rouhani may have less freedom to maneuver within the hardline elements of his country than he's suggested, especially on the question of the nuclear program. But even some of the most ardent Western dissenters on the regime's capacity to moderate say that the current moment represents one of the greatest openings for dialogue in memory.

Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, and a former top Middle East official in the Bush administration where he often struck a hard line on Iran, said recently that in meetings with the foreign minister in Tehran he has detected an openness to negotiating on Syria.

""It's hard for us to imagine any solution in Syria that doesn't somehow have an Iranian role,"" Feltman told CNN last week. ""The Iranians stated that they understand that we need to get to a political solution. I don't think from my conversations that I had in Iran that the Iranians see it in their interest to see the situation [in Syria] continue or deteriorate.""

Parsi believes that in winning a surprise electoral victory over conservatives, Rouhani has actually earned himself a brief window of opportunity to make a deal with the West -- but it's one that must be struck quickly.

""You have to assume he has six months or so where he can get his way, and where the conservatives will have to be on their best behavior,"" Parsi said. ""This is a moment when he has maximum flexibility -- it will either expand if he gets a deal, or it will be lost if he doesn't. If the U.S. fails to reciprocate, we will be forced to deal with the hardliners six months from now.""

Not everyone agrees that Obama deserves full credit for pursuing diplomacy at the expense of other tactics. After all, while he has avoided troops-on-the-ground combat in places like Iran and Syria, he hasn't slowed his deadly policy of drone strikes in hot zones like Yemen and Pakistan.

And to some participants in the Obama administration's earlier days, the talk of dialogue and diplomacy in places like Iran was often more talk than practice -- the recent openings from Assad and Rouhani, they argue, have essentially fallen in his lap.

""I think he was not looking for diplomacy with Iran or Syria,"" said Vali Nasr, the dean of Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, and a former State Department policy adviser. ""Now that it has come his way, he will be judged by whether he makes diplomacy work.""

Others -- including some of Obama's own advisers -- argue that to the extent Obama deserves credit for the possible breakthroughs, it is instead because he turned against his espoused belief in dialogue, and showed a credible threat against the regimes: For Syria, it was the recent talk of cruise missile strikes, they say; for Iran, it was years of crushing economic sanctions.

""It was that threat of force from President Obama that changed the calculus around the chemical weapons issue [in Syria], and allowed for this diplomatic progress,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters on a conference call Friday.

But while it's true that Obama hasn't always held true to the ideals of his early campaign days -- first-term talk of engagement ""grounded in mutual respect"" eventually gave way to tough rhetoric about ""painful sanctions"" and nuclear red lines -- he consistently resisted the hardline pull, from hawkish members of Congress and Israeli allies, toward a preventative military strike.

""There is too much loose talk of war,"" Obama said about U.S. and Israeli threats toward Iran, in a powerful 2012 speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

For observers like Parsi, it is actually this softer side that has done the most to earn the present detente with Iran.

""What Iranians are largely reacting to now is that Rouhani got a congratulatory letter from Obama. That's not toughness -- that is a huge concession given to the Iranians,"" said Parsi. ""When Iranians are convinced that the other side wants to take military action, the only way they know to respond and try to prevent it is to show how high the costs would be, not to suddenly show flexibility.""

It's a notion promoted by some of the sharpest minds in U.S. policy. Earlier this year, Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Los Angeles Times that without the promise of a softer touch, a strong sanctions regime would only harden Iranian interlocutors.

“Sanctions are easy to do, and afterwards we can tell ourselves that, ‘by God, we’ve really stuck it to them,’” he said. “But it seems to me that the more you press this regime, the more they dig in.”

""Sanctions and pressure are useless if you don't get something for them,"" added Rubin. ""There are going to be some people in Washington who say, 'see, the sanctions are working, let's keep the pedal to the floor and we'll push them over completely and get everything that we want.' But that's not how it works. What the president's saying is, 'let's test them.'""

Officials say those tests are likely to come down to technical issues, such as whether Iran is willing to reduce the number of nuclear centrifuges it currently has in operation. Progress on this front could signal ""whether perhaps there's a place for the U.S. and Iran to meet in the middle,"" said the administration official.

""It's going to be technical specifications, not speeches or tweets or op-eds, that will be the crucial components in determining whether or not there will ever be a true thaw between the two countries.""

Gruninger was stripped of his job, his reputation was trashed, and it's only now, more than half a century after the fact, that his town is beginning to acknowledge and honor him. During his lifetime, he was a pariah. His chapter is entitled ""Disobeying the Law.""

Aleksander Jevtic, a Serb swept up in a round-up of Croats in his small home town in northern Serbia. Since he was a hometown guy, the Serbs asked him to separate the Croats from his fellow Serbs so the enemy could be identified and detained (and presumably killed). Moving slowly through the decrepit cowshed where they were huddled, he slowly began—he'd pick out a Serb, another Serb, another Serb …. and then a Croat, whom he would stare at forcefully and give a new (Serbian) name. He did this repeatedly, saving as many Croats alongside Serbs as he could. After the war, few hometown Croats thanked him or acknowledged the risk he'd run in saving their lives. His chapter is entitled ""Defying the Group.""

Avner Wishnitzer, an Israeli born on a kibbutz, who enters the ranks of Sayeret Matkal, the most elite commando unit in the Israeli Defense Force, for his mandatory military service. After he was discharged after three-and-a-half years of service, he joined a civilian convoy on a mission to deliver blankets to Palestinian farmers in the West Bank because his conscience had been pricked by a documentary he'd seen regarding Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Upon arriving at a checkpoint where Israeli police told the group to turn back because they were breaking the law, he and others in the group defied the orders. He'd never served in the occupied territory; indeed, he'd never spoken directly to a Palestinian. But his anger over Israeli treatment of them bubbled over, and even though he still performed regular service in the reserve unit of Sayeret Matkal, his awakened conscience led him to join with a few other reservists in his unit to take a very public, and risky stand: they signed a letter proclaiming they would refuse to ever serve if called upon in the occupied territories. Needless to say, he met quite a bit of public shaming. His chapter is entitled ""The Rules of Conscience.""

Leyla Wydler, a financial advisor with Stanford Group Company, part of Stanford Financial Group and brainchild of prominent financier Allen Stanford, who was charged with ""massive ongoing fraud"" for swindling investors out of billions of dollars. Wydler was the whistleblower who alerted the SEC (several times, actually, which they chose to ignore) and other regulators of the Ponzi scheme. Her testimony earned the enmity of her fellow former financial advisors, and she could not find work in her chosen field after her whistleblowing. A single mother, she risked much—Stanford fined her for ""breaking her contract""—and today she works … in real estate. Her chapter is entitled ""The Price of Raising One's Voice.""

There are no statues erected in their honor (although 60 years after the fact, Gruninger finally received a plaque on his grave). There are no proclamations, laurels or monuments in their name. They are, if not despised, then ignored. Indeed, some are still thought of by their former fellow workers or ""tribe"" members as traitors to their cause. As author Press puts it:



To judge by the sanctimonious tributes made to those who ""confront evil"" in places like Rwanda or by Time magazine's tribute to whistleblowers who spoke out about accounting fraud in the United States, we live in a world where overcoming passivity and acquiescence is seen as honorable. In reality, we all know that doing so is risky and dangerous, not least because there is precious little agreement about where the line between duty and conscience should be drawn. Around torture, which much of the world officially banned centuries ago? Not according to those who vilified the handful of dissenters who challenged the abusive interrogation policies that were institutionalized during the Bush era. Around concocting clever ways to defraud people of their savings? Not according to the traders on Wall Street who did exactly that and profited, without pausing to apologize, during the period that preceded the 2008 financial crash (and who were not asked to apologize by politicians who proceeded to weaken or scuttle efforts to regulate their industry afterward). What about stealing people's land? Not according to Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who see this as a fulfillment of God's plan. Even people who do regard these things as unconscionable might find it unnerving to see a soldier, a public official, or a colleague at work take an uncompromising stand on the matter. For if we agree that something blatantly wrong is happening, shouldn't we be taking a similar stand? Do we really want to be reminded of the compromise we've made?

Those who dare to take a stand, Press claims, really only have one thing in common in the end: they're idealists (some would even say, naive idealists), true believers. Gruninger honestly believed Switzerland was a kind, neutral, compassionate and freedom-loving country; he thought he was upholding the values of his nation when he let in refugees, despite the law. Jevtic truly believed his fellow townsmen would have done the same rescuing in the name of shared history and humanity. Wishnitzer truly believed that Israelis, as a persecuted people with a horrendously victimized past, would refuse to act as persecutor of others. Wydler truly believed in the principles and ethics her chosen profession claimed to hold dear—that serving the interests of clients came first, not lining their own pockets.

All learned the hard way that for the most part, they stood alone or with a very small and often reviled minority.

And the Wishnitzer chapter in particular raises a question that seems unanswerable: How does one judge the ""true believer"" who holds beliefs in direct opposition to other ""true believers""? In Israel's case, there are true righteous believers on both sides—IDF members who refuse to participate in the eviction of Palestinians on the West Bank … and IDF members who are devout Zionists who refuse to comply with orders from the Israeli government to evict Jewish settlers who are squatting in recognized Palestinian territory. Both fervently believe in their cause. Both types are willing to accept the punishment for refusal.

The closest author Press comes to teasing out the differences in cases like this, is to resort to a thought experiment in empathy:



Measured by depth and sincerity of conviction, perhaps there wasn't much difference between left- and right-wing refuseniks in the Israeli army. Measured by moral content, there clearly was. One way to draw it out, it seemed to me, was by applying the standard Adam Smith might have proposed, assessing the ability—or inability—of those saying no to stretch their moral imaginations by putting themselves in the shoes of people who were suffering and extending sympathy to them.

In Press' mind, the resistors like Wishnitzer were refusing to evict out of empathy, but they weren't dehumanizing those who didn't agree with them. In the case of the Zionist refuseniks, most of them resorted to justifying Israeli occupation by vilifying the Palestinians as vermin or worse. This strikes me as a very difficult standard with which to draw a distinction, although a handier one for this thorny predicament does not leap to mind.

And with Edward Snowden in the news, it's interesting to discuss what society should do with these true believers and which category he falls into. Is Snowden in the same class as the ""beautiful souls"" author Press discusses in his book? I took the opportunity this past week to ask Press his opinion of Snowden and if he too typified the nonconformist resistor he's studied. As you can tell from his response, he is at least slightly puzzled about one aspect of the whistleblower:



With the obvious caveat that there is a lot we don't know about Snowden, there are some parallels to the people I wrote about. Like them, he appears to have started out full of idealism—volunteering to fight in Iraq—only to grow bitterly disillusioned. This is often the trajectory whistleblowers follow. And like them, he appears to have been motivated by one thing: his conscience. I'm a bit puzzled why someone so fiercely committed to privacy ever went to work for the intelligence community in the first place, but I suppose we'll learn more about that in due time.

Howsociety deal with inconvenient truth-tellers and those who act out of moral conscience? And how do we as individuals judge the rightness or wrongness of another's actions? Should we make more of an effort to honor these ""beautiful souls?"" Or do we hold back, learn more, let history sort it out?

These questions are not easy, nor are they painless. As Press says:



Inevitably, then, displays of moral courage sow discord and make a lot of people uncomfortable—most of all, perhaps, the true believer who never wanted or expected to say no. It is never easy to incur the wrath of an offended majority, to ""fall out of step with one's tribe,"" observed Susan Sontag. And it's true: no one finds this painless. But it's considerably harder for insiders who've spent their lives fiercely identifying with the values of the majority than for dissenters accustomed to being on the margins, with their like-minded comrades by their side."

He Joined The Network In September', 'Is Based Out Of Washington']","Clinton sought end-run around counterterrorism bureau on night of Benghazi attack, witness will say","On the night of Sept. 11, as the Obama administration scrambled to respond to the Benghazi terror attacks, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making, according to a ""whistle-blower"" witness from that bureau who will soon testify to the charge before Congress, Fox News has learned.

That witness is Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for operations in the agency’s counterterrorism bureau. Sources tell Fox News Thompson will level the allegation against Clinton during testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.

Fox News has also learned that another official from the counterterrorism bureau -- independently of Thompson -- voiced the same complaint about Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to trusted national security colleagues back in October.

Extremists linked to Al Qaeda stormed the U.S. Consulate and a nearby annex on Sept. 11, in a heavily armed and well-coordinated eight-hour assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans.

Thompson considers himself a whistle-blower whose account was suppressed by the official investigative panel that Clinton convened to review the episode, the Accountability Review Board (ARB). Thompson's lawyer, Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, has further alleged that his client has been subjected to threats and intimidation by as-yet-unnamed superiors at State, in advance of his cooperation with Congress.

Sources close to the congressional investigation who have been briefed on what Thompson will testify tell Fox News the veteran counterterrorism official concluded on Sept. 11 that Clinton and Kennedy tried to cut the counterterrorism bureau out of the loop as they and other Obama administration officials weighed how to respond to -- and characterize -- the Benghazi attacks.

""You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,"" the second official in State's counterterrorism bureau told colleagues back in October. Those comments would appear to be corroborated by Thompson's forthcoming testimony.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the counterterrorism officials' allegation ""100 percent false."" A spokesman for Clinton said tersely that the charge is not true.

Daniel Benjamin, who ran the department's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time, also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges.

""I ran the bureau then, and I can say now with certainty, as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism, that this charge is simply untrue,"" he said. ""Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack, I was in frequent contact with the Department. At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of.""

He went on to call his bureau a ""central participant in the interagency discussion about the longer-term response to Benghazi."" He said ""at no time was the Bureau sidelined or otherwise kept from carrying out its tasks.""

Thompson's attorney, diGenova, would not comment for this article.

Documents from the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, first published in the May 13 edition of ""The Weekly Standard,"" showed that senior officials from those agencies decided within days of the attacks to delete all references to Al Qaeda's known involvement in them from ""talking points"" being prepared for those administration officers being sent out to discuss the attacks publicly.

Those talking points -- and indeed, the statements of all senior Obama administration officials who commented publicly on Benghazi during the early days after the attacks -- sought instead to depict the Americans' deaths as the result of a spontaneous protest that went awry. The administration later acknowledged that there had been no such protest, as evidence mounted that Al Qaeda-linked terrorists had participated in the attacks. The latter conclusion had figured prominently in the earliest CIA drafts of the talking points, but was stricken by an ad hoc group of senior officials controlling the drafting process. Among those involved in prodding the deletions, the documents published by ""The Weekly Standard"" show, was State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, who wrote at one point that the revisions were not sufficient to satisfy ""my building's leadership.""

The allegations of the two counterterrorism officials stand to return the former secretary of state to the center of the Benghazi story. Widely regarded as a leading potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Clinton has insisted she was not privy to decisions made by underlings about the inadequate security for the U.S. installations in Benghazi that were made in the run-up to the attacks. And she has portrayed her role -- once the attacks became known in Washington -- as that of a determined fact-finder who worked with colleagues to fashion the best possible response to the crisis.

Clinton testified about Benghazi for the first and only time in January of this year, shortly before leaving office. She had long delayed her testimony, at first because she cited the need for the ARB to complete its report, and then because she suffered a series of untimely health problems that included a stomach virus, a concussion sustained during a fall at home, and a blood clot near her brain, from which she has since recovered. However, Clinton was never interviewed by the ARB she convened.

Fox News disclosed last week that the conduct of the ARB is itself now under review by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. A department spokesman said the OIG probe is examining all prior ARBs, not just the one established after Benghazi.

The two U.S. officials -- former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and former Ambassador Tom Pickering -- who oversaw the internal review of the attacks defended their report.

""From the beginning of the ARB process, we had unfettered access to everyone and everything including all the documentation we needed. Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened, and that's what we did,"" they said in a statement Monday.

The counterterrorism officials, however, concluded that Clinton and Kennedy were immediately wary of the attacks being portrayed as acts of terrorism, and accordingly worked to prevent the counterterrorism bureau from having a role in the department's early decision-making relating to them.

Also appearing before the oversight committee on Wednesday will be Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Like Thompson, Hicks is a career State Department official who considers himself a Benghazi whistle-blower. His attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee, has charged that Hicks, too, has faced threats of reprisal from unnamed superiors at State. (Toensing and diGenova, who are representing their respective clients pro bono, are married.)

Portions of the forthcoming testimony of Hicks -- who was one of the last people to speak to Stevens, and who upon the ambassador's death became the senior U.S. diplomat in Libya -- were made public by Rep. Issa during an appearance on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

Hicks told the committee that he and his colleagues on the ground in Libya that night knew instantly that Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and that he was astonished that no one drafting the administration's talking points consulted with him before finalizing them, or before U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice delivered them on the Sunday talk shows of Sept. 16.

Hicks was interviewed by the ARB but Thompson was not, sources close to the committee's investigation tell Fox News."

When the Justice Department began investigating possible leaks of classified information about North Korea in 2009, investigators did more than obtain telephone records of a working journalist suspected of receiving the secret material.

They used security badge access records to track the reporter’s comings and goings from the State Department, according to a newly obtained court affidavit. They traced the timing of his calls with a State Department security adviser suspected of sharing the classified report. They obtained a search warrant for the reporter’s personal e-mails.

The case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, the government adviser, and James Rosen, the chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, bears striking similarities to a sweeping leaks investigation disclosed last week in which federal investigators obtained records over two months of more than 20 telephone lines assigned to the Associated Press.

At a time when President Obama’s administration is under renewed scrutiny for an unprecedented number of leak investigations, the Kim case provides a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one such probe.

Court documents in the Kim case reveal how deeply investigators explored the private communications of a working journalist — and raise the question of how often journalists have been investigated as closely as Rosen was in 2010. The case also raises new concerns among critics of government secrecy about the possible stifling effect of these investigations on a critical element of press freedom: the exchange of information between reporters and their sources.

“Search warrants like these have a severe chilling effect on the free flow of important information to the public,” said First Amendment lawyer Charles Tobin, who has represented the Associated Press, but not in the current case. “That’s a very dangerous road to go down.”

Obama last week defended the Justice Department’s handling of the investigation involving the AP, which is focused on who leaked information to the news organization about a foiled plot involving the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. AP executives and First Amendment watchdogs have criticized the Justice Department in part for the broad scope of the phone records it secretly subpoenaed from AP offices in Washington, Hartford, Conn., and New York.

“The latest events show an expansion of this law enforcement technique,” said attorney Abbe Lowell, who is defending Kim on federal charges filed in 2010 that he disclosed national defense information. A trial is possible as soon as 2014. “Individual reporters or small time periods have turned into 20 [telephone] lines and months of records with no obvious attempt to be targeted or narrow.”

The president said press freedoms must be balanced against the protection of U.S. personnel overseas. According to the office of Ronald Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District, its prosecutors followed federal regulations by first seeking the information through other means before subpoenaing media phone records. Machen’s office is investigating both the Kim and AP cases. The Justice Department said in a statement that in both cases it had abided by “all applicable laws, regulations, and longstanding Department of Justice policies intended to safeguard the First Amendment interests of the press in reporting the news and the public in receiving it.”

The Obama administration has pursued more such cases than all previous administrations combined, including one against a former CIA official charged with leaking U.S. intelligence on Iran and another against a former FBI contract linguist who pleaded guilty to leaking to a blogger.

The Kim case began in June 2009, when Rosen reported that U.S. intelligence officials were warning that North Korea was likely to respond to United Nations sanctions with more nuclear tests. The CIA had learned the information, Rosen wrote, from sources inside North Korea.

The story was published online the same day that a top-secret report was made available to a small circle within the intelligence community — including Kim, who at the time was a State Department arms expert with security clearance.

FBI investigators used the security-badge data, phone records and e-mail exchanges to build a case that Kim shared the report with Rosen soon after receiving it, court records show.

In the documents, FBI agent Reginald Reyes described in detail how Kim and Rosen moved in and out of the State Department headquarters at 2201 C St. NW a few hours before the story was published on June 11, 2009.

“Mr. Kim departed DoS at or around 12:02 p.m. followed shortly thereafter by the reporter at or around 12:03 p.m.,” Reyes wrote. Next, the agent said, “Mr. Kim returned to DoS at or around 12:26 p.m. followed shortly thereafter by the reporter at or around 12:30 p.m.”

The activity, Reyes wrote in an affidavit, suggested a “face-to-face” meeting between the two men. “Within a few hours after those nearly simultaneous exits and entries at DoS, the June 2009 article was published on the Internet,” he wrote.

The court documents don’t name Rosen, but his identity was confirmed by several officials, and he is the author of the article at the center of the investigation. Rosen and a spokeswoman for Fox News did not return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.

Reyes wrote that there was evidence Rosen had broken the law, “at the very least, either as an aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator.” That fact distinguishes his case from the probe of the AP, in which the news organization is not the likely target.

Using italics for emphasis, Reyes explained how Rosen allegedly used a “covert communications plan” and quoted from an e-mail exchange between Rosen and Kim that seems to describe a secret system for passing along information.

In the exchange, Rosen used the alias “Leo” to address Kim and called himself “Alex,” an apparent reference to Alexander Butterfield, the man best known for running the secret recording system in the Nixon White House, according to the affidavit.

Rosen instructed Kim to send him coded signals on his Google account, according to a quote from his e-mail in the affidavit: “One asterisk means to contact them, or that previously suggested plans for communication are to proceed as agreed; two asterisks means the opposite.”

He also wrote, according to the affidavit: “What I am interested in, as you might expect, is breaking news ahead of my competitors” including “what intelligence is picking up.” And: “I’d love to see some internal State Department analyses.”

Court documents show abundant evidence gathered from Kim’s office computer and phone records, but investigators said they needed to go a step further to build their case, seizing two days’ worth of Rosen’s personal e-mails — and all of his e-mail exchanges with Kim.

Privacy protections limit searching or seizing a reporter’s work, but not when there is evidence that the journalist broke the law against unauthorized leaks. A federal judge signed off on the search warrant — agreeing that there was probable cause that Rosen was a co-conspirator.

Machen’s office said in a statement that it is limited in commenting on an open case, but that the government “exhausted all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting the evidence” before seeking a search warrant.

However, it remains an open question whether it’s ever illegal, given the First Amendment’s protection of press freedom, for a reporter to solicit information. No reporter, including Rosen, has been prosecuted for doing so.

In the hours before Rosen’s story was published, Kim was one of more than 95 people who saw the intelligence report through a classified database, according to court documents.

Kim’s phone records showed that seven calls lasting from 18 seconds to more than 11 minutes were placed between Kim’s desk telephone and Rosen’s cellphone and desk phone at the State Department, according to the court documents. Investigators pulled at least two months of phone records from Kim’s desk and found 36 calls with numbers associated with Rosen.

Investigators also scrutinized computer records and found that someone who had logged in with Kim’s user profile viewed the classified report “at or around” the same time two calls were placed from his desk phone to Rosen, according to the documents.

Two months later on an August evening, diplomatic security secretly entered Kim’s office and found a copy of Rosen’s article next to his computer. Kim, who worked in a secure facility, was subject to daily office inspections. The Fox News article was also in “plain view” during follow-up visits in late September.

Kim initially told the FBI in an interview that month that he had met the reporter in March but had not had contact since. Later, Kim admitted to additional contacts, according to the affidavit.

Believing they are losing the messaging war with progressives, a group of prominent conservatives in Washington—including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and journalists from Breitbart News and the Washington Examiner—has been meeting privately since early this year to concoct talking points, coordinate messaging, and hatch plans for ""a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,"" according to documents obtained by Mother Jones.

Dubbed Groundswell, this coalition convenes weekly in the offices of Judicial Watch, the conservative legal watchdog group. During these hush-hush sessions and through a Google group, the members of Groundswell—including aides to congressional Republicans—cook up battle plans for their ongoing fights against the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, progressive outfits, and the Republican establishment and ""clueless"" GOP congressional leaders. They devise strategies for killing immigration reform, hyping the Benghazi controversy, and countering the impression that the GOP exploits racism. And the Groundswell gang is mounting a behind-the-scenes organized effort to eradicate the outsize influence of GOP über-strategist/pundit Karl Rove within Republican and conservative ranks. (For more on Groundswell's ""two front war"" against Rove—a major clash on the right—click here.)

At the March 27 meeting, Groundswell participants discussed one multipurpose theme they had been deploying for weeks to bash the president on a variety of fronts, including immigration reform and the sequester: Obama places ""politics over public safety."" In a display of Groundswell's message-syncing, members of the group repeatedly flogged this phrase in public. Frank Gaffney penned a Washington Times op-ed titled ""Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Tom Fitton headlined a Judicial Watch weekly update ""Politics over Public Safety: More Illegal Alien Criminals Released by Obama Administration."" Peter List, editor of LaborUnionReport.com, authored a RedState.com post called ""Obama's Machiavellian Sequestration Pain Game: Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Matthew Boyle used the phrase in an immigration-related article for Breitbart. And Dan Bongino promoted Boyle's story on Twitter by tweeting, ""Politics over public safety?"" In a message to Groundswellers, Ginni Thomas awarded ""brownie points"" to Fitton, Gaffney, and other members for promoting the ""politics over public safety"" riff.

In the interests of copyright I won't post any more. It is a long article and I'll be honest, I haven't got through it all yet myself.

Updated 10:36 a.m. ET, 12/9/2013

Washington (CNN) - Newt Gingrich is fighting back against conservative critics who attacked the former Speaker of the House and co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire"" for his praise of Nelson Mandela.

After Mandela passed away Thursday, Gingrich posted a statement, praising him as ""one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The right-wing response was overwhelmingly reproachful.

""Such an amazing re-write of history since 1962 and 1990. Newt, I thought you of all people, a historian, would be true to who this guy really was,"" Mike Winkelman posted on Gingrich's Facebook page.

""This clenched-fist, murdering, gorilla warrior does not deserve respect from informed Americans,"" posted Trish Baehr-Schaefer.

There were several others posts, many generating dozens of ""likes,"" and some with language unfit for publication.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, congressional Democrats to commemorate Mandela in South Africa

Gingrich said Monday that people were confusing Mandela's role with the African National Congress and that most of the violence by the ANC happened while Mandela was in prison.

On the other side of the political spectrum, he said on CNN's ""New Day"" that some liberals were going ""overboard in trying to excuse this as an attempt to attack (Ronald) Reagan."" Gingrich noted that Reagan was the one who appointed the first black ambassador to South Africa.

""There's a lot of anger on the right about this opportunity being used inappropriately,"" he said

He added that Mandela was ""deeply committed to a nonviolent approach, until you had a South African dictatorship...which made it impossible to have anything that was purely nonviolent.""

In a statement Saturday, he compared Mandela to the Founding Fathers and the farmers who took up arms at Lexington and Concord in the Revolutionary War. He praised the former South African president for his calls for reconciliation, his Christian faith and his turn from Communism to opening South Africa up to free enterprise.

""I was very surprised by it,"" Gingrich said Sunday CNN's ""State of the Union"" about the backlash.

""Callista posted my statement on her Facebook page and was amazed at some of the intensity, some of whom came back three, four and five times, repeating how angry they were.""

Gingrich has a long history as a Mandela supporter. During the Reagan administration, he was among the many Republicans in Congress who pressured the president to impose sanctions on the apartheid regime.

Fellow conservative Ted Cruz faced a similar backlash this week when he posted a respectful tribute to Mandela that generated angry criticisms. No comment yet from the Texas senator on the reaction of some of his supporters.

The freshman Senator from Texas, however, will be one of two Republicans who join a Congressional delegation to attend a memorial for Mandela in South Africa this week. President Barack Obama and other former presidents are also slated to attend.

""Frankly, without being partisan, I hope the President brings some of the spirit back with him,"" Gingrich said on ""New Day."" ""Maybe he and the Congress can sit down more in the spirit of Mandela and actually listen to each other for a while.""

As House Republicans prepared to vote Wednesday on a plan to suspend the debt limit, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan made clear that the party is in no way abandoning its uncompromising approach to the budget battle with President Obama.

Republicans will insist that automatic spending cuts take effect March 1 unless other cuts are adopted, Ryan said. They may force a shutdown of the government on March 27 unless Democrats agree to additional cuts. And they will demand that any future increase in the debt limit – likely to be necessary this summer if the measure to suspend the current debt limit is adopted -- be paired dollar-for-dollar with spending cuts or other reforms.

“We have a sequester kicking in on March 1, a continuing resolution [on the budget] expiring on March the 27. We have budgets that, if the Senate decides to do its job this year, will come out in April,” Ryan said Wednesday at a breakfast with reporters. “These are the kind of points we think force the kind of conversation we think we have to have.”

When a reporter asked why Republicans would consider shutting down the government when the brinksmanship of the past two years has put the congressional approval rating in the teens, Ryan shot back: “So, we don’t have much to lose, do we? This is not about politics and what makes us popular. This is about what is the right thing to do.”

The breakfast, hosted by the Wall Street Journal, marked just the second time the Wisconsin Republican has met with reporters since he and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost their bid for the White House in November. Wednesday’s far-ranging session covered topics ranging from Ryan’s hopes for immigration reform to his disappointment with his seating assignment on Inauguration Day – which left him in the bleachers with other lawmakers instead of standing up front in Vice President Biden’s spot.

President Obama said in a Jan. 14 White House press conference that he won’t negotiate with Republicans on the federal debt ceiling. Post economic policy reporter Zachary Goldfarb stops by to explain which bills the government will and will not pay if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

“I was about eight rows behind” where he had hoped to be, Ryan joked.

On gun control, Ryan tacitly chastised the National Rifle Association for a much-maligned TV ad focused on the president’s daughters.

“Our kids are out of bounds,” Ryan said. “The Obama campaign [and] the national media respected that of my family, and we’re grateful for that. Our kids ought to be out of bounds.”

But for more than an hour at the Mayflower hotel downtown, the questions focused primarily on strategy in the coming year, when Republicans say they hope to force Obama and other Democrats to agree to even sharper cuts in government spending and to tackle a wholesale overhaul of federal health programs.

The bill under consideration in the House Wednesday would suspend the nation’s borrowing limit until May 18 to give each chamber of Congress breathing room to adopt a budget blueprint. Ryan, who will again draft the GOP budget, said he would eliminate deficits within the next decade, although he offered no guidance on how his plan would meet that goal. His past budget proposals took nearly 30 years to achieve balance, even after slashing Medicaid and social safety net programs, which is completely unacceptable to Democrats.

(On Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that panel would draft the first Senate budget proposal in four years.)

On another sticking point between the two parties, Ryan said Republicans would not consider additional tax revenue to close record budget deficits, as Democrats prefer. The “fiscal cliff” deal approved earlier this month would generate about $650 billion over the next decade, and that, Ryan said, is enough.

“They got their revenue increases already. We have yet to get anything as a result of it,” Ryan said. Reminded that Obama approved more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade as part of the last debt-limit fight in 2011, Ryan said: “That was last session. We’re going forward now.”

Ryan also said House Republicans will push for an overhaul of the tax code that trims rates and eliminates loopholes and deductions – including, perhaps, the preferential treatment of investment income.

“I think that debate ought to be open with respect to tax reform,” Ryan said. Although profits from capital gains and dividends have been taxed at lower rates than earned income for two decades, Ryan said it would be less important to preserve that difference “if your rates [on wages and salaries] are getting low enough.”

The preferential treatment of investment income amounts to the biggest break in the tax code for the ultra-wealthy and has been a cornerstone of GOP tax policy. But it caused problems last year for Romney’s presidential campaign when he revealed that he paid only about 13 percent of his income in taxes because his earnings came primarily from capital gains and dividends.

While a concession on investment income would likely be welcomed by Democrats, Obama has said he would insist that any new deficit-reduction package be balanced between spending cuts and fresh tax revenues. Asked where he sees ground for compromise, Ryan argued that reforming Social Security and Medicare over the long term is “the sweet spot in all this.”

“Changes that don’t offend either parties’ philosophy or ideology, I think,” Ryan said, “is where hopefully this ends up going.”"

Bush’s legacy keeps getting worse

By Eugene Robinson,

In retrospect, George W. Bush’s legacy doesn’t look as bad as it did when he left office. It looks worse.

I join the nation in congratulating Bush on the opening of his presidential library in Dallas. Like many people, I find it much easier to honor, respect and even like the man — now that he’s no longer in the White House.

But anyone tempted to get sentimental should remember the actual record of the man who called himself The Decider. Begin with the indelible stain that one of his worst decisions left on our country’s honor: torture.

Hiding behind the euphemism “enhanced interrogation techniques,” Bush made torture official U.S. policy. Just about every objective observer has agreed with this stark conclusion. The most recent assessment came this month in a 576-page report from a task force of the bipartisan Constitution Project, which stated that “it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture.”

We knew about the torture before Bush left office — at least, we knew about the waterboarding of three “high-value” detainees involved in planning the 9/11 attacks. But the Constitution Project task force — which included such figures as Asa Hutchinson, who served in high-ranking posts in the Bush administration, and William Sessions, who was FBI director under three presidents — concluded that other forms of torture were used “in many instances” in a manner that was “directly counter to values of the Constitution and our nation.”

Bush administration apologists argue that even waterboarding does not necessarily constitute torture and that other coercive — and excruciatingly painful — interrogation methods, such as putting subjects in “stress positions” or exposing them to extreme temperatures, certainly do not. The task force strongly disagreed, citing U.S. laws and court rulings, international treaties and common decency.

The Senate intelligence committee has produced, but refuses to make public, a 6,000-page report on the CIA’s use of torture and the network of clandestine “black site” prisons the agency established under Bush. One of President Obama’s worst decisions upon taking office in 2009, in my view, was to decline to convene some kind of blue-ribbon “truth commission” to bring all the abuses to light.

It may be years before all the facts are known. But the decision to commit torture looks ever more shameful with the passage of time.

Bush’s decision to invade and conquer Iraq also looks, in hindsight, like an even bigger strategic error. Saddam Hussein’s purported weapons of mass destruction still have yet to be found; nearly 5,000 Americans and untold Iraqis sacrificed their lives to eliminate a threat that did not exist.

We knew this, of course, when Obama became president. It’s one of the main reasons he was elected. We knew, too, that Bush’s decision to turn to Iraq diverted focus and resources from Afghanistan. But I don’t think anyone fully grasped that giving the Taliban a long, healing respite would eventually make Afghanistan this country’s longest or second-longest war, depending on what date you choose as the beginning of hostilities in Vietnam.

And it’s clear that the Bush administration did not foresee how the Iraq experience would constrain future presidents in their use of military force. Syria is a good example. Like Saddam, Bashar al-Assad is a ruthless dictator who does not hesitate to massacre his own people. But unlike Saddam, Assad does have weapons of mass destruction. And unlike Saddam, Assad has alliances with the terrorist group Hezbollah and the nuclear-mad mullahs in Iran.

I do not advocate U.S. intervention in Syria, because I fear we might make things worse rather than better. But I wonder how I might feel — and what options Obama might have — if we had not squandered so much blood and treasure in Iraq.

Bush didn’t pay for his wars. The bills he racked up for military adventures, prescription-drug benefits, the bank bailout and other impulse purchases helped create the fiscal and financial crises he bequeathed to Obama. His profligacy also robbed the Republican Party establishment of small-government credibility, thus helping give birth to the tea party movement. Thanks a lot for that.

As I’ve written before, Bush did an enormous amount of good by making it possible for AIDS sufferers in Africa to receive antiretroviral drug therapy. This literally saved millions of lives and should weigh heavily on one side of the scale when we assess The Decider’s presidency. But the pile on the other side just keeps getting bigger.

Instead, the hearing showed, yet again, that sober fact-finding is not their mission. Common sense and good judgment have long given way to conspiracy-mongering and a relentless effort to discredit President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The attack on the lightly protected consulate in Benghazi in September that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans was a tragic event, and Americans should know the full story. The most authoritative account, completed in December, came from an independent inquiry, led by two respected and now retired officials — Thomas Pickering, a former deputy secretary of state, and Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Their report was unsparing in concluding that “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels” in the State Department’s bureaus of diplomatic security and near eastern affairs resulted in a “security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place.” Mrs. Clinton took responsibility for the security failures when she testified at a Congressional hearing in January.

Wednesday’s hearing, led by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California who is chairman of the House oversight committee, featured three witnesses who testified about those failures. One of them, Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 official at the American Embassy in Tripoli, was at the embassy the night of the Benghazi attack. He said he was later demoted for raising questions about how the incident was handled, a charge the State Department denied."

Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week” that the release of more than 100 pages of Benghazi emails and notes show “beyond a shadow of the doubt” that accusations she tried to change the narrative of what happened in the attacks was false.

""And, frankly, I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this, now that they have seen the emails, owe Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack,” he said.

“An apology for what?” host George Stephanopoulos asked.

“For accusing her of misleading the country,” Pfeiffer said, adding, “For saying that she didn't -- that somehow we were -- she was involved in some sort of political whitewash of what happened there.

@DouthatNYT Right now, the base has a plan for winning 46 percent of the vote in 2016, and the establishment has a plan for winning ... 48 percent.

But these days, Mr. Brown — who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California — is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.

Here's a NY Times profile on Jerry Brown of CA:Republicans usually tout their governors, but that's mostly because they can't tout their Congressional people. How can they, when their entire schtick is ""send me to hated Washington where I swear to do nothing (and less than my predecessor)""?

Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei on how much it sucks to be a Republican these days:

It is almost impossible to find an establishment Republican in town who’s not downright morose about the 2013 that has been and is about to be. Most dance around it in public, but they see this year as a disaster in the making, even if most elected Republicans don’t know it or admit it. Several influential Republicans told us the party is actually in a worse place than it was Nov. 7, the day after the disastrous election. This is their case: • The party is hurting itself even more with the very voters they need to start winning back: Hispanics, blacks, gays, women and swing voters of all stripes. • The few Republicans who stood up and tried to move the party ahead were swatted into submission: Speaker John Boehner on fiscal matters and Sen. Marco Rubio on immigration are the poster boys for this. • Republicans are all flirting with a fall that could see influential party voices threatening to default on the debt or shut down the government — and therefore ending all hopes of proving they are not insane when it comes to governance.

VOICEOVER: Yet two days later, Secretary Clinton and others blamed protesters and ... CLINTON (9/14/12): ... an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with.

CLINTON (9/14/12): This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable.

The video editing is seamless between the voiceover and Clinton, making it appear as though she was finishing his sentence, putting an exclamation point on the claim that she blamed a YouTube video for what happened in Benghazi. But, as with the video's first clip, it turns out that this is just another slice and dice editing job, because as the transcript makes clear, Clinton wasn't talking about Benghazi—she was talking about protests out our embassies in Cairo and other places around the world.Clinton's comments about the video were clearly referring to protests and violence at our embassies. Not only was Benghazi not an embassy, Clinton referred to the attack there separately, in the preceding sentence.

At this point in the video, Rove has now told two big whoppers. His goal is to convince viewers that Hillary Clinton was blaming America for what happened in Benghazi and that she refused to stand up to religious extremists simply because they were Muslims. But immediately after the attack, Clinton did exactly that, saying:



Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It’s an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm.

What could Rove possibly find objectionable in that statement? The answer is obvious—nothing, because he didn't include it in his video. Instead, he took a statement Clinton had made linking the protest in Cairo to an internet video and falsely claimed she was talking about Benghazi.

Rove wasn't done with his deceptions, however. After the Clinton clip, his video claimed that Hicks was shocked and angered by what Clinton had said:



VOICEOVER: Deputy Hicks was shocked. HICKS: I was stunned. My jaw dropped. I was embarrassed.

Just one problem: Hicks wasn't talking about his reaction to Hillary Clinton. He was describing his reaction to Susan Rice's Sunday talk show comments. This isn't a surprise: After all, Clinton didn't say what Rove claims she said, so how could he have been?

Rove's video continues:



VOICEOVER: But when Hicks dared to question why Secretary Clinton and others were contradicting the facts he told her, Clinton's Chief of Staff ordered him not to talk to Congress.

A 22-year diplomatic veteran, intimidated for daring to blow the whistle—all under Hillary Clinton's watch. How could this happen? Why did she blame a video? Was she part of a cover up?

Again, this is not true. Hicks says he was told not to talk with Congress without a State Department lawyer present—not that he was told he couldn't talk to Congress. After overlooking that crucial piece of information, the video then makes its closing argument:The best thing I can say about the closing argument is that by framing its points as rhetorical questions rather than asserting falsehoods as truth, it falls closer to the category of ""bull"" than ""lie.""

Really, the one and only question that is potentially troubling is the question of whether Hicks did face any political repercussions for meeting with Jason Chaffetz without a State Department employee. He says he believes he's been effectively demoted, but the State Department says he hasn't and promised that he won't be. The State Department notes that Hicks asked to end his Libya assignment early and hasn't had his pay reduced by one dime. Hicks, meanwhile, says he still hasn't been reassigned.

It's important to make sure that Hicks is not intimidated for speaking his mind. The fact that he hasn't said anything particularly new or damaging is beside the point. The good news is that he's still employed by the State Department and his salary hasn't been cut one dime. In that respect, he's gotten much better treatment than Shirley Sherrod got after she became the target of a maliciously edited Andrew Breitbart video. But while the administration might not be as trigger happy with Hicks as they were with Sherrod, one thing is clear: If a right-winger puts out a video that's hard to believe, it's pretty damn good bet the video is nothing but lies."

""Nobody is listening to your telephone calls,"" the president says

The formerly secret surveillance programs help prevent terror, he says

But critics say U.S. programs go too far and should be rolled back

Details on millions of American phone calls. Records of e-mails, texts, video chats and more from overseas. And pulsing beneath it all, a worrying concern there's more to the government's surveillance programs than what's been acknowledged.

All the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs in recent days have put the government on the defensive, set privacy advocates howling for reform and left millions of Americans somewhere in the middle, wondering what the news means to them and what, if anything, they should do about it.

The man at the top says they should just relax.

""Nobody is listening to your telephone calls,"" President Barack Obama said Friday as he tried to reassure Americans who have had to digest a dizzying array of revelations in the past few days. Among them:

-- U.S. intelligence agencies are, in fact, collecting details on just about every telephone call placed each day in the United States, U.S. officials confirmed. And they've been doing it for seven years, a senator added.

-- They're also monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and other providers of popular online services.

-- And they may be scooping up credit card data, as well, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the operations of the National Security Agency.

U.S. officials say the phone-call data isn't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror, and only then on the authority of a judge. And officials say analysts are forbidden from slurping up the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas.

The Wall Street Journal said it wasn't clear whether the credit card monitoring was a continuing program or a one-off, and didn't say what analysts did with the information.

Analysts say such information can be analyzed using powerful computers and sophisticated software to detect personal habits and links among groups of people, and to build detailed dossiers on the activities of everyday people.

The government says it is not doing that, but privacy activists say even the limited amount of data collection U.S. officials have acknowledged poses huge threats.

""The problem is its massive surveillance,"" said author James Bamford, who has written extensively about NSA surveillance programs. ""We went through this problem with the Bush administration, warrantless eavesdropping. It was an outrage that government can turn the surveillance on average citizens without any suspicion whatsoever.""

""And here, this is an enormous increase in that,"" he said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday. ""This is communications that are local. These aren't even international communications at all. These are communications from people speaking to their neighbors, people that are under no suspicion whatsoever.""

The American Civil Liberties Union described the programs as ""beyond Orwellian.""

And the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been fighting the government over surveillance programs for years, is urging a full-scale investigation with an eye toward stopping the surveillance programs for good and reining in U.S. intelligence agencies with new laws and a demand for public oversight.

""The revelations not only confirmed what EFF has long alleged, they went even further and honestly, we're still reeling,"" the privacy organization said Friday on its blog.

Telephone monitoring

The revelations began Wednesday, when a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other analysts said similar orders undoubtedly are in effect for other companies.

The order doesn't allow authorities to listen in on the calls.

National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who denied during a March 12 congressional hearing that the government was engaged in mass data-collection practices involving Americans, blasted the Guardian report, saying it ""omits key information"" regarding ""safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties.""

He said the program operates within the law, respects Americans' privacy and is crucial to preventing attacks. Most of the records are never looked at, and those that are can be reviewed only with judicial approval, he said.

""The collection is broad in scope because more narrow collection would limit our ability to screen for and identify terrorism-related communications. Acquiring this information allows us to make connections related to terrorist activities over time,"" he said.

Clapper said both Congress and courts have reviewed and authorized the law.

But several congressional critics have complained that the government has made significant use of broad interpretations made in secret by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the judicial body charged with overseeing the government's use of the law.

""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Patriot Act co-author Rep. James Sensenbrenner wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, said he was ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.""

Online monitoring

A day after the initial Guardian report on the Verizon court order, the Guardian and the Washington Post published reports alleging the NSA is able to tap into data held by some of the world's biggest online services companies as it hunts for terrorists.

The program, which the newspapers said is called PRISM, reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft, Google and other companies to extract details of customer activities, including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials, The Post reported.

The Post reported PRISM, founded in 2007, has become the leading source of raw material for the NSA.

Clapper did not directly confirm the program's existence but acknowledged that the Post and Guardian stories ""refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.""

That section of the law authorizes intelligence agencies to collect information on non-U.S. residents as part of efforts to gather foreign intelligence.

He said the program cannot be used to target anyone inside the United States or U.S. citizens anywhere in the world and includes ""extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.""

""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,"" Clapper said Thursday.

""The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans,"" he said.

While the Post initially reported that the companies ""knowingly participate"" in the program, it later updated the online version of its story to remove that contention.

In its stead, the newspaper described a classified report indicating that NSA analysts were allowed to send ""content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations.""

AT&T, Verizon and Comcast declined to comment on the report Friday. Time Warner said it was unfamiliar with PRISM.

Microsoft said Thursday that it doesn't participate in any national security data gathering program. Facebook and Google said they do not give government agencies direct access to their servers.

And Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said his company has never heard of the program.

Necessary measures

While controversial to some, the programs also have plenty of backers. Obama noted that Congress has repeatedly endorsed the programs on a bipartisan basis.

Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California liberal, both believe the methods are necessary to prevent terrorism.

""Terrorists will come after us if they can,"" Feinstein said, ""and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us.""

Graham said that as a Verizon customer, ""it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Agency to have my phone number.""

Previous efforts

Similar efforts have floated to the surface for years.

After the 2001 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush's administration authorized the NSA to conduct wireless surveillance of international phone calls that included at least one person believed to be an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist.

The program was later ruled unconstitutional.

Another Bush-era program, the ""total information awareness"" program, would have combined vast government databases into a data-mining effort to look for suspicious patterns revealing potential criminal or terrorist activity. It was official dropped amid intense outcry from civil libertarians.

Also, in 2003, a former AT&T technician made a splash when he alleged that the telecom was routing all Internet traffic into a special NSA-controlled room in San Francisco.

Last year, Bamford wrote in Wired magazine about a huge data center being built for the NSA in Utah. Officials have officially labeled the center as part of the nation's effort to fight cyberattacks, but the Wired article, citing former NSA officials and others, said it was part of a huge surveillance program that would take in and analyze untold amounts of data.

Obama takes heat

The reports have increased scrutiny of Obama's record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism.

Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed, ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency."" But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post on its home page conflated an image of Obama with one of his predecessor, Bush, in a move to criticize the secret surveillance both administrations have been accused of.

A New York Times editorial said ""the administration has now lost all credibility"" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.

Obama said Friday that he entered office skeptical of the programs. But after thoroughly vetting them and adding additional safeguards -- which he did not identify -- Obama said he concluded they were worthwhile.

""My assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks,"" he said. ""And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and without looking at content, that on net it was worth us doing.""

Obama said he welcomed debate on the issue, but said some compromises are going to be necessary, no matter what.

""I think it is important to recognize that you can't have 100% security and then also have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" he said. ""You know, we are going to have to make some choices as a society."""

Original bill allowed local police to investigate drivers%27 immigration status during traffic stops

The law allowed police to arrest immigrants in circumstances far broader than federal law%2C judge said

Anyone using a consular identification card issued by a foreign country as ID also committed a crime

INDIANAPOLIS — A federal judge permanently blocked enforcement Friday of two key provisions of a controversial 2011 Indiana immigration bill: one barring the use of consular identification cards and another allowing the arrests of people whose immigration status is questionable.

In the ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker made permanent a preliminary injunction that she issued in June 2011.

That ruling found the state law violated the Constitution's due process and search and seizure provisions, as well as other protections, because local police were allowed to arrest people whose immigration status had been questioned by federal authorities — even if those authorities had determined that a person should be able to remain in the country.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said he will not appeal the decision.

""Now that the federal court decision reinforces what we said all along — that immigration enforcement is a federal government not a state responsibility — this case is at an end,"" Zoeller said.

Advocates for civil liberties and Indiana's growing Latino community hailed the ruling as a victory that protects law-abiding citizens and visitors to the U.S. — a decision that reaches well beyond any one ethnic group.

""The ruling says we're not going to allow police officers to profile people just because of their national origin,"" said Kevin C. Munoz, an Indianapolis immigration and criminal lawyer. ""It protects us from xenophobia that anybody can have and all of a sudden start harassing someone who has every right to be here whether they are a legal resident or have been granted some other protective status.""

Other provisions of the state law, which penalize employers for hiring illegal immigrants, remain in effect.

Barker also issued an order Friday denying a motion from three Indiana lawmakers who asked to defend parts of the state's immigration law in court.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and National Immigration Law Center had filed the challenge on behalf of three foreign-born residents living in the state.

""The U.S. Supreme Court made it quite clear that states should not be engaged in this sort of enterprise,"" Ken Falk, the state ACLU's legal director, said of the immigration legislation. ""This ruling demonstrates that the Constitution applies to all Indiana residents.""

The 2011 law originally empowered local police to investigate drivers' immigration status during traffic stops. It was significantly watered down amidst opposition from many public figures, including the state attorney general.

Still, as adopted, the law made it a crime for a person to provide as identification a consular identification card issued by the government of a foreign country.

""These sweeping regulations, targeted solely at foreign government-issued identification that consulates are entitled to issue and which restrict the manner in which foreign citizens may travel, live, and trade in the United States, have a direct effect on our nation's interactions with foreign nations,"" Barker wrote in her ruling. ""Such interactions cannot be dictated or restricted by individual states.""

The law also had allowed police to arrest a person if that person was the subject of a removal order issued by an immigration court, a detainer or notice of action by U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or when there is ""probable cause to believe that the person has been indicted for or convicted of one or more aggravated felonies.""

The Indiana law authorized ""state and local law enforcement to arrest in circumstances far broader than those in which Congress has allowed state and local officers to arrest immigrants,"" Barker wrote. The provisions were even broader than what federal officers are allowed under federal law.

Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane of Anderson, Ind., said the ruling should be ""a reminder to the legislature to be extremely careful when creating punitive public policy."" Republicans dominate the Indiana General Assembly.

""Its measures unfortunately portray Indiana as intolerant"" and involve the state in time-consuming litigation, he said."

Dianne Feinstein says program info aided two declassified cases ""If they want to get you, over time they will,"" Snowden says U.S. officials say the program is overseen by courts and Congress Senators have expressed concerns about the scope of the program before

(CNN) —

A 29-year-old computer technician for a U.S. defense contractor leaked details of a top-secret American program that collects vast streams of phone and Internet data, American and British newspapers revealed Sunday.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” the source, Edward Snowden, told Britain’s the Guardian, one of the papers that broke stories on the program last week.

The Washington Post also disclosed Sunday that Snowden was the source on its stories.

Snowden is a former technical assistant for the CIA and has been working at the National Security Agency, the U.S. electronic intelligence service, for the past four years, the newspaper reported. He said he walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and has holed up in a hotel in Hong Kong in preparation for the expected fallout from his disclosures.

“I’m willing to sacrifice all of that because I can’t in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they’re secretly building,” he said.

Video: What did NSA want with Verizon data?

The Guardian reported Wednesday that Verizon Business Network Services had been ordered to hand over telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. An order from a U.S. court that oversees U.S. surveillance efforts backed up the demand, the newspaper reported.

Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of customer activities – including “audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents” and other materials – from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms.

Snowden said the NSA’s reach poses “an existential threat to democracy.” He said he had hoped the Obama administration would end the programs once it took office in 2009, but instead, he said, President Barack Obama “advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in.”

“I don’t see myself as a hero, because what I’m doing is self-interested,” he said. “I don’t want to live in a world where there’s no privacy, and therefore no room for intellectual exploration and creativity.”

Will he be extradited?

The first call for Snowden’s prosecution came shortly after his identity was made public, from Rep. Peter King, the chairman of a House Homeland Security subcommittee and a member of the Intelligence Committee.

“If Edward Snowden did in fact leak the NSA data as he claims, the United States government must prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law and begin extradition proceedings at the earliest date,” King, R-New York, said in a written statement. “The United States must make it clear that no country should be granting this individual asylum. This is a matter of extraordinary consequence to American intelligence.”

Though Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China, the former British colony has a free press and tolerates political dissent under a semi-autonomous government.

Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for “political” crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the “defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy” of either party.

James Clapper, director of the Office of National Intelligence, had no direct comment on Snowden’s admission, but noted, “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law.”

A law enforcement official told CNN the United States must charge Snowden before a process to seek his extradition can begin, adding that any talk of such action is “jumping ahead” of where things stand in the case.

The Justice Department declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the leak.

Leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress defended the program Sunday.

Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it helped lead to convictions in two cases:

– Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York.

– David Headley, who pleaded guilty to conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people.

“These programs are within the law,” Feinstein, D-California, told ABC’s “This Week.” And Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC, “The inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what Dianne and I know this program really does.”

“The instances where this has produced good – has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks – is all classified,” said Rogers, R-Michigan. “That’s what’s so hard about this.”

Obama defends NSA program

Clapper: Programs were authorized by Congress

Clapper’s office declassified some details of the programs, which it said were “conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress.”

U.S. officials said earlier that phone-call data isn’t looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terrorism, and only then on the authority of a judge. Officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas. And Obama tried to reassure Americans about the programs Friday, saying, “Nobody is listening to your telephone calls.”

Clapper’s office said PRISM was created in 2008, targets “foreign targets located outside the United States” and gets reviewed by the administration, Congress and judges. And Rogers told reporters Sunday that “there is not a target on Americans.”

Some shrug at NSA snooping: Privacy’s already dead

But Glenn Greenwald, the lead author of the Guardian pieces, told ABC’s “This Week” that the articles show the NSA hasn’t leveled with members of Congress who have expressed concerns about the scope of electronic surveillance. He said Americans need an “open, honest debate about whether that’s the kind of country that we want to live in.”

“These are things that the American people have a right to know,” said Greenwald, a lawyer and civil-liberties advocate. “The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and the way they exercise power in the dark.”

Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who has long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on Americans, said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week’s disclosures.

“Maybe Americans think this is OK, but I think the line has been drawn too far towards ‘we’re going to invade your privacy,’ versus ‘we’re going to respect your privacy,’ ” Udall told CNN’s State of the Union.

Udall is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of Americans’ phone records but have been limited in what they could say publicly.

Udall told CNN that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown.

“It’s unclear to me we’ve developed any intelligence through the metadata program that’s led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means,” Udall said, pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and Rogers that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records.

’I do not expect to see home again’

The Guardian reported that Snowden grew up in North Carolina and Maryland. He joined the Army in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident. He never completed a high-school diploma but learned computer skills at a community college in Maryland.

He started his career as a security guard for an NSA facility at the University of Maryland, then went to work for the CIA in Internet security. In 2009, he got the first of several jobs with private contractors that worked with the NSA.

In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Booz Allen said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. Reports that he had leaked American secrets were “shocking” and if true, “represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,” the company said.

Snowden told the Guardian that he left for Hong Kong on May 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned.

“I do not expect to see home again,” he told the paper, acknowledging the risk of imprisonment over his actions.

“You can’t come up against the world’s most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept the risk,” he said. “If they want to get you, over time they will.”

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said. New possible exposures in Fredericton Public Health has identified new possible exposures to the coronavirus in Fredericton. People who have been in a public exposure location can be tested, even if they're not experiencing any symptoms. Residents may request a test online or by calling Tele-Care 811.

That miracle may be in the making, helped along by Christians who want to put their faith into action.

FOR THE RECORD:

Immigration: An Aug. 8 Op-Ed article said 300 evangelical Christians confronted members of Congress on July 25 in support of immigration reform. It was July 24. —



On July 25, 300 evangelical Christians from 27 states had 110 meetings with their mostly Republican representatives on Capitol Hill to ask them to let personal faith replace political fear. Republican leaders told us we represented a “new factor” in the debate on immigration, a grass-roots constituency for reform that can influence the political right.

We offered a clear message to every member of the House, but especially those who consider themselves people of faith. Christians, including millions of evangelicals, believe fixing our broken immigration system is long overdue.

We aren’t primarily motivated by political considerations or even by the clear economic benefits immigration reform would bring. It is the biblical call to “welcome the stranger” and Jesus’ concern for “the least of these” that inspires us. Congress needs to pass immigration reform because it is the morally right thing to do.

Of course, God never ordains or endorses particular pieces of legislation — bills are always the product of compromises and limitations. But the principles contained in the common-sense immigration bill put forward by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are the right ones. The proposal could bring 11 million people out of the shadows, reunite families, provide an earned, achievable pathway to citizenship, respect the rule of law and secure the border — all goals that are broadly consistent with biblical values.

When three of the largest Republican constituencies — evangelicals, law enforcement officials and business leaders — are in favor of an immigration overhaul, it’s hard to fathom the arguments against it. Those whose position on reform is based on political fear, unacknowledged racial prejudice or worries about losing primaries to far-right ideologues are too often the same people who trumpet their religious convictions as guiding their decisions in public life.

Our claim to them is simple: Politicians who are professing Christians need to consider what their faith has to say about immigration. If they oppose reform and refuse to offer compassion to our immigrant brothers and sisters, they should justify their positions on moral grounds. We join with other faith communities in asking for a moral and religious conversation about immigration reform — not just a political one.

We don’t think a faith-based argument exists against immigration reform, at least if you’re reading the Bible closely. God’s passionate, abiding concern for immigrants and foreigners, strangers and travelers — and for our neighbors — is obvious to anyone reading through Scripture.

In the Old Testament, the Lord commands:

“When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself … "" (Leviticus 19:33-34).

The biblical word “ger” for the foreigners in our midst occurs an astounding 92 times in the Hebrew scriptures, with the consistent instruction to protect them.

In the New Testament, the stranger, and all who are vulnerable, are at the very heart of the Gospel. In the book of Matthew, Jesus offers a vision in which caring for them is the defining mark of God’s kingdom:

“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me” (Matthew 25:35-36).

That evangelical Christians would finally act to reform the immigration system should surprise no one, and not just for theological reasons. Undocumented immigrants have joined our congregations; we understand the problem firsthand. They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ. And we know that by reforming our immigration laws, we can create a system that also reflects the best values of our nation and the highest ideals of our faith. We act because, as the book of James reminds us, “faith without works is dead.”

Conservative Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has connected his faith with his vote:

“I think the biggest change hasn’t been in the pulpit; it’s been in the pews.... It’s one thing when 11 million is a statistic. The other thing is when one of those 11 million is your friend, a human being who you now know … as a father, as a husband, as a mother, as a worker, as a worshiper.... Our faith has always been about compassion and it compels you to do something. If you took compassion or the principle of compassion out of the Bible, it would be in tatters because it’s all over the place.”

Compassion is indeed all over the Bible. I pray it will also be found in the House of Representatives. It’s time for Christians in the House to stand up in support of immigration reform, or to explain why they won’t — as Christians. If they follow their faith, we will see the miracle we need.

WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.

The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.

""I have never heard of anything like this at all,"" said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.

""It is one thing to create special rules for national security,"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""

THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION

The unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit, including the FBI, CIA, NSA, Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.

Today, much of the SOD's work is classified, and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive,"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.

""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function,"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""

A spokesman with the Department of Justice, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment.

But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.

A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only, 'Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.

""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""

After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""

The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""

A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.

""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,"" said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.

Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.

A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY

""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""

Lawrence Lustberg, a New Jersey defense lawyer, said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""

Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information, such as an informant's identity or classified evidence, to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.

""You can't game the system,"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes, not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here, where do you draw it?""

Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke, a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer, said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.

""It's a balancing act, and they've doing it this way for years,"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No, because now that I'm a defense lawyer, I see how difficult it is to challenge.""

CONCEALING A TIP

One current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him, the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.

""I was pissed,"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation, he said.

A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown, even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.

The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents, albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.

The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations, connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.

SOD'S BIG SUCCESSES

The unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy, a crackdown against manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.

Since its inception, the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.

Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.

The DICE database contains about 1 billion records, the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged, the DEA officials said.

About 10,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database, records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently, one of the DEA officials said, DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100,000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.

""We use it to connect the dots,"" the official said.

""AN AMAZING TOOL""

Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.

""They do a pretty good job of screening, but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American,"" the senior law enforcement official said.

Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.

As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.

Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.

""It was an amazing tool,"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""

DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review. (Edited by Blake Morrison)"

Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who had complained about the brochure in May, on Tuesday released a copy of a letter she received from the Pentagon informing her of the Air Force's decision and steps the services are taking to deal with the epidemic of sexual assault in the ranks, including reviewing its prevention material.

""We have reviewed the Shaw Air Force Base brochure you mentioned in your letter,"" Jessica Wright, acting undersecretary of defense, wrote to Slaughter. ""We share your concerns over some of the materials presented, and the Air Force has withdrawn the brochure from circulation.""

The letter was dated June 20, received by Slaughter's office during last week's congressional recess and released on Tuesday.

The brochure contained some common-sense recommendations, such as checking around a car before entering and using dead-bolt locks and peepholes when home alone. It also included advice that the congresswoman described as victim-blaming and inappropriate as the military struggles with the problem of sexual assault.

""If you are attacked, it may be advisable to submit than to resist,"" the brochure said. ""You have to make this decision based on circumstances. Be especially careful if the attack has a weapon.""

The brochure also suggested that if an individual is accosted in a parking lot, ""consider rolling underneath a nearby auto and scream loud. It is difficult to force anyone out from under a car.""

The Pentagon estimated in a recent report that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military actually reported rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, the report said.

""No service member wearing the uniform of the United States military should ever be told 'it may be advisable to submit than to resist' in the case of a sexual assault,"" Slaughter said in a statement. ""I am cautiously optimistic about the Pentagon's agreement to review all sexual assault prevention materials. We have to change the military culture if we want to stop this epidemic of sexual assault, and this response is a step in the right direction and a small victory for victims."""

Snowden, a fugitive from U.S. authorities, is apparently still holed up in the transit zone at Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport, an airport official said, according to Interfax. The former national security consultant arrived at the airport on June 23 after a period in hiding in Hong Kong.

U.S. officials have vowed to pursue and extradite Snowden, who was charged by federal prosecutors last month with two violations of the Espionage Act and the theft of government property.

The request for a meeting was sent to Russian representatives of Amnesty International, Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, a Polish civil rights group and a U.N. representative in Russia. Russian Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin was also invited, the Interfax report said.

Snowden also intends to make a statement, the details of which were not disclosed, the report said.

Snowden “intends to express his attitude toward a maniacal persecution campaign unleashed against him by the U.S. administration resulting from which passengers of air flights bound for Latin America are exposed to danger,” the unnamed airport official told Interfax.

A meeting between Snowden and representatives of the human rights groups was set to take place at 4:30 p.m. local time at the Sheremetyevo transit zone, a Foreign Ministry official said.

However, it remains unclear whether the invited parties can enter the transit zone of the airport without possessing traveling documents and having their passports exit-stamped, the official said.

“Other than that, Snowden is a free man, as our president [Vladimir Putin] pointed out, and can make statements,” the official told The Times on condition of anonymity. “However, I think he will heed our advice and refrain from any more leaks, which can do harm to our U.S. partners while he is here.”

[Updated, 4:36 a.m. PDT July 12: In a letter to the human rights organizations, the text of which was provided to the Times, Snowden thanked the “brave countries around the world” that have offered him asylum.

“By refusing to compromise their principles in the face of intimidation, they have earned the respect of the world,” Snowden said in the letter.

“Unfortunately, in recent weeks we have witnessed an unlawful campaign by officials in the U.S. Government to deny my right to seek and enjoy this asylum under Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Snowden said.

He referenced the July 3 forced grounding of a flight out of Moscow that had Bolivian President Evo Morales on board. The flight was forced to land in Vienna in connection with suspicions the plane might be carrying Snowden to a welcoming Central American or South American country.

“Never before in history have states conspired to force to the ground a sovereign president’s plane to effect a search for a political refugee,” Snowden said of the incident.

Snowden said the purported attempts by the U.S. to extradite him represented “a threat not just to the dignity of Latin America or my own personal security, but to the basic right shared by every living person to live free from persecution.”]

Marco Rubio played a crucial role in orchestrating passage of the bipartisan immigration overhaul in the Senate last month, but the Florida Republican and potential 2016 presidential contender has bowed out of the messy battle as it moves to the House.

Key senators behind the immigration bill admonished top business leaders in a session at the Capitol this week to put more pressure on reluctant House Republicans, but Rubio was notably absent. The bill’s supporters were counting on his voice as a Latino and tea party favorite to help sell the measure to conservatives.

At the same time, President Obama has adopted a lofty approach, speaking of the benefits of immigration but staying above the fray, aware that efforts to rouse public opinion would almost certainly chase away House Republicans who typically distance themselves from his initiatives.

Obama did a round of interviews with Spanish-language television anchors on Tuesday. He said nothing new, but his message to House Republicans, though not overt, was clear: Millions of Latino voters are watching.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

The decisions by Rubio and Obama to step back leave the two highest-profile champions of changing the nation’s immigration laws in cameo roles for what is expected to be the toughest part of the fight.

Instead, the most influential advocates for comprehensive reform will probably be business and religious leaders who hold more sway over House Republicans than either the Florida senator or the president.

Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), who along with Rubio were among the chief architects of the Senate bill, told those leaders at the session that it was past time to launch a high-level campaign.

McCain delivered a “stern” message, according to one source in the room. And Schumer said, “You guys are working, but you need to ramp it up,” according to another source familiar with the meeting.

Rubio’s decision reflects a broader conflict among immigration advocates of how best to prod the House, where the GOP majority remains cool to the cornerstone of the legislation, the path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the nation illegally.

Schumer and McCain sought to build political momentum that would leave the House little choice but to act.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Rubio appears to have decided to give House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) space to work with his often unruly majority. He has no plans to continue meeting with the other senators who wrote the bill with him.

“The House has an opportunity to improve on the Senate’s efforts and advance reform further, but they should be given the deference to decide the best way forward,” said Rubio spokesman Alex Conant.

Boehner engaged on the issue Wednesday by suggesting he would favor a path to citizenship limited to immigrants brought to the country as children.

“This is about basic fairness,” the Ohio Republican said. “You know, these children were brought here of no accord of their own, and frankly they’re in a very difficult position. And I think many of our members believe that this issue needs to be addressed.”

Democratic lawmakers and Obama are likely to resist that approach as insufficient.

Obama has called some House members, mostly Democrats, but he believes his most effective role is to keep the pressure on Republicans with a public campaign, administration officials said.

On Tuesday, the administration held a Spanish-language media day at the White House, hosting four anchors from Telemundo and Univision stations in Los Angeles, New York, Denver and Dallas. Obama did eight-minute interviews with each, welcoming them with a hearty “mucho gusto” — a customary Spanish greeting — and launched into an argument that a “pathway to citizenship” was an essential component of any immigration reform.

The president is expected to host more of these not overtly partisan events, traveling to communities where he can stand with a coalition of business, farm and faith leaders who support the immigration overhaul.

One congressional aide referred to it as using the pulpit, rather than the bully pulpit.

Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) was among those in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with Obama recently at the White House, where the president made his stand-to-the-side approach clear. “He said, ‘You all know the House better than I know the House. Let me know how I can be helpful. I’m ready to go,’” Becerra said of the president.

Many Democrats, including several top advisors to Obama, believe the party has nothing to lose no matter what happens. If House Republicans allow a bill with a pathway to citizenship to pass, the president fulfills a campaign promise. If not, Latino voters could be further alienated from the GOP.

But Obama’s top advisors say he does not want to keep the immigration debate alive simply to use it as a wedge issue. “The president says his metric for success is what he gets done,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior political advisor. “How do we make progress on our agenda? That’s the only thing that matters.”

House Republicans, however, may leave for the August recess without voting on any immigration bills.

At the Capitol meeting this week, the senators told those gathered that they needed to deliver a unified message to House members over the break. “The message was: Let’s band together and push for overall immigration reform in the House,” said Kristi Boswell, director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Blair Latoff Holmes, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman, said business leaders planned to meet with lawmakers to communicate “why this is important from an economic and business perspective.”

“Rest assured,” she said, “we will be engaged in the districts that matter to ensure the House takes up immigration reform.”

A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.']",Rand Paul vows to speak ‘as long as it takes’ to block Brennan,"WASHINGTON -- In a rare, traditional filibuster, Sen. Rand Paul vowed to speak on the Senate floor “as long as it takes” to draw attention to his concerns about the Obama administration’s policy regarding the targeted killing of American terrorism suspects.

The Kentucky Republican took to the floor before noon Wednesday to block an expected vote on the nomination of John Brennan to lead the CIA, with aides saying he could continue for hours. Paul, beginning his remarks, said he would continue “until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important.”

“Are we so complacent with our rights that we would allow a president to say he might kill Americans?” Paul asked. “No one person, no one politician should be allowed ... to judge the guilt of an individual and to execute an individual. It goes against everything we fundamentally believe in our country.”

As Paul began the third hour of his filibuster, he shifted from discussing terrorism to government spending. No other senators were in the chamber, except freshman Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin who sat on the rostrum as presiding officer. A Senate stenographer stood just feet from Paul as he spoke from his corner desk, an aide seated to his left. A spokesman for Paul said he was armed with three large binders of material to help him deliver his remarks.

The Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12-3 Tuesday to forward Brennan’s nomination to the full Senate, a path that senators thought was cleared after the White House agreed to provide all of the Justice Department’s secret legal opinions on killing terrorism suspects abroad, as well records from the September attacks at U.S. diplomatic and intelligence compounds in Benghazi, Libya.

A leadership aide had said the Senate could potentially hold a confirmation vote Wednesday evening, with a 60-vote requirement, a threshold that appeared to be within reach.

Paul, a self-described champion of constitutional liberties, had said this week he would delay a vote until the White House assures him it has no authority to target an American within the United States under the drone program. Perhaps because he lacked the support of a sufficient number of colleagues to hold up the vote, Paul instead chose to use his prerogative as a senator to control the floor.

“I have allowed the president to pick his appointees, but I will not sit quietly and let him shred the Constitution,” he said. “I cannot sit at my desk quietly and let the president say he will kill Americans on American soil who are not actively attacking the country.”

Advertisement

Under Rule XIX of the Senate, senators who have been recognized to speak may do so for as long as they wish and cannot be forced to cede the floor or even interrupted without their consent, according to the Congressional Research Service.

That was traditionally how a filibuster was conducted, but that notion has changed. Instead, a filibuster now describes any procedural move by a Senate minority to block or delay consideration of legislation or appointments, and a senator is not required to the floor to speak.

Advertisement

Such was the case earlier Wednesday when 40 Republican senators voted to block one of President Obama’s appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The last time a talking filibuster occurred was in December 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke for all but 80 minutes in a nearly nine-hour period to oppose a compromise to extend the George W. Bush-era tax rates.

Advertisement

Paul said his effort was not a partisan one. He noted that he voted for John F. Kerry as secretary of State, and for Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense, after initially voting to block Hagel’s nomination.

Paul recalled Obama’s previous criticism of the Bush administration’s prosecution of the war on terrorism, arguing that if Obama were still in the Senate, he would likely be supporting the effort.

“It amazes and disappoints me how much he has changed,” Paul said.

Tim Casey, the lead attorney representing America's self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in the case, said an appeal of the finding that the agency racially profiles people was planned in the next 30 days.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Murray Snow in Phoenix backs up years of allegations from Arpaio's critics who say his officers violate the constitutional rights of Latinos in relying on race in their immigration enforcement.

Snow, whose ruling came more than eight months after a seven-day, non-jury trial, also ruled Arpaio's deputies unreasonably prolonged the detentions of people who were pulled over.

The ruling marks a thorough repudiation of the immigration patrols that made Arpaio a national political figure, and it represents a victory for those who pushed the lawsuit.

""For too long the sheriff has been victimizing the people he's meant to serve with his discriminatory policy,"" said Cecillia D. Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants' Right Project. ""Today we're seeing justice for everyone in the county.""

Monetary damages weren't sought in the lawsuit but rather a declaration that Arpaio's office engages in racial profiling and an order that requires it to make policy changes.

Stanley Young, the lead lawyer who argued the case against Arpaio, said Snow set a hearing for June 14 where he will hear from the two sides on how to make sure the orders in the ruling are carried out.

The sheriff, who has repeatedly denied the allegations, won't face jail time as a result of Friday's ruling.

Casey said that MCSO's position ""is that it has never used race and will never use race in its law-enforcement decisions."" He added the sheriff's office relied on ""bad training"" from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""The decision here really affects some poor training from ICE and unfortunately we relied on ICE, acted on ICE, and now it turns out ICE was incorrect,"" Casey told MyFoxPhoenix.com.

In the meantime, Casey said the agency ""will meet with the court and comply with the letter and spirit of the order.""

A small group of Latinos alleged in their lawsuit that Arpaio's deputies pulled over some vehicles only to make immigration status checks. The group asked Snow to issue injunctions barring the sheriff's office from discriminatory policing and the judge ruled that more remedies could be ordered in the future.

The group also accused the sheriff of ordering some immigration patrols not based on reports of crime but rather on letters and emails from Arizonans who complained about people with dark skin congregating in an area or speaking Spanish. The group's attorneys noted Arpaio sent thank-you notes to some who wrote the complaints.

The sheriff said his deputies only stop people when they think a crime has been committed and that he wasn't the person who picked the location of the patrols. His lawyers said there was nothing wrong with the thank-you notes.

Young, the group's lawyer, said he was still reading the decision Friday but noted it contained ""very detailed findings of discriminatory intent and effect.""

A call to ICE officials in Phoenix for comment wasn't immediately returned Friday evening.

Arpaio, who turns 81 next month, was elected in November to his sixth consecutive term as sheriff in Arizona's most populous county.

Known for jailing inmates in tents and making prisoners wear pink underwear, Arpaio started doing immigration enforcement in 2006 amid Arizona voter frustration with the state's role as the nation's busiest illegal entryway.

Snow wrote that ""in the absence of further facts that would give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a violation of either federal criminal law or applicable state law is occurring,"" Arpaio's office now is enjoined from enforcing its policy ""on checking the immigration status of people detained without state charges, using Hispanic ancestry or race as any factor in making law enforcement decisions pertaining to whether a person is authorized to be in the country, and unconstitutionally lengthening stops.""

Snow added ""the evidence introduced at trial establishes that, in the past, the MCSO has aggressively protected its right to engage in immigration and immigration-related enforcement operations even when it had no accurate legal basis for doing so.""

The trial that ended Aug. 2 focused on Latinos who were stopped during both routine traffic patrols and special immigration patrols known as ""sweeps.""

During the sweeps, deputies flood an area of a city -- in some cases, heavily Latino areas -- over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders. Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since January 2008, according to figures provided by Arpaio's office.

At trial, plaintiffs' lawyers drew testimony from witnesses who broke down in tears as they described encounters with authorities, saying they were pulled over because they were Hispanic and officers wanted to check their immigration status, not because they had committed an infraction. The sheriff's attorneys disputed such characterizations, typically working to show that officers had probable cause to stop the drivers based on a traffic violation.

Plaintiffs' lawyers also presented statistics to show Latinos are more likely to be stopped on days of immigration patrols and showed emails containing offensive jokes about people of Mexican heritage that were circulated among sheriff's department employees, including a supervisor in Arpaio's immigrant smuggling squad.

Defense lawyers disputed the statistical findings and said officers who circulated offensive jokes were disciplined. They also denied the complaint letters prompted patrols with a discriminatory motive.

The ruling used Arpaio's own words in interviews, news conferences and press releases against him as he trumpeted his efforts in cracking down on immigrants. When it came to making traffic stops, Arpaio said in 2007 that deputies are not bound by state laws in finding a reason to stop immigrants.

""Ours is an operation, whether it's the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first, that they happen to be illegals,"" the ruling quoted Arpaio as saying. ""My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I'm not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.""

Some immigrant traffic stops were made ""purely on the observation of the undercover officers that the vehicles had picked up Hispanic day laborers from sites where Latino day laborers were known to gather,"" the ruling said.

The judge also said the sheriff's office declared on many occasions that racial profiling is strictly prohibited and not tolerated, while witnesses said it was appropriate to consider race as a factor in rounding up immigrants.

""This is a blow to"" the sheriff's office, said David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studied racial profiling and wrote a book on the subject.

Arpaio's lawyers will have ""an uphill climb"" in the appeals process because of all ""the gross statistical evidence,"" he said.

That responsibility lies with the members of Congress who voted for the PATRIOT Act, as well as extensions of it and the provisions related to collecting those records. Over 100 people currently serving in the House and Senate voted for the original Act in 2001. Last year, over 300 voted to extend a key provision.

RELATED: Obama Administration Defends Its Right to Take All Your Phone Records

We looked at seven Congressional actions generally and five in particular to assess how the government's power to collect data has evolved. From October 2001 to last December, Congress continually voted to expand or continue the government's power to collect private data, ostensibly to bolster efforts to stop terrorist activity. In addition to the PATRIOT Act, Congress has also renewed provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA — the law that established the court which issued the Verizon order.

“I think it’s very surprising to accuse somebody of espionage who hasn’t worked for a foreign government, who didn’t covertly pass information to an adversary-enemy of the United States, who didn’t sell any top secret information, who simply went to newspapers, asked newspapers to very carefully vet the information to make sure that the only thing being published are things that inform his fellow citizens but doesn’t harm national security,"" Greenwald said in a phone interview. ""That is not espionage in any real sense of the word.”

If I could have a word with Greenwald, I'd give him this advice to keep him from absolutely making a fool of himself. I'm afraid it's to late:

1. Just write the stories and shut-up. Your advocacy journalism is reminding me of James O'keefe. That's foolish, my man.

2. Quit responding to every one of your critics. Makes you look childish and petulant.

3. Quit managing Snowden's image--you're supposed to be a ""journalist,"" not his publicists.

4. Quit telling me what I should be outraged about--that's offensive and foolish.

5. Quit taking everything Snowden's says for absolute law. There's still a healthy skepticism about the veracity of some of his claims.

6. Quit claiming to speak for the American people and let your work speak for itself.

7. Cancel your TV tour...you look angry and out of control.

8. Now that Snowden has been charged, don't become a co-conspirator in this mess.

9. Quit playing the god of America's consciousness...it's getting old.

10. It is absolutely foolish to think that any president (regardless of party) would allow ""any leaker"" to distribute intelligence information around the world without repercussions. For you to think this President would give him an ""ata-boy"" and open the door to a flood of others is utterly foolish and devoid of understanding.

Yes, I believe Greenwald has poisoned this story."

Appearing on FoxNews to defend the bill’s security provisions, Rove singled out a Breitbart story which appeared Friday as “simply not true.” Rove’s criticism, however, was factually incorrect.

The article Rove attacked, detailed a new provision in the then-Corker-Hoeven amendment which would allow immigrants on work visas who overstayed their visas to still apply for a green card. In other words, breaking immigration law in the future would not prevent someone from getting on the “path to citizenship.”

Rove claimed the article “turned out simply not to be true. It was very narrow provision that said if you’re from one of nine countries that get what’s called ‘Temporary Protective Status’ because of war or conflict inside your country, and you’ve been employed for ten years, the last ten years, you can, like every other person who’s here in the United States get in line to become a citizen, ultimately at the back of the line, and can’t happen for another ten years and so forth.” (emphasis added)

Rove, like many supporters of the Senate bill, clearly has not read the entire bill or simply misunderstands it. The language discussed in the Breitbart article had nothing to do with the TPS program or refugees from war-torn countries. The amendment allowing visa-overstays applies to the overwhelming majority of future immigrants in this country, what’s called the Merit Track-2 path. The CBO estimates that more than half the current 11 million illegals in this country will take this path to citizenship.

That is not a “very narrow provision.” Rove’s attempt to attack the Breitbart News article was totally inaccurate and wrong."

""Usually we're supposed to be props,"" Ju Hong told the San Jose Mercury News. ""I was shaking a little bit, but thinking about me and my family and my community and my friends, the pain they have suffered under the Obama administration ... it really sparked a buildup of my anger.

""Actually, I don't,"" Obama said, ""and that's why we're here.""



As members of the Secret Service moved in to remove Hong, the president called them off, telling Hong his speech was part of an effort to get Congress to pass immigration reform.



""The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. What I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won’t be as easy as just shouting.”



“He blames Congress but not himself,” Hong told the Daily Californian. “He said he’s in full support [of immigration reform], but he’s not doing anything. An executive order is not violating the law.”



It's not the first time Hong, who graduated in 2012, has taken to civil disobedience to make his point.



In August, he was one of six protesters arrested after interrupting a ceremony welcoming former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as the new president of UC-Berkeley.



In 2011, Hong and six other undocumented student activists were arrested at a rally in San Bernadino, Calif., after blocking a street in protest of Arizona's anti-immigration laws. (The rally was in support of the Dream Act, which enabled undocumented students to qualify for financial aid.)



“This is my last year at Cal,"" Hong said after his 2011 arrest. ""After I graduate, now what? Even with a degree from UC-Berkeley, I cannot legally work.""



Hong was part of a group of San Francisco-based activists (Asian Students Promoting Immigrant Rights through Education) in attendance at Obama's speech.



""Mr. President, I did not heckle you,"" Hong wrote on Twitter. ""I was speaking the truth.""

Story highlights William Potts hijacked a plane to Havana in 1984 He was surprised to face trial and be sentenced to 15 years in Cuban prison His daughters are now living in U.S., but Potts continues to fight to join them Potts says he realizes that violence is not the way to bring about change

(CNN) —

Should William Potts, an American fugitive living in Cuba, ever set foot in the United States again, he faces an indictment for airplane hijacking and a potentially lengthy prison term.

So why is Potts now battling to return to the same country that wants to imprison him?

In 1984, Potts hijacked a Piedmont Airlines passenger plane bound for Miami with 56 people aboard.

A Black Panther and self-styled revolutionary, Potts dreamed of receiving military training in Cuba that he could use to overthrow the United States government.

But first, the New York native had to find a way to get to the island.

Potts’ solution was to smuggle a .25-caliber pistol inside a fake cast on his arm.

The handgun set off the metal detectors at Newark Airport, but all Potts had to do was flash his cast and an easy smile to breeze past security.

After the plane took off, Potts went to bathroom, where he ditched the phony cast and put on what he calls his “Black Panther costume” of dark clothes and combat boots. He walked to the back of the airplane with the pistol in hand.

A flight attendant told him to retake his seat, Potts said, but her eyes grew wide as she saw his changed demeanor and clothing.

Potts gave her a note ordering the pilot to fly the plane to Cuba.

Over the plane’s telephone system, the pilot tried to convince Potts to end the hijacking.

“I had to be forceful with him,” Potts remembered. “I tell him, if we don’t go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba.”

As the plane crossed the bright blue water and the coastline and palm trees came into view, Potts still wasn’t sure he was over Cuba.

“I had them go low and circle around,” he said. “I was looking for McDonald’s and Coca-Cola and propaganda like that. I didn’t see any of it, so I figured we must be here.”

The plane landed in Havana, but Potts did not get the welcome he expected from his fellow revolutionaries.

After years of hijackings to the island, the Cubans put hijackers like him on trial.

Authorities told Potts that Fidel Castro’s government was no longer involved in spreading armed revolution abroad.

“In a Machiavellian sense, the Cubans changed,” he said. “They simply changed. They used to do it, and now they don’t do it.”

Authorities offered to let Potts return with the plane he hijacked to the United States, where air piracy charges awaited him.

Potts said he would face trial in Cuba.

“I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,” Potts said, recalling his brief court proceedings in Cuba. “I didn’t even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said ‘quince.’ I said, what is ‘quince?’ and my translator said 15 years. And I said, ‘15 years for who?’ And they said, ‘15 years for you.’ “

Even though he was sent to one of Cuba’s toughest prisons, where he regularly battled with other inmates and the guards, Potts never lost faith in the same revolution that had become his jailer.

“If you are not able to suffer for the cause, you are just a play revolutionary,” Potts said.

Potts served his time – 13½ years in prison and the rest under supervised release – and tried to fit into Cuban society with the pidgin Spanish he learned in prison.

His first marriage, to a Cuban, didn’t work out.

“That was a clash of cultures,” he explained. “I am Muslim, and she’s a santera.”

A second failed marriage produced two daughters: Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after the American fugitive also believed to be residing in Cuba whom the FBI added to its list of most wanted terrorists in May.

The girl’s mother, Aime, also a Cuban, said she didn’t realize her husband was naming their daughter after a fellow militant, convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper.

“He likes Japanese things, so I thought it was a Japanese name,” she said with a roll of her eyes.

Raising his two daughters, Potts said, made him realize how much he missed family in the United States and wanted his children to meet them.

He said he also needed to make amends and apologize in person to the passengers of the plane he hijacked.

Potts still considers himself a revolutionary but says that both he and the times have changed, and violence is no longer an acceptable way to bring about change.

“I regret taking the plane and putting those people’s lives in jeopardy,” he said. “I didn’t have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying.”

In 2009, Potts wrote President Barack Obama, requesting a pardon for the hijacking.

Hearing nothing back, Potts then wrote the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami to ask whether a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had served in Cuba.

“Fifteen years in a communist prison that’s been cited for human rights violations, I have paid my debts to society,” he said.

Potts again got no reply, but his daughters were given U.S. citizenship and passports.

Potts wanted to travel with them to the U.S. and in September said he offered to surrender and face the charges awaiting him in the United States.

Nearly six months later, his daughters have been living with relatives in the U.S. since December, but he is still waiting for an answer.

But without a renewed U.S. passport, Potts can’t join his girls.

Dozens of fugitives are believed to be living in Cuba, from convicted cop killers to Puerto Rican separatists to suspects in a South Florida Medicare fraud scheme.

The U.S. State Department has placed Cuba on the list of countries that support state terror, along with Iran and Syria, for providing a safe haven for fugitives from U.S. and international justice.

Potts is in all likelihood the only fugitive on the island offering to be tried.

“No one’s harboring me,” Potts countered. “I am trying to go back.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami said Potts has been indicted for the 1984 hijacking but would not comment on why his offers to surrender have gone unanswered."

Mr. Obama departed from his script at a health care event in California to try to reassure Americans that he had not abused government authority by collecting telephone call logs and foreigners’ e-mail messages. But the disclosure hours later of secret contingency planning to target other countries for possible cyberattacks made his get-together with President Xi Jinping later in the day all the more awkward because cyberattacks by the Chinese are high on the American agenda.

The latest of three documents published over three days by the British newspaper The Guardian added to the understanding of the Obama administration’s approach to national security in an age of multifaceted threats and became another factor in the renewed debate over the balance between privacy and security.

The identity of the person who gave those documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post is not known, but The Post has described its source as a career intelligence officer angry at “what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy” by the Obama administration."

In at least a dozen sexual assault cases since the president’s remarks at the White House in May, judges and defense lawyers have said that Mr. Obama’s words as commander in chief amounted to “unlawful command influence,” tainting trials as a result. Military law experts said that those cases were only the beginning and that the president’s remarks were certain to complicate almost all prosecutions for sexual assault.

“Unlawful command influence” refers to actions of commanders that could be interpreted by jurors as an attempt to influence a court-martial, in effect ordering a specific outcome. Mr. Obama, as commander in chief of the armed forces, is considered the most powerful person to wield such influence.

The president’s remarks might have seemed innocuous to civilians, but military law experts say defense lawyers will seize on the president’s call for an automatic dishonorable discharge, the most severe discharge available in a court-martial, arguing that his words will affect their cases."

http://news.yahoo.com/sen-rubio-says-immigration-deal-needs-tough-terms-164751016--politics.html,,[],Sen. Rubio says immigration deal needs tough terms,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan deal on immigration legislation would need tough enforcement and even stricter penalties for those who came to the United States illegally, a leading Republican at the center of negotiations said Sunday.

Sen. Marco Rubio, who's among the eight senators writing a plan that's expected to come out Tuesday, tried to promote and defend the framework for the emerging overhaul that would provide a path toward citizenship for those who came to the country illegally or overstayed their visit.

While the deal does include a long and difficult process for the 11 million individuals in question, Rubio insisted the proposal does not include an ""amnesty"" provision that fellow conservatives have called a deal-breaker.

""We're not awarding anybody anything. All we're doing is giving people the opportunity to eventually earn access to our new, improved and modernized legal immigration system,"" said Rubio, a Florida Republican and Cuban-American.

But among some of his fellow Republicans, there are serious doubts.

""I'm not convinced,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. ""I know Sen. Rubio's heart is exactly right. And I really respect the work of the 'Gang of Eight.' But they have produced legislation ... that will give amnesty now, legalize everyone that's here effectively today and then there's a promise of enforcement in the future.""

Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, added: ""The pathway to citizenship, right now, before those other elements are in place, is the deal-breaker for me.""

He said he could consider supporting the proposals only if the first priority were border security.

Rubio said he would abandon the overhaul effort if enforcement, border security and other elements are softened to his dissatisfaction.

With an eye on a possible White House run in 2016, Rubio has been careful not to appear weak on border security or create political problems among the conservatives who have great sway in picking the GOP's nominee.

Story continues

Rubio also told those immigrants that it would perhaps be easier if they returned to their home countries and started the process from scratch rather than use the process Rubio is proposing.

""So I would argue that the existing law is actually more lenient, that going back and waiting 10 years is going to be cheaper and faster that going through this process that we are outlining,"" he said.

Other lawmakers helping to write the legislation acknowledged the political challenges of the issue.

""A lot of my conservative colleagues have significant questions and they're legitimate,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""This is the start of a process, this is a vehicle that requires hearings, requires input and we welcome all of that. ... I am guardedly optimistic that we will see finally the end of this long, long trek that a lot of us have been on for many years.""

The measure would put millions who are in the U.S. illegally on a 13-year path to citizenship, while toughening border security requirements, mandating that all employers check the legal status of workers, and allowing tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country with new visa programs.

The legislation is expected to include a new emphasis on merit-based immigration over family ties.

""This is a very balanced bill. The American people have told us to do two things: one, prevent future flows of illegal immigration; and then, come up with a common-sense solution for legal immigration. And that's what our bill does,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

All of this, however, is contingent on the border security and enforcement, Rubio said.

""If you are undocumented here now, if you are illegally in the U.S., that you can't even apply for this until these plans are in place and they begin to implement them,"" Rubio said. ""And then you're going to have to pay a fine. You're going to have to pay an application fee. You're going to have to pass a background check.""

Without those pieces, the path to citizenship is unavailable, and the proposal is available only for those who arrived in the United States before Dec. 31, 2011. Anyone who came after that date would be subject to deportation.

Rubio pressed his case during interviews on ABC's ""This Week,"" CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" CNN's ""State of the Union"", ""Fox News Sunday"" and NBC's ""Meet the Press."" He also was booked on the Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision. Sessions and Schumer were on ABC while McCain appeared on CNN."

(CNN) - Republicans pushed forward in their criticism of Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday, standing by a new investigation of his comments at a congressional hearing about leaks.

Holder has come under fire for saying in the May 15 grilling on Capitol Hill that he has never been involved with the ""potential prosecution of the press,"" despite signing off on a 2010 warrant application that listed a Fox News reporter as a ""co-conspirator"" for receiving classified material from a government official.

""With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in or heard of or would think would be a wise policy,"" Holder said.

Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are focusing on that comment, now that the Justice Department has acknowledged it tracked Fox reporter Jay Rosen's e-mails and movements in and out of the State Department. The decision to apply for the search warrant was vetted at the department's highest levels, including Holder, a Justice Department official said.

Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, for example, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Holder's comments amount to ""a lie, by most people's standards.""

The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee announced last week it is now looking into whether Holder lied under oath when he made that statement, which came before news of the Justice Department's monitoring of Rosen but after news that the department had subpoenaed phone records of Associated Press reporters.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the judiciary committee, said Sunday it's giving Holder until Wednesday to ""answer some very pointed questions about the conflict between his testimony under oath.""

""Those remarks were made under oath,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But we also think it's very important that the attorney general be afforded the opportunity to respond. So we will wait to pass judgment on that until after we receive his response - unless, of course, he's not forthcoming with that.""

On the same program, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen said the ""whole thing reeks of hypocrisy.""

""It wasn't that long ago you had Republicans on Capitol Hill and a lot of folks on Fox going after the Obama administration saying, 'You're not getting to the bottom of these national security leaks.' It was nonstop for a while. Then the administration goes after these national leaks and people say, 'Oh, you can't do that,'"" he said.

Asked Sunday whether he thinks Holder lied, Issa said, ""It would be kind to say he misled Congress.""

""It would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people's standards,"" the House oversight committee chairman told CNN's chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley. ""By the American people's standard, you don't sign a warrant and then pretend you wouldn't know about it.""

""One of the things about perjury, this is the attorney general. Don't use perjury lightly,"" he added. ""Perjury is a criminal charge that has to be proven. But certainly it's hard to have confidence in what this attorney general says or his people say, when so often it turns out not to be true.""

Issa pointed to ""Fast and Furious,"" the botched firearm program in Mexico run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, saying Holder still hasn't provided answers about the controversy.

""This attorney general maliciously covered up and will not give us the facts as to when Congress was lied to in the Fast and Furious case,"" he said. ""So now when he does something similar, tries to cover up his tracks potentially as to a warrant he signed, am I surprised? No.""

Sen. John McCain also expressed a lack of confidence in Holder.

“The Attorney General has to ask himself the question, ‘Is he really able to effectively serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?’ That’s a decision he’d have to make,” McCain said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”

The FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails said there was probable cause the reporter had broken the law when he allegedly received a leaked classified report from a State Department contractor named Stephen Kim. The affidavit described Rosen as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the case involving Rosen and Fox News, and therefore it was ""self-evident"" that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was ""inaccurate.""

Implying that Republicans were playing politics on the matter, Carney said reporters should ""be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true."" Pressed further, he added that reporters were ""conflating a subpoena with prosecution.""

Asked if Obama still had full confidence in the attorney general, Carney replied: ""He absolutely does, yes.""

The Justice Department also released a statement late Thursday night, saying Holder did not lie in his May 15 testimony and that his comments were ""accurate and consistent with the facts."" An official said that prosecutors have never sought to bring criminal charges against Rosen, meaning Holder's testimony was accurate.

""The search warrant application in the Kim matter was focused on obtaining evidence relating to allegations that a government official had leaked highly classified information, which was a threat to our national security,"" the Justice official wrote. ""The warrant application was drafted during the investigation phase of the case, which came before any decisions about prosecution. And nearly three years after completing our thorough investigation of the Kim matter, the Department does not anticipate bringing any additional charges. During the Attorney General's tenure, no reporter has ever been prosecuted.""

If the bill is signed by the governor, it will be an important and long-overdue step forward that will enhance public safety.

Under AB 60, sponsored by Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), immigrants in California who learn the rules of the road, pass a driving test and provide whatever additional information the state Department of Motor Vehicles determines it needs will be eligible to receive a license to operate a car.

That would bring California in line with at least nine other states that have adopted similar measures. Since 1993, most immigrants living here illegally have been barred from obtaining California licenses (except for some young people who qualify for temporary federal work permits).

Already, critics of AB 60 are arguing that providing driver’s licenses to people who are in the United States illegally rewards them for breaking the law. But that’s putting politics before common sense.

AB 60 doesn’t condone illegal immigration. Rather, it recognizes the argument made by some law enforcement officials, including Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, that we are all safer if those immigrants who are currently driving without a license are taught to operate a car safely and are tested to ensure that they meet the same standards as other drivers. Licenses will also deter hit-and-run accidents by taking away one of the chief incentives to flee the scene.

Other critics are arguing that immigrants will use their new licenses as identification to commit voter fraud or to claim public benefits. In fact, the new license will carry explicit language noting that it confers only the right to drive a car, and doesn’t bestow any new legal rights or establish eligibility for employment or public benefits. Such language will also guarantee that California complies with the federal Real ID law, which requires states to verify the legal status of individuals when issuing driver’s licenses or other forms of identification.

California legislators deserve credit for passing this bill, which we hope Gov. Jerry Brown will sign. After that, we hope Congress will enact comprehensive immigration reform. By legalizing the status of most of the country’s undocumented immigrants, that would make the roads safer in all 50 states."

Rand Paul’s filibuster against the confirmation of CIA Director and “drone czar” John Brennan offers a “teachable moment” to the media and the left about the Tea Party. As they seethe in outrage and confusion that it took a Republican to question the constitutionality of drone attacks, it is important to remind our friends on the other side that it wasn’t just any Republican, but a–gasp!–Tea Party Republican who spoke “truth to power.”

Not only that, but the Senators who were first to offer their assistance were also Tea Party Republicans–the so-called McCarthyist Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco “Water Break” Rubio of Florida. All three of these Senators won their primary elections against candidates favored by the Republican establishment. All three have been attacked by the left and smeared as racist and extremist for belonging to the Tea Party. Yet without them, no one from either party would have questioned a policy that the left once saw as a dangerous abuse of executive power.

Only one Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, supported Paul. (Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois came to the floor very late in the game to offer a few challenging questions and formally end debate when Paul finally yielded.) Ryan Grim and Mollie Reilly of the Huffington Post observed: “…progressives who might have assumed to have been supportive were absent, leaving members of the GOP as the sole defenders of civil liberties. The White House was equally silent.” Some Democrats, notably Maxine Waters, even slammed Paul as “destructive.”

What many on the left and in the media have willfully failed to understand is that the Tea Party exists to defend the Constitution from unconstitutional encroachments on power and dangerous expansions in the size and cost of government. It did not merely arise in opposition to President Barack Obama; it had its roots in conservative outrage at the bailouts of the last months of George W. Bush’s presidency. At its core, the Tea Party is about American values, not Republican politics. It exists not to obstruct the Democrats but to restore the Constitution.

Rand Paul’s filibuster provided a useful contrast between the Tea Party and the GOP establishment. While Paul stood on the Senate floor, unable to leave the chamber to eat, a dozen other Republicans chose to dine with President Obama in a gesture of bipartisanship. (The contrast is not exact; a few Tea Party favorites attended the dinner, too, and joined Paul later in the Senate chamber.) It had already been hours since Wyden joined Paul’s protest, illustrating that true bipartisanship is forged on the basis of shared principles, not just political necessity.

Democrats and journalists like to describe the Tea Party as “hostage-takers,” holding Republican leaders and moderates in their thrall while they try to dismantle the government. But in reality it is the Washington elite that have taken the country hostage, forcing through expansions of government power and spending vast sums of money that the nation will struggle for generations to repay. The Tea Party represents the last chance to escape the zero-sum politics and economic stagnation that has plagued much of Europe for the last several years.

As Paul continued, liberals who once railed angrily against Bush were forced to confront the fecklessness of their own party. Hollywood’s John Cusack asked: “Where are the so-called progressive Democratic senators?” Meanwhile, the supposedly racist Tea Party Senator from Kentucky was leading the charge. It was not a political ploy for votes, or even an attempt to block one of President Obama’s nominees, which Paul acknowledged he would fail to do. It was just a stand on principle–which is what the Tea Party has been about all along."

USA TODAY

Julian Assange is lingering in Ecuador%27s embassy in London

Snowden has said he is hiding out in Hong Kong

Snowden has produced no information that U.S. programs were acting outside the law

LONDON — Could Edward Snowden pull a Julian Assange?

Snowden, the self-outed leaker of U.S. spying programs who says he is hiding out in Hong Kong, has expressed an interest in the news media to seek political asylum in Iceland.

But Iceland says he is missing a key element.

""The main stipulation for seeking asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start the process,"" said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik. ""That would be the ground rule No. 1.""

WikiLeaks founder Assange, who also made public reams of U.S. classified information, lost his attempt in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape charges. Apparently unable to flee the country, he ran to the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has remained for nearly a year.

He has asked for political asylum, which was granted, and Ecuador says the Australian native can remain in its embassy for as long as he wishes.

Quito granted Assange safe harbor on the grounds that were he to be extradited to Sweden he would swiftly be passed on to authorities in the U.S. who want him to face allegations he leaked tens of thousands of government cables in violation of the law.

Ecuador, whose president Rafael Correa is a leftist and ally of former Venezuela anti-American president Hugo Chavez, said the U.S. prosecution of Assange represents wrongful persecution for his political views, a justification for granting someone political asylum. The United Kingdom says he violated his bail by fleeing to an embassy and will be arrested and sent to Sweden if he leaves the building.

So Assange lingers on the United Kingdom's embassy row, at an estimated cost so far of around $5 million to Scotland Yard.

Pressed on whether there could ever be a scenario where Snowden could walk into an Icelandic embassy in Hong Kong or elsewhere and receive a degree of protection while applying for asylum, Tomasson conceded that advice or consultation could be sought that fell outside the asylum-application process.

But he wouldn't comment on the legal status of the person seeking such advice or consultation. In other words, he couldn't say whether Snowden would be on base while trying to get to base.

""The main rule is that the application starts when the person is in Iceland, "" Tomasson said. ""Anything beyond that would just be speculation.""

Iceland has a reputation for providing sanctuary to others. In 2005, Iceland offered citizenship to chess champion Bobby Fischer, who was wanted in the USA on charges of breaking international law by playing a chess match in Yugoslavia in 1992 when it was under sanction for atrocities.

Assange's Wikileaks has enjoyed legal protection in Iceland, and WikiLeaks says it is prepared to help Snowden.

Its spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said he wasn't entirely certain what tools would be available to the organization to come to the aid of a fellow outer of classified information.

Assange did not work for any government whose secrets he is accused of publishing illegally and to the detriment of operations trying to prevent America's enemies from attacking it. Snowden was, however. Wikileaks says what Snowden alleges he did amounts to ""whistle-blowing,"" a term generally regarded as the making public of illegal actions by the government.

Yet so far, Snowden has produced no information that the U.S. surveillance programs were acting outside the law. The Obama administration says the programs were legal, under the supervision of the U.S. court system and monitored by intelligence committees in Congress whose members have said the programs prevented terror attacks against Americans.

""We believe he (Snowden) is an important whistle-blower,"" Hrafnsson said.

Hrafnsson said that WikiLeaks is not in direct contact with the former CIA computer expert who when he fled was working for Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm that handles government work. He declined to comment on whether WikiLeaks has staff members in Hong Kong that could be put at Snowden's disposal, saying only, ""We are of course willing to assist in any way possible.""

About half had gathered to express their frustration with ongoing deportations of immigrants and with the immigration bill that is pending in Congress.



Some of the others waved red signs opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline. About a dozen abortion opponents also were gathered at the protest site, on the east side of the 700 block of South Michigan Avenue, with signs depicting aborted fetuses.



The protesters voiced a range of complaints against the president.



""I don't know what he has in his head to come in and fundraise for politicians a week after 50 schools got shut down in Chicago,"" said Esteban Burgoa, an Iraq war vet who was born in Mexico and carried a sign that urged an end to deportations, among other things. ""Why doesn't he raise money for the educators?""



The demonstration was organized in part by immigration activists, including Undocumented Illinois, a coalition of groups across the state that want deportations halted as Congress works out an immigration reform bill.



""We're seeing people that would qualify for the reform be deported and displaced,"" said Xanat Sobrevilla, 25, an organizer from Chicago Ridge. ""They are community members, they are parents, they are workers.""



Twelve protesters who were expressing that message were arrested earlier today after they staged a sit-in outside the hotel, Sobrevilla said.



The eight female and four male protesters were taken into custody a little after 9:45 a.m. after they blocked traffic and refused to move, said Police News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli.



They were expected to be charged with reckless conduct, obstructing or resisting the actions of a police officer, and obstructing a roadway, all misdemeanors, Mirabelli said.



Alfonso Seiva, of Pilsen, said he was there to ""remind Obama of the Latino people.""



""Nothing happened in the last four years and nothing is happening now,"" Seiva said as he held a large sign that said ""Stop Deportation.""



Others said they disapprove of the immigration bill under consideration in the Senate.



""We don't accept it; we believe it's not a just reform,"" said Vicki Cervantes, of the Coalition for Migrant Justice. ""It creates semi-legal status where people don't have full rights. It leaves people still vulnerable.""



Obama is in town for two fundraisers hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. After speaking at the Hilton this evening, he will attend the second fundraiser at a private residence.

Panetta is ending the ban on women serving in combat in the U.S. military, potentially opening up more than 200,000 positions on the front lines and possibly also jobs with elite commando units.

Pentagon officials said Wednesday that Panetta gave the armed services until 2016 to ask for special waivers if they believe any positions should remain closed to women.

The decision specifically overturns a 1994 rule that barred women from serving with smaller ground combat units.

Panetta’s decision was seen as a recognition of women’s contributions to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of the demand for troops, women often found themselves on the front lines serving as drivers, medics, mechanics and in other roles when commanders attached their units to combat battalions. They didn’t receive combat decorations or other special recognition, however.

The move will also help women climb the military ranks. Female service members have struggled to gain promotions in part because of their lack of combat experience; the Pentagon’s first four-star female general, Ann Dunwoody, wasn’t promoted until 2008.

The Pentagon took an initial step in February when it opened 14,000 combat-related jobs, mostly in the Army, to female service members. The new policy would open up to women more than 200,000 combat jobs, including in Army and Marine infantry units.

Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove), a member of the House Armed Services Committee and founder of the Women in the Military Caucus, praised Panetta’s decision. He is expected to step down next month, and a Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled next week for Chuck Hagel, whom President Obama has nominated as the next Pentagon chief.

“I have been a firm believer in removing the archaic combat exclusion policy for many years,” Sanchez said in a statement. “I am happy to hear the secretary will be making significant changes as part of an effort to expand opportunities for women in the military.”

U.S. Atty. Carmen Ortiz indicated in a news conference Friday night that investigators planned to question Tsarnaev without the standard reminder of his rights to remain silent and to request a lawyer. That could make him the first test of a two-year-old Justice Department policy expanding emergency exemptions when questioning terrorism suspects.

Ortiz’s statement brought criticism from the left and right. Civil libertarians said the decision would erode civil liberties for everyone. But some Republicans said that it did not go far enough, and that Tsarnaev should be treated as an enemy combatant.

“The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans,” Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said in a joint statement. Conservatives have long demanded that terrorism suspects not be tried in federal courts.

Ortiz invoked a newly expanded version of the so-called public safety exception to Miranda warnings. The Supreme Court formulated the warnings in 1966 and created a public safety exception in 1980, saying police could interrogate suspects, and use their statements against them, if the lives of police or the public were in danger.

In 2011, after intense criticism of the Justice Department’s handling of the so-called “underwear bomber,” the department expanded the use of the public safety exception in domestic terrorism cases so that it could be invoked in exceptional circumstances even when there was not an imminent safety threat. The changes were made after the suspect in the Dec. 25, 2009, airline bombing attempt, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was questioned for less than an hour before being read his rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement that “every criminal defendant” is entitled to the Miranda warning, noting that Tsarnaev became a naturalized American citizen: “The public safety exception should be read narrowly. It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule.... Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.”

Neal K. Katyal, professor of national security law at Georgetown University and acting solicitor general of the U.S. from May 2010 to June 2011, said invoking the exemption seemed “absolutely appropriate” in this case.

“At least right now, it is right for law enforcement not to be so concerned with self-incrimination and to be more concerned with gathering intelligence,” Katyal said.

The Miranda issue may turn out to be less than crucial. Between the videotape allegedly showing Tsarnaev setting down the bag at the marathon, the shootout with police in which his brother died, and evidence police reportedly found in his apartment, prosecutors probably have a strong case already.

But Graham and McCain said Tsarnaev should stay out of the courts altogether. “We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives,” they said. “The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now.”

Legal experts said there was no basis to treat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev under the law of war because investigators had disclosed no evidence that he was acting on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization.

“With all due respect to the senators, the absence of a relationship to Al Qaeda is absolutely fatal to any ability to subject them to noncivilian trials,” said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at American University.

“Are we really going to entertain the idea that whenever we have a big bomb go off in America the first thing that happens is the military takes over? Is that what we really want?” said Bobby Chesney, professor of national security law at the University of Texas School of Law, in a telephone interview.

Special for USA TODAY

Mohammed Morsi%2C the country%27s first democratically elected leader%2C was arrested by the military

Mansour will serve as president until elections are held at an undetermined date

Mansour helped draft the presidential elections laws that saw Morsi elected in 2012

CAIRO — A big question circulating in Egypt today: Who is Adly Mansour?

The answer: a little-known constitutional judge appointed years ago by ousted former president Hosni Mubarak who has now been drafted to serve as Egypt's interim president.

Another big question: Will Mansour be a puppet for the military leadership that put him in power?

Mansour was sworn in Thursday after deposed president Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, was ousted and placed under arrest by the military.

Mansour assumed the job under a transitional plan that appointed the head of the country's High Constitutional Court as interim president.

Mansour became head of the court June 30 after the former chief judge retired. The judge will serve in the post of president until elections are held, a date undetermined so far.

Now, the spotlight is shining on a man about whom little is known.

""Yesterday was the first time I heard his name,"" said Marwa Farid, 30, a democratic activist. ""I'm hopeful he'll be inclusive of all members of society after what we've been through over the past year.""

Mansour, 67, was born in Cairo and graduated from Cairo University with a law degree in 1967. He had been deputy chief justice since 1992.

Mohammed Hamed El Gamal, former head of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, described Mansour as a ""fair man"" committed only to the ""constitution and the law"" in an interview with al Shabab, part of the Egyptian news organization Al-Ahram.

Mansour helped draft the presidential election laws that saw Morsi elected in 2012, according to Al-Ahram.

On Thursday, Mansour praised the recent street demonstrations that led to the ouster of Morsi, saying, ""I offer my greetings to the revolutionary people of Egypt.""

Some analysts expect Mansour to be a figurehead for the military, which will retain power over the government.

""The military is just going to be pulling the strings,"" said Shashank Joshi, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. ""That means the international community has to push very hard to make sure the constitution drafting process is inclusive and fair and credible and doesn't try to exclude Islamists from the process.""

Other analysts weren't so sure the military wants to weigh back into politics, which provoked public outrage when it ruled after ousting Mubarak and until Morsi's election a year ago.

Military leaders ""know what a thankless task it is,"" said Firas Abi Ali, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS in London. ""I think the military is doing its best not to present itself as governing directly but to put forward a civilian face. The objective is not to present this as a military takeover of power.""

However, he added, the military has always been influential in Egypt. ""If you look at the structure of public services, you find retired military men in all sorts of positions, so they have a lot of influence over bureaucracy,"" he said.

Activist Gigi Ibrahim, who has fought to achieve the revolution's goals since the uprising against Hosni Mubarak in 2011, said it is too soon to judge the interim president.

""If he will fulfill the people's and revolution's demands and what we agreed on — this road map that was set — that's great, but I know this won't happen easily,"" said Ibrahim, who belongs to the Revolutionary Socialists group in Egypt.

""There needs to be a lot of pressure, with people continuously protesting to ensure these demands are fulfilled, and they're not going to happen on their own,"" she added. ""Whether (Mansour) will fulfill the demands of the people or not is what will determine whether he is a good president or a bad one.""

Mrs. King carried on her husband’s civil rights activism after he was assassinated.

In a 1991 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Coretta Scott King and other black community leaders argued that illegal immigration would have a devastating impact on the black community. At the time, Hatch was working his U.S. Senate position to undo some enforcement measures laid out in Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty agreement, attempting to weaken interior enforcement and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens.

We, the undersigned members of the Black Leadership Forum, write to urge you to postpone introduction of your employer sanctions repeal legislation until we have had an opportunity to report to you what we believe to be the devastating impact the repeal would have on the economic condition of un- and semi-skilled workers–a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Hispanic; and until we have had the opportunity to propose to you and to our Hispanic brothers and sisters, what we believe could be a number of effective means of eliminating the discrimination occasioned by employer sanctions, without losing the protection sanctions provide for U.S. workers, especially minority workers.

While the members of the Black Leadership Forum wrote they had “divergent views” at the time on the employer sanctions regarding illegal immigration, they wrote they were “united in three respects.”

First, they wrote they were united in being “fully committed to the elimination of the root causes of national origin discrimination under the Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) [Reagan’s amnesty], as well as discriminatory impact.”

Second, they said they stood together in their belief that “there are a number of effective ways to remedy discrimination resulting from IRCA, without tampering with employer sanctions. Some measures we support are contained in the Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on IRCA-Related Discimination and in the 1990 GAO Report on Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and Question of Discrimination.”

Third, the writers said they were unanimous in their request for a discussion with Hatch and other members of Congress on “the importance of employer sanctions to the economic security of African Americans and Hispanic workers.”

The black leaders wrote that they feared lack of interior immigration enforcement would lead to future illegal immigration, and the hiring of those illegal immigrants into jobs that could be occupied by black and Hispanic American citizens.

“We are concerned, Senator Hatch, that your proposed remedy to the employer sanctions-based discrimination, namely, the elimination of employer sanctions, will cause another problem–the revival of the pre-1986 discrimination against black and brown U.S. and documented workers, in favor of cheap labor–the undocumented workers,” they wrote. “This would undoubtedly exacerbate an already severe economic crisis in communities where there are large numbers of new immigrants.”

Coretta Scott King and the other black leaders added that they were “concerned that some who support the repeal of employer sanctions are using ‘discrimination’ as a guise for their desire to abuse undocumented workers and to introduce cheap labor into the U.S. workforce.”

America does not have a labor shortage. With roughly 7 million people unemployed, and double that number discouraged from seeking work, the removal of employer sanctions threatens to add additional U.S. workers to the rolls and drive down wages. Moreover, the repeal of employer sanctions will inevitably add to our social problems and place an unfair burden on the poor in the cities in which most new immigrants cluster–cities which are already suffering housing shortages and insufficient human needs services.

The black leaders then called for education reform to train American workers for jobs, rather than immigration reform to bring in foreigners to fill those jobs while American workers suffered. “Senator Hatch, we believe that what this country needs is not to prematurely scrap employer sanctions, but rather, we need education and training programs designed to prepare the unemployed, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and others at great risk, to meet the market demands of tomorrow,” they wrote.

The authors added that while “not a panacea for the nation’s illegal immigration problems, employer sanctions are one necessary means of stopping the exploitation of vulnerable workers and the undercutting of American jobs and living standards.”"

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Proposal seeks to fine tech companies for noncompliance with wiretap orders,"A government task force is preparing legislation that would pressure companies such as Face­book and Google to enable law enforcement officials to intercept online communications as they occur, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the effort.

Driven by FBI concerns that it is unable to tap the Internet communications of terrorists and other criminals, the task force’s proposal would penalize companies that failed to heed wiretap orders — court authorizations for the government to intercept suspects’ communications.

Rather than antagonizing companies whose cooperation they need, federal officials typically back off when a company is resistant, industry and former officials said. But law enforcement officials say the cloak drawn on suspects’ online activities — what the FBI calls the “going dark” problem — means that critical evidence can be missed.

“The importance to us is pretty clear,” Andrew Weissmann, the FBI’s general counsel, said last month at an American Bar Association discussion on legal challenges posed by new technologies. “We don’t have the ability to go to court and say, ‘We need a court order to effectuate the intercept.’ Other countries have that. Most people assume that’s what you’re getting when you go to a court.”

There is currently no way to wiretap some of these communications methods easily, and companies effectively have been able to avoid complying with court orders. While the companies argue that they have no means to facilitate the wiretap, the government, in turn, has no desire to enter into what could be a drawn-out contempt proceeding.

Under the draft proposal, a court could levy a series of escalating fines, starting at tens of thousands of dollars, on firms that fail to comply with wiretap orders, according to persons who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. A company that does not comply with an order within a certain period would face an automatic judicial inquiry, which could lead to fines. After 90 days, fines that remain unpaid would double daily.

Instead of setting rules that dictate how the wiretap capability must be built, the proposal would let companies develop the solutions as long as those solutions yielded the needed data. That flexibility was seen as inevitable by those crafting the proposal, given the range of technology companies that might receive wiretap orders. Smaller companies would be exempt from the fines.

The proposal, however, is likely to encounter resistance, said industry officials and privacy advocates.

“This proposal is a non-starter that would drive innovators overseas and cost American jobs,” said Greg Nojeim, a senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which focuses on issues of privacy and security. “They might as well call it the Cyber Insecurity and Anti-Employment Act.”

The Obama administration has not yet signed off on the proposal. Justice Department, FBI and White House officials declined to comment. Still, Weissmann said at the ABA discussion that the issue is the bureau’s top legislative priority this year, but he declined to provide details about the proposal.

Increased urgency

The issue of online surveillance has taken on added urgency with the explosion of social media and chat services and the proliferation of different types of online communication. Technology firms are seen as critical sources of information about crime and terrorism suspects.

“Today, if you’re a tech company that’s created a new and popular way to communicate, it’s only a matter of time before the FBI shows up with a court order to read or hear some conversation,” said Michael Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie’s Washington office who represents technology firms. “If the data can help solve crimes, the government will be interested.”

Some technology companies have developed a wiretap capability for some of their services. But a range of communications companies and services are not required to do so under what is known as CALEA, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Among those services are social media networks and the chat features on online gaming sites.

Former officials say the challenge for investigators was exacerbated in 2010, when Google began end-to-end encryption of its e-mail and text messages after its networks were hacked. Facebook followed suit. That made it more difficult for the FBI to intercept e-mail by serving a court order on the Internet service provider, whose pipes would carry the encrypted traffic.

The proposal would make clear that CALEA extends to Internet phone calls conducted between two computer users without going through a central company server — what is sometimes called “peer-to-peer” communication. But the heart of the proposal would add a provision to the 1968 Wiretap Act that would allow a court to levy fines.

Challenges abound

One former senior Justice Department official, who is not privy to details of the draft proposal, said law enforcement officials are not seeking to expand their surveillance authorities. Rather, said Kenneth L. Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security from 2006 to 2008, officials are seeking “to make sure their existing authorities can be applied across the full range of communications technologies.”

Proponents say adding an enforcement provision to the 1968 Wiretap Act is a more politically palatable way of achieving that goal than by amending CALEA to redefine what types of companies should be covered. Industry and privacy experts, including some former government officials, are skeptical.

“There will be widespread disagreement over what the law requires,” said Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at Perkins Coie’s flagship Seattle office who represents telecommunications companies. “It takes companies into a court process over issues that don’t belong in court but rather in standards bodies with technical expertise.”

Some experts said a few companies will resist because they believe they might lose customers who have privacy concerns. Google, for instance, prides itself on protecting its search service from law enforcement surveillance, though it might comply in other areas, such as e-mail. And Skype has lost some of its cachet as a secure communications alternative now that it has been bought by Microsoft and is reportedly complying with wiretap orders.

Susan Landau, a former Sun Microsystems distinguished engineer, has argued that wiring in an intercept capability will increase the likelihood that a company’s servers will be hacked. “What you’ve done is created a way for someone to silently go in and activate a wiretap,” she said. Traditional phone communications were susceptible to illicit surveillance as a result of the 1994 law, she said, but the problem “becomes much worse when you move to an Internet or computer-based network.”

Marcus Thomas, former assistant director of the FBI’s Operational Technology Division, said good software coders can create an intercept capability that is secure. “But to do so costs money,” he said, noting the extra time and expertise needed to develop, test and operate such a service.

A huge challenge, officials agree, is how to gain access to peer-to-peer communications. Another challenge is making sense of encrypted communications.

Thomas said officials need to strike a balance between the needs of law enforcement and those of the technology companies.

“You want to give law enforcement the ability to have the data they’re legally entitled to get, at the same time not burdening industry and not opening up security holes,” he said."

He and three other Republican lawmakers declared — without the benefit of evidence — that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be considered an enemy combatant, not a criminal, and should be held by the military without access to a lawyer or the fundamental rights that distinguish this country from authoritarian regimes.

Mr. Graham’s reckless statement makes a mockery of the superb civilian police work that led to the suspect’s capture, starting with a skillful analysis of video recordings of the marathon. The law enforcement system solved the case swiftly and efficiently, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police, and as shocking as the attack was, there is no reason civilian prosecutors, defense lawyers and courts cannot continue to do their work — especially since they have proved themselves far better at it than the military.

Mr. Tsarnaev is a naturalized American citizen, an inconvenient fact for the pressure-him-at-Gitmo crowd. He cannot be tried in a military commission, a legal system reserved for aliens. Even to be held by the military without trial would require a showing that he is associated with a declared enemy of the United States, such as Al Qaeda or the Taliban. So far there isn’t any visible connection between the Tsarnaev brothers and anyone more malevolent. Their Islamic or Chechen heritage alone is hardly proof of jihadist intent.

Fortunately the Obama administration has ignored the posturing and declared that Mr. Tsarnaev, like all citizens and even alien terrorists captured on American soil, will be tried in the federal courts. He will soon be charged with terrorism under federal statutes, and will be represented by the federal public defender’s office."

The A.P. said that the Justice Department informed it on Friday that law enforcement officials had obtained the records for more than 20 telephone lines of its offices and journalists, including their home phones and cellphones. It said the records were seized without notice sometime this year.

The organization was not told the reason for the seizure. But the timing and the specific journalistic targets strongly suggested they are related to a continuing government investigation into the leaking of information a year ago about the Central Intelligence Agency’s disruption of a Yemen-based terrorist plot to bomb an airliner.

The disclosures began with an Associated Press article on May 7, 2012, breaking the news of the foiled plot; the organization had held off publishing it for several days at the White House’s request because the intelligence operations were still unfolding."

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Proposal seeks to fine tech companies for noncompliance with wiretap orders,"A government task force is preparing legislation that would pressure companies such as Face­book and Google to enable law enforcement officials to intercept online communications as they occur, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the effort.

Driven by FBI concerns that it is unable to tap the Internet communications of terrorists and other criminals, the task force’s proposal would penalize companies that failed to heed wiretap orders — court authorizations for the government to intercept suspects’ communications.

Rather than antagonizing companies whose cooperation they need, federal officials typically back off when a company is resistant, industry and former officials said. But law enforcement officials say the cloak drawn on suspects’ online activities — what the FBI calls the “going dark” problem — means that critical evidence can be missed.

“The importance to us is pretty clear,” Andrew Weissmann, the FBI’s general counsel, said last month at an American Bar Association discussion on legal challenges posed by new technologies. “We don’t have the ability to go to court and say, ‘We need a court order to effectuate the intercept.’ Other countries have that. Most people assume that’s what you’re getting when you go to a court.”

There is currently no way to wiretap some of these communications methods easily, and companies effectively have been able to avoid complying with court orders. While the companies argue that they have no means to facilitate the wiretap, the government, in turn, has no desire to enter into what could be a drawn-out contempt proceeding.

Under the draft proposal, a court could levy a series of escalating fines, starting at tens of thousands of dollars, on firms that fail to comply with wiretap orders, according to persons who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. A company that does not comply with an order within a certain period would face an automatic judicial inquiry, which could lead to fines. After 90 days, fines that remain unpaid would double daily.

Instead of setting rules that dictate how the wiretap capability must be built, the proposal would let companies develop the solutions as long as those solutions yielded the needed data. That flexibility was seen as inevitable by those crafting the proposal, given the range of technology companies that might receive wiretap orders. Smaller companies would be exempt from the fines.

The proposal, however, is likely to encounter resistance, said industry officials and privacy advocates.

“This proposal is a non-starter that would drive innovators overseas and cost American jobs,” said Greg Nojeim, a senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which focuses on issues of privacy and security. “They might as well call it the Cyber Insecurity and Anti-Employment Act.”

The Obama administration has not yet signed off on the proposal. Justice Department, FBI and White House officials declined to comment. Still, Weissmann said at the ABA discussion that the issue is the bureau’s top legislative priority this year, but he declined to provide details about the proposal.

Increased urgency

The issue of online surveillance has taken on added urgency with the explosion of social media and chat services and the proliferation of different types of online communication. Technology firms are seen as critical sources of information about crime and terrorism suspects.

“Today, if you’re a tech company that’s created a new and popular way to communicate, it’s only a matter of time before the FBI shows up with a court order to read or hear some conversation,” said Michael Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie’s Washington office who represents technology firms. “If the data can help solve crimes, the government will be interested.”

Some technology companies have developed a wiretap capability for some of their services. But a range of communications companies and services are not required to do so under what is known as CALEA, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Among those services are social media networks and the chat features on online gaming sites.

Former officials say the challenge for investigators was exacerbated in 2010, when Google began end-to-end encryption of its e-mail and text messages after its networks were hacked. Facebook followed suit. That made it more difficult for the FBI to intercept e-mail by serving a court order on the Internet service provider, whose pipes would carry the encrypted traffic.

The proposal would make clear that CALEA extends to Internet phone calls conducted between two computer users without going through a central company server — what is sometimes called “peer-to-peer” communication. But the heart of the proposal would add a provision to the 1968 Wiretap Act that would allow a court to levy fines.

Challenges abound

One former senior Justice Department official, who is not privy to details of the draft proposal, said law enforcement officials are not seeking to expand their surveillance authorities. Rather, said Kenneth L. Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security from 2006 to 2008, officials are seeking “to make sure their existing authorities can be applied across the full range of communications technologies.”

Proponents say adding an enforcement provision to the 1968 Wiretap Act is a more politically palatable way of achieving that goal than by amending CALEA to redefine what types of companies should be covered. Industry and privacy experts, including some former government officials, are skeptical.

“There will be widespread disagreement over what the law requires,” said Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at Perkins Coie’s flagship Seattle office who represents telecommunications companies. “It takes companies into a court process over issues that don’t belong in court but rather in standards bodies with technical expertise.”

Some experts said a few companies will resist because they believe they might lose customers who have privacy concerns. Google, for instance, prides itself on protecting its search service from law enforcement surveillance, though it might comply in other areas, such as e-mail. And Skype has lost some of its cachet as a secure communications alternative now that it has been bought by Microsoft and is reportedly complying with wiretap orders.

Susan Landau, a former Sun Microsystems distinguished engineer, has argued that wiring in an intercept capability will increase the likelihood that a company’s servers will be hacked. “What you’ve done is created a way for someone to silently go in and activate a wiretap,” she said. Traditional phone communications were susceptible to illicit surveillance as a result of the 1994 law, she said, but the problem “becomes much worse when you move to an Internet or computer-based network.”

Marcus Thomas, former assistant director of the FBI’s Operational Technology Division, said good software coders can create an intercept capability that is secure. “But to do so costs money,” he said, noting the extra time and expertise needed to develop, test and operate such a service.

A huge challenge, officials agree, is how to gain access to peer-to-peer communications. Another challenge is making sense of encrypted communications.

Thomas said officials need to strike a balance between the needs of law enforcement and those of the technology companies.

“You want to give law enforcement the ability to have the data they’re legally entitled to get, at the same time not burdening industry and not opening up security holes,” he said."

Williams Joined The Network As A Contributor In']",Meet the new face of immigration reform,"Adriana Garcia, 21, is about to become a very unusual poster girl for immigration reform.

Beginning this week Ms. Garcia and the American flag appear in an on-line advertisement for immigration reform called “The Pledge.”

Garcia is one of more than a dozen undocumented young people appearing in the advertisement and holding up their hands as they say the pledge of allegiance to the U.S. flag.

Since she left Mexico and arrived in Arizona at age 10 Ms. Garcia has put her hand over heart every day in school and pledged allegiance “to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”

Garcia is not a U.S. citizen. The only reason she can show her face without fear of trouble is because President Obama ordered federal immigration authorities not to deport “Dreamers,” high school and college students who lack legal immigration status.

More On This...

She calls the U.S. her country and she calls the American flag her flag.

But her American identity has no legal standing. Her parents, who have been in Arizona since the early 1990s, don’t have any legal status at all.

None of the other young people in the on-line advertisements are American citizens. But all of them grew up in the U.S. happily pledging their oath to the red, white and blue flag of a country they call home.

But they have been ignored failed to move immigration reform under President Bush, a Republican, and President Obama, a Democrat.

Garcia, a junior marketing major at Grand Canyon State University who worked as a congressional intern this year, agreed to appear in the advertisement to reach out to American citizens and ask them to insist Congress take immediate action on reforming the immigration broken immigration system.

The symbol in the ad is an open hand of the kind lift to their hearts when they recite the pledge of allegiance.

“The immigration rights movement doesn’t have a symbol,” said Jose Antonio Vargas, another undocumented immigrant who has been saying the pledge of allegiance since he was 12. Now 32 he has written for several American newspapers, won a Pulitzer Prize, and founded the pro-immigration reform group ‘Define American.’ His feature length documentary on his life as a child without citizenship papers will debut on television next year.

But he still lacks citizenship.

“We want the symbol of the pledge hand to unify U.S. citizens and undocumented people in the fight for immigration reform,” said Vargas. “Looking at American history we know that in the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, and the gay rights movement it was crucial to attract allies from all parts of American life. Those movements took off when everyone got involved.”

Garcia, a Girl Scout, has two sisters, 13 and 9, who are citizens because they were born in the U.S.

“I hope people who don’t feel involved with immigration reform take a look at the video and see themselves in a group of all-around American young people who say the pledge but don’t have citizenship,” said Garcia. “If they get involved it will strengthen the movement.”

The only hope remaining for the immigration reform movement is that the House of Representatives will take up the issue in early 2014 before mid-term elections. The Senate passed an immigration bill last summer but the House has taken no action.

Once 2014 primary campaigns begin in Republican congressional districts it will be difficult, if not impossible, for Republican Congressmen to support any reforms without fear of being attacked by GOP primary opponents as soft on criminals.

But this Christmas the happy, welcome symbol of an open hand -- ready to pledge allegiance with other Americans – is Ms. Garcia’s gift to efforts to bring all Americans together and get the House to finally to take action on immigration reform."

(Updated)","If you've been following current events in North Carolina you know the recently empowered GOP legislature (and GOP governor) have been on a roll to slash and burn healthcare, unemployment benefits, taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and more. Yesterday they attached, and passed in the Senate, a very restrictive abortion clause to a bill about ""Sharia Law."" (This particularly odious action was cleverly designed to hopefully pass below the horizon of public view and opinion, but did not...although the protestors were told to be quiet because the only voices that mattered were those of the Senators.)

In response, thousands of North Carolinians have gone to the capital building to peacefully protest. Hundreds have been arrested...booked, finger-printed...mug shots...the whole banana. These are the Moral Monday protestors we're talking about...good citizens from all walks of life.

Lo and behold, the Civitas Institute..a right-wing ""think tank"" and public policy influence organization founded and financed by Gazillionaire retailer Art Pope...who is also the appointed NC Budget Director...immediately put up several web pages with all the collected info on the arrested protestors.

You can see it here, but I ask that you read on before going back to the Civitas site...

http://www.nccivitas.org/...

When you do visit this steaming pile of crap, be sure to page through the various options to see how they've turned intimidation into a game.

So...you're a good citizen peacefully protesting...you're arrested for trespassing...and now here you are on the intertoobs...your name, address, sex, age, race, party, occupation, employer, salary if available, alleged voter registration violation (address not matching registration)....etc. There has been some speculation as to just how the Civitas folks were able to get all the data so rapidly...implying possible cooperation from someone in government.

Now, just for fun, imagine if the Civitas folks had all your postal, internet, email, and financial ""meta data"" and they listed some carefully selected magazines you subscribe to..web sites you visit...places where you've made purchases and how much you spent, you name it. Innocent or not...and none of their business...they could twist this to make anyone look like whatever they choose.

John Q. Smith...subscribes to xyz magazine, spent money at the xyz club, was delinquent on property taxes last year, buys books on the following subjects...mother in nursing home under medicaid yet purchased a $900 xyz last week....sends emails twice a week to woman in Soviet Union... You name it... A totally misleading picture could be constructed to try someone in the court of public opinion. Doesn't matter if the magazine is Playboy or Forbes, the club is a ""gentlemans club"" or a golf club...it all depends on the story they're trying to construct for their audience. Heck, they could make someone look bad or suspicious for darn near anything...and it's none of their damn business even if technology has made it available.

Now...go look at the Civitas stuff. Then decide whether or not you want to let the government, and by association those entities involved with the government or politics ...who might not like you for some reason....to have unfettered, unjustified, and pervasive access to your daily life and activities.

BTW...when some NC activists used the Civitas' listing of their directors and employees and constructed a compilation of their names and addresses, etc., on the web...Civitas immediately removed the names of their people from their web site... Gee...probably because that was uncalled for and invasive.

***UPDATE: Thank you allowing me on the Rec List. What's happening in North Carolina is beyond despicable. The GOP and their allies are using every dirty trick they can to ram thru their regressive legislation...and they ARE stooping to intimidation by use of both personal data and law enforcement. They make the rules...you break 'em...jail or intimidation for you...or both. Young people here want to help, but arrest records don't portend well for their future."

Jim DeMint, the new president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, ripped the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” U.S. Senators who are pushing immigration reform during the debut of Breitbart News Sunday with Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius/XM Patriot on Sunday night.

“That’s not the way it should be done, where people go behind closed doors and come up with something that we still haven’t seen,” DeMint said.

They’re out there selling it. We don’t know what the legislation is but we’re supposed to have an open, democratic process where people can hear the debate, they can see amendments, they can find out what’s in the bill before it’s voted on. So, it’s very frustrating. Obviously, this isn’t the first time this has happened–on the fiscal cliff, and on all these other things they do backroom deals. But I’m tired of it. Frankly, it’s one of the reasons I left the Senate: to try to change things from the outside in. But I know some of these folks involved [in the Gang of Eight] are actually trying to solve a problem, but this is not the way to do it.

DeMint said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is one of those he thinks is actually trying to solve the problem of illegal immigration but is going about it the wrong way–mainly because the way Washington has evolved is antithetical to transparent and open government.

“Well this is hard because Marco is one of my best friends in the Senate and he’s a great guy, very genuine, and I know he got into this process trying to solve a problem,” DeMint said when asked for his reaction to Rubio’s whirlwind media tour this weekend, in which the Florida Republican appeared on a record seven Sunday shows.

“He’s just dealing with some folks who have a political objective and it’s very difficult,” DeMint explained. “So, I don’t blame him for trying to sell what’s in it, I’ve just encouraged him from the very beginning to make sure he knows what’s in the legislation and make sure we get what we need out of a new immigration system before we agree to make citizens out of 11 million people.”

The eight senators–Republicans Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Bob Menendez, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, and Michael Bennet–have been meeting in secret since January trying to craft a plan for comprehensive immigration reform.

White House officials have been involved in the drafting of the legislation, as have representatives from special interest groups like the powerful AFL-CIO labor union and the big business lobby the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from groups in favor of law enforcement reform, like the president of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents’ union Chris Crane, have been kept out of the discussion, as has anyone opposed to granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

DeMint claimed that the reason those senators keep the deal-making happening in secret is because their plan cannot stand up to public scrutiny. “One of the reasons you do all this behind closed doors is because you don’t want any critics at the party,” DeMint said.

You want to bring this out and surprise people and do your pre-selling. But, Robert Rector, just about five years ago, when I was helping to fight a similar bill, provided information that was not only credible but it was very provable that there is a high cost to have amnesty. There is a high cost to have unregulated immigration and we need to go ahead. Americans are going to look at this very differently if they know it’s likely to mean they’re going to cut their Social Security and Medicare and raise their taxes which the president seems to be talking about every week.

Heritage Foundation analyst Robert Rector is in the final stages of wrapping up what is expected to be a bombshell analysis breaking down the entire cost of the Gang of Eight’s immigration reform proposal. Preliminary estimates from Rector’s and Senate Budget Committee Republican staff analyses put the Gang of Eight plan at just under $3 trillion in entitlement spending increases, but the final analysis may put the number much higher.

As the Heritage Foundation continues its work on this, the conservative hallmark has taken heat from several groups around Washington for the forthcoming report–largely because the Heritage report could very well be the poison pill that kills immigration reform.

The libertarian Cato Institute and the GOP establishment-minded Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s group, have become unlikely allies, banding together to attack the still-unpublished Heritage analysis from Rector.

During his media tour this weekend, Rubio himself stabbed at Heritage, saying on Fox News Sunday that Rector’s forthcoming analysis was not accurate. DeMint said he trusts Rector, and added that this report coming out “shouldn’t be controversial.”

“Those who don’t think this has been done correctly should show us their analysis,” DeMint said. “The fact is, there is not any other analysis. Robert Rector has been a scholar for years. He was the one who did the data that actually ended up pushing through welfare reform back in the 1990s,” he explained. “He came out with data that was irrefutable five years ago [on immigration costs], although some are saying it needs to be combined with other types of research.”

DeMint argued that the report should be a point of open analysis of the plan: “Let’s talk about it. But let’s at least consider the cost. We hope we’ll have our report out within the next week. We’ll be writing and speaking about it a lot but Americans need to understand there’s nothing free about the proposal that’s being talked about.”

As the bill is set to be released on Tuesday, DeMint urged Americans and those in the media to “keep in mind that even if it’s in legislation that does not mean the administration will do it.”

“Over five years we passed into law that there had to be 700 miles of double layer fencing along the volatile areas of our southern border,” DeMint said. “But President Obama has ignored the law.”

There are only 30 something miles of double layer fencing that have actually been built. The law says that the federal government should support states in the enforcement of federal immigration policy, this administration has decided not to do it. So my point is this: if they promise legal status or citizenship in return for the future fixing of the immigration system, no one can count on that. That’s why this needs to be a step-by-step process where we fix the system first and earn the trust of the American people, then we consider what we’re going to do with those who are already here.

But as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) noted in a Sunday afternoon press release, the Gang of Eight senators admitted throughout their Sunday show blitzkrieg that they want to do amnesty first, then reform the immigration system later."

Three secret court opinions%2C other classified NSA documents released to the public

Official says documents reveal %22effective self-policing%22 at the NSA

Problems involving %22upstream collection%22 led to NSA scooping up thousands of e-mails from U.S. accounts

WASHINGTON — The nation's top intelligence official on Wednesday declassified three secret U.S. court opinions and other classified documents that reveal how the National Security Agency intercepted thousands of e-mails from Americans with no connection to terrorism.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper authorized the release and the agency published the documents on a newly created Tumblr page dubbed IC on the Record.

The latest revelations come amid growing criticism from members of Congress and privacy groups about the NSA surveillance programs and charges that the agency has far overstepped its bounds in collecting information on U.S. citizens. There are already bipartisan efforts in Congress to rein in the programs and increase oversight of the intelligence agencies.

The declassification of documents also follows President Obama's call on Clapper in June to release more information about U.S. surveillance programs in response to public outcry, triggered by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's leaking of details of previously secret intelligence gathering programs.

Some of the documents shine a harsh light on how the NSA operated.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, authorized to oversee surveillance requests, first learned in 2011 of problems involving ""upstream collection"" that led to the intelligence community unlawfully scooping up thousands of emails from U.S. accounts over a three-year period. One opinion shows that the NSA reported to the FISA court in 2011 that it inadvertently collected as many as 56,000 Internet communications by Americans with no connection to terrorism.

In the strongly worded 86-page opinion, U.S. District Judge John Bates, who was then the court's chief judge, wrote that the ""volume and nature of the information it has been collecting is fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe.""

Bates blasted the NSA for mishandling thousands of e-mails from Americans over those three years, and said the NSA's disclosures about its e-mail collection effort ""fundamentally alters the court's understanding of the scope of the collection … and requires careful re-examination of many of the assessments and presumptions underlying prior approvals.''

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the latest revelation underscores the need for greater oversight of the intelligence community. Blumenthal has proposed legislation calling for a special advocate to represent the public's interest in the secret FISA court proceedings.

""Now, the question is how many other such unconstitutional practices occurred without the court knowing, and without a special advocate to blow the whistle?"" Blumenthal said. ""This highly intrusive breach highlights the need for reforming the FISA court system to assure greater respect for constitutional rights, and to ensure that the American people have faith and trust in the institutions charged with keeping us safe."""

The group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says it is taking the extraordinary legal step of going directly to the Supreme Court because the sweeping collection of the phone records of American citizens has created “exceptional circumstances” that only the nation’s highest court can address.

The group, based in Washington, also said it was taking its case to the Supreme Court because it could not challenge the legality of the N.S.A. program at the secret court that approved it, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, and because lower federal courts did not have the authority to review the secret court’s orders.

In its petition, the group said the FISA court had “exceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.”"

Critics says NSA has turned Internet into %22surveillance engine%22

NSA it%27s the %22price of admission for the U.S. to maintain unrestricted access to ... cyberspace%22

British agents are focused on the %22big four%22%3A Google%2C Yahoo%2C Facebook and Microsoft%27s Hotmail

U.S. and British intelligence agencies have cracked the encryption designed to provide online privacy and security, documents leaked by former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden show.

In a clandestine, decade-long effort to defeat digital scrambling, the National Security Agency, along with its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have used supercomputers to crack encryption codes through ""brute force"" and have inserted secret ""back doors"" into software with the help of technology companies, The Guardian,TheNew York Times and ProPublica reported Thursday.

The NSA has also maintained control over international encryption standards.

As the Times points out, encryption ""guards global commerce and banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical records, and automatically secures the e-mails, Web searches, Internet chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a federal suit challenging the government's collection of telephone communications data, called the NSA's efforts to defeat encryption ""recklessly shortsighted'' and said they make the Internet less secure for all.

In a statement, the ACLU said the actions will ""further erode not only the United States' reputation as a global champion of civil liberties and privacy but the economic competitiveness of its largest companies.''

""The encryption technologies that the NSA has exploited to enable its secret dragnet surveillance are the same technologies that protect our most sensitive information, including medical records, financial transactions and commercial secrets,"" said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. ""Even as the NSA demands more powers to invade our privacy in the name of cybersecurity, it is making the Internet less secure and exposing us to criminal hacking, foreign espionage, and unlawful surveillance.''

The spy agencies have focused on compromising encryption found in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), virtual private networks (VPNs) and 4G smartphones and tablets. The NSA spent $255 million this year on the decryption program — code named Bullrun — which aims to ""covertly influence"" software designs and ""insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems"" that would be known only to the agency.

The documents leaked by Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, do not name specific companies or encryption technologies, and refer to customers and users as ""adversaries.""

The NSA calls its decryption efforts the ""price of admission for the U.S. to maintain unrestricted access to and use of cyberspace.""

A 2010 memo describing an NSA briefing to British agents about the secret hacking said, ""For the past decade, N.S.A. has led an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies. Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming online. Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable.""

The GCHQ is working to penetrate encrypted traffic on what it called the ""big four"" service providers — Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft's Hotmail.

One document shows that by 2012, the British agency had developed ""new access opportunities"" into Google's systems.

Most major tech companies did not immediately respond. In the past, they have said they cooperate with government agencies only as prescribed by law.

Google said in a statement: ""We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. As for recent reports that the U.S. government has found ways to circumvent our security systems, we have no evidence of any such thing ever occurring. We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.""

A spokesman for Microsoft, Dominic Carr, said Thursday night that ""the company has significant concerns about the allegations of government activity reported today.'' He cited a previous Microsoft statement denying it provides ""any government with the ability to break the encryption.''

The NSA says code-breaking is fundamental to its mission of protecting national security by deciphering communications from terrorists, spies or other U.S. adversaries.

During the 1990s, the agency fought unsuccessfully to have a secret government portal included in all encryption protocols.

Experts and critics say that while ""back doors"" may help intelligence gathering, they weaken the Web's overall security and trust, and could be used against Americans.

""The risk is that when you build a back door into systems, you're not the only one to exploit it,"" Matthew Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, told the Times. ""Those back doors could work against U.S. communications, too.""

Bruce Schneier, a security technologist, examined the documents before they were published and authored an analysis for the Guardian. He told USA TODAY that they are the biggest revelations yet from the documents leaked by Snowden and said they show NSA has ""subverted"" much of the Internet and tech companies that form its backbone.

""They fundamentally undermine the social contract of the Internet — which is that you get what you think you get and it works,'' Schneier said. ""An agency has subverted vast swaths of this to turn the Internet into a surveillance engine. Now the Internet doesn't do what people thought it did.''

""They've done it through secret agreements with companies, so essentially all the companies you deal with on the Internet have been lying to you. They have basically sucked the trust out of the Internet — the NSA and these companies. It's a public-private partnership to turn the internet into a surveillance engine.''

The Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit group that advocates for a free Internet, called the NSA efforts ""a fundamental attack on the way the Internet works.''

""In an era which businesses as well as the average consumer trust secure networks and technologies for sensitive transactions and private communications online, it's incredibly destructive for the NSA to add flaws to such critical infrastructure,"" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, CDT Senior Staff Technologist.

""The NSA seems to be operating on the fantastically naïve assumption that any vulnerabilities it builds into core Internet technologies can only be exploited by itself and its global partners. The NSA simply should not be building vulnerabilities into the fundamental tools that we all rely upon to protect our private information,"" Hall added.

The Times and ProPublica said intelligence officials asked them not to publish the article, arguing that the revelations ""might prompt foreign targets to switch to new forms of encryption or communications that would be harder to collect or read.""

After removing ""some specific facts,"" they chose to publish ""because of the value of a public debate about government actions that weaken the most powerful tools for protecting the privacy of Americans and others.""

ProPublica published a separate article explaining its decision to publish:

The story, we believe, is an important one. It shows that the expectations of millions of Internet users regarding the privacy of their electronic communications are mistaken. These expectations guide the practices of private individuals and businesses, most of them innocent of any wrongdoing. The potential for abuse of such extraordinary capabilities for surveillance, including for political purposes, is considerable. The government insists it has put in place checks and balances to limit misuses of this technology. But the question of whether they are effective is far from resolved and is an issue that can only be debated by the people and their elected representatives if the basic facts are revealed.

The non-profit news organization noted that ""American history is replete with examples of the dangers of unchecked power operating in secret,"" specifically the President Nixon, who ""tried to subvert law enforcement, intelligence and other agencies for political purposes, and was more than willing to violate laws in the process.""

""Such a person could come to power again. We need a system that can withstand such challenges. That system requires public knowledge of the power the government possesses. Today's story is a step in that direction,"" ProPublica wrote.

Sanger']",White House Tries to Prevent Judge From Ruling on Surveillance Efforts,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration moved late Friday to prevent a federal judge in California from ruling on the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance programs authorized during the Bush administration, telling a court that recent disclosures about National Security Agency spying were not enough to undermine its claim that litigating the case would jeopardize state secrets.

In a set of filings in the two long-running cases in the Northern District of California, the government acknowledged for the first time that the N.S.A. started systematically collecting data about Americans’ emails and phone calls in 2001, alongside its program of wiretapping certain calls without warrants. The government had long argued that disclosure of these and other secrets would put the country at risk if they came out in court.

But the government said that despite recent leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, that made public a fuller scope of the surveillance and data collection programs put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks, sensitive secrets remained at risk in any courtroom discussion of their details — like whether the plaintiffs were targets of intelligence collection or whether particular telecommunications providers like AT&T and Verizon had helped the agency.

“Disclosure of this still-classified information regarding the scope and operational details of N.S.A. intelligence activities implicated by plaintiffs’ allegations could be expected to cause extremely grave damage to the national security of the United States,” wrote the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr."

Pelosi said Edward Snowden broke the law%2C called for balance between security and privacy

Pelosi argued Obama%27s approach to surveillance was an improvement over Bush%27s policies

She was the keynote speaker at the event

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has disappointed some of her liberal base with her defense of the Obama administration's classified surveillance of U.S. residents' phone and Internet records.

Some of the activists attending the annual Netroots Nation political conference Saturday booed and interrupted the San Francisco Democrat when she commented on the surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency and revealed by a former contractor, Edward Snowden, The San Jose Mercury News reports.

The boos came when Pelosi said that Snowden had violated the law and that the government needed to strike a balance between security and privacy.

As she was attempting to argue that Obama's approach to citizen surveillance was an improvement over the policies under President George W. Bush, an activist, identified by the Mercury News as Mac Perkel of Gilroy, stood up and tried loudly to question her, prompting security guards to escort him out of the convention hall.

""Leave him alone!"" audience members shouted. Others yelled ""Secrets and lies!,"" ''No secret courts!"" and ""Protect the First Amendment!,"" according to the Mercury News.

Perkel told the newspaper that he thinks Pelosi does not fully understand what the NSA is up to.

Several others in the audience walked out in support of Perkel.

""We're listening to our progressive leaders who are supposed to be on our side of the team saying it's OK for us to get targeted"" for online surveillance, said Jana Thrift of Eugene, Ore. ""It's crazy. I don't know who Nancy Pelosi really is.""

Netroots Nation is an organizing and training convention for progressive political leaders. Pelosi was Saturday's keynote speaker at the event, which opened Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center and was scheduled to conclude Sunday.

Her remarks criticizing the Republican majority in the House and encouraging powerful women brought applause, cheers and laughs."

Joan was informed that the men were protesting her concert about an hour before it was due to begin and she immediately walked out onto the street to talk to them. When she approached, one of the first things they said was ""We appreciate the work you did on civil rights and women's rights."" They wanted to make that point clear.

She listened closely as they discussed their views. Primarily, they wanted to express the way they felt betrayed by anti-war protesters when they returned from combat. Joan assured them that she stood by them then and now. They had mixed reactions as she explained her actual positions and her support for all veterans, across the board.

At this point, Joan's merchandise salesman, Jim Stewart, who was a Captain in the US Army during Vietnam, approached the group. Jim is one of the most kind-hearted people you could ever meet. He is not one to speak lightly of what he went through in Vietnam. He took Joan's arm and said to these four men, ""I stand by this lady 100%. She did the right thing then, and she stood by us when we got home. She even recorded a song at that time from which 100% of the proceeds went to us vets.""

Here Jim listens, then engages in conversation:

Unbelievably, one of the four protesters began to question Jim in an accusatory fashion, pressing him for details about what division he was in and and where he served, as if, somehow, he were making it up. It brings tears to my eyes, as I write this, to remember Jim being questioned in this way. These protesters were there, theoretically, to lament the poor treatment of American soliders and yet they belittled and questioned the service of a veteran because he did not agree with their views.

Jim played their game for a bit before seeing it for what it was and disengaging. Joan stood by his side and said, ""Oh, he's got the stories all right. But he doesn't feel the need to talk about them.""

Ironically, a man on his way to the concert approached at this moment and, without really following all that had gone on, interjected, ""Those who don't realize that what they did in Vietnam was wrong are kind of SLOOOOOOW."" I watched Jim's face as he heard that statement - literally getting it from both sides within less than a minute.

At this point I engaged in conversation with the man holding the sign accusing liberals, rather than soliders, of killing babies. He said ""I never killed any babies and I don't believe in guilt by association."" I asked him how in the world he could justify holding a sign with Joan Baez's name on it that basically implied she killed babies if he didn't believe in guilt by association. He replied ""It's an analogy, you probably wouldn't understand it!""

Uhhhh.... yeah.

Jim said he should destroy the sign and he then claimed we were trying to trample his Constitutional right to free speech. We replied that we weren't questioning his right, by any means, but rather his sense of decency, considering that he was there having a conversation with Joan and she was clearly not a baby killer. Since his entire point was that guilt by association was wrong, it made sense to us. But he replied ""I'm Pro-Life and I'm proud of this sign."" With those words, he held it higher.

As we discussed these things, one of them repeated, ""Soldiers don't kill babies."" I said that so many horrible things happen in war that it's impossible to make such a blanket statement, especially when bombs get dropped from the sky, and I said it all comes down to the truth that ""War is hell.""

I continued, saying, ""And you all know that far better than me.""

They were suprised by this statement, as if shocked that anyone on the ""other side"" recognized what they'd been through. It seemd to render them speechless for a moment.

At this point, Joan's continuing acceptance of their stories and her willingness to hear them out began to melt their anger. In a twist that seems hard to fathom, they then asked her to SIGN THEIR POSTERS! She replied that she would sign the back but not the front of ""those horrible things."" Incredibly, the man with the baby-killing sign replied that he would take her name off the poster if she would sign it.

She did end up signing them, and also getting copies of her book for each of them, and offering tickets to the show, which they did not accept. She signed the back of the poster about her encouraging the killing of American soldiers - ""All the very best to you, Joan Baez.""

When we got back inside the theatre, Joan broke down in tears. I said to her ""You are so brave to face people like that."" She wasn't crying about the way she had been treated, however, but about the way Jim Stewart had stood up for her. ""Did you hear his voice shaking?"" she said. ""That was bravery...""

And she was right. Stepping back into the mire of Vietnam was not something he did lightly - he bore the literal denigration of his service by another veteran in order to defend her.

During the concert afterwards Joan dedicated a song to the protesters and said ""You know, they just wanted to be heard. Everyone wants to be heard. I feel like I made four new friends tonight.""

She took the high road, as always. It wasn't my name on those signs, yet I gave into anger. She never did. As we deal with tea parties and increasingly violent right wing protests it would do us all good to remember the example of non-violence and compassion that Ms Baez has exemplified for the 50-plus years of her career.

Her heroes are Gandhi and Martin Luther King. In my book, she's right there with them, leading the timeless and essential march along the high road.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for the recs! I'm so happy that this story has inspired members of this community. You may want to check out the version of ""We Shall Overcome"" that Joan recorded in her kitchen in June, with some lyrics in Farsi, in the hope of directly inspiring the people of Iran as they stand up for real democracy against real oppression.

USA TODAY

NSA spying authorized in the wake of the 9/11 attacks%2C James Clapper says

Release says the agency applied %22additional internal constraints%22 on authorized activities

White House expected to reveal tweaks to NSA program in January

WASHINGTON — In the face of growing skepticism over the National Security Agency's practice of collecting bulk phone and Internet records, the director of national intelligence on Saturday declassified several documents detailing the program.

The latest declassification of documents comes during a week in which a federal judge ruled the NSA's bulk collection was likely unconstitutional and a White House task force questioned the effectiveness of the program.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement announcing the release that President George W. Bush first authorized the spying in October 2001, as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks.

""President Bush issued authorizations approximately every 30-60 days,"" Clapper said. ""Although the precise terms changed over time, each presidential authorization required the minimization of information collected concerning American citizens to the extent consistent with the effective accomplishment of the mission of detection and prevention of acts of terrorism within the United States. NSA also applied additional internal constraints on the presidentially authorized activities.""

Approval for the bulk collection was eventually shifted to the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court, a secret court that considers government requests for electronic surveillance for intelligence-gathering purposes.

The documents released include legal arguments by two former national intelligence directors under Bush — Dennis Blair and Mike McConnell — who state their legal case for why it was essential to keep secret the practice of bulk data collection. The unclassified documents are part of an ongoing court case that was filed in 2006.

""These are among the most important intelligence tools the NSA uses, and they have never been officially confirmed or denied by the United States,"" McConnell offers in his argument. ""Disclosing or confirming these activities would seriously undermine an essential tool for tracking possible terrorist plots and would help foreign adversaries evade detection.""

But in recent days, both advisers of President Obama and a Bush appointed federal judge have offered very different assessments about the utility and legality of the practice.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled on Monday on a lawsuit brought by conservative activist Larry Klayman that the legal challenge to the massive surveillance program — disclosed in full earlier this year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden — would likely succeed.

""The court concludes that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the government's bulk collection and querying of phone record metadata, that they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim (of unlawful search and seizure), and that they will suffer irreparable harm absent…relief,'' wrote Leon, who was appointed to the bench by Bush.

The task force Obama appointed in August to review the NSA surveillance program and recommend changes concluded in their report — which was made public on Wednesday — that the data collection program was ""not essential to preventing attacks.""

Before leaving for his two-week Hawaii vacation on Friday, Obama said he and his aides were evaluating all of the recommendations by the five-member panel, and that he would offer a response to their suggestions in January. He hinted that that changes to the bulk data collections could be coming.

""The question we're going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing,"" Obama said. ""I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers.""

The president added, ""We may have to refine this further to give people more confidence."""

The fugitive document-leaker has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. He has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23.

Fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden announced that he is submitting a request for political asylum in Russia, where he has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23. Eventually, the 30-year-old former contractor for the National Security Agency said at a meeting with human rights activists and lawyers, he hopes to gain asylum in Latin America.

Fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden announced that he is submitting a request for political asylum in Russia, where he has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23. Eventually, the 30-year-old former contractor for the National Security Agency said at a meeting with human rights activists and lawyers, he hopes to gain asylum in Latin America.

The fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden surfaced, even if behind closed doors, at Sheremetyevo International Airport on Friday afternoon, and in announcing to a group of visitors that he plans to seek asylum in Russia, he ensured that a problem neither Moscow nor Washington wants is not about to go away.

Snowden had hoped to go to Latin America, but as that prospect has come to appear more difficult, he is facing the more immediate challenge of getting out of the airport after nearly three weeks there. He told his guests that he sees Russian asylum as a short-term solution, in hopes that he can later make his way to Venezuela, Nicaragua or Bolivia, which have offered him asylum.

Russia has been ambivalent at best about his presence here, as an unwelcome complication in already strained relations with the United States. But by late evening, Russian authorities seemed to be making the best of a difficult situation, as a line of officials sought out the media and voiced their support for asylum.

If asylum is granted, the Obama administration would be forced to decide how to react without ruining relations with Moscow entirely.

Snowden told his guests, they reported afterward, that he likes Sheremetyevo Airport well enough but that he can’t stay cooped up forever. Russian officials said it may take them two or three more weeks to decide.

The Interfax news agency quoted Russian migration service head Konstantin Romodanovsky as saying no asylum request had been received as of Saturday.

Snowden has been out of public sight since he arrived here from Hong Kong on June 23, a step ahead of American efforts to have him sent back to the United States for revealing classified information about data collection programs run by the National Security Agency.

But Thursday night he sent e-mail invitations to a group of defense lawyers, pro-Kremlin politicians and human rights advocates to meet him the next day at the airport. There he read a statement critical of the United States and told them of his hopes for Russian asylum.

And in a comment that seemed to raise more questions than answers, he repeated claims that as an NSA contractor, he “had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize and read your communications. Anyone’s communications at any time.”

The White House said in a statement Friday that President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone about Snowden’s status and “a range of security and bilateral issues.”

Until now, Russia has been eager not to prolong Snowden’s stay, though it has been unwilling to return him to the United States. Moscow’s relations with Washington are complicated enough, politicians here have said, without a professed whistleblower and fugitive from prosecution standing between them.

“I do not want a human fate to hinge on the relations between two countries,” said Vladimir Lukin, Russia’s human rights commissioner and a participant in the meeting, “but at the same time it would be undesirable if relations between two countries hinged on one man’s will.”

The Kremlin insisted again that if he is to stay, Snowden must agree “to fully stop activities causing damage to our American partners and Russian-American relations,” in the words of Dmitri Peskov, Putin’s spokesman.

Snowden told his visitors that he has no problem meeting that condition, said Tatyana Lokshina of Human Rights Watch, because he believes he has not caused any harm to the United States with his revelations.

It’s not clear the Kremlin would be in line with those semantics. “As far as we know, he has considered and continues to consider himself a human rights champion and a defender of the rule of law and democracy and that he did not plan to abandon these activities,” Peskov said at a briefing.

“He is a patriot of his country,” said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a member of parliament from the ruling United Russia party and the grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov, who was the Soviet foreign minister under Joseph Stalin.

Nikonov said he thinks Snowden will have to remain at the airport while his request — which has yet to be filed — is considered. The meeting Friday was repeatedly interrupted by flight announcements, he said, and Snowden joked, “I’m used to that by now.”

‘Not a whistleblower’

Lokshina reported that Snowden feels safe at the airport, but it has become clear he “couldn’t stay indefinitely.” On her way to the meeting, she got a phone call from a U.S. diplomat who, she said, asked her to relay to Snowden that the United States does not consider him a whistleblower — a category that has a fairly precise legal definition.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki denied that human rights representatives had been asked to convey a message to Snowden. “At no point did . . . any official from the U.S. government ask anyone to convey a message to Mr. Snowden,” she said.

The State Department expressed “disappointment” that Russia allowed human rights activists into the airport transit zone “despite the government’s declaration of Russia’s neutrality.”

“Our concern here is that he’s been provided with this opportunity to speak in a propaganda platform . . . that Russia has played a role in facilitating this, that others have helped elevate it,” Psaki said.

Snowden, she said, is “not a whistleblower. He’s not a human rights activist. He’s wanted on a series of serious criminal charges brought in the Eastern District of Virginia in the United States.”

In the statement he read from at the meeting, Snowden attacked the “historically disproportionate aggression” of the United States in trying to prevent his access to asylum in Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua, according to a transcript provided by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that is helping him.

“I believe,” he said, after talking about his revelations, “in the principle declared at Nuremberg in 1945: ‘Individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience. Therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring.’ ”

Snowden said he was formally accepting “all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future.” He cited, for example, Venezuela’s offer of asylum, but he said that “some governments” in Western Europe and North America were interfering with his “right to enjoy that asylum,” making it impossible for him to travel.

Several Latin American leaders have accused the United States of pressuring European countries to keep Snowden from reaching the region, including an incident in which Bolivian President Evo Morales’s plane was apparently prevented from crossing the airspace of some European nations on suspicion that Snowden was hiding aboard.

The scene at the airport

Snowden’s visitors gathered at 4:30 p.m. in the arrivals hall of the airport’s Terminal F, a dingy, aging relic of the Soviet era. They were mobbed by television camera crews, starved of a glimpse of Snowden for the past 19 days. Then airport officials led them on a long march past tourists just in from Thailand, right by a restaurant called Franklin’s Roll & Burger displaying a large American flag, up one escalator and down another, until they reached the gleaming Terminal E.

Down to the ground floor, into a back area nearly empty except for a woman placidly embroidering, then along a long blank pale green wall, to a door marked “Staff Only.” The airport had set up a meeting room that allowed the visitors not to cross passport control, from their side, or Snowden from his. A hot, jostling mob of journalists waited while the meeting took place. Then they pounced when the visitors re-emerged.

Time and again, the N.S.A. has pushed past the limits that lawmakers thought they had imposed to prevent it from invading basic privacy, as guaranteed by the Constitution.

It was bad enough in 2008 when Congress allowed the agency to spy without a warrant on e-mails and text messages between Americans and foreign targets of an investigation. That already strained the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal searches, but lawmakers decided it was justified as part of a terror investigation.

It turns out, as Charlie Savage revealed in The Times on Thursday, that the N.S.A. went far beyond those boundaries. Instead, it copies virtually all overseas messages that Americans send or receive, then scans them to see if they contain any references to people or subjects the agency thinks might have a link to terrorists.

That could very well include innocent communications between family members expressing fears of a terror attack. Or messages between an editor and a reporter who is covering international security issues. Or the privileged conversation between a lawyer and a client who is being investigated."

An air of mystery has surrounded the FBI shooting of Ibragim Todashev, 27, since it occurred in Todashev’s apartment early on the morning of May 22. The FBI said in a news release that day that Todashev, a former Boston resident who knew bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during an interview with several law enforcement officers.

The FBI has provided few other details, saying that the matter is being investigated by an FBI review team that may not finish its probe for several months.

“The FBI takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents and as such we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally,” FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said in a statement Wednesday. “The review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.”

The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations on Wednesday called for an independent investigation by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Officials said the division and local prosecutors are already reviewing the case.

At the time of the shooting, Todashev was being interviewed about his possible connection to a triple murder in Waltham, Mass., on Sept. 11, 2011. Law enforcement officials said he had acknowledged involvement in the murders and had implicated Tsarnaev. Officials said Todashev was not suspected of involvement in the April 15 Boston bombing.

Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police four days after the bombing. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured later that day and remains in custody.

In the statement about Todashev’s shooting issued on the day of the incident, the FBI said that an agent, along with two Massachusetts State Police troopers and other law enforcement personnel, were interviewing “an individual” in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation when a “violent confrontation was initiated by the individual.”

An agent sustained non-life-threatening injuries, later described by one law enforcement official as “some cuts and abrasions.”

Initial reports citing anonymous law-enforcement individuals provided conflicting accounts of what happened. Some law enforcement officials said Todashev wielded a knife and others suggested that he attempted to grab the FBI agent’s gun.

One law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said Wednesday that Todashev lunged at the agent and overturned a table. But the official said Todashev did not have a gun or a knife. A second official also said Todashev was unarmed.

An official said that according to one account of the shooting, the other law enforcement officials had just stepped out of the room, leaving the FBI agent alone with Todashev, when the confrontation occurred.

The shooting followed hours of questioning by the law enforcement officials that had begun the night before.

Todashev’s father said after the shooting that he didn’t believe the FBI’s account of why they killed his son.

“My son could never commit a crime, I know my son too well,” Abdul-Baki Todashev, who lives in Chechnya, told the Daily Beast Web site. “He worked helping disabled people in America and did sports, coached other sportsmen. The FBI made up their accusations.”

Todashev, a martial arts fighter, met Tamerlan Tsarnaev in fighting circles in Boston before Todashev moved to Orlando.

Todashev’s family said he had a ticket to fly to Russia this month and planned to spend the summer in his native Chechnya."

Surveillance programs sparked a damaging controversy

Defending the programs threaten to move key agenda items to back burner

The scarcest precious resource for second-term presidents is time

WASHINGTON — President Obama, meet the second-term curse.

Revelations that the U.S. government has been collecting a massive database of telephone usage by millions of Americans — citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing — created a firestorm Thursday that would be damaging for any administration. But it is is especially problematic for Obama because it stokes controversies he already was struggling to contain and reinforces criticism that has dogged him from the start.

Republicans have long depicted Obama as an advocate of a big, dangerous and overreaching government, back to the federal bailout of the auto industry he undertook during the financial crisis that greeted his first inauguration. That has been their fundamental philosophical objection to his signature Affordable Care Act, now just months away from implementation of its major provisions.

In recent weeks, it has fueled outrage over the targeting by the Internal Revenue Service of conservative Tea Party groups seeking non-profit status, and over the use of secret subpoenas and search warrants against the Associated Press and Fox News in Justice Department investigations of news leaks.

Now the headlines are focused on governmental monitoring that touches not just reporters but, apparently, just about anyone who makes a phone call. Thursday began with explosions over a story in The Guardian in London of a broad secret U.S. warrant for phone records from Verizon. By midday, Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein had confirmed the surveillance had been going on for years. By the end of the day, The Washington Post and The Guardian reported that a data-mining program targeting foreigners was tapping into such Internet companies as Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

All that overwhelmed the president's planned message for the day, and likely well beyond. (For the record, he had stopped by Mooresville Middle School outside Charlotte to promote his plan to provide schools with high-speed Internet access. Not that anyone noticed.)

And in a bit of timing that is at least awkward, he holds high-profile meetings in California today with President Xi Jinping of China — a government the United States has long faulted for its heavy-handed treatment of its own people.

Indeed, as a U.S. senator from Illinois in 2007, Barack Obama blasted President George W. Bush for sweeping surveillance of Americans in the name of battling terrorism — just the sort of justification that Obama officials were making Thursday.

Then, Obama called it ""a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand.""

""I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom,"" he said in a speech then. ""No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are. And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.""

To be sure, Obama didn't launch the data-mining initiatives, which were started during the Bush administration, though he has expanded them. He had defenders Thursday ranging from California Sen. Feinstein, a liberal Democrat, to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a conservative Republican. ""It's called protecting America,"" Feinstein said.

But his critics also spanned the political spectrum. ""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" former vice president Al Gore posted on Twitter. Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, an author of the Patriot Act that was used to obtain the court order, called it ""excessive and un-American.""

The scarcest precious resource for second-term presidents isn't political clout, which they demonstrate by joining the small fraternity of those who have managed to win the presidency twice. It is time — the time to pursue the agenda they choose before a scandal or foreign-policy crisis erupts, and before the next presidential campaign begins to consume all the oxygen in town. For former president Bill Clinton, the Monica Lewinsky affair ended his hopes of winning serious entitlement reform during his second term. Former president Richard Nixon found himself bedeviled with and eventually forced from office by the Watergate scandal.

Obama's plan has been to be able to win approval for and sign a comprehensive immigration bill in Congress by fall. He hopes to be able to negotiate a big budget deal that would curb the deficit and put Medicare on a firmer long-term footing before the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race seize the political world.

Instead, explaining and defending these surveillance programs — what they are, how they work and why he thinks they're needed — are about to take up a lot of his time."

Curbs,"WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory committee charged with examining the operations of the National Security Agency has concluded that a program to collect data on every phone call made in the United States should continue, though under broad new restraints that would be intended to increase privacy protections, according to officials with knowledge of the report’s contents.

The committee’s report, the officials said, also argues in favor of codifying and publicly announcing the steps the United States will take to protect the privacy of foreign citizens whose telephone records, Internet communications or movements are collected by the N.S.A. But it is unclear how far that effort would go, and intelligence officials have argued strenuously that they should be under few restrictions when tapping the communications of non-Americans abroad, who do not have constitutional protections under the Fourth Amendment.

The advisory group is also expected to recommend that senior White House officials, including the president, directly review the list of foreign leaders whose communications are routinely monitored by the N.S.A. President Obama recently apologized to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the N.S.A.’s monitoring of her calls over the past decade, promising that the actions had been halted and would not resume. But he refused to make the same promise to the leaders of Mexico and Brazil.

Administration officials say the White House has already taken over supervision of that program. “We’re not leaving it to Jim Clapper anymore,” said one official, referring to the director of national intelligence, who appears to have been the highest official to review the programs regularly."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/senators-reject-biometric-visas-immigration-reform-184521049.html,,[],Senators reject biometric tracking in immigration reform,"A bipartisan group of senators voted against adding a biometric system to the sweeping immigration reform bill that would ensure people on tourist, student and other temporary visas leave the country when they are supposed to. The failed amendment was one of the most controversial additions to the bill considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee at Tuesday's hearing.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, backed the amendment that would have required the government to use fingerprints and other biometric data to track visitors when they leave the country at airports and other ports of exit. Democrats, including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, argued the system would be too expensive to implement. It was voted down 6-12, with two Republicans joining the 10 Democrats in opposing it. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who helped draft the original bill, said he opposed the amendment because the government hasn't shown ""the will or the desire"" to implement the system, and he doubted including it in the bill would change that.

Despite some conservative opposition to the immigration bill, attempts to significantly alter the bill have failed in the committee mark-up process so far.

The current immigration reform bill seeks to legalize most of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country and prevent future illegal immigration though an employment verification system and more border security measures. About 40 percent of the unauthorized immigrants currently in the country entered legally and then overstayed their visas, which Sessions argued raises national security concerns.

After the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress passed a bill mandating that the government institute a biometric tracking system for people on temporary, nonimmigrant visas such as for tourism. Twelve years later, the system still hasn't been implemented due to cost and other complications.

The Department of Homeland Security estimated it would cost up to $6.4 billion to implement a biometric tracking system in the nation's airports, according to a report in USA Today. It's unclear how much it would cost to install similar technology in the country's land ports, where nearly 80 percent of people enter the United States.

Story continues

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said at the hearing that he was concerned that requiring the biometric system would delay the citizenship process for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who will benefit from the bill. The amendment said none of those immigrants would be able to apply for citizenship before the biometric system was put in place. The current bill lays out a 10-year waiting period for citizenship for the group.

A spokesman for Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and a member of the ""Gang of Eight"" that drafted the bill, told The Hill he was ""disappointed"" with the vote, and that he would try to reintroduce it once senators begin debating the bill on the Senate floor.

Another rejected amendment, introduced by Sessions on Tuesday, sought to significantly reduce future legal immigration. Sessions argued it would help the American economy to keep legal immigration numbers down. All of Sessions' colleagues on the committee, Republican and Democrat, voted against the measure."

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-reveals-more-secrets-court-111216859.html,,[],NSA reveals more secrets after court order,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has given up more of its surveillance secrets, acknowledging that it was ordered to stop scooping up thousands of Internet communications from Americans with no connection to terrorism — a practice it says was an unintended consequence when it gathered bundles of Internet traffic connected to terror suspects.

One of the documents that intelligence officials released Wednesday came because a court ordered the National Security Agency to do so. But it's also part of the administration's response to the leaks by analyst-turned-fugitive Edward Snowden, who revealed that the NSA's spying programs went further and gathered millions more communications than most Americans realized.

The NSA declassified three secret court opinions showing how it revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that one of its surveillance programs may have collected and stored as many as 56,000 emails and other communications by ordinary Americans annually over three years. The court ruled the NSA actions unconstitutional and ordered the agency to fix the problem, which it did by creating new technology to filter out buckets of data most likely to contain U.S. emails, and then limit the access to that data.

The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, released the information Wednesday ""in the interest of increased transparency,"" and as directed by President Barack Obama in June, according to a statement accompanying the online documents.

But it wasn't until the Electronic Freedom Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group that sued for the release of one of the documents, disclosed the court order that Obama administration officials also acknowledged that the release was prodded by the group's 2012 lawsuit.

The court opinions show that when the NSA reported its inadvertent gathering of American-based Internet traffic in September 2011, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ordered the agency to find ways to limit what it collects and how long it keeps the material.

Story continues

In an 85-page declassified FISA court ruling from October 2011, U.S. District Judge James D. Bates rebuked government lawyers for repeatedly misrepresenting the operations of the NSA's surveillance programs.

Bates wrote that the NSA had advised the court that ""the volume and nature of the information it had been collecting is fundamentally different than what the court had been led to believe,"" and went on to say the court must consider ""whether targeting and minimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amendment"" prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.

""This court is troubled that the government's revelations regarding NSA's acquisition of Internet transactions mark the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program,"" Bates added in a footnoted passage that had portions heavily blacked out.

Bates also complained that the government's submissions make clear that the NSA was gathering Internet data years before it was authorized by the USA Patriot Act's Section 702 in 2008.

The NSA had moved to revise its Internet surveillance in an effort to separate out domestic data from its foreign targeted metadata — which includes email addresses and subject lines. But in his October 2011 ruling, Bates said the government's ""upstream"" collection of data — taken from internal U.S. data sources — was unconstitutional.

Three senior U.S. intelligence officials said Wednesday that national security officials realized the extent of the NSA's inadvertent collection of Americans' data from fiber optic cables in September 2011. One of the officials said the problem became apparent during internal discussions between the NSA and Justice Department officials about the program's technical operation.

The problem, according to the officials, was that the top secret Internet-sweeping operation, which was targeting metadata contained in the emails of foreign users, was also amassing thousands of emails that were bundled up with the targeted materials. Because many web mail services use such bundled transmissions, the official said, it was impossible to collect the targeted materials without also sweeping up data from innocent domestic U.S. users.

Officials said that when they realized they had an American communication, the communication was destroyed. But it was not clear how they determined to whom an email belonged and whether any NSA analyst had actually read the content of the email. The officials said the bulk of the information was never accessed or analyzed.

As soon as the extent of the problem became clear, the officials said, the Obama administration provided classified briefings to both Senate and House intelligence committees within days. At the same time, officials also informed the FISA court, which later issued the three 2011 rulings released Wednesday — with sections blacked out — as part of the government's latest disclosure of documents.

The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so by name.

The documents were declassified to help the Obama administration explain some of the most recent disclosures made by The Washington Post after it published classified documents provided by Snowden, the former NSA systems analyst.

But the FISA court's classified rulings have also been at issue in a year-old lawsuit filed against the government by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The release Wednesday of the FISA opinion, two other 2011 rulings and a secret ""white paper"" on the NSA's surveillance came less than two weeks after a federal judge in Washington gave government lawyers a time extension in order to decide which materials to declassify. The EFF had been pressing for a summary judgment that would have compelled the government to release the secret FISA rulings, and the government's most recent extension expired Wednesday, the day it released the once-secret FISA court rulings.

""This was all released in response to the court's orders,"" said Mark Rumold, an EFF attorney involved in the litigation.

A senior administration official acknowledged Wednesday that some of the documents released were in response to the lawsuit, while others were released voluntarily. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the release with a reporter by name.

The documents were posted later in the day on a new website that went live Wednesday afternoon. The front page of the site said it was ""created at the direction of the president of the United States (and) provides immediate, ongoing and direct access to factual information related to the lawful foreign surveillance activities carried out by the U.S. intelligence community.""

These interceptions of innocent Americans' communications were happening when the NSA accessed Internet information ""upstream,"" meaning off fiber optic cables or other channels where Internet traffic traverses the U.S. telecommunications system.

The NSA disclosed that it gathers some 250 million Internet communications each year, with some 9 percent from these ""upstream"" channels, amounting to 20 million to 25 million emails a year. The agency used statistical analysis to estimate that of those, possibly as many as 56,000 Internet communications collected were sent by Americans or people in the U.S. with no connection to terrorism.

Under court order, the NSA resolved the problem by creating new ways to detect when emails by people within the U.S. were being intercepted and separated those batches of communications. It also developed new ways to limit how that data could be accessed or used. The agency also agreed to only keep these bundled communications for possible later analysis for a two-year period, instead of the usual five-year retention period.

The agency also, under court order, destroyed all the bundled data gathered between 2008, when the FISA court first authorized the collection under Section 702 of the Patriot Act, and 2011, when the new procedures were put in place.

The court signed off on the new procedures.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the program is specifically to gather foreign intelligence, not spy on Americans.

""The reason that we're talking about it right now is because there are very strict compliance standards in place at the NSA that monitor for compliance issues, that tabulate them, that document them and that put in place measures to correct them when they occur,"" Earnest said.

Wilkerson recalled the harrowing details on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, yet her story has gone unheard in the broader press.

Maria Espinoza, the director of the Remembrance project that memorializes Americans who were killed by illegal immigrants, told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that such crimes “happen every day” in America, even in states far from the border. But the mainstream media, Espinoza said, often do not report on illegal immigrants who have murdered Americans in states like Virginia, Tennessee, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.

Espinoza said incidents remain local ones and are “shared” and actually suppressed.

“We don’t even hear the person was here illegally in the country,” she said.

Wilkerson told the harrowing tale of how her 18-year-old son was killed on what started out as “just a normal school day.” Wilkerson’s maternal instinct took over when her son did not answer a text from her around 1:30 pm and she went to the school to look for him. While driving around, Wilkerson saw her son’s truck parked by a dumpster at a strip mall. After police found her son’s backpack and shoes in the dumpster, she suspected the worst.

Wilkerson would later find out that an illegal alien, who would have been eligible for citizenship under the DREAM Act, brutally murdered her son after he offered to give him a ride home. The illegal alien would later testify–without showing remorse–that he punched her son so hard in the nose that he went blind and kicked him in the stomach so hard that Josh’s liver and spleen sliced. After ultimately strangling Josh to death, the illegal immigrant then tied Josh up, took him to a field, doused him with gas and burned him. The illegal immigrant was sentenced to life in prison this January.

Espinoza said such crimes were 100% preventable if the nation’s immigration laws are enforced. Wilkerson agreed, recalling how her son’s murder had been in court days before he killed her son because the illegal alien had stalked an ex-girlfriend. Similar incidents have occurred in states like Virginia, where the illegal alien who stabbed a Virginia teenager to death after asking her for a ride to the hospital had been detained months before the murder

Wilkerson emphasized that the country had to “enforce the laws that are in place and secure the border” so even illegal alien criminals who are deported are not able to just walk back into the country because “our borders are open.”

She sad those like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) who have stood up against illegal immigration “were brave” for doing so and those like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who have supported comprehensive immigration reform that would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants disgust her.

“That just makes me sick,” Wilkerson said. “Until it happens to one of their children or their grandkids they are not going to see it the same way.”

Espinoza said the Remembrance Project is engaging in a national campaign to memorializing the victims of illegal immigrants–like Wilkerson’s son–on quilts in every state.

She said Americans needed to tell lawmakers to focus on America, Americans, the debt, and citizens who are out of work.

“There is absolutely no urgency to address illegal aliens or illegal aliens’s children,” Espinoza said. “They need to focus on American families.”

Wilkerson said her son had dreams of going into the military like his brother and was a “compassionate” and “gentle” kid who “did not have an enemy.”

But now that her son is gone, Wilkerson said the illegal alien who murdered her son had “more rights than he did.” Because the illegal alien lived in a so-called sanctuary city, Wilkerson recalled that police could not even ask him the immigration status of his parents when they arrested him.

“I don’t understand it at all,” Wilkerson said."

With his ruling, Judge G. Murray Snow of United States District Court delivered the most decisive defeat so far to Sheriff Arpaio, who has come to symbolize Arizona’s strict approach to immigration enforcement by making it the leading mission for many of the 800 deputies under his command at the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.

At 142 pages, the decision is peppered with stinging criticism of the policies and practices espoused by Sheriff Arpaio, who Judge Snow said had turned much of his focus to arresting immigrants who were in the country illegally, in most cases civil violations, at the expense of fighting crimes.

He said the sheriff relied on racial profiling and illegal detentions to target Latinos, using their ethnicity as the main basis for suspecting they were in the country illegally. Many of the people targeted were American citizens or legal residents."

Cepeda: With Hispanics, Mitt Romney hasn’t learned his lesson","CHICAGO — Mitt Romney is back — and so is his foot.

As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Romney is planning on re-emerging in ways that will “help shape national priorities,” such as assisting the Republican Party as it tries to regain its footing with the non-white voters who ignored the GOP standard-bearer at the polls in 2012.

Yes, the man known for favoring the term “self-deportation” and offending scores of Hispanics by using the word “illegals” over and over again during prime-time presidential debates wants to give Republicans advice on reaching out to minorities.

Romney told the Journal that in addition to wishing his campaign had poured more money into ads targeting Hispanic voters, the GOP needs “to translate our message in a way that minorities understand.”

Honestly, of all the slips Romney committed during last year’s campaign — from letting his staffers tell Spanish-language media that he was struggling with Latinos because they were simply not well-informed to never calling out his fellow Republicans for using degrading language when speaking about immigrants or Hispanics — this latest is probably the most insulting.

Some Latino advocates spent the year leading up to the election painting him as a racist for not compromising on his views toward illegal immigration. But I always thought his biggest failure as a candidate was his inability to connect with people who aren’t rich and privileged. His terrible tone-deafness for non-whites was a close second.

Let’s unpack his recent comment starting with the tricky, loaded word “translate.” My first impression was that Romney used the word because he, like so many others, still believes that most Hispanics can’t speak English.

Can someone please get this man on the Pew Hispanic Center’s email list? Almost two-thirds of Hispanics report speaking only English, or speaking it very well, according to the nonpartisan research organization.

That sounds touchy, you say? Well, what else could he have meant? The GOP’s 2012 platform said the party wanted to “rebuild the economy and create jobs, reform government to serve the people and build healthy families, great schools and safe neighborhoods.” These concepts don’t need to be broken down into some simplified code so minorities can make sense of them.

And this is the second hot button Romney’s statement pushes. Did he not hear about how a leading Republican think tank, the Heritage Foundation, ticked off Latinos when it became known that an anti-immigration reform study was co-authored by a researcher who had authored a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation contending Hispanics have particularly low IQs?

A mere month after that deeply offensive controversy is not the time to imply that minorities have a hard time comprehending the basic tenets of an organization’s values and need special help to understand.

Actually, it’s Republicans such as Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan — who have suggested that what the GOP really needs is to double-down on white voters and lamented that “white folks are losing interest in politics and voting” — who need someone to translate for them.

Ann Telnaes animation: Ann Romney reflects on her husband’s election defeat. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Schlafly, Buchanan and others who find it silly that some Republicans think immigration reform will send Latino voters into the arms of the GOP aren’t wrong to be skeptical about such a proposition. It’s a long shot at best and Republicans are better off banking on the fact that Latinos care more about education, the economy, health care and the federal budget deficit than immigration.

But Hispanics, as with all minority voters, do care greatly about being treated with respect, which is exactly the top concern that the Republican National Committee outlined in their December 2012 treatise, “The Growth and Opportunity Project.”

In plain English, it calls on the Republican Party to “stop talking to itself,” change the “perception that the GOP does not care about people” and begin to “engage [ethnic minority voters] and show our sincerity.”

As the RNC points out, America now looks different and the GOP simply needs to deal with it in a civil manner. The report quotes tea party leader Dick Armey on the topic of tone: “You can’t call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.”

See? That’s great advice. And here’s some for Romney: If you want to help the Republicans with their Hispanic and minority outreach, just write some checks and stay out of earshot.

He Has Previously Covered Sports', 'Education', 'City Government', 'Reported Afghanistan', 'Pakistan']",Immigration proposal could be delayed,"A bipartisan Senate group on immigration legislation is attempting to craft an agreement so secure that the eight members will oppose amendments to its core provisions, an arrangement that could delay the introduction of a bill, people familiar with the negotiations said.

The senators had said they hoped to present their proposals this week, but Republican members expressed skepticism about that timetable Sunday. The group continues to negotiate issues related to new visa programs for agricultural and high-tech workers and has not reached agreement on a guest-worker program for low-skilled foreign laborers, said the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he hopes a deal can be reached “in the next couple of weeks.” A GOP Senate aide involved in the negotiations said a deal is unlikely this week because writing the bill, which is expected to be up to 1,500 pages, is going slowly.

The timetable is important because President Obama has called for a comprehensive immigration reform measure that could be approved by the Senate and House in time for him to sign it into law by the end of the year. Under the timetable eyed by the Senate group, whose proposal is expected to be the template for a potential deal, the legislation would be introduced in the Judiciary Committee this month for the amendment process.

The goal is to get the measure to the Senate floor after Memorial Day. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the lead Democrat in the bipartisan working group, remained optimistic about the time frame.

“Thus far, we are on track,” he said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “All of us have said that there will be no agreement until the eight of us agree to a big, specific bill. But hopefully we can get that done by the end of the week.”

Obama has supported the Senate group’s effort, but the president has vowed to step forward with his own legislative proposal if the senators are unable to deliver a plan in the spring.

The senators are mindful of the pitfalls of previous immigration reform efforts, when amendments by supporters and opponents in 2007 helped doom a bill in the Senate. In an attempt to head off such threats, the Senate group is trying to strike a deal in which all the members agree to oppose any amendments to the core provisions.even if they might agree with the amendments, people familiar with the talks said.

The group is concerned that if one provision is amended, the entire bill will fall apart because the deal is predicated on a comprehensive plan composed of carefully negotiated pieces.

The core provisions are likely to include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, new visa programs for low- and high-skilled workers and for agricultural workers, a reduction in some family visa categories, and increased border control and workplace security.

But ironing out the specific language at a time that the senators are still negotiating portions of it has made the drafting process laborious, said one member of the business community who has talked with the senators.

“My sense is this week is pretty unlikely,” this person said. “Just the mere writing is enough to delay past this week, but that’s not the problem. There are still substantial disagreements on almost all the major parts.”

Another labor community individual was more optimistic about the progress, but agreed that the bill would probably not be ready this week. This individual said that the senators are trying to determine which areas of the bill would be considered “core provisions” on which they will agree not to support amendments.

“No one wants there to be errors,” the individual said. “It’s a contentious process.”

Immigration advocates have begun to grow impatient, and thousands are expected to attend a rally Wednesday at the Capitol. Republicans, however, have cautioned against excessive haste.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the group who has emphasized that a deal has not been reached, received permission from the group to brief the GOP Senate caucus on the progress of the negotiations, something he probably will do Tuesday, aides said.

“He’s talking to a lot of people,” the business community individual said. “Partially, it’s over how to resolve some of these issues, but it’s also to find out how toxic this thing could be.”

As reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell sent an email warning Army officers to be on the lookout for soldiers connected with “domestic hate groups.” In his 14-page email, Rich identified groups that support traditional marriage or advocate strict border enforcement regarding illegal aliens as domestic hate groups.

This story is disturbing for several reasons, one of which is this U.S. military email was reportedly using the “domestic hate group” list created by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This radical-left organization has listed Christian organizations such as the American Family Association and Family Research Council (FRC), immigration reform groups such as FAIR, and various Tea Party organizations as “hate groups.” The SPLC publicly claims they are no different than the KKK and Neo-Nazis, groups that engage in extreme violence and acts of terrorism.

Yet SPLC has itself now been linked to a domestic terrorist. As we covered in detail, on Aug. 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins attempted to go on a mass-shooting spree at FRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. with 100 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot building manager Leo Johnson, yet the wounded Johnson disarmed Corkins, who was then captured alive.

As part of a plea deal, Corkins signed a full confession in which he admitted that he selected his targets from SPLC’s hate group list and used the map SPLC put on its website to find FRC with the intent of murdering everyone in the building (several dozen people). He called himself a political activist and was going to kill everyone in the FRC building because FRC opposes redefining marriage to include gay marriage.

Corkins was convicted on Feb. 6, 2013, of committing acts of domestic terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing that anyone in the U.S. military would use material from such ultra-left zealots, who label organizations that disagree with them on a range of issues–not just social issues like marriage, but also national security issues (immigration) and economic issues (Tea Party groups)–as “hate groups.”

Yet SPLC is the only group here that has actually been linked to a terrorist, one who was inspired to commit his despicable crime by none other than the same SPLC whose material the Obama administration’s military command is now using.

The terrible Boston bombing is a reminder what real terrorism looks like. The Obama administration needs to deal with this threat, not associate with radical-fringe organizations that convicted terrorists cite as their enablers.

Criminal cases will rely more on public as thousands take pictures and videos, he says

Unmindful of privacy, he says, a community worked together for a greater good

Kessler: Crowdsourcing in criminal investigation will happen more and more

The Boston Marathon bombing investigation made use of crowdsourcing to collect photos and video from cell phones and surveillance cameras at an unprecedented level. These pictures were made public a little more than 72 hours after the explosions and the second suspect was arrested 29 hours later.

Forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law. Digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification, acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices: computers, cell phones, digital cameras or any computer-based system.

The concept of law enforcement posting photos of wanted individuals in a public place and asking for assistance is hardly new; walk into any post office and you will still see the FBI Most Wanted poster. Why the post office? Because it used to be the social center of a town, a place where the government and the people regularly came together.

Fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event. Law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects. And most of this imagery came from private citizens.

Gary Kessler

Personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years. The Internet has been commercially available for 20 years. Mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones, in particular, for more than five. Computers, networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper, instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades.

Smartphones are everywhere and offer the equivalent of a portable Internet terminal. Not only do cell phones contain a phone book, call history and text messages, but also Web browser history, email, Global Positioning System and other location information. And surprisingly high-quality pictures and video.

All of this information will be of value to investigators. They will want to know who the suspects might have been communicating with in the immediate aftermath of the bombings and, again, in the aftermath of their pictures being posted in the media. The larger investigation will undoubtedly examine their text and email messages, social media postings, Web sites visited and calls made over the last few months and years. This digital forensic evidence will help piece together patterns of behavior that could provide insights into the suspects' thoughts and deeds, and even provide new leads.

What does this mean for privacy rights? Consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection, or purchase a drone, there is often a public outcry. Is the camera an invasion of privacy? Where will it be looking? How will the government use the data? How long will the data be kept? Will it be used to track my movements? At some level, these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.

Yet, in Boston, a lot of the images came not from public-sector cameras but from private-sector cameras: our fellow citizens. Fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job.

Were these people violating the rights of others by sharing their pictures? Well, no, considering that the Bill of Rights was intended to protect us against a tyrannical government rather than from each other. Indeed, it is not clear that the government could have compelled these citizens to turn over their pictures just in case they might be useful; imagine persuading a judge to sign a search warrant on such pure speculation.

Yet, citizens stepped forward to offer their help, a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government.

Although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security, it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends, family and strangers. They were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community.

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly offer citizens a right of privacy, although many court decisions certainly support such an ideal. Indeed, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis is well known for his observation, ""The right to be left alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.""

Your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of Facebook and Google than from the government. Commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money. How?

We, our information, have become their commodity. They have more money, motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does. We, as users of social media, self-exploit; we post our information voluntarily. Yet, once posted, we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it.

Although the use of the crowdsourcing metaphor may be new as it applies to a criminal investigation, it is almost certain we will see more of this in the future. And it is sure to renew questions about how we all are invading each other's privacy and personal space.

It also points to the incredible resiliency of the U.S. Constitution and its ability to guide us in a modern era, yet why it needs constant interpretation. As technologies evolve that the Founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society."
http://news.yahoo.com/report-nsa-contract-worker-surveillance-source-185911834.html,,[],Report: NSA contract worker is surveillance source,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A 29-year-old intelligence contractor who claims to have worked at the National Security Agency and the CIA allowed himself to be revealed Sunday as the source of disclosures about the U.S. government's secret surveillance programs, risking prosecution by the U.S. government.

The leaks have reopened the post-Sept. 11 debate about privacy concerns versus heightened measure to protect against terrorist attacks, and led the NSA to ask the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation into the leaks.

The Guardian, the first paper to disclose the documents, said it was publishing the identity of Edward Snowden, a former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, at his own request.

""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,"" Snowden told the newspaper.

Stories in The Guardian and The Washington Post published over the last week revealed two surveillance programs, and both published interviews with Snowden on Sunday.

One of them is a phone records monitoring program in which the NSA gathers hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records each day, creating a database through which it can learn whether terror suspects have been in contact with people in the U.S. The Obama administration says the NSA program does not listen to actual conversations.

Separately, an Internet scouring program, code-named PRISM, allows the NSA and FBI to tap directly into nine U.S. Internet companies to gather all Internet usage — audio, video, photographs, emails and searches. The effort is designed to detect suspicious behavior that begins overseas.

Snowden said claims the programs are secure are not true.

""Any analyst at any time can target anyone. Any selector. Anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of those sensor networks and the authority that that analyst is empowered with,"" Snowden said, in accompanying video on the Guardian's website. ""Not all analysts have the power to target anything. But I, sitting at my desk, had the authority to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email.""

Story continues

He told the Post that he would ""ask for asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy"" in an interview from Hong Kong, where he is staying.

""I'm not going to hide,"" Snowden told the Post. ""Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.""

The Post declined to elaborate on its reporting about Snowden.

The spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, Shawn Turner, said intelligence officials are ""currently reviewing the damage that has been done by these recent disclosures,"" adding that ""Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law.""

He referred further comment to the Justice Department.

""The Department of Justice is in the initial stages of an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information by an individual with authorized access,"" said Nanda Chitre, Justice Department spokeswoman. ""Consistent with longstanding department policy and procedure and in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, we must decline further comment.""

In a statement, Booz Allen confirmed that Snowden ""has been an employee of our firm for less than 3 months, assigned to a team in Hawaii."" The statement said if the news reports of what he has leaked prove accurate, ""this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct,"" and the company promised to work closely with authorities on the investigation.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has decried the revelation of the intelligence-gathering programs as reckless and said it has done ""huge, grave damage."" In recent days, he took the rare step of declassifying some details about them to respond to media reports about counterterrorism techniques employed by the government.

Snowden told The Guardian that he lacked a high school diploma and enlisted in the U.S. Army until he was discharged because of an injury, and later worked as a security guard with the NSA.

He later went to work for the CIA as an information technology employee and by 2007 was stationed in Geneva, Switzerland, where he had access to classified documents.

During that time, he considered going public about the nation's secretive programs but told the newspaper he decided against it, because he did not want to put anyone in danger and he hoped Obama's election would curtail some of the clandestine programs.

He said he was disappointed that Obama did not rein in the surveillance programs.

""Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world,"" he told The Guardian. ""I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.""

Snowden left the CIA in 2009 to join a private contractor, and spent last four years at the NSA, as a contractor with consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton and, before that, Dell.

The Guardian reported that Snowden was working in an NSA office in Hawaii when he copied the last of the documents he planned to disclose and told supervisors that he needed to be away for a few weeks to receive treatment for epilepsy.

Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald, who filed the initial news reports on the programs, declined comment Sunday when contacted in a Hong Kong hotel lobby by The Associated Press.

""I'm not going to talk to you, and I don't have any information to give you,"" he said.

A sign advertising Century 21 realtor Kerri Jo Heim sits on the grass outside the blue-and-white house where Snowden and his girlfriend lived in a quiet neighborhood in Waipahu, West Oahu.

Heim says the couple moved out on May 1, leaving nothing behind. She said last Wednesday police came by asking where they went, but she didn't know.

Snowden left for Hong Kong on May 20 and has remained there since, according to the newspaper. Snowden is quoted as saying he chose that city because ""they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent"", and because he believed it was among the spots on the globe that could and would resist the dictates of the U.S. government.

""I feel satisfied that this was all worth it. I have no regrets,"" Snowden told The Guardian, which said he asked to be identified after several days of interviews.

Iceland's International Modern Media Institute, a free press group, said it had yet to hear from Snowden directly. But in a statement the institute said it would do what it could to help the former intelligence worker find asylum and was already working to set up a meeting with Iceland's newly appointed interior minister.

Snowden could face decades in a U.S. jail for revealing classified information if he is successfully extradited from Hong Kong, said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Hong Kong had an extradition treaty with the United States that took force in 1998, according to the U.S. State Department website.

""If it's a straight leak of classified information, the government could subject him to a 10 or 20 year penalty for each count,"" with each document leaked considered a separate charge, Zaid said.

Hong Kong, though part of China, is partly autonomous and has a Western-style legal system that is a legacy from the territory's past as a British colony. A U.S.-Hong Kong extradition treaty has worked smoothly in the past. Hong Kong extradited three al-Qaeda suspects to the U.S. in 2003, for example.

But the treaty comes with important exceptions. Key provisions allow a request to be rejected if it is deemed to be politically motivated or that the suspect would not receive a fair trial. Beijing may also block an extradition of Chinese nationals from Hong Kong for national security reasons.

Snowden told the newspaper he believes the government could try to charge him with treason under the Espionage Act, but Zaid said that would require the government to prove he had intent to betray the United States, whereas he publicly made it clear he did this to spur debate.

The government could also make an argument that the NSA leaks have aided the enemy — as military prosecutors have claimed against Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, who faces life in prison under military law if convicted for releasing a trove of classified documents through Wikileaks.

""They could say the revelation of the (NSA) programs could instruct people to change tactics,"" Zaid said. But even under the lesser charges of simply revealing classified information, ""you are talking potentially decades in jail, loss of his employment and his security clearance.""

Officials said the revelations were dangerous and irresponsible. House intelligence committee member Peter King, R-NY, called for Snowden to be ""extradited from Hong Kong immediately...and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" in an interview with The Associated Press Sunday.

""I believe the leaker has done extreme damage to the U.S. and to our intelligence operations,"" King said, by alerting al-Qaida to U.S. surveillance, and by spooking U.S. service providers who now might fight sharing data in future with the U.S. government, now that the system has been made public.

King added that intelligence and law enforcement professionals he'd spoken to since the news broke were also concerned that Snowden might be taken into custody by Chinese intelligence agents and questioned about CIA and NSA spies and policies.

""To be a whistleblower, there would have to be a pattern of him filing complaints through appropriate channels to his supervisors,"" said Ambassador John Negroponte, the first director of national intelligence, in an interview with the AP Sunday. ""For me, it's just an outright case of betrayal of confidences and a violation of his nondisclosure agreement.""

President Barack Obama, Clapper and others have said the programs are authorized by Congress and subject to strict supervision of a secret court.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/04/jeb-bush-book_n_2806602.html,2013-03-04 00:00:00,['Deputy Enterprise Editor'],Jeb Bush Book: Undocumented Immigrants Should Be Ineligible For Citizenship,"WASHINGTON -- In a new book, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) makes a notable reversal on immigration reform, arguing that creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would only encourage future unauthorized immigration.

""It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences -- in this case, that those who violated the law can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship,"" Bush and lawyer Clint Bolick argue in a new book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution. ""To do otherwise would signal once again that people who circumvent the system can still obtain the full benefits of American citizenship.""

The book, which The Huffington Post obtained before its Tuesday release, lays out the two men's proposals for comprehensive immigration reform. Both are longtime proponents of reform, and Bush in particular has long beat the drum for the GOP to take a new tone on the matter.

But the book's treatment of a pathway to citizenship stands in contrast to Bush's previous statements on immigration reform. And ironically, later in the book Bush argues that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, suffered immense political damage by moving to the right on the issue during the GOP primary.

""Mitt Romney moved so far to the right on immigration issues that it proved all but impossible for him to appeal to Hispanic voters in the general election,"" Bush and Bolick write. ""Although Romney eventually called for comprehensive immigration reform, a platform that hardened the party's stance on immigration hung like an anvil around his candidacy,"" they continue.

Bush's reversal doesn't appear as severe as some of the tough rhetoric used by Romney during the primary. Still, it creates a contrast between him and some of Bush's possible 2016 Republican primary opponents, and shows what could be the biggest problem in finding a compromise on immigration reform this year. While some Republicans, including potential 2016 candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), are calling for a pathway to citizenship, most members of the party are arguing for only legalization. Democrats, meanwhile, argue a special road to become citizens is absolutely necessary. The American people for the most part also support such a measure, according to a number of polls.

As of June 2012, Bush asserted that he supported a pathway to citizenship.

""You have to deal with this issue,"" Bush told CBS' Charlie Rose. ""You can't ignore it, and so either a path to citizenship, which I would support -- and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives -- or ... a path ... to residency of some kind.""

In the book, however, Bush and Bolick write that there should be ""two penalties for illegal entry: fines and/or community service and ineligibility for citizenship.""

They don't fully rule out citizenship, however, despite what that sentence implies. Although Bush and Bolick state there should be no special pathway, they say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to go through normal channels to naturalize by going to their native country to apply. That process currently requires three- or 10-year bars and no guarantee of return, making it untenable to many undocumented immigrants.

""A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage,"" they write. ""However, illegal immigrants who wish to become citizens should have the choice of returning to their native countries and applying through normal immigration processes that now would be much more open than before.""

Bush and Bolick propose a different solution for Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. They argue citizenship should be granted to people who entered the country under the age of 18, have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, committed no ""significant crimes"" and either graduated from high school, obtained a GED or entered military service.

For legal immigration, they argue there must be a better process that makes it less appealing to come to the United States without authorization.

""There is one reason above all others that we have millions of illegal immigrants in our country: because under our current immigration system, there is no lawful avenue for them to enter the country. ... So that saying 'they should wait in line like everyone else' is hollow because there is no line in which to wait,"" they write. ""The days in which people could lawfully emigrate to the United States just because they wanted to pursue the American Dream are as much a memory as Ellis Island.""

UPDATE: 2:55 p.m. -- Bush defended his stance to the Miami Herald's Marc Caputo after an anonymous Romney adviser accused him of advocating for the same positions that he said tanked the former GOP presidential candidate.

""[I] am not advocating self deportation. read the book,"" Bush wrote in an email.

The advisor argued to Caputo that it was the same stance.

""Where the hell was this Jeb Bush during the campaign?"" the advisor said. ""He spent all this time criticizing Romney and it turns out he has basically the same position. So he wants people to go back to their country and apply for citizenship? Well, that's self deportation. We got creamed for talking about that. And now Jeb is saying the same thing."""

Kelly (R-PA): Consultants 'Drinking Brandy and Smoking Cigars' Wrote Senate Immigration Bill,"Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News he is confident House Republicans as a whole will stop the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, and take up an alternative aimed at securing the border before handling anything else.

“I can’t say exactly what’s going to happen in the future, but based on what I know now and based on what I know about leadership, I would say that we’re not going to see this thing get watered down [to get a version of it passed],” Kelly said. “Our conference is a very strong and independent conference.

“Sometimes folks get upset about that and I know why they do. But on the other hand, these folks I serve with are very principled and I don’t think they’re going to yield anything because they were promised a certain process was going to take place. I don’t think the Speaker was going to promise that if he wasn’t going to live up to it. I have a lot of respect for him, but he’s made commitments and I’ve never yet seen him break away on a commitment. I see him remain pretty strong.”

Kelly said that members of Congress should have learned from the 1986 amnesty that border security needs to come before legalization. He added that Congress should have learned from Obamacare that massive pieces of legislation, like this 1,200-page immigration bill, should not be rushed through to passage.

“If we did not learn anything from 1986, if we didn’t learn anything from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that big pieces of legislation shoved through in a hurry are dangerous, they are dangerous for people,” Kelly said.

“I’m disappointed in the Senate. I’m disappointed in our colleagues in the Senate for doing what they did. I think they really made it look like they tried to put it in the House to position it as ‘these Republicans are going to try to hold it up.’ The Speaker has said that we will break this into smaller pieces. We will have a heavy debate, not a conversation–that’s ridiculous–there’s going to be a heavy debate and we’re going to look at it. And I still, I can’t imagine anybody looking at this piece that came out of the Senate and saying ‘you know, I feel pretty good about this.’ If I’m one of the four and a half million [legal immigrants] standing in line, waiting in line and who played by the rules, I’m not feeling very good about it. I’m not feeling very good about this at all.”

Kelly said he thinks much of the misconception about what may or may not happen in the House moving forward is contrived by pundits, especially the common theme that assumes House Republicans will cave and pass a bill like the Senate one. “The pundits say ‘oh no, they’ll cave, they’ll give in to pressure, they’ll do this, they’ll do that, because they know if they don’t they won’t win the next election,'” Kelly said. “I don’t buy that. We lost the last election because we didn’t have enough of our people come out and vote.”

Kelly added: “You and I both know a lot of this stuff comes from these people sitting around drinking brandy and smoking cigars and have never been a part of this but are actually trying to drive opinion and drive policy,” Kelly said. “They say ‘this is the way it’s got to be or it can’t float.'”

“‘Well, you’ve never been in a boat. How do you know what makes it float?'”

“These people are wrong as much as they’re right but they don’t get held accountable for the things that they do that are wrong,” Kelly said."
http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/18/business/la-fi-tsa-rapiscan-20130119,2013-01-18 00:00:00,[],Controversial full-body scanners to be removed from airports,"The Transportation Security Administration is removing controversial full-body scanners made by a Torrance manufacturer, winning praise from privacy advocates and passenger-rights groups that raised questions about the health effects of the devices.

Rapiscan, a unit of OSI Systems Inc., manufactured about 200 full-body scanners used by the TSA to screen passengers for hidden weapons at airports across the country. The machines generated a storm of protest because the devices use low levels of radiation to create what resembles a nude image of screened passengers.

The machines, one of two types of scanners used by the TSA for passenger screening, will be pulled from all airports by this summer. The TSA had already begun to remove the Rapiscan scanners from Los Angeles International Airport in October to replace them with faster screening machines.

The agency won’t use the Rapiscan full-body scanners because the company could not produce a software upgrade to protect the privacy of passengers in time to meet a congressional deadline, according to TSA and Rapsican officials.

Privacy advocates and others praised the move, saying the scanners violated the privacy of passengers and exposed them to unhealthy levels of radiation — a charge the TSA denies.

“This is a significant victory for privacy,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group that sued to try to force the TSA to hold public hearings over the deployment of full-body scanners at airports. “The announcement by the TSA is recognition that if devices don’t respect the privacy of the public, they don’t belong here.”

Rapiscan has agreed to pay the cost of removing its scanners from airports. Most will be replaced by a second type of scanner that uses radio waves and shows hidden objects projected onto a generic avatar image on a screen — not on a nude-like image of a passenger. Those scanners are built by New York-based L-3 Communications Holdings.

“It’s good news and a step in the right direction,” said Brandon M. Macsata, executive director of the Assn. for Airline Passenger Rights, an advocacy group that has questioned the health effects of the X-ray scans on passengers. “We still have questions about whether these machines really make airports that much safer.”

The Rapiscan scanners use low-level X-rays to create what looks like a naked image of screened passengers to uncover weapons hidden under clothes. TSA officers in isolated rooms see the images and then notify other agents at the security lines if hidden weapons are spotted.

Since 2007, the TSA has used full-body scanners, in addition to metal detectors and random pat-down searches, to try to prevent terrorists from sneaking explosives onto planes. But the TSA has been accused by privacy groups, members of Congress and others of using extreme tactics.

Responding to questions about the safety of the scanners, TSA officials said the machines have been repeatedly tested by medical experts and found to expose passengers to levels of radiation well below safe health standards.

To address privacy concerns, Congress imposed a June 2013 deadline for Rapiscan to come up with a software upgrade that would prevent the scanner from showing TSA agents the nude-like images. But Rapiscan officials said the company wouldn’t be able to meet that deadline.

“TSA has strict requirements that all vendors must meet for security effectiveness and efficiency since the use of this technology is critical to TSA’s efforts to keep the traveling public safe,” the TSA said in a statement.

Rapiscan representatives called the TSA decision “unfortunate” but noted that they fulfilled their $15-million contract to build the machines and continue to produce security devices for the TSA, including luggage scanners and metal detectors.

Peter Kant, executive vice president of Rapiscan, said his company won’t collect on the $5-million contract to complete the software upgrade and must pay for the cost of removing the existing scanners from airports across the country. But he added: “For a $400-million company, that’s a pretty small number.”

The scanners that will be removed from airports will be used by the military and federal law enforcement, among other government agencies, for security screening, Kant said.

Rapiscan has more than 1,000 employees worldwide and reported nearly $400 million in sales in 2012.

One reason the NSA's PR offensive must be so vigorous is that its old PR strategy sounds a lot like lies. In a March 12 Senate hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, ""Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" Clapper responded, ""No, sir... Not wittingly."" Since last week, it's become clear that Clapper's statement was not exactly true. Clapper's given a series of interviews to explain the comment, each time getting closer to admitting that what he said was not true. [...] Clapper wasn't the only official who was cute with facts. In February, NSA general counsel Rajesh De gave a speech to debunk ""false myths"" about the agency. Those were that the NSA ""is a vacuum that indiscriminately sweeps up and stores global communications""; that it ""is spying on Americans at home and abroad with questionable or no legal basis""; and that it ""operates in the shadows free from external scrutiny or any true accountability."" De's debunking has been debunked.

If ever tyranny overtakes this land of the sometimes free and home of the intermittently brave, it probably won’t, contrary to the fever dreams of gun rights extremists, involve jack-booted government thugs rappelling down from black helicopters. Rather, it will involve changes to words on paper many have forgotten or never knew, changes that chip away until they strip away, precious American freedoms. It will involve a trade of sorts, an inducement to give up the reality of freedom for the illusion of security. Indeed, the bargain has already been struck. [...] People think tyranny will be imposed at the point of a gun. Paranoids look up in search of black helicopters. Meanwhile, the architecture of totalitarianism is put into place all around them, surveillance apparatus so intrusive as to stagger the imagination of Orwell himself. The point is not that one has nothing to hide. The point is that whatever you have is none of the government’s business absent probable cause and a warrant. The point is that one should never repose unfettered power with the state. We should know this, yet we fall for the same seductive con every time: We are afraid, but the state says it can make us safe. And all it will take is the surrender of a few small freedoms.

The U.S. military's effort to prosecute, punish and curtail sexual assaults has failed miserably, despite a chest-thumping zero-tolerance policy and repeated assurances it would get the job done. A dramatically different approach is clearly necessary. [...] Gillibrand's fix would give military prosecutors the authority to decide which sexual misconduct cases go to trial. And it would end commanders' power to reverse convictions and sentences. That would ensure victims could trust they would no longer face retaliation or career-crippling marginalization for reporting assaults, and that their attackers would be prosecuted and punished. In announcing her intent to take the fight for these reforms to the Senate floor, Gillibrand is showing that the voices of the growing number of women in the chamber cannot be dismissed.

Cracking down on retaliation, though necessary, does not address the low prosecution rate or the sense among many victims that their claims, especially against someone higher in rank, will not be believed. It is distressing that two decades of scandals could not persuade Mr. Levin to budge from his decision to support the military brass. Ms. Gillibrand says she will try again to get her measure included when the full Senate takes up the defense spending bill. She has done a diligent job of building a bipartisan coalition pressing for more sweeping change, and further debate about the sexual assault problem and its solutions can help strengthen the result when the Senate negotiates a final bill with the House.

With the grace of Charlie Sheen and the subtlety of a sitcom, the manly men [of the House Judiciary Committee] voted down a Democratic effort to add enhanced protections for the life and health of the mother. They voted down a Democratic amendment that would allow exceptions for women with heart or lung disease or diabetes. They even voted down an amendment that would have made exceptions for victims of rape or incest. If that weren’t enough, the chief sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), had a Todd Akin moment as he attempted to argue that women aren’t likely to become pregnant from rape. Franks provided his variation of “legitimate rape” theory when he argued against the rape-and-incest exception because the amendment didn’t require women to report the crime.

http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/judge-orders-google-turn-over-data-fbi-6C10157219/,2013-06-01 16:13:00+00:00,['Paul Elias'],Judge orders Google to turn over data to FBI,"A federal judge has ruled that Google Inc. must comply with the FBI's warrantless demands for customer data, rejecting the company's argument that the government's practice of issuing so-called national security letters to telecommunication companies, Internet service providers, banks and others was unconstitutional and unnecessary.

FBI counter-terrorism agents began issuing the secret letters, which don't require a judge's approval, after Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The letters are used to collect unlimited kinds of sensitive, private information, such as financial and phone records and have prompted complaints of government privacy violations in the name of national security. Many of Google's services, including its dominant search engine and the popular Gmail application, have become daily habits for millions of people.

In a ruling written May 20 and obtained Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston ordered Google to comply with the FBI's demands.

But she put her ruling on hold until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide the matter. Until then, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company must comply with the letters unless it shows the FBI didn't follow proper procedures in making its demands for customer data in the 19 letters Google is challenging, she said.

After receiving sworn statements from two top-ranking FBI officials, Illston said she was satisfied that 17 of the 19 letters were issued properly. She wanted more information on two other letters.

It was unclear from the judge's ruling what type of information the government sought to obtain with the letters. It was also unclear who the government was targeting.

The decision from the San Francisco-based Illston comes several months after she ruled in a separate case brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation over the letters. She ruled in March that the FBI's demand that recipients refrain from telling anyone — including customers — that they had received the letters was a violation of free speech rights.

Kurt Opsah, an attorney with the foundation, said it could be many more months before the appeals court rules on the constitutionality of the letters in the Google case.

""We are disappointed that the same judge who declared these letters unconstitutional is now requiring compliance with them,"" Opsah said on Friday.

Illston's May 20 order omits any mention of Google or that the proceedings have been closed to the public. But the judge said ""the petitioner"" was involved in a similar case filed on April 22 in New York federal court.

Public records show that on that same day, the federal government filed a ""petition to enforce National Security Letter"" against Google after the company declined to cooperate with government demands.

Google can still appeal Illston's decision. The company declined comment Friday.

In 2007, the Justice Department's inspector general found widespread violations in the FBI's use of the letters, including demands without proper authorization and information obtained in non-emergency circumstances. The FBI has tightened oversight of the system.

The FBI made 16,511 national security letter requests for information regarding 7,201 people in 2011, the latest data available."

The Defense Department recently announced it would be giving domestic law enforcement forces hulking vehicles designed to efficiently maneuver in a war zone for use in thwarting any potential high-scale activity.

This did not sit well with those who see a troubling trend: the militarization of local police departments, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which has criticized the Defense Department for giving 18-ton, $500,000 armor-protected military fighting vehicles to local forces.

ACLU affiliates have been collecting 2012 records to determine the extent of military hardware and tactics sent to police and plan to issue a report early next year.

""One of our concerns with this is it has a tendency to escalate violence,"" said ACLU Center for Justice senior counsel Kara Dansky.

An Associated Press investigation of the Defense Department military surplus program this year found that a disproportionate share of the $4.2 billion worth of property distributed since 1990 — everything from blankets to bayonets and Humvees — has been obtained by police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.

Ohio State University campus police got one vehicle, saying they would use it in large-scale emergencies and to provide a police presence on football game days. Others went to police in High Springs, Fla., and the sheriff's office in Dallas County, Texas.

In New York, the Albany County sheriff's department already had four smaller military-surplus Humvees, which have been used for storm evacuations and to pull trees out of roadways. Their new Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle will go into service after technicians remove the gun turret and change the paint from military sand to civilian black.

Sheriff Craig Apple rejected the idea that the nation's police forces are becoming too militaristic.

""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" he said. ""Our problem is we have to make sure we are prepared to respond to every type of crisis.""

To be sure, there has been some concerns raised in the past.

Radley Balko, the author of ""The Rise of the Warrior Cop,"" argues that the police mind set in the country is to be like a soldier.

""Instead of bringing soldiers in to do domestic law enforcement, we have allowed, and even encouraged, police officers to basically be armed like, police like, use the tactics of, be dressed like and adopt the mind set of these soldiers,"" he said at a CSPAN forum last summer. ""And the outcome is just as troubling, I think, as if the military were actually doing domestic police themselves.""

In October, Reuters ran a column by Michael Shank and Elizabeth Beavers called ""The Militarization of U.S. Police Forces"" in which the authors called for Congress to permanently ban the transfer of all military-grade equipment to U.S. cities.

The column noted the Pentagon's 1033 Program that allows the Defense Department to donate its surplus equipment. It pointed out allegations of fraud and abuse and called some of the machinery donated ""impractical.""

""Shocking, almost comical, examples of abuse have been well-documented — from the officer who sold his weapons on eBay, to the one who lent his weapons to unauthorized friends and the police departments that lost the military weapons or tried to auction them off,"" the column said.

For police and sheriff's departments, which have scooped up 165 of the mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPS, since they became available this summer, the price and the ability to deliver shock and awe while serving warrants or dealing with hostage standoffs was, however, just too good to pass up.

""It's armored. It's heavy. It's intimidating. And it's free,"" said Apple.

Only hours later, Snowden released a statement railing against the U.S. government.

Russia was one of about 20 countries that the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which has been assisting Snowden in exile, said it had approached for asylum on Snowden's behalf. Others included China, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, India, Nicaragua and Spain.

Putin told reporters that Russia won't hand Snowden over to U.S. authorities, but he said there would be strings attached if he wants to remain in Moscow.

""If he likes to stay here, there is one condition: He should cease his work aimed at damaging our American partners. No matter how strange it will sound from me,"" Putin told reporters, adding that Snowden isn't working for Russian intelligence.

He said he doubted Snowden would curtail his activities and suggested that the former National Security Agency contractor should figure out which country he wants to wind up in and ""move there.""

Snowden left the U.S. for Hong Kong before he allegedly leaked top-secret details of U.S. surveillance programs and was charged with espionage. With the help of WikiLeaks, he traveled to Moscow eight days ago.

The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but President Barack Obama noted that Snowden traveled to Moscow without legal papers and referred to ""high-level"" discussions between the two countries about the case.

""We are hopeful that the Russian government makes decisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions that law enforcement have,"" Obama said.

It was thought that Snowden would eventually head for Ecuador, but the president of the South American country said this week that no asylum request was sent and suggested Russia would make the call on when Snowden could leave and where he would go.

And in a statement released late Monday through WikiLeaks, Snowden claimed the White House is pressuring other countries to deny him asylum.

""The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,"" his statement said.

""This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me,"" he added.

""Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.""

While Snowden remains in legal limbo, new claims about U.S. surveillance based on his purported leaks continue to emerge.

Obama addressed reports that the NSA has bugged America's European allies with something of a shrug, saying it should not be a surprise that intelligence agencies seek ""additional insight beyond what's available through open sources.”

""If that weren't the case, then there'd be no use for an intelligence service,"" Obama told reporters while traveling in Africa.

“And I guarantee you that in European capitals there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders,” he added.

“That's how intelligence services operate.”

He said his team would look into the allegations and report back to European Union allies, who have expressed concern and, in some cases, outrage.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who is traveling in Brunei, echoed Obama's statement.

""I will say that every country in the world that is engaged in international affairs of national security undertakes lots of activities to protect its national security, and all kinds of information contributes to that, and all I know is that that is not unusual for lots of nations,"" he said.

""But beyond that, I'm not going to comment any further until I have all of the facts and find out precisely what the situation is.""

But many conservatives made clear they rejected that contention. They remain deeply skeptical of any plan that would create a way for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country to become citizens.

“The last time we talked about this in 2007, it sounded very seductive. When we saw the details, it was clear it wouldn’t work,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said. Sessions said he was concerned that the Obama administration was not committed to securing the borders to thwart illegal immigration.

On the Senate floor, Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) sounded implacable. “We have history as a guide, and history suggests that this brand of comprehensive reform … is a recipe for failure,” he said.

Twenty-two GOP senators who opposed the failed 2007 plan for immigration reform are still in the Senate, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. By contrast, just two of the 12 Republicans who backed it are still in Congress: Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

McCain, who worked on the new compromise, bluntly replied, “Elections,” when asked what improved the outlook in Congress to pass an overhaul. His own history illustrates his point: He was the main GOP advocate for reform in 2007, but he backed off when he ran for president in 2008.

“The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens,” McCain said at a news conference with four other senators. “We realize that there are many issues in which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens.”

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who worked with McCain and others on the compromise, agreed that the political environment had shifted. “For the first time ever, there’s more political risk in opposing immigration reform than in supporting it,” he said.

The failure Republican candidates experienced with Latino voters in November has galvanized the attention of party strategists and many elected officials. Advocates for the reform plan hope that a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, which Schumer predicted, will pressure the House to act.

The immigration blueprint unveiled Monday contains many similarities to the 2007 legislation, including a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But the architects of the current plan made a number of adjustments to try to satisfy liberal and conservative critics.

The framework, for example, includes additional steps to enforce border security, a longtime demand by many Republican lawmakers. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who worked on the plan and at times spoke in Spanish during Monday’s news conference, later told a conservative radio host that he would “not support any law that does not ensure the enforcement things happen.”

The support from Rubio, a potential presidential hopeful, is seen as particularly key in bringing others in his party along. But another Latino newcomer, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said in a statement that he had “deep concerns with the proposed path to citizenship.”

In the House, some Republicans who have been reluctant to pursue comprehensive reform welcomed the Senate outline, including House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who issued a carefully worded response. But Republican resistance promises to be intense. Many represent districts where any proposal that could be characterized as “amnesty” for illegal immigrants sparks angry opposition.

“It’s one thing for a senator who has a statewide electorate to be able to make the case on this issue. In the House, you have a different demographic base,” said Luke Frans of Resurgent Republic, a conservative research group that has been closely studying the Latino vote.

House conservatives made clear Monday that nothing in the new proposal changed their minds.

“When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration,” said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas). “By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.”

Smith was instrumental in stopping earlier attempts to overhaul the immigration system from his former perch as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. His successor, Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), handled immigration cases as a private practice lawyer in Roanoke. His voting record on immigration is nearly identical to Smith’s, but Goodlatte did not dismiss the proposal.

“Our nation’s immigration system is in desperate need of repair, and it is not working as efficiently and fairly as it should be,” Goodlatte said, promising to look at the Senate plan.

Most of the Republicans on the committee, including Goodlatte, have consistently voted against bills that would expand the number of immigrants allowed into the country. But some see moves by the House leadership to put calmer voices in key positions as an indication the committee may be more open to engaging in the immigration debate.

“Do I see a change in tone on how they are talking about the issue? Absolutely,” said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican strategist at the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Washington-based nonprofit group. “We have the environment where it can happen.”

A bipartisan group of House members also plans to introduce an immigration overhaul bill similar to the Senate proposal before President Obama’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12, a congressional aide said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney welcomed the Senate proposal as “movement and progress.”

On Tuesday, Obama will travel to Las Vegas to push the immigration proposal he outlined in May 2011. He plans to insist that any reform be comprehensive, such as the bipartisan Senate plan, which the president believes tracks with his approach, said aides who requested anonymity to discuss internal White House talks. The president also plans to urge Congress to move swiftly.

Schumer said lawmakers planned to write a bill by March, with a Senate vote by late spring or summer.

Advertisement

Though McCain welcomed the president’s public push for reform, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said he worried the president’s involvement could curb support from Republicans.

“If we can keep everybody on the same message and not try to move the ball too much, I think we can get something done in a bipartisan manner,” he said. “But if he tries to move it too far on the left — I just don’t want to lose the support that we have on our side.”

Advertisement

A range of outside groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Service Employees International Union, reacted positively to the Senate plan. But NumbersUSA, a Virginia-based advocacy group that lobbies to reduce immigration levels, dismissed the proposal as “all the same old tired ideas.”

And some immigrant rights groups applauded the proposal but worried that it would make a pathway to citizenship contingent on first securing the border.

“What measurable outcome are they looking for, with respect to being able to say the border is completely secure?” asked Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. “Can the border ever be completely secure?”

Such legislation has passed the House twice with large bipartisan majorities, and in 2009 a version won the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee — only to stall after the hemorrhage of classified documents from the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

A lot of people I respect, including some eminent journalists, have questioned the idea that Congress should exempt reporters from the civic duty to give evidence. Anthony Lewis, the Times correspondent, columnist and self-taught legal scholar who died this year, worried six years ago that giving reporters an inviolable right to protect sources might make it hard for someone who had been ruined by false allegations to find his accuser and get justice. Walter Pincus, the veteran Washington Post investigator who has himself been a target of leak-hunting subpoenas, argues that a shield law would make the press too beholden to Congress and subject to a worrisome degree of government regulation. He insists that the right to protect sources already exists in law. (The Supreme Court, in its 1972 ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes, failed to find such a right in the Constitution, but a few federal judges have found it in common law. The fact that every state in the country except Wyoming offers a measure of protection for confidential sources has persuaded some judges that this is society’s will, even if Congress has not yet said so.)

Pincus and other critics complain that a sanctimonious press is quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment but often slow to acknowledge that some secrets are worth keeping. A closer look at the two cases currently fueling media indignation suggests they have a point.

In the first case, The Associated Press disclosed last year that the C.I.A. had thwarted a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner. The initial scoop uncorked a gusher of sensitive details as other news organizations raced to advance the story and the Obama administration tried to supply some self-serving context. So we now know this: A C.I.A.-Saudi-British operation planted a mole inside the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The agent volunteered to blow up an airliner using a new bomb designed to get past airport security. Instead, he turned over the device to his handlers."

* Says unaware of son's plans, believes he is not disclosing information

* Russia has not disclosed Snowden's location

By Steve Gutterman

MOSCOW, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden's father arrived in Moscow on Thursday to see his son, who was granted asylum in Russia after he leaked details of government surveillance programmes and fled the United States.

Speaking at the same Moscow airport where his fugitive son was stranded for weeks this summer, Lon Snowden said he had no direct contact with Edward Snowden but that he felt ""extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free"".

The younger Snowden, 30, is wanted in the United States on espionage charges and Russia's decision to grant him temporary asylum aggravated already tense relations between Moscow and Washington.

Russian authorities and the Russian lawyer who is assisting Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, have not disclosed his location.

""I am not sure my son will be returning to the U.S. again. That's his decision, he is an adult, he is a person who is responsible for his own agency,"" Lon Snowden said, standing beside Kucherena at Sheremetyevo airport.

""I am his father, I love my son and I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,"" Snowden said.

Edward Snowden was the source of disclosures about U.S. government surveillance that included details about a program that collected e-mails, chat logs and other types of data from companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.

""I really have no idea what his intentions are,"" Lon Snowden said, citing his lack of direct contact with him.

But he said he believed Snowden had not been involved in the publication of any information since he arrived in Russia and was ""simply trying to remain healthy and safe"".

Directly from the airport, he and the lawyer drove to a state television studio to give an exclusive live interview, indicating the visit was under strong government control.

Kucherena, who said he last saw Edward Snowden on Wednesday, expressed hope the former intelligence contractor would soon find a job in Russia - possibly in IT or human rights sector - because he has largely run out of his savings and was living modestly, mainly of donations.

He also said the fugitive American lived under security in Russia and was avoiding publicity because of the U.S. chase after him.

NO HANDOVER

Snowden, who worked as a systems administrator at a U.S. National Security Agency facility in Hawaii, fled to Hong Kong in June and then flew to Moscow. The United States annulled his passport and urged nations in Latin America and elsewhere not to take him in or help him find refuge from U.S. prosecution.

President Vladimir Putin rejected repeated American pleas to hand Snowden over to the United States but has denied Russia had any role in Snowden's disclosures or that its intelligence agencies were working with him in any way.

Putin has used Snowden's case to accuse the United States of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home.

After Snowden was granted asylum, on Aug. 1, U.S. President Barack Obama pulled out of a summit with Putin that had been scheduled for early September in Moscow, but then met Putin at a G20 summit in St. Petersburg.

Edward Snowden is in the running for the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, a European human rights award whose past winners include Nelson Mandela and Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The winner is to be chosen on Thursday."
http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/08/16/building-trust-between-police-and-minority-communities/,2013-08-16 00:00:00,"['Joseph D. Mcnamara', 'Posted Oneofthesheep', 'Posted Tmc', 'Posted Ptiffany', 'Posted Camp Williams Utah']",Building trust between police and minority communities,"A federal judge ruled Monday that the stop-and-frisk policies of the New York City Police Department were unconstitutional. That same day, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Justice Department will pull back from prosecuting low-level drug offenders to avoid triggering harsh mandatory sentences.

Both decisions reflect fundamental changes in U.S. law enforcement practices. The resulting strident opposition to the changes and equally adamant support illuminate the deep disagreements in the nation’s unresolved racial divide.

Holder pointed out that mandatory sentences fell disproportionately on minority communities and had led to grossly overcrowded prisons. Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that the New York police policy violated the Constitution — police are most often stopping and frisking innocent male minorities.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly quickly defended the policy. They both argued that the tactics had greatly reduced violence and crime — and the number of minority crime victims. Supporters of mandatory sentences and stop-and- frisk contend that, most importantly, policy changes would lead to far higher crime levels.

My decade-long experience as a beat officer in New York’s Harlem, the highest crime area in the city during the 1960s, when crime soared, and as police chief of Kansas City, Missouri, and San Jose, California, during the high-crime 1970s and ’80s, convinced me that police tactics and judicial sentencing policies do affect crime rates.

It is also true, however, that many other variables play a significant role. Demographic and economic factors, community culture and leadership, education, unemployment, the patterns of local drug use and gangs, drug enforcement efforts and police crime reporting practices are all factors.

My years as a beat cop taught me truths that were invaluable as police chief. I learned that the magnitude of the evil imposed on African-Americans by slavery didn’t just vanish with the Emancipation Proclamation. It still contributed to the high rates of black-on-black violence and crime, often by black youths against poor people in their communities, which were ill-served by indifferent police, courts and correctional organizations.

Drug War enforcement did not reduce drug use, but Bureau of Justice statistics show that mandatory minimum sentencing disproportionately filled prisons with low-level black offenders to the point where, according to the most recent data, roughly 80 percent of young African-Americans can expect to be jailed during their life time. Since the recidivism rate is around 68 percent it is no surprise that many inner-city African-American communities suffer from exceedingly high victimization. Forty-nine percent of homicide victims are African-American, despite the fact that blacks make up only 13 percent of the population.

Nonetheless, it is understandable that an innocent African-American, confronted and frisked by an armed, uniformed officer, may feel that his dignity as a man is violated, creating a potentially violent encounter. It is important that such situations are perceived as an officer taking necessary action to protect neighborhood residents, at their bequest.

During the 18 years I served as police chief, I attended countless community meetings throughout both cities. I often heard residents complain about sporadic police encounters. Inevitably, however, the minority community would admonish, “Chief, don’t mistake what we’re saying. We don’t want less policing. We want more, but we want it to be without racial bias.”

As part of good management, police departments should be assigning the most cops to higher crime areas which, unfortunately, are often among the poor in minority neighborhoods. They require more policing, not less. People in those areas, in my experience, will accept that most police interactions will be with minority youth. So the burden for the police agencies is to establish community trust and ensure that cops behave professionally as they do their work.

I made it mandatory for beat officers and their superiors to attend and participate in neighborhood meetings. Cops who thought a community hated them and sided with law-breakers quickly learned differently. The local residents also began to see officers as dedicated and caring — not as members of an occupying army.

It didn’t solve all problems, of course. But it did go a long way toward establishing enough trust so that when inevitable difficulties and misunderstandings arose, people would withhold judgment until all the facts were in. Which is all that we could ask. Ultimately, increased public participation created a partnership supporting police actions, which helped make San Jose the safest large city in the nation at that time.

No one can predict for sure that crime will increase if police stop-and-frisk policies are eliminated. But the New York Police Department’s promise to improve the process deserves consideration when the federal appellate court reviews the decision.

While the stop-and-frisk policies can be re-evaluated, common sense tells us that prison populations can and should be reduced. It is time to put aside the hysterical rhetoric of the Drug War, because it causes far more harm to lock up drug users than to use viable alternatives, like drug treatment or community service work for minor offenses.

The federal government declared a war on drugs in 1914 by passing the Harrison Act, which first made drug possession and use a crime. More than a century later, prohibition of drugs enriches drug cartels and corrupt officials. There have been unprecedented levels of drug use and drug gang violence, while minor, non-violent drug offenders were given severe mandatory sentences. It would be better to repeal unworkable drug sentencing laws than to have the attorney general try an end run — but it is still well past time to stop making drug cartels rich and turning minor users into career criminals.

The judge stated that she did not rule on whether or not stop and frisk reduces crime but only on the constitutionality of the NYPD policies. The appeal courts will ultimately rule on the program’s constitutionality. But ultimately the public will need to vote on the appropriateness of the methods police can use to protect safety.

(CNN) —

Historically, surveillance was difficult and expensive.

Over the decades, as technology advanced, surveillance became easier and easier. Today, we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance, where everything is collected, saved, searched, correlated and analyzed.

But while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance, the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there. The former always collected information about everyone, but over time, collected more and more of it, while the latter always collected maximal information, but over time, collected it on more and more people.

Corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information. Corporations always collected information on everyone they could, but in the past they didn’t collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary. When surveillance information was expensive to collect and store, companies made do with as little as possible.

Telephone companies collected long-distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes. Credit cards collected only the information about their customers’ transactions that they needed for billing. Stores hardly ever collected information about their customers, maybe some personal preferences, or name-and-address for advertising purposes. Even Google, back in the beginning, collected far less information about its users than it does today.

Ann De Wulf Bruce Schneier

As technology improved, corporations were able to collect more. As the cost of data storage became cheaper, they were able to save more data and for a longer time. And as big data analysis tools became more powerful, it became profitable to save more. Today, almost everything is being saved by someone – probably forever.

Examples are everywhere. Internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple collect everything we do online at their sites. Third-party cookies allow those companies, and others, to collect data on us wherever we are on the Internet. Store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases. CCTV and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements; so does your cell phone. The Internet will facilitate even more surveillance, by more corporations for more purposes.

On the government side, surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected. When surveillance was manual and expensive, it could only be justified in extreme cases. The warrant process limited police surveillance, and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance. Specific individuals were targeted for surveillance, and maximal information was collected on them alone.

As technology improved, the government was able to implement ever-broadening surveillance. The National Security Agency could surveil groups – the Soviet government, the Chinese diplomatic corps, etc. – not just individuals. Eventually, they could spy on entire communications trunks.

Now, instead of watching one person, the NSA can monitor “three hops” away from that person – an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance. Using sophisticated tools, the NSA can surveil broad swaths of the Internet and phone network.

Governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance. Why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data? For example we just learned that the NSA collects e-mail, IM and social networking contact lists for millions of Internet users worldwide.

But as corporations started collecting more information on populations, governments started demanding that data. Through National Security Letters, the FBI can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant. Through secret agreements, the NSA can monitor the entire Internet and telephone networks.

This is a huge part of the public-private surveillance partnership.

The result of all this is we’re now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance.

Data is a byproduct of the information society. Every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record, and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day. Even if we don’t use a computer – buying something in person with cash, say – the merchant uses a computer, and the data flows into the same system. Everything we do leaves a data shadow, and that shadow is constantly under surveillance.

Data is also a byproduct of information society socialization, whether it be e-mail, instant messages or conversations on Facebook. Conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded, and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go.

Moore’s law has made computing cheaper. All of us have made computing ubiquitous. And because computing produces data, and that data equals surveillance, we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance.

Now we need to figure out what to do about it. This is more than reining in the NSA or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse. We need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource, a part of us that is inherently ours by right, or a private good to be bought and sold.

Writing in The Guardian, Chris Huhn said that “information is power, and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom.” How this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined.

""Reforms are taking shape,"" Assange said in a statement released Saturday

President Obama has rejected characterizations of Snowden as a whistle-blower

Snowden, who has temporary asylum in Russia, faces felony charges in the U.S.

President Barack Obama's plan to review U.S. surveillance programs has validated fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden's role as a whistle-blower, the head of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said Saturday.

The statement came a day after Obama outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures, saying the classified leaks by Snowden created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans.

""As Snowden has stated, his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur,"" Julian Assange said in a written statement.

""Well, reforms are taking shape, and for that, the president and people of the United States and around the world owe Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude.""

Obama has refused any characterization of Snowden as a ""whistle-blower"" or ""patriot,"" telling reporters there were ""other avenues"" the former National Security Agency contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information.

The president said Snowden's leaks came in ""dribs and drabs,"" giving a false general impression that ""we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody.""

At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency.

Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies.

Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said.

Snowden fled first to China and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

If Snowden believes his actions were right, ""he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,"" the president said.

Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government.

""The simple fact is that without Snowden's disclosures, no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place,"" Assange said.

Assange released the statement from Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he sought refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes."

Daniel Biss has introduced legislation that would require police to get a search warrant before using a drone to gather evidence. Along with banning the use of lethal and nonlethal weapons on the drones — except in emergencies — the proposal would require information a drone gathers to be destroyed unless it is part of an investigation.
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/21/fbi-under-pressure-to-explain-drone-use-as-obama-names-new-director/,2013-06-21 00:00:00,[],"FBI under pressure to explain drone use, as Obama names new director","As President Obama nominates a new FBI director, the bureau is coming under rising pressure from lawmakers to explain the limits of its recently disclosed drone fleet.

Civil liberties-minded senators on both sides of the aisle have fired off sharply worded letters and statements in recent days criticizing the FBI for deploying surveillance drones without clear guidance on how to protect privacy rights.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the latest to scrutinize the bureau, sending a letter on Thursday to outgoing Director Robert Mueller asking a string of questions about his agency's drone use.

""I am disturbed by the revelation that the FBI has unilaterally decided to begin using drone surveillance technology without a governance policy, and thus without the requisite assurances that the constitutional rights of Americans are being protected,"" Paul wrote.

Mueller acknowledged Wednesday, during a Senate hearing, that the bureau has a limited number of drones that it uses for surveillance on U.S. soil. He stressed they are used in a ""very, very minimal way and very seldom."" Newly released documents show that the FBI has sought and received permission from the FAA at least four times to fly surveillance drones inside the U.S. since 2010.

The use of non-lethal drones for surveillance purposes is rapidly getting off the ground among local law enforcement agencies and other groups. Mueller, in acknowledging that the FBI, too, has obtained surveillance drones, said the bureau is in the ""initial stages"" of drafting rules and regulations for their use.

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., took umbrage at that fact, saying that while drones have the potential to help law enforcement agencies, constitutional rights must come first.

""I am concerned the FBI is deploying drone technology while only being in the 'initial stages' of developing guidelines to protect Americans' privacy rights. I look forward to learning more about this program and will do everything in my power to hold the FBI accountable and ensure its actions respect the U.S. Constitution,"" he said in a statement.

The FBI clarified on Friday that its drone use is governed by existing bureau regulations and FAA rules. It confirmed that the specific drone model is the PUMA AE, manufactured by California firm AeroVironment. The model is hand-launched, battery-powered and can send live color and thermal video to its operator, according to the company. It is designed to respond to disasters and other incidents.

The issue is likely to follow Obama's new nominee to lead the FBI, Jim Comey. Obama nominated the former federal prosecutor on Friday.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who originally asked Mueller about the drone program, also wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday seeking ""clarification"" regarding a prior response from the department that did not disclose the FBI's drones. He, too, asked Holder to explain when the FBI began using them, what checks are in place for the program and whether any are capable of being armed.

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson clarified earlier this week that the aircraft are only used in ""very limited circumstances to support operations where there was a specific operational need.""

He cited an example of a hostage situation in Alabama earlier this year where a drone helped law enforcement. He said they are only used to conduct surveillance ""on stationary subjects."" And the bureau must obtain FAA approval first."

“It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,” Cantor said. “I’m pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues.”

At a major speech at the American Enterprise Institute that detailed Republican policy proposals to “make life better” for Americans, Cantor called on his colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle to address this issue and urged President Barack Obama to lead on a bipartisan immigration bill. Cantor said one of the “founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.”

This is a reversal for Cantor, who voted against the DREAM Act in 2010.

“There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue,” Cantor said. “I reject this notion and call on the President to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past.”

Cantor said “there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country,” and “they, like us, have families and dreams.”

“While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and that’s what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult,” Cantor said. “In looking to solve this problem soon, we’ve got to balance the respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America.”

Cantor also called on Congress to pass the STEM Act, which would give foreign students who have advanced degrees in field such as science, technology, engineering, and math from American universities permanent residency.

He said discussions about immigration reform have made “border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program immediate priorities.”

“It’s the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy,” Cantor said.

Cantor said his “grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic pogroms of the czars of Russia to come to America.” He said his grandmother, who was “widowed at a young age,” raised “her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened.”

“With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure that my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country,” Cantor said. “And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her then like an impossible dream.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/19/congress-eyes-regulating-drones/,2013-05-19 00:00:00,[],Lawmakers eye regulating domestic surveillance drones,"Amid growing concern over the use of drones by police and government officials for surveillance, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to limit the use of unmanned surveillance ""eyes in the sky"" aircraft.

Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., along with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, is sponsoring legislation that would codify due process protections for Americans in cases involving drones and make flying armed drones in the U.S. sky illegal.

Sensenbrenner believes it is necessary to develop new standards to address the privacy issues associated with use of drones — which can be as small as a bird and as large as a plane.

""Every advancement in crime fighting technology, from wiretaps to DNA, has resulted in courts carving out the Constitutional limits within which the police operate,"" Sensenbrenner said at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Friday on the issues surrounding drones.

The subcommittee heard from experts who were divided on what actions Congress should take to address the new technology. But the four witnesses all agreed that drones raised new, often unprecedented questions about domestic surveillance.

""Current law has yet to catch up to this new technology,"" said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Calabrese said he supported immediate regulation of the drone industry and said his biggest concern was the overuse of drones by police and government officials for surveillance. But Calabrese said he doesn't want to hinder the growth of drones with the power to do good, including helping find missing persons, assisting firefighters and addressing other emergencies.

Tracey Maclin, a professor with the Boston University School of Law, said the issues raised by drones haven't been addressed by courts before because the technology goes beyond what humans had been capable of through aerial surveillance.

Past court rulings, ""were premised on naked-eye observations — simple visual observations from a public place,"" he said.

Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., said he wanted to know when drone technology will advance to the point where Congress will have to act on the issue. He said he was concerned about the effect on privacy.

""At what point do you think it's going to get to a point where we have to say what a reasonable expectation of privacy is?"" Richmond said.

Republicans expressed similar concerns.

""It seems to me that Congress needs to set the standard, rather than wait and let the courts set the standard,"" Poe said.

""Technology is great — as long as it's used the right and proper way,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said at Friday's hearing.

Some experts urged caution.

Gregory McNeal, an associate law professor at Pepperdine University, said writing laws to cover drones will be difficult because the technology continues to improve and Congress could think it's addressing key issues, only to have new ones emerge.

He compared drones to the privacy concerns raised by development of the Internet in the 1990s. Regulating then, he said, could have stymied the rapid growth of the Internet and wouldn't have addressed today's Internet privacy issues.

If Congress feels compelled to act, McNeal said, it should think in terms broader than a ""drone policy"" and set standards for surveillance or realistic expectations of privacy. ""A technology-centered approach to privacy is the wrong approach,"" he said.

But the ACLU's Calabrese said Congress should work quickly.

""This can't be adequately addressed by existing law,"" he said. ""Manned aircraft are expensive to purchase. Drones' low cost and flexibility erode that natural limit. They can appear in windows, all for much less than the cost of a plane or a helicopter.""

A future with domestic drones may be inevitable. While civilian drone use is currently limited to government agencies and some public universities, a law passed by Congress last year requires the Federal Aviation Administration to allow widespread drone flights in the U.S. by 2015. According to FAA estimates, as many as 7,500 civilian drones could be in use within five years.

Congress isn't alone in seeking to address the issues: Since January, drone-related legislation has been introduced in more than 30 states, largely in response to privacy concerns.

Forty-five percent said the government's anti-terrorism efforts go too far in restricting civil liberties, compared to 40 percent saying they did not go far enough. A 2010 poll by the group found that 63 percent felt anti-terrorism policies did not go far enough, while just 25 percent said they went too far.

The numbers suggest that the revelation of the NSA's telephone and Internet spying programs has caused many Americans to change their opinions of the national security state.

Men, by a 54-34 margin, said that policies had gone too far, while women, by a 47-36 margin, said they had not gone far enough, revealing a sizable gender gap.

In the new poll, 55 percent of Americans characterized former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as a whistleblower, while 34 percent deemed him a traitor. Forty-nine percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents said he is a whistleblower.

The survey reveals that the public disagrees with many lawmakers -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who have called the former NSA contractor a traitor. Snowden is believed to be holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport after he leaked classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post detailing the agency's massive telephone and Internet spying programs.

Nevertheless, other recent surveys have shown that more Americans disapprove than approve of Snowden's actions. A HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 38 percent of Americans thought Snowden had done the wrong thing in leaking the documents, while 33 percent condoned his actions. Twenty-nine percent were unsure. A CNN poll released on June 17 showed that 52 percent disagreed with his actions, and 44 percent agreed."

Over time the program, just one piece of the bill, would open up many new opportunities for foreigners to settle in the United States based on their skills, a shift from the focus on family ties that is the main foundation of the current immigration system.

But the bill will also include a host of measures to eliminate, over 10 years, a backlog of 4.7 million immigrants who have applied to come here legally and have been languishing in the system, waiting for permanent resident visas known as green cards. As a result, during the next decade, millions of immigrants who have been waiting patiently for legal documents will be united with their family members here.

The bill, an intricate combination of many interlocking parts, also provides a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Under the plan, those immigrants would wait at least 13 years before they could apply to become citizens."

Do we surrender without a fight our nation, our way of life, our childrens' and descendants' entire future, just because we're too damned lazy, apathetic, or thoroughly hypnotized to exercise our power? Our guests and household members all seem to understand what's at stake. We differ slightly on how we might deal with it politically, but the most interesting positions (to me) have to do with the rationalizations we've heard and possibly rejected. WHY are they doing this, WHAT is its purpose, and WHO exactly is doing it.

When my turn to opine came, my position as Matriarch and oldest living member of the tribe allows me quite a bit of leeway as well as more than polite attention. So I used the opportunity to talk about my experience growing up and becoming politically aware. Hub and I are certified 1951 Boomers. We grew up in the first generation post-WW2... or, post-nuclear WMDs if you prefer. ALL of our childhood years were spent living under the constant overt 'threat' of Instant Human Annihilation. If we didn't toe the line, 'they' would make humanity extinct. Just because they could.

Duck and Cover drills, endlessly. Back yard fallout shelters stocked with months' worth of water and provisions. The basement level of just about every solidly-built commercial building in town had its government-provided provisions, we had CD personnel in the police and fire departments, we were all totally familiar with the signs and instructions for when we'd need to seek shelter and obey our designated CD caretakers unquestionably...

I'd always had a bad attitude. Comes no doubt from being born to the U.S. Navy. Dad was Planning Officer at Subic during the Korean 'conflict' when I was born. That's why I am currently non-existent according to the federal imposed-to-state level, but that's another story altogether. Anyway, having an extensive experience with the military's take on such things, by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and Dad's first MIC corporate job after the Navy, I didn't spend any time being afraid of the public rhetoric. Dad taught physics and electrical engineering for awhile at The Citadel too, had been attached to the Pentagon when next younger sister was born, before he went through the revolving door to the contractor end where he eventually helped develop the ceramic heat tiles and computers for the Apollo missions. The nation's economy was booming, veterans from all backgrounds were quickly creating the greatest Middle Class the world had ever known, despite the underlying undercurrent of MAD. People generally didn't take it all THAT seriously. Until those six days in October...

I was in the sixth grade when it happened. First post-Navy 'new school', in a long line of new schools thus far. I was quite used to it. As the crisis developed, we got a new student in our class, a red-headed boy named Ira who had come with his mother to his grandparents house in our tiny town because they'd been evacuated from Gitmo Bay, where his father was stationed [Marines]. He and I became immediate friends, the only people in our western New York state class who sort of knew things about the game being played. We talked about it quite a lot, and made a pact not to be afraid.

It steadily got worse, day to day. The very first time a television tuned to the regular national broadcast news ever showed up in a classroom of mine, the teachers from 6th grade through high school (attached) let us just sit and watch all day long. The news was dire, the End Of The World was at hand, and all the adults in our lives became steadily more and more terrified. To which Ira and I reacted as we'd agreed to do - We Are Not Afraid.

We reasoned that there was nothing at all to be gained by making humanity extinct, since those making the decisions were also human. Still, they blustered and bloviated and acted all terrified. SuperCereal [ht: South Park] newscasters grimly reported every detail as it came in. It seemed like everyone was convinced we were ALL about to die. Ira and I didn't believe it for a moment.

That last long day I shook my fist at the sky during after-lunch on the playground - ""Drop it or shut up about it!"" Like a personal dare to those threatening everyone's life.

Sure enough, they didn't kill us all. Probably not because of my measly shaken fist. And at no point from there all the way through the ignoble end of the ignoble Cold War, they never again ventured that close to the edge. Even as the stockpiles and the yields kept going higher and higher, at more and more expense (conveniently covered by We The People). Fallout shelters fell out of favor outside Tornado Alley. Provisions in commercial basements rotted. Nobody gave a shit anymore, the threat had lost its existential punch.

Fast forward. Now they want me to be terrified of assorted unknown stateless actors somewhere, sometime. That's why they call 'em ""terrorists."" Yet it's a very simple google search to discover that I'm in more danger of being killed in any given year by lightning than faceless terrorists. And that doesn't even begin to compare to home accidents, auto mishaps, plain old murder, heart disease, cancer, or any other prominent cause of death in the world today.

I am not afraid.

I haven't been really afraid of teh gub'mint since. They do still piss me off fairly regularly. I wasn't afraid on 9-11. I'm not shaking in my boots now. Terrorists present little to no threat to me and mine. The government's paranoia, on the other hand, is definitely an issue. Because it has abrogated my rights. This is not okay with me.

There seems to be a rather large disconnect between some Kossacks and reality. It can't be simple blindness, because it's responsible for much of the pie-throwing over the past couple of weeks. I'm beginning to learn that this is some sort of ""Third Way"" thing, but I'd have to go looking to find out what that viewpoint dictates when teh gub'mint sends things FUBAR. Makes no obvious sense from here. Perhaps because...

I am not afraid.

What is at stake right now is the very same thing that was at stake in the bad old Cold War. If that was never really about human extinction, then today's overt goal(s) aren't about any big deal threat from random/anonymous 'terrorists'. It's about US, because we are the only ones with the real power to call an abrupt halt to it.

The existential 'threat' in my day was global nuclear war. That's a whole helluva lot more scary than assorted cave dwellers, desert nomads, possibly smart 'visitors' taking flying lessons, or even hard core domestic assholes like Tim McVeigh. Why on earth would anyone expect me to surrender now, if I haven't surrendered at any point between then and now? Again, absurd.

I am not afraid.

It's about controlling us, not about killing us, or disappearing or torturing us, or any other awful consequence of the new ""National Security State."" It's about controlling us through fear. That is what it's always been about.

I am not afraid."

The amendment, introduced by Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), co-sponsored by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) and over 30 other bipartisan members, would substantially curtail the NSA's domestic spying.

The amendment [pdf] basically defunds the NSA's dragnet collection of every bit of metadata on all phone records as well as other bulk records that have not yet been revealed. The amendment still would allow the NSA to collect information under the original intent—and understanding—of the law, that is information actually related to actual investigations.

The NSA and its supporters are, of course, fighting back. They've introduced a second amendment intended to peel support away from the Amash amendment. What this second amendment, from Rep. Richard Nugent (R-FL), does is to pretend that it will withhold funding for bulk collection, but it actually just reiterates what's already in the law, and it just reiterates the status quo.

Meanwhile, NSA chief Keith Alexander is lobbying House members in a

""top secret,"" ""emergency"" meeting to fight the Amash amendment.



NSA head Gen. Keith Alexander scheduled a last-minute, members-only briefing in response to the amendment, according to an invitation distributed to members of Congress this morning and forwarded to HuffPost. ""In advance of anticipated action on amendments to the DoD Appropriations bill, Ranking Member C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of the House Intelligence Committee invites your Member to attend a question and answer session with General Keith B. Alexander of the National Security Agency,"" reads the invitation. The invitation warned members that they could not share what they learned with their constituents or others. ""The briefing will be held at the Top Secret/SCI leveland will be strictly Members-Only,"" reads the invite.

So Alexander is personally lobbying, and making the meeting ""top secret,"" to make all these members of Congress—whose law his agency has been shamelessly flouting—feel invested in the system and feel important. Despite the panic Alexander is trying to foment in the House, the Amash amendment would not curtail the NSA's ability to conduct surveillanceInstead, it would try to force the agency to adhere to the law as it stands today.

This is the first vote, potentially as soon as Wednesday, the Congress is taking on the NSA's dragnet surveillance program. It's the first chance for members of Congress to tell the NSA to abide by existing law.

Please join with Daily Kos and RootsAction to urge your representative to vote in favor of the Amash amendment to begin curtailing the NSA domestic spying program."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/19/Fed-court-signals-AZ-Drivers-license,2013-05-19 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Federal Court Signals AZ's Denial of Driver's License for Illegals in Trouble,"U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses.

In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.

In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer.

Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions.

Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.

However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.

Campbell writes:

“The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”

The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.

Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.

And so the latest fight between Obama and Arizona over immigration continues.

Includes 2004 Ruling on Email Surveillance,"The Bush administration temporarily shut down its bulk collection of email logs after Justice Department lawyers raised legal concerns in March 2004. Judge Kollar-Kotelly declared the collection lawful in July 2004, according to documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.

The email metadata — information like the identities of senders and recipients and the dates of messages, but not the content — was used in searches of unknown associates of terrorism suspects. The Obama administration has said it shut down the email metadata program in 2011 for “operational and resource” reasons.

Several other court documents released on Monday indicated that the program had difficulties with collecting Internet communications beyond the scope of what the court had authorized. Redactions made it difficult to understand the specifics of the problems, but an accompanying statement offered more details. At one point, it said, the government had shut down the program for several months “because of the significance and complexity of these incidents.”

The New York Times reported in 2009 that the N.S.A. had intercepted private email messages and phone calls of Americans on a scale that went beyond broad legal limits. A statement released on Monday said that an excess collection problem in 2009 was the result of “longstanding compliance issues associated with N.S.A.’s electronic communications and telephony bulk metadata collection programs” and that the N.S.A. “recognized that its compliance and oversight structure had not kept pace with its operational momentum.”

In a statement, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that with the new releases, nearly 2,000 pages about surveillance matters had been declassified since President Obama instructed him in June to “make public as much information as possible about certain sensitive programs while being mindful of the need to protect sensitive classified intelligence activities and national security.”"

The intrusions were detected in December while Attkisson was reporting almost exclusively on the government’s response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The attack on Sept. 11, 2012, killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Attkisson has previously investigated the Justice Department’s gun-tracking operation known as “Fast and Furious.”

In a statement Friday, CBS did not identify a culprit. It said Attkisson’s computer “was accessed by an unauthorized, external, unknown party on multiple occasions late in 2012.”

It added: “Evidence suggests this party performed all access remotely using Attkisson’s accounts. While no malicious code was found, forensic analysis revealed an intruder had executed commands that appeared to involve search and [removal] of data. This party also used sophisticated methods to remove all possible indications of unauthorized activity, and alter system times to cause further confusion.”

Attkisson said she noticed unusual activity in her CBS-issued laptop and her home computer, such as dormant computers spontaneously “waking up” at odd hours. The unusual activity, which also included disruptions on her home phone line, predate the December 2012 breach that CBS confirmed.

She said in an interview Friday that she was “outraged” by the breach, which did not appear to be aimed at extracting personal financial information.

“This wasn’t any ordinary malware of a phishing attempt,” that is, an effort to gain personal information, she said. “I assume someone wanted to see what I was working on.

“The privacy and security of every American citizen in his own home, not to mention the work of a journalist, is sacrosanct. The idea that an unknown party could come into your home electronically is upsetting and disturbing. . . . People should be disturbed that a reporter would be spied on and intimidated this way. I do feel that this was an attempt to make me feel intimidated.”

Attkisson said she stopped using the computer and the TV network’s internal data system in January after the security firm hired by CBS began looking into it.

CBS said it is still trying to identify “the responsible party and their method of access.”"

He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report and co-host of a new CNN podcast “The Big Three” that looks at the top three stories of the week. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.

(CNN) —

What do you think of Edward Snowden? By leaking classified documents to the media and revealing that the National Security Agency has been monitoring our phone and Internet usage, is he a traitor or a hero? Could he simply be a narcissist looking to get famous? Or do you not care about either him or the NSA surveillance programs?

Chris Cuomo, co-host of the new CNN morning show, “New Day,” joined us to discuss the top issues in this week’s episode of “The Big Three” podcast. (Be sure to tune in to “New Day,” which premieres on Monday June 17 at 6 a.m. ET.)

I must note that while I disagreed with Cuomo’s view on Snowden, as a fellow graduate of Fordham Law School, his logic and comedy chops were impeccable. It’s something we share and that distinguishes me from my co-hosts Margaret Hoover and John Avlon. (At least that’s what I keep telling myself.)

Back to Edward Snowden. A poll this week found that 31% of Americans consider him a patriot while 23% view him as a traitor. But a whopping 46% say they don’t know. Is it because these 46% simply aren’t following the story or because they have accepted government surveillance as the price for security?

The Snowden Index: A glance at opinions about the NSA leaker

As Cuomo pointed out, Americans have “matured” since 9/11 over the issue of government surveillance. Consequently, he believes that many do accept increased monitoring if it means that we can prevent another 9/11 or Boston Marathon bombing.

But to me, “we the people” have a right to know when our government is spying on us, especially when officials like James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, denied such a program existed when asked about it under oath by Congress just a few months ago. How else can we hold our government accountable if we aren’t informed of its actions?

The second issue we discuss this week will hopefully outrage and disgust you as much as it did us. There are few things that unite the left and right in America (or Margaret, John and I for that matter) but charities taking advantage of the sympathy and good will of Americans did just that.

CNN teamed up with The Tampa Bay Times to reveal the 50 worst charities in America. Anyone considering donating money to a charity needs to first check out this list.

These charities have raised millions of dollars pulling on the heartstrings of Americans by claiming to help children dying of cancer, disabled veterans, the less fortunate and others in need. What are they really doing? Only giving pennies on the dollar to those they purport to assist while keeping 80% to 90% of the money raised for administrative costs – such as paying their officers.

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah John Avlon, Margaret Hoover, Dean Obeidallah

We also highlighted some of the best charities in America, including the YMCA, Goodwill and the new “Dean Obeidallah charity,” where I pledge to use 100% of the money raised to help me, Dean Obeidallah.

Finally, we turned to erotic books and the CIA. No, the CIA hasn’t started secretly spying on people who read erotica or investigating whether the “Letters to Penthouse” are real. As the Daily Beast reported, the CIA’s new No. 2 person, Avril Danica Haines, once co-owned a bookstore where she featured “Erotica nights” during which she and her guests would read aloud racy portions of books.

John and Margaret applauded this as showing a human side to Haines as well as making the point that women in power can also be sexual beings. However, my view is that this type of story typifies why it’s so difficult for women to navigate up the government and corporate ladder.

Those are our views. More importantly, we would love to hear your views on the three issues featured in this week’s episode of “The Big Three.” Plus, follow us on Twitter, we are all needy – me especially.

Bradley Manning's defense wanted all charges dismissed

If convicted of aiding the enemy, he could face life behind bars

WikiLeaks case involves thousands of war logs leaked

FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) — An Army private suspected of sending reams of classified documents to the secret-sharing WikiLeaks website was illegally punished at a Marine Corps brig and should get 112 days cut from any prison sentence he receives if convicted, a military judge ruled Tuesday.

Army Col. Denise Lind ruled during a pretrial hearing that authorities went too far in their strict confinement of Pfc. Bradley Manning for nine months in a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va., in 2010 and 2011. Manning was confined to a windowless cell 23 hours a day, sometimes with no clothing. Brig officials said it was to keep him from hurting himself or others.

Lind said Manning's confinement was ""more rigorous than necessary."" She added that the conditions ""became excessive in relation to legitimate government interests.""

Manning faces 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a maximum sentence of life behind bars. His trial begins March 6.

The 25-year-old intelligence analyst had sought to have the charges thrown out, arguing the conditions were egregious. Military prosecutors had recommended a seven-day sentence reduction, conceding Manning was improperly kept for that length of time on highly restrictive suicide watch, contrary to a psychiatrist's recommendation.

Lind rejected a defense contention that brig commanders were influenced by higher-ranking Marine Corps officials at Quantico or the Pentagon.

Manning showed no reaction as Lind read her decision. He fidgeted when the judge took the bench to announce her ruling, sometimes tapping his chin or mouth with a pen and frequently glancing at his attorney's notepad, but those movements tapered off during the hour and 45 minutes it took the judge to read the lengthy opinion.

Mike McKee, one of about a dozen Manning supporters in the courtroom, said he was disappointed. He called the ruling ""very conservative,"" although he said he didn't expect the charges to be thrown out.

""I don't find it a victory,"" McKee said. ""Credit like that becomes much less valuable if the sentence turns out to be 80 years.""

Jeff Paterson of the Bradley Manning Support Network, which is funding Manning's defense, said the sentencing credit ""doesn't come close to compensating Bradley"" for his harsh treatment.

""The ruling is not strong enough to give the military pause before mistreating the next American soldier awaiting trial,"" Paterson wrote in an email.

Lind ruled on the first day of a scheduled four-day hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore.

The hearing is partly to determine whether Manning's motivation matters. Prosecutors want the judge to bar the defense from producing evidence at trial regarding his motive for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of secret war logs and diplomatic cables. They say motive is irrelevant to whether he leaked intelligence, knowing it would be seen by al-Qaida

Manning allegedly told an online confidant-turned-informant that he leaked the material because ""I want people to see the truth"" and ""information should be free.""

Defense attorney David Coombs said Tuesday that barring such evidence would cripple the defense's ability to argue that Manning leaked only information that he believed couldn't hurt the United States or help a foreign nation.

Manning has offered to take responsibility for the leaks in a pending plea offer but he still could face trial on charges such as aiding the enemy.

The Crescent, Okla., native is accused of leaking classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010. He is also charged with leaking 2007 video of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Pentagon concluded the troops acted appropriately, having mistaken the camera equipment for weapons.

Manning supporters consider him a whistleblower whose actions exposed war crimes and helped trigger the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings in late 2010."

For American women serving at military bases across Afghanistan, there was nothing extraordinary about the recent Pentagon decision to lift the official ban on women in direct combat roles.

“We’re already here,” said Army Capt. Kelly Hasselman, 28, of Broken Arrow, Okla., who commands a company of female soldiers that deployed with infantry in the southern province of Kandahar to build relations with rural Afghan women. “It’s just not officially been in the books.”

U.S. commanders say that military policy was out of step with the reality of two wars with virtually no front lines. Women, who make up about 15% of the active-duty military, have faced gunfire, bomb blasts and shelling while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan — in some cases without leaving their bases.

Two have been awarded the Silver Star, the nation’s third-highest medal for gallantry in combat. More than 150 have lost their lives.

Long before Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced that he was lifting a 1994 rule that prevented women from being assigned to units below brigade level whose primary function is direct ground combat, female troops were serving alongside such units at outposts in some of the most heavily contested regions of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Stretched by more than a decade of war, the Army and Marine Corps for years sidestepped official policy by “attaching,” rather than assigning, women to infantry and special operations units because their skills were needed.

When soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, deployed in December to this dusty base in Zhari, the Kandahar district where the Taliban was born, they brought with them an eight-member “female engagement team” drawn from Hasselman’s company. Women also serve in the battalion as medics, in the logistics and personnel sections and in the motor pool.

“Gender, height, weight, religion, sexual preference, race — I don’t care,” said the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Thomas Anderson. “It all comes down to your ability to do what the Army asks you to do.”

So far, the area has remained relatively calm. But when temperatures warm up and another fighting season begins, Anderson expects that his female soldiers will be involved in firefights.

“They are no less capable than I am to react to and return fire,” Anderson said. “Are my infantrymen better? Yes. That’s not due to a lack of ability. It is a lack of repetition.”

The battalion leadership says there have been few problems integrating women into the ranks. Rather, the change has been tougher for their Afghan security force partners to accept. The American women have grown accustomed to stares — and they aren’t allowed on the Afghan side of the compound without a security escort, a precaution also imposed on male soldiers because of the threat of insider attacks.

Pfc. Rosie Darby said she was told by her recruiter that women could not serve as frontline combat medics. She made sure to email him when she got her current job: a platoon medic at one of the battalion’s combat outposts. (Her official designation is healthcare specialist.)

“That first formation was a bit of a shell shock,” she said, smiling. “Everyone was looking and asking: ‘Is she in our formation? Is she a girl?’ ”

The petite 20-year-old from Pavilion, N.Y., soon earned their respect. Members of her platoon said she goes out with them almost every day, climbing over rows of grapevines with a pack of medical supplies on her back to avoid roads that may be seeded with bombs. “She outperforms half of us,” said Sgt. Andrew Bohman, 27, of Cincinnati.

Coarse language doesn’t faze her. “She’s like one of the guys,” said Pfc. Evan Sharp, 20, of Manteca, Calif.

But many in the unit are skeptical about opening other jobs to women, particularly in the infantry, where soldiers sometimes carry as much as 100 pounds of gear on foot patrols that can last all day. “There’s a lot of men that struggle with that,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ron Costa, 42, of Billerica, Mass.

Darby herself called it a “terrible idea.” Besides the physical demands, she worries about how soldiers will react if a woman serving with them is injured. She said the men in her platoon treat her like a little sister and would want to take care of her, even if their job demands that they carry on the fight.

1st Lt. Glen Melin, the platoon commander, said his main concern is upholding Army fitness standards. “This isn’t … like a frat club, to make it difficult to get into,” said Melin, 25, of Corpus Christi, Texas. “It’s to prepare you for the worst possible scenario.”

It is a concern shared by the women who serve here. “You need to say this is the standard, either you meet it or you don’t,” said Hasselman. But she dismissed the notion that women might not be capable of serving in combat positions. “I think that’s the worst argument for not having women in positions, saying they can’t do it,” she said. “Because I have plenty of females who have proven time and time again they can.”

Staff Sgt. Kimberly Williams, a member of Hasselman’s company who is attached to Anderson’s battalion, said some of her most dangerous jobs have been driving supply trucks and guarding prisoners in Iraq. Insurgents would frequently target convoys with roadside bombs and shell the bases where she was deployed.

“I’m not sure why only in the last two or three weeks it’s official I’m allowed to be in battle,” said Williams, 38, of New York. “Just because you don’t have the designated code doesn’t mean you aren’t doing the same work.”

Female engagement teams, first deployed in Afghanistan in 2009, are one of the clearest examples of the blurring of combat and support roles in the military.

Developed by the Marine Corps, the teams live, train and patrol with combat troops in sometimes rugged conditions. They sleep in tents and container housing, take their turn at guard duty and might go for days without access to showers or latrines. (“We use tons and tons of baby wipes,” Hasselman said.) Like their male counterparts, the women have frequently come under fire while on patrol and some have struggled with the psychological toll. Before deploying, Hasselman’s soldiers drew up wills and power of attorney instructions, many of them for the first time.

“Goodbye, this time, was harder,” said 1st Lt. Erica Miranda Ortiz, 32, of San Juan, Puerto Rico. She served twice in Iraq with an aviation support unit. But like others in the unit, she did not want another desk job.

“This is the first time I get to go out every day and interact with the local population,” she said. “I love what I do.”

Local cultural sensitivities prevent male troops from engaging with Afghan women in the more conservative rural areas. But village men will sometimes allow female soldiers into their compounds to meet with their wives, sisters and children. The soldiers also run a small women’s center, which offers adult literacy classes and art projects for children in a walled courtyard attached to the base.

Much of the time is spent getting to know each other. But the female soldiers, who have studied the Pashto language and cover their hair with colorful scarves, also ask women about conditions in their villages. With most international forces slated to leave next year, the soldiers hope the information will help Afghan authorities to better serve their communities and win their loyalty.

Although they are pleased that the military is acknowledging their role, the soldiers don’t expect a surge of women into combat jobs. For some the change came too late.

“When I was in college, I thought it would be so cool to be a Ranger or special forces,” said 1st Lt. Nicole Chappell, 25, of Fort Worth. “I was never going to get married. I was never going to have kids. I was going to be in the Army forever. Then I met my husband and everything changed.”

Williams said she was nearing retirement but was pleased that new opportunities were opening up for the next generation of servicewomen. “We want to help out in the effort just as much as the males,” she said.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/17/politics/nsa-court-ruling-questions/index.html,2013-12-17 00:00:00,"['Evan Pérez', 'Cnn Justice Correspondent']",5 questions about the NSA court ruling,"(CNN) —

A federal judge ruled the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of data on nearly every call made by U.S. phone subscribers is likely unconstitutional, providing ammunition to efforts to rein in surveillance programs that have expanded since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional

Here are five questions about the implications of the court’s ruling:

Q: How does the ruling affect the NSA’s data collection?

A: The NSA continues to have legal authority, based on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, to collect phone metadata, which includes numbers called and length of calls.

The judge stayed his ruling to give the government time to appeal. But the ruling provides the first indication yet that the courts could put some limits on surveillance that the political branches of government – Congress and successive administrations under Republican and Democratic presidents – have not done.

If the ruling stands, it also means that more Americans could sue to have their data removed from the NSA’s data collection programs.

Q: Why does the government collect the data and has it been useful for national security?

A: The Obama administration and officials from the Bush administration say the program is crucial to protecting national security.

NSA Director Keith Alexander has said the program, in conjunction with others, has thwarted more than 50 attacks. Supporters of the program in Congress put the number of attacks prevented at closer to 12 or 13.

In Monday’s ruling, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the program doesn’t appear useful at all, adding that government had not cited “a single instance” in which analysis of the NSA phone data program stopped an imminent terror attack.

Q: What have other courts said about the NSA program?

A: Until Monday’s ruling, 15 different judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had ruled 35 times that the NSA’s phone data collection is legal under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the government says.

The legality rests also in part on a 1979 Supreme Court ruling, called Smith v Maryland, that phone subscriber rights to privacy didn’t include information held by the phone company, such as raw data on phone calls.

Last month, a federal judge in California rejected an attempt to challenge the NSA program, saying the expectation of privacy doesn’t extend to phone data.

The Supreme Court, in a separate case last year, required police to seek warrants to attach a GPS device to a suspect’s car, but most justices questioned whether the 1979 precedent still was valid given the advances in technology.

Q: What does the ruling mean for Edward Snowden, who disclosed the program?

A: The ruling could increase public support for the idea that Snowden deserves amnesty for exposing a program that now at least one judge thinks is unconstitutional. But the Obama administration flatly rejects any talk of amnesty.

Snowden’s open letter offers to help Brazil investigate NSA surveillance

NSA official: Snowden amnesty ‘worth having a conversation about’

The administration has said there is no plan to seek the death penalty if Snowden returns from his temporary exile in Russia to face federal charges for leaking NSA classified documents.

But Attorney General Eric Holder, in an interview with CNN, said of Snowden: “I think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to have loved.”

Q: Are there efforts to change the NSA programs?

A: There are multiple proposals to change the NSA data collection programs, but the ones that have the likelihood of passing Congress would still allow the data collection to continue.

Some proposals would take the phone data program out of the NSA’s hands and require the phone companies to collect the data, then allow the government to seek access to it. NSA officials call it a “hot potato” that no one wants to hold onto.

Opinion: Who broke the law, Snowden or the NSA?"

I am Ju Hong, the ""heckler"" that interrupted your speech at the Betty Ong Center in San Francisco last week. I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.

My family came to the United States from South Korea when I was 11 years old. Like many immigrants, my mother brought me to this country to seek a better life for her children.

I graduated from UC Berkeley, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Public Administration at San Francisco State University. I have lived in America now for 13 years. I consider this country as my home. During my senior year in high school, however, I learned that my family had overstayed a tourist visa. We are undocumented immigrants.

As an American without papers, I was not able to get a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive governmental financial aid. When my mother was sick and in severe pain, she did not visit a doctor because she cannot procure medical insurance. And when my family's home was burglarized, she refused to call the police because she was afraid that our family would be turned over to immigration officials and deported.

Like many other undocumented immigrants, I was living in the shadows and living in fear of deportation. However, I have decided to speak out and stand up.

Immigration reform is not only a Latino issue, it's also an Asian and Pacific Islander issue -- in fact, it is a human rights issue. Currently, two million of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in our country come from Asia. Under your administration, 250,000 undocumented Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants have been deported. While we only make up five percent of the country, we are disproportionately impacted by your immigration policies.

Last week, I was formally invited by White House staff to hear your remarks on immigration reform in San Francisco. As I stood in the stands behind you, I was hoping to hear about your plan to address the lives of 11 million undocumented people living in this country, like my family. And while you expressed your support for comprehensive immigration reform, you did not address how an average of 1,100 immigrants are deported every single day under your administration. You did not address how you deported 205,000 parents of U.S. citizens in the last two years. You did not address how, because of your administration's record number of deportations--nearly two million immigrants in five years, a record--families are being torn apart: spouses are being separated from each other, parents are being separated from their children, and our brothers and sisters are being separated from one another. You did not to address how your administration would end the anti-immigration deportation programs like ""Secure Communities."" You've deported more people than any other president in the U.S. history.

Interestingly, you talked about Angel Island during your speech. What you did not mention, however, is that more people are detained every single day in detention today than were detained yearly at Angel Island. You recognized Angel Island as a dark period in Chinatown's history, but you failed to recognize that more Asians and Pacific Islanders are in detention today than were in detention under the Chinese Exclusion Act. In fact, your administration detains up to 34,000 people per day, a record number of detainees in U.S. history.

Because you failed to address these issues, I was compelled to address the concerns of our community.

You claim that the President of the United States has no authority to stop the deportations. And yet, in June 2012, before the 2012 election, which you won with the help of Latino and Asian voters, you implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. With the stroke of a pen, you dramatically changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people like me who can now live without the daily threat of deportation, and can legally work in this country for the first time in our lives.

I know that you support comprehensive immigration reform. But I also know that you have the power to stop the deportations, and that you have the power to stop the suffering, fear, and intimidation facing millions of immigrants like my family.

Your fellow American,

Ju Hong"

USA TODAY

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone and Internet records is legal and a critical component of the country's effort to combat the threat of terrorism.

The decision by U.S. District Judge William Pauley contrasts with a ruling earlier this month by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon and increases the likelihood that the issue will go before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Leon had granted a preliminary injunction against the collecting of phone records, saying the program likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search.

The NSA-run programs pick up millions of telephone and Internet records that are routed through American networks each day.

In the 54-page opinion issued in New York, Pauley said the sweeping program ""represents the government's counter-punch"" to eliminate al-Qaeda's terror network by connecting fragmented and fleeting communications.

""There is no evidence that the Government has used any of the bulk telephony metadata it collected for any purpose other than investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks,"" he wrote.



The judge further maintained that the program, which sucks up vast amounts of data, is subject to executive and congressional oversight as well as monitoring by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.



""We are pleased with the decision,"" Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said.



In issuing the ruling, Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had sued after former NSA analyst Edward Snowden leaked details of the secret programs that critics say violate privacy rights.

""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director said in a statement.

In hearings last month in New York, an ACLU lawyer had argued that the government's interpretation of its authority under the Patriot Act was so broad that it could justify the mass collection of financial, health and even library records of innocent Americans without their knowledge. A government lawyer had countered that counterterrorism investigators wouldn't find most personal information useful.

The judge acknowledged that the data collection system is far-reaching, and ""vacuums up information about virtually every telephone call, to, from or within the United States.

""This blunt tool only works because it collects everything,"" the judge wrote. ""Such a program if unchecked, imperils the civil liberties of the every citizen.""



While acknowledging this ""natural tension"" between protecting the nation and preserving civil liberty, Pauley said the system sweeps up huge quantities of data ""by design"" and could have helped investigators connect the dots before the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks

""The government learned from its mistake and adapted to confront a new enemy: a terror network capable of orchestrating attacks across the world. It launched a number of counter-measures, including a bulk telephony metadata collection program — a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data,"" he said.

He also found that the right to be free from search and seizures ""is fundamental, but not absolute.""

""Every day, people voluntarily surrender personal and seemingly-private information to transnational corporations, which exploit that data for profit,"" Pauley wrote in . Few think twice about it, even though it is far more intrusive than bulk telephony metadata collection.

Earlier this week, executive editor Jill Abramson appeared on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" and said the Times feared ""news gathering is being criminalized."" She added, ""The reporters who work for the Times in Washington have told me many of their sources are petrified even to return calls"" in light of the Justice Department's agressive investigations into leaks.

Late Thursday afternoon, The Times published another scathing editorial about the sweeping court order that allowed the NSA to collect Verizon customers' phone data. The board wrote:

Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it. That is one reason we have long argued that the Patriot Act, enacted in the heat of fear after the 9/11 attacks by members of Congress who mostly had not even read it, was reckless in its assignment of unnecessary and overbroad surveillance powers.

The board added that it was not objecting to the legality of the court order but argued against using the Patriot Act for this purpose.

This stunning use of the act shows, once again, why it needs to be sharply curtailed if not repealed.

The Times appears to have updated its editorial, adding to its statement, ""The administration has now lost all credibility."" Journalist Adam Henry of WAFF-TV noticed that the line now reads, ""The administration has now lost all credibility on this issue."""

The bill largely has withstood the assaults of those who oppose it, including a union of federal immigration application officers, which announced their opposition Monday.

Senators have dispatched more than 100 amendments, turning back those that would derail the bipartisan compromise engineered by a group of eight senators and accepting others to potentially pick up broader support.

Convening for a fourth hearing Monday, the committee met for another day-long session, as rows of immigrants-rights activists and business representatives filled the Senate hearing room.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

One area of continued concern has been how to keep track of those immigrants who overstay their visas – a problem at the center of the illegal immigration debate.

Many senators have said they would like to see an exit visa system that relies on biometric controls, such as fingerprints, to screen immigrants as they leave the country. But efforts to immediately mandate such a system have been rejected as too cumbersome and, airlines argued, costly.

On Monday, the senators approved a compromise: A biometric exit visa system would be required at 10 of the nation’s 30 busiest international airports to screen visa holders before they board outbound flights. The system would need to be running within two years of the immigration bill becoming law and online for the rest of the airports within six years.

Opponents, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), pushed for a mandatory system at more airports.

Supporters, though, called it a good first step.

“I don’t look at this, Sen. Sessions, as a fig leaf; I look at it as a start,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) as she voted for the measure.

Sessions has led Republican opposition to the 844-page bill, and offered an amendment that would block the earned-income tax credit for those immigrants who apply for legal status. It was rejected.

The bill involves political and policy trade-offs that would beef up border security, launch a new guest-worker program and require employers to verify the legal status of all workers. In exchange, the estimated 11 million immigrants who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas would be offered a 13-year path to citizenship, after they pay fines, taxes and learn English.

Democrats have a majority on the 18-member Judiciary Committee and are expected to approve the bill with the help of two Republicans who were part of the bipartisan effort that drafted the legislation. A vote could come as soon as Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has indicated the full Senate would take up the bill once Congress returns from its break, in early June.

Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various TV networks including CNN. He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report and co-host of a new CNN podcast “The Big Three” that looks at the top three stories of the week. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.

(CNN) —

What do you think of Edward Snowden? By leaking classified documents to the media and revealing that the National Security Agency has been monitoring our phone and Internet usage, is he a traitor or a hero? Could he simply be a narcissist looking to get famous? Or do you not care about either him or the NSA surveillance programs?

Chris Cuomo, co-host of the new CNN morning show, “New Day,” joined us to discuss the top issues in this week’s episode of “The Big Three” podcast. (Be sure to tune in to “New Day,” which premieres on Monday June 17 at 6 a.m. ET.)

I must note that while I disagreed with Cuomo’s view on Snowden, as a fellow graduate of Fordham Law School, his logic and comedy chops were impeccable. It’s something we share and that distinguishes me from my co-hosts Margaret Hoover and John Avlon. (At least that’s what I keep telling myself.)

Back to Edward Snowden. A poll this week found that 31% of Americans consider him a patriot while 23% view him as a traitor. But a whopping 46% say they don’t know. Is it because these 46% simply aren’t following the story or because they have accepted government surveillance as the price for security?

The Snowden Index: A glance at opinions about the NSA leaker

As Cuomo pointed out, Americans have “matured” since 9/11 over the issue of government surveillance. Consequently, he believes that many do accept increased monitoring if it means that we can prevent another 9/11 or Boston Marathon bombing.

But to me, “we the people” have a right to know when our government is spying on us, especially when officials like James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, denied such a program existed when asked about it under oath by Congress just a few months ago. How else can we hold our government accountable if we aren’t informed of its actions?

To listen to this week’s podcast, click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page or find us on iTunes.

The second issue we discuss this week will hopefully outrage and disgust you as much as it did us. There are few things that unite the left and right in America (or Margaret, John and I for that matter) but charities taking advantage of the sympathy and good will of Americans did just that.

CNN teamed up with The Tampa Bay Times to reveal the 50 worst charities in America. Anyone considering donating money to a charity needs to first check out this list.

These charities have raised millions of dollars pulling on the heartstrings of Americans by claiming to help children dying of cancer, disabled veterans, the less fortunate and others in need. What are they really doing? Only giving pennies on the dollar to those they purport to assist while keeping 80% to 90% of the money raised for administrative costs – such as paying their officers.

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah John Avlon, Margaret Hoover, Dean Obeidallah

We also highlighted some of the best charities in America, including the YMCA, Goodwill and the new “Dean Obeidallah charity,” where I pledge to use 100% of the money raised to help me, Dean Obeidallah.

Finally, we turned to erotic books and the CIA. No, the CIA hasn’t started secretly spying on people who read erotica or investigating whether the “Letters to Penthouse” are real. As the Daily Beast reported, the CIA’s new No. 2 person, Avril Danica Haines, once co-owned a bookstore where she featured “Erotica nights” during which she and her guests would read aloud racy portions of books.

John and Margaret applauded this as showing a human side to Haines as well as making the point that women in power can also be sexual beings. However, my view is that this type of story typifies why it’s so difficult for women to navigate up the government and corporate ladder.

Those are our views. More importantly, we would love to hear your views on the three issues featured in this week’s episode of “The Big Three.” Plus, follow us on Twitter, we are all needy – me especially.

Rubio defends immigration bill emerging from bipartisan group,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) blitzed the airwaves Sunday to defend the immigration bill being written by four Republican and four Democratic senators.

Speaking on seven news shows -- including two Spanish-language broadcasts -- Rubio said the draft legislation lays out a way for those in the country unlawfully to apply for legal status, includes stiff penalties for breaking the law and will make the country’s border more secure than ever before.

“I just hope that I can convince people that leaving things the way they are now is much worse than approaching it the way we’ve outlined,” Rubio said on ABC News’ “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”

RELATED: Is the border secure?

“We’re not awarding anything.” Rubio said on Fox News Sunday.

Rubio, who was elected on a wave of tea party support and is a GOP presidential hopeful, is considered to be the best chance the group has of selling the compromise to conservatives.

He said that in order for immigrants who entered the country illegally to earn legal status, they will have to pass a criminal background check, prove they are gainfully employed and pay a penalty. Immigrants with this probationary status will have to wait 10 years before applying for permanent residency, he said, and during that time, they won’t qualify for food stamps or federal medical benefits.

“It will be cheaper, faster and easier for people to go back home and wait 10 years than [go through] this process. That’s why it’s not amnesty,” Rubio said. “If somehow being in the country illegally is cheaper, easier and quicker than the right way, I wouldn’t support that,” he said.

Rubio said that Senate staff members were drafting the bill and that he hoped to be able to talk in more detail about the provisions this week. He said he looked forward to considering amendments from the 92 other senators who have not been involved in writing the bill, but said he would oppose any amendments designed to kill the effort.

Rubio outlined three parts of the bill designed to improve border security. The provisions would have to be implemented before immigrants with probationary status could apply for permanent residency. Employers would be required to use a federal verification database before hiring workers, a new exit visa system would track when visitors overstayed their visas, and technology would be put in place to provide 100% surveillance of the Southwest border and stop 90% of the people who attempt to cross illegally.

“All three have to happen,” he said. Under the bill, the Department of Homeland Security would have five years to accomplish the border security goals. If it fails to do so in that time frame, an independent border commission would be given funding and authority to complete the task in the following five years, he said.

Once the measures in the bill are put into place, Rubio said, “we will have the most effective enforcement system this country has ever had.”

FULL COVERAGE: U.S. immigration

Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, however, said the security measures should come before immigrants can apply for probationary legal status, not after.

“When the Gang of Eight was first formed a publicly stated principle was the enforcement would come first — before legalization,” Sessions said in a statement. “Today, on the Sunday shows, Gang of Eight members admitted that they abandoned this principle and that, in fact, legalization — or amnesty — would come first.”

Speaking after Rubio’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on the broadcast he was encouraged by what the group has agreed on.

“Border security is absolutely critical to this picture,” said Cornyn, adding that he wanted to read the bill before he decided whether to support it. “So much of it is restoring public confidence that the government is actually doing its job,” he said. If the bill doesn’t restore confidence in border security, he said, he will “have a hard time supporting it.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one of the eight senators writing the bill, said there would have to be some flexibility built into how border security is measured so that it doesn’t derail the whole process. Durbin said that there will be more investment in border security, but emphasized how much has already been done.

“Our border with Mexico is the safest and strongest it’s been in 40 years,” Durbin said, adding that the government is now putting more money into border enforcement than into the budgets of the FBI, the ATF and the DEA combined.

Shear']",President Moves to Ease Worries on Surveillance,"“Transparency is important, but we expect the White House to insist that no reform will compromise the operational integrity of the program,” said the spokesman, Brendan Buck. “That must be the president’s red line, and he must enforce it. Our priority should continue to be saving American lives, not saving face.”

A clear theme of Mr. Obama’s remarks was that he believed that the public’s understanding of the surveillance programs had been distorted. He portrayed some of Mr. Snowden’s leaks as having been reported in “the most sensationalized manner possible” and parceled out to “maximize attention” in “dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways.” The result has been misimpressions not merely among the American public, he said, but around the world — a reference to the widespread international criticism of the United States over reports of its surveillance policies.

“If you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying ‘U.S. Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, etc.,’ well, understandably people would be concerned,” he said, while also addressing some of his reassurances to those abroad.

“To others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people,” he said. “Our intelligence is focused above all on finding the information that’s necessary to protect our people and, in many cases, protect our allies. It’s true we have significant capabilities. What’s also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don’t even think to do.”

In an effort to rebuild public trust, Mr. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress to modify the phone log program, but in what he said would be an “appropriate” way. He listed as examples of those steps establishing more oversight and auditing how the database is used.

The president also threw his support behind a proposal to change the procedures of the secret court that approves electronic spying under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, saying an adversarial lawyer should make arguments opposing the Justice Department when the court is considering whether to approve broad surveillance programs."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/26/Mainstream-Media-Ignore-Americans-Killed-By-Illegal-Alien-DREAMers,2013-08-26 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Media Ignore Americans Killed by Illegal Alien 'DREAMers',"An illegal alien brutally murdered Laura Wilkerson’s 18-year-old son in Texas, tied his body up, and then doused him with gasoline before burning him.

Wilkerson recalled the harrowing details on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, yet her story has gone unheard in the broader press.

Maria Espinoza, the director of the Remembrance project that memorializes Americans who were killed by illegal immigrants, told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that such crimes “happen every day” in America, even in states far from the border. But the mainstream media, Espinoza said, often do not report on illegal immigrants who have murdered Americans in states like Virginia, Tennessee, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.

Espinoza said incidents remain local ones and are “shared” and actually suppressed.

“We don’t even hear the person was here illegally in the country,” she said.

Wilkerson told the harrowing tale of how her 18-year-old son was killed on what started out as “just a normal school day.” Wilkerson’s maternal instinct took over when her son did not answer a text from her around 1:30 pm and she went to the school to look for him. While driving around, Wilkerson saw her son’s truck parked by a dumpster at a strip mall. After police found her son’s backpack and shoes in the dumpster, she suspected the worst.

Wilkerson would later find out that an illegal alien, who would have been eligible for citizenship under the DREAM Act, brutally murdered her son after he offered to give him a ride home. The illegal alien would later testify–without showing remorse–that he punched her son so hard in the nose that he went blind and kicked him in the stomach so hard that Josh’s liver and spleen sliced. After ultimately strangling Josh to death, the illegal immigrant then tied Josh up, took him to a field, doused him with gas and burned him. The illegal immigrant was sentenced to life in prison this January.

Espinoza said such crimes were 100% preventable if the nation’s immigration laws are enforced. Wilkerson agreed, recalling how her son’s murder had been in court days before he killed her son because the illegal alien had stalked an ex-girlfriend. Similar incidents have occurred in states like Virginia, where the illegal alien who stabbed a Virginia teenager to death after asking her for a ride to the hospital had been detained months before the murder

Wilkerson emphasized that the country had to “enforce the laws that are in place and secure the border” so even illegal alien criminals who are deported are not able to just walk back into the country because “our borders are open.”

She sad those like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) who have stood up against illegal immigration “were brave” for doing so and those like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who have supported comprehensive immigration reform that would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants disgust her.

“That just makes me sick,” Wilkerson said. “Until it happens to one of their children or their grandkids they are not going to see it the same way.”

Espinoza said the Remembrance Project is engaging in a national campaign to memorializing the victims of illegal immigrants–like Wilkerson’s son–on quilts in every state.

She said Americans needed to tell lawmakers to focus on America, Americans, the debt, and citizens who are out of work.

“There is absolutely no urgency to address illegal aliens or illegal aliens’s children,” Espinoza said. “They need to focus on American families.”

Wilkerson said her son had dreams of going into the military like his brother and was a “compassionate” and “gentle” kid who “did not have an enemy.”

But now that her son is gone, Wilkerson said the illegal alien who murdered her son had “more rights than he did.” Because the illegal alien lived in a so-called sanctuary city, Wilkerson recalled that police could not even ask him the immigration status of his parents when they arrested him.

“I don’t understand it at all,” Wilkerson said."

“We’ve found a lot of value in having these high-visibility security details,” said John Siqveland, a spokesman for Metro Transit, which operates buses and trains Minneapolis-St. Paul. He said that local transit police have worked with VIPR teams on security patrols on the Metro rail line, which serves the Minnesota Vikings stadium, the Mall of America and the airport.

Kimberly Woods, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said the railroad has had good experiences with VIPR team members who work with the Amtrak police on random bag inspections during high-travel times. “They supplement our security measures,” she said.

But elsewhere, experiences with the teams have not been as positive.

In 2011, the VIPR teams were criticized for screening and patting down people after they got off an Amtrak train in Savannah, Ga. As a result, the Amtrak police chief briefly banned the teams from the railroad’s property, saying the searches were illegal.

In April 2012, during a joint operation with the Houston police and the local transit police, people boarding and leaving city buses complained that T.S.A. officers were stopping them and searching their bags. (Local law enforcement denied that the bags were searched.)

The operation resulted in several arrests by the local transit police, mostly for passengers with warrants for prostitution and minor drug possession. Afterward, dozens of angry residents packed a public meeting with Houston transit officials to object to what they saw as an unnecessary intrusion by the T.S.A.

“It was an incredible waste of taxpayers’ money,” said Robert Fickman, a local defense lawyer who attended the meeting. “Did we need to have T.S.A. in here for a couple of minor busts?”

Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of the T.S.A., said he generally supports the VIPR teams but remains concerned about the warrantless searches and the use of behavior detection officers to profile individuals in crowds."

“While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill,” the Washington Post‘s Scott Wilson and Zachary Goldfarb reported on Sunday.

Even though the Gang of Eight–Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez–has allowed the White House into meetings, ICE officers union president Chris Crane notes that his group has been kept completely out of the discussion on immigration reform.

“We have tried for weeks, unsuccessfully, to get a meeting with the Gang of 8 in order to share our deep concerns about the breakdown of interior enforcement in America,” Crane said in the statement released on Sunday.

“ICE’s political leadership, specifically Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton, have repeatedly and dangerously undermined the ability of ICE officers and agents to do their jobs and ensure the constitutionally established rule of law is upheld. Yet, while the Gang of 8 has, as reported for months, worked extensively with powerful interest groups, ICE officers–like the public–have been shut out. Now we understand from media reports that the Gang of 8 is preparing to drop a 1,500 page bill on Tuesday, and pass it as quickly as possible, without having received any input from rank-and-file ICE officers.

“If the Gang is truly committed to enforcement and public safety they should be eager to provide our officers with an opportunity to review this legislation and offer detailed input before it is introduced,” Crane added. “I would therefore respectfully request that the introduction of the bill be delayed so that ICE officers and others in the law enforcement community can be fully briefed on this 1,500 page bill and offer detailed input regarding some of our nation’s most urgent interior enforcement needs that this proposal seemingly does nothing to address.”

Even though the Gang of Eight has refused meeting requests with ICE officers to discuss real law enforcement reform in the immigration debate, Rubio–the GOP members’ de facto leader–says he wants an open and transparent discussion on this issue. He has still not forced multiple hearings on the legislation, as he previously promised, and has not set up a meeting with ICE officers.

During his Sunday show charm offensive, Rubio continued saying he supports an open and transparent debate."

Snowden remains trapped in a diplomatic no-man’s land at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, lacking documents that would allow him to enter Russia or travel to a country willing to damage relations with Washington to give him refuge.

The 30-year-old former contract worker for the National Security Agency has been on the run for more than a month since telling journalists about massive U.S. efforts to track telephone conversations and Internet traffic around the world.

Snowden lost what was probably his best shot for reprieve on Thursday, when minor parties in Iceland’s parliament proposed granting Snowden immediate citizenship. That would have allowed him, once provided with a passport by the Icelandic Embassy in Moscow, to fly to Reykjavik and shelter in the chilly Nordic nation to evade extradition to the United States for prosecution on espionage charges.

But the proposal by the liberal Left-Green, Pirate and Brighter Future parties fizzled, with only six of the parliament’s 63 members expressing support, the Russia Today network reported. The legislature then recessed for the summer.

Before Friday’s announcement of additional asylum bids, WikiLeaks had reported that Snowden had appealed to 21 countries for political asylum. He subsequently withdrew the request to settle in Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s condition that he refrain from leaking information about U.S. surveillance practices that are “aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners.”

None of the other 20 states identified by WikiLeaks has offered Snowden refuge. Most have evaded a formal response because their asylum laws require an application to be made in person on national soil. Others, such as U.S. allies France, Germany, Poland and India, have denied him entry.

WikiLeaks, the secret-revealing website that has been aiding Snowden in his efforts to dodge U.S. extradition, announced via Twitter on Friday that six more countries had been approached.

“Edward #Snowden has applied to another six countries for asylum. They will not be named at this time due to attempted U.S. interference,” WikiLeaks tweeted.

The freedom-of-information crusaders were apparently referring to reports of U.S. pressure being applied to countries to which Snowden had previously appealed for asylum. Four U.S.-allied states -- France, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- denied airspace entry Tuesday to a plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales because they had been informed that Snowden might be on board with the leftist leader, who as headed home to La Paz after a meeting in Moscow.

Snowden has been in the Sheremetyevo transit area for 13 days. Foreign journalists have been searching the publicly accessible areas of the airport between arrival gates and passport control but none have reported any encounter with the fugitive. That suggests he is in a secure area under watch by Russian border guards -- and probably security and intelligence officials keen to learn more about the secret data he reportedly carried in with him on four computers.

Includes 2004 Ruling on Email Surveillance,"The Bush administration temporarily shut down its bulk collection of email logs after Justice Department lawyers raised legal concerns in March 2004. Judge Kollar-Kotelly declared the collection lawful in July 2004, according to documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.

The email metadata — information like the identities of senders and recipients and the dates of messages, but not the content — was used in searches of unknown associates of terrorism suspects. The Obama administration has said it shut down the email metadata program in 2011 for “operational and resource” reasons.

Several other court documents released on Monday indicated that the program had difficulties with collecting Internet communications beyond the scope of what the court had authorized. Redactions made it difficult to understand the specifics of the problems, but an accompanying statement offered more details. At one point, it said, the government had shut down the program for several months “because of the significance and complexity of these incidents.”

The New York Times reported in 2009 that the N.S.A. had intercepted private email messages and phone calls of Americans on a scale that went beyond broad legal limits. A statement released on Monday said that an excess collection problem in 2009 was the result of “longstanding compliance issues associated with N.S.A.’s electronic communications and telephony bulk metadata collection programs” and that the N.S.A. “recognized that its compliance and oversight structure had not kept pace with its operational momentum.”

In a statement, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that with the new releases, nearly 2,000 pages about surveillance matters had been declassified since President Obama instructed him in June to “make public as much information as possible about certain sensitive programs while being mindful of the need to protect sensitive classified intelligence activities and national security.”"

The decision, with its lopsided vote, is not an indication that the court will always be sympathetic to claims of voter suppression. Its decision on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is expected by the end of the month, and it may limit what its supporters say is an important tool in protecting minority voters.

Nor has the Supreme Court been uniformly hostile to Arizona’s efforts to address what lawmakers there say is a crisis in illegal immigration. Last year, it upheld one part of a tough 2010 state immigration law even as it endorsed broad federal power over immigration. In 2011, it sustained a different law that imposed harsh penalties on businesses that hired illegal workers.

On Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, No. 12-71, said a federal law requiring states to “accept and use” a form displaced an Arizona law requiring various kinds of proof of citizenship.

The law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, allows voters to register using a federal form that asks, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” Prospective voters must check a box for yes or no, and they must sign the form, swearing under the penalty of perjury that they are citizens."

http://news.yahoo.com/us-releases-more-documents-surveillance-origins-164901191--politics.html,,[],US releases more documents on surveillance origins,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The director of national intelligence on Saturday declassified more documents that outline how the National Security Agency was first authorized to start collecting bulk phone and Internet records in the hunt for al-Qaida terrorists and how a court eventually gained oversight of the program.

The declassification came after the Justice Department complied with a federal court order to release its previous legal arguments for keeping the programs secret.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper explained in a statement Saturday that President George W. Bush first authorized the spying in October 2001, as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, just after the Sept. 11 attacks. Bush disclosed the program in 2005. The Terrorist Surveillance Program — which had to be extended every 30-60 days by presidential order — eventually was replaced by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that requires a secret court to approve the bulk collection.

Clapper also released federal court documents from successive intelligence directors arguing to keep the programs secret, after a California judge this fall ordered the administration to declassify whatever details already had been revealed as part of the White House's campaign to justify the NSA surveillance. Former agency contractor Edward Snowden first made the surveillance programs public in leaks to the media.

A senior intelligence official Saturday confirmed that the documents were released as part of two long-running class-actions cases against the NSA in California. The official said that at the judge's direction the administration reviewed prior declarations in order to relate information that is no longer classified and determined what could be released. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to describe the court case by name.

President Barack Obama hinted Friday that he would consider some changes to NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records to address the public's concern about privacy. His comments came in a week in which a federal judge declared the NSA's collection program is probably unconstitutional, and a presidential advisory panel suggested 46 changes to NSA operations.

Story continues

The judge said there was little evidence any terror plot had been thwarted by the program, known as Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. The advisory panel recommended continuing the program but requiring a court order for each NSA search of the phone records database, and keeping that database in the hands of a third party — not the government. Obama said he would announce his decisions in January.

""There has never been a comprehensive government release ... that wove the whole story together — the timeline of authorizing the programs and the gradual transition to (court) oversight,"" said Mark Rumold, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group suing the NSA to reveal more about the bulk records programs. ""Everybody knew that happened, but this is the first time I've seen the government confirm those twin aspects.""

That unexpected windfall of disclosures early Saturday came along with the release of documents outlining why releasing the information would hurt national security. The U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California in the fall had ordered the Obama administration to make public the documents, known as state secrets declarations.

The Justice Department issued the declarations late Friday in the two class-action cases: Shubert v. Bush, now known as Shubert v. Obama, on behalf of Verizon customers; and Jewel v. NSA, on behalf of AT&T customers.

Calls to the Justice Department were not answered.

""In September, the federal court in the Northern District of California ... ordered the government to go back through all the secret ex-parte declarations and declassify and release as much as they could, in light of the Snowden revelations and government confirmations,"" Rumold said. ""So what was released late last night was in response to that court order.""

In one such legal argument, former National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair in 2009 told the court that revealing information — including how information was collected, whether specific individuals were being spied upon and what the programs had revealed about al-Qaida — could damage the hunt for terrorists.

""To do so would obviously disclose to our adversaries that we know of their plans and how we may be obtaining information,"" Blair said. Much of his 27-page response is redacted.

The suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, a naturalized American citizen, remained hospitalized on Saturday for treatment of injuries sustained when he was captured by the police on Friday night, and it was not clear whether he had been questioned yet. But the administration’s effort to stretch a gap in the Miranda rule for questioning about immediate threats to public safety in this and other terrorism cases has alarmed advocates of individual rights.

Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said it would be acceptable for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to ask Mr. Tsarnaev about “imminent” threats, like whether other bombs are hidden around Boston. But he said that for broader questioning, the F.B.I. must not “cut corners.”

“The public safety exception to Miranda should be a narrow and limited one, and it would be wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional to use it to create the case against the suspect,” Mr. Romero said. “The public safety exception would be meaningless if interrogations are given an open-ended time horizon.”"

Sure. But Nixonian? Please.,"Matthew Dallek is an associate academic director at the University of California Washington Center and the author of “The Right Moment: Ronald Reagan’s First Victory and the Decisive Turning Point in American Politics.”

When a reporter asked Jay Carney this past week how his boss felt about the comparisons he was drawing to one Richard M. Nixon, the White House press secretary shot back: “I don’t have a reaction from President Obama. I can tell you that the people who make those kind of comparisons need to check their history.”

Actually, if Carney checked his history, he’d realize that the “Nixonian” accusation has been a rite of passage for presidents over the past four decades, particularly in their second terms. Critics have routinely charged that presidents’ conduct has demeaned the office, reaching levels of malfeasance not seen since, of course, Watergate.

And with the disputes over the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, the targeting of tea party groups by the IRS and the Justice Department’s secret gathering of Associated Press phone records, the Nixon comparisons are rife.

“Do these people not remember the Nixon administration?” asked NBC’s senior investigative correspondent, Lisa Myers. “I’ve never seen anything quite like this, except in the past during the Nixon years,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). And BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith captured the moment with his post featuring Obama’s and Nixon’s faces morphing into one another in an endless loop of guilt by association.

The White House deserves some of the blame for the mess it’s in, but let’s be clear: The comparisons to Nixon are hyperbolic. Watergate, with its unique depth of criminality, remains a scandal unlike any other in modern times, and the echoes today reveal far more about the culture of Washington than about the supposed similarity between Obama’s troubles and Nixon’s crimes.

The 44th president has plenty of company in the he’s-as-bad-as-Nixon club. Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, recounting the Iran-contra scandal during the Gipper’s second term, asked: “What did the president know and when did he know it? This had been the central issue in the Watergate scandal and it became and remains a principal unanswered question of the Iran-contra affair.”

President Bill Clinton had several “gates” attached to his woes: Travelgate, Filegate, Lewinskygate. House Republicans, armed with Watergate comparisons, voted to impeach Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, insisting that the president’s sexual relationship with a White House intern and his misleading testimony rivaled Nixon’s abuses of power. (In a bit of trivia, Lewinsky was living in the Watergate complex at the height of her scandal.)

President George W. Bush had Watergate analogies hurled his way so often in his second term that the charge almost became banal. John Dean, Nixon’s counsel during Watergate, who subsequently became a liberal voice, wrote a book about Bush titled “Worse Than Watergate,” accusing the president of obstructing the investigation into the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks with “tactics not unlike those used by the Nixon White House.”

None of these comparisons holds up. Nixon had an “enemies list.” He directed a cover-up to shield his White House from blame for the break-in and theft of documents at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Nixon, asking aides to pull “dirty tricks,” was involved in thwarting FBI and congressional investigations into Watergate. He even ordered aides to burglarize the Brookings Institution.

Obama’s secrecy on issues from drone strikes to (until recently) Benghazi talking points is disappointing for a president who promised the most open administration in history, but it hardly rises to Nixonian levels. Indeed, Obama seems about as open on internal White House and administration matters as his recent predecessors — which is to say, not much. Even so, the broad forces now undercutting him have also harmed past presidents. The so-called scandals, and the “Nixonian” charge, are not without consequences.

With their party on a presidential losing streak, Republicans in Congress are seizing any opportunity to damage the White House by pumping up its missteps, big or small, into Watergate-like proportions. Such tactics are hardly unique to the GOP, of course; Democrats took a similar approach toward Bush on issues such as Sept. 11 investigations, weapons of mass destruction and the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

At congressional hearings, Republicans have called witnesses who push the notion of an administration cover-up of the Benghazi debacle. Obama has fired the acting IRS commissioner, but we should brace for more hearings on the IRS as well as the Associated Press phone records.

On all these fronts, the Obama administration has made matters worse for itself. It initially failed to give a straightforward account of its response to the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. The Justice Department’s seizure of AP phone records is an affront to civil liberties. And news that the IRS targeted tea party and other anti-big-government groups for special scrutiny — actions that the president has called “inexcusable” — only strengthens the perception on the right that Obama’s government has become a leviathan. Carney’s efforts to distance the White House from the Justice Department, the IRS and, to a lesser extent, the CIA and the State Department give the impression of a bureaucracy run amok.

But none of this even come close to Watergate. There are far more apt and instructive analogies.

If anything, the tragedy in Benghazi recalls Reagan’s failed effort to tame Lebanon’s civil war — resulting in the suicide truck bombing that killed 241 Marines and other U.S. troops in 1983 — and Clinton’s disastrous military operation in Somalia, where 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis died in the Battle of Mogadishu. During Gerald Ford’s presidency, a Palestinian separatist group killed the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Francis Meloy, and his economic adviser, Robert Waring, and sniper fire killed Ambassador Rodger Davies in Cyprus.

Putting U.S. soldiers, spies and diplomats into civil wars or politically volatile situations in weak states is a fraught and sometimes deadly enterprise. The kind of limited military and diplomatic actions that Reagan, Clinton and Obama took in Beirut, Mogadishu and Benghazi, respectively, all failed because of flawed strategies and inadequate security precautions. These parallels, more than any Nixonian cover-up, are most salient to the Benghazi debacle.

The IRS developments bring to mind past government intrusions, such as when a State Department official in the George H.W. Bush administration searched Bill Clinton’s passport files in 1992, or in 2008, when State Department employees also searched the passport records of Obama, Hillary Rodham Clintonand John McCain. In all these instances, mid-level officials invaded politicians’ privacy and singled them out for scrutiny. (In all of them, the White House appeared to have no involvement.)

The Justice Department’s secret collection of AP phone records is the most revelatory of Obama’s three so-called scandals. During the Cold War, presidents of both parties agreed, more often than not, that the United States must use diplomacy, economic aid and military intervention to stop the spread of communism. But the unfolding AP saga is the latest example of how, in the post-9/11 world, Democratic and Republican presidents have arrived at a different consensus: National security trumps civil liberties.

The Justice Department’s actions are an extension of efforts by the George W. Bush administration to hound journalists in pursuit of the sources of leaks of classified information. Bush’s attempts to find out who leaked information on warrantless wiretaps presaged Obama’s. On guarding national secrets, the current administration has displayed far more continuity with Bush’s than most of Obama’s supporters would have imagined on Inauguration Day in 2009.

Indeed, what we know of the Associated Press saga bolsters the evidence that this administration’s anti-leaking efforts are more zealous than Bush’s. The previous administration threatened to prosecute reporters for espionage, but, according to a Bloomberg News report, this Justice Department has actually prosecuted more officials for leaking than all prior administrations combined.

Nixon’s paranoia and vengefulness defined his White House. He abused his power to silence his opponents and Vietnam War critics, and win reelection. But the Obama White House’s penchant for secrecy and its hostility toward the media should be seen in the context of the blinkered attitudes that recent administrations have displayed toward domestic detractors. Clinton, Bush and Obama surrounded themselves with loyalists and cultivated a bunker mind-set, battling a legion of critics eager for any hint of scandal to take the president down. (It’s an understandable mind-set when members of the press hype up any hint of scandal, turning minor stumbles into mini-Watergates.)

Obama seems to have cultivated within his administration a broad disdain for conservatives and for the tea party in particular, which may help explain why mid-level IRS employees put a bullseye on these groups; a frustration with congressional Republicans that has bred the kind of antagonism to opponents seen in Clinton’s and Bush’s White Houses; and suspicion of much of the news media.

Such attitudes may bear a surface resemblance to Nixon’s secrecy and belligerence — but in truth they are found deep in all modern White Houses. Even Obama, who vowed to change politics in his 2008 run, has been no less susceptible to them than any of his predecessors.

It’s hard to imagine the next White House team — whether under Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush or someone else — behaving very differently.

Actor and liberal activist John Cusack tweaked the administration, tweeting “Prism the name for electronic prison – all have to wear lojacks,” in reference to the PRISM data mining program revealed in leaks by former NSA employee Edward Snowden last week.

Cusack also re-tweeted “Obama is becoming the next Nixon.”

Prominent writer/director Judd Apatow of “Knocked Up” fame also took to Twitter to blast the administration: “What is this, North Korea? We are so inundated with so much info and so many problems – we have given up caring.""

Apatow also drew attention to reports on the scandal, calling it ""an outrageous breach of the privacy and rights of American citizens.”

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore also hopped on the bandwagon, tweeting “the administration has now lost all credibility” while spotlighting a 2007 Obama quote: “that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more (spying) on citizens... No more tracking citizens...""

Some media critics called the celebrities' about face a welcome change.

“I am encouraged to see the Hollywood left is starting to dish out some bipartisan criticism. Now, the NSA scandal under the Obama administration has many feeling betrayed by a Democrat who promised more transparency and less intrusion,” political blogger and author Thomas Moyer told FOX411 Pop Tarts column. “Further, it hits a lot closer to home when you find out that your personal phone records are being monitored, something that scares a lot of people.”

But some left-leaners in Hollywood had no problem with the administration's reported actions. Liberal comedian and HBO host Bill Maher praised both the tapping, and Obama’s handling of the growing scandal, during his program Friday night.

“I’m okay with it now that Obama is in office. I’m kind of trusting of him,” he said. “We live in a world of nuclear weapons. And there are religious fanatics who would love to get one and set if off here… The fact that a city can be demolished in one second kinda tips the scale for me. I’m not saying to look into your emails is the right thing, I’m just saying, I’m not gonna pretend it’s ‘cause I’m brave, it’s ‘cause I’m scared.”

And Chrissy Teigen, best known for posing in swimsuits for Sports Illustrated and being engaged to singer John Legend, also dismissed the issue on Monday.

“On NSA: I’m most shocked you’re shocked,” she wrote. “Although I understand why you’re upset, I personally could not care less.”

The Guardian broke the story late Wednesday that the federal government was collecting phone call records from Verizon customers.

The Guardian and the Washington Post followed with a series of reports about the calls being taken from other telecommunications companies and that the NSA and FBI have a Internet scouring program, code-named PRISM, that records Internet activities, all part of a post-9/11 effort to thwart terrorism."

Story highlights NEW: The ACLU says it filed a lawsuit against NSA domestic surveillance President Obama slammed by controversies, criticism from the right and left The bitter political divide of his first term remains, and may be getting worse History shows that second terms can be tougher for presidents

(CNN) —

History shows that second terms in the White House can be much tougher than first ones, and that is proving true so far for President Barack Obama.

Less than five months in, Obama and his administration appear knocked off balance by a barrage of controversies and criticisms exacerbating the bitter political battles that marked his first four years in office.

He’s under fire from the right and left, accused by some of conspiratorial machinations to grab even more power than the leader of the free world legally holds.

Headlines are dominated by scandals such as the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups and classified leaks that disclosed details of the vast data mining and surveillance apparatus created after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Meanwhile, Republicans and some Democrats say his attorney general should resign over various issues including secret subpoenas of journalist phone records.

Conservative Democrat: Holder should think about quitting

Now, late night comedians are making the controversies a staple of opening monologues, and even the first lady got heckled – at a Democratic fundraiser, no less.

While the issue was gay rights, the incident showed how Obama supporters also were frustrated by what they consider to be a lack of sufficient progress on progressive issues they expect the president to champion.

Second-term blues

Second-term blues have been the norm for presidents in recent decades, with Ronald Reagan facing the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s and Bill Clinton getting impeached over the Monica Lewinskly affair in the 1990s.

To columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, the latest Washington scandals “have put the president off balance,” with the administration on defense instead of driving the agenda.

“The choice will be in how the administration tries to deal with it,” Avlon said. “If it’s in denial and acts like these events are occurring outside its purview or control, that will be a big problem.”

Obama finds himself mired in topics and disputes far from his second-term agenda, in part because he maintained some of the national security policies of his predecessor that were adopted in a nation traumatized by 9/11, noted CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger.

“This is a president now who’s dealing with issues he never thought he was going to have to deal with,” Borger said Monday, referring to drone strikes, government surveillance and classified leaks. “But when you continue some of the policies of George W. Bush, you’re going to have some of the same questions that are raised about them.”

How should Obama respond?

Avlon and Borger agreed that Obama must be proactive in dealing with the newly revealed details about how the government has access to phone records and Internet activity as tools in fighting terrorism.

Last week’s leak of classified documents on the U.S. intelligence programs forced Obama to try to reassure the nation by declaring “nobody is listening to your telephone calls.”

However, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor’s claim of a “false choice” between civil liberties and national security following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks now argued that such a choice was inevitable.

“You can’t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,” Obama said. “We’re going to have to make some choices as a society.”

12 moments in national security for Obama’s team

Borger said Obama now needs to bolster his administration’s explanation so far – that Congress and federal judges have sufficient oversight to prevent abuses of the information available.

“I think he ought to get out there, speak with the American public, say not only why this kind of surveillance is defensible, but why he thinks it is essential in a post-9/11 world and lay it out there for the American people within the strictures of what he can say given the classified nature of the program,” she said.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King noted that despite Obama’s insistence his administration struck a proper balance between national security and domestic surveillance, critics from ranging from libertarian GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to liberal Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon are calling for more details and debate.

“If the president doesn’t try to get ahead of it, guess what, he’ll get dragged along with it,” King said.

Other issues on the table

On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it filed a constitutional challenge to the National Security Agency program that collected information on phone calls, arguing it violated First Amendment rights to free speech and association as well as Fourth Amendment rights to privacy.

The controversies come as the administration and Congress wrestle with other volatile issues, including a bipartisan push for immigration reform and a debate over whether to arm Syrian rebels.

Avlon and King agreed that Obama needs to move forward on issues where progress can occur, and both cited the Senate immigration bill that would offer a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States.

Conservative Republicans fiercely oppose the measure, but more mainstream GOP legislators consider it vital to the party’s hopes of building support among the nation’s fastest-growing demographic – the Hispanic vote.

In last year’s presidential election, exit polls showed Obama trounced GOP nominee Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters.

“The fact that immigration reform looks possible is significant,” Avlon said, saying passage of a bill would be a “significant legacy accomplishment” for Obama and also a boost for Congress at a time of extremely low public approval ratings.

Republicans led by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama consider the immigration measure drafted by a bipartisan Senate “Gang of Eight” little more than amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They demand stricter border enforcement provisions before providing legal status of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.

Despite such opposition, the Senate voted Tuesday to open debate on the measure, with many Republican foes joining Democrats on the procedural move.

However, conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas predicted that while the measure would pass the Senate, it had no chance of winning approval from the GOP-led House unless the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants was removed.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration is looking at possible options this week to increase support to Syrian rebels after resisting persistent calls for months to provide weapons.

“There is a recognition that unless we provide help, a lot of help, the situation is going to be very, very terrible,” one senior administration official said.

The official described a “somber mood” among Syria hands throughout the administration, who remain frustrated at inaction by the Obama administration in the face of a deterioration on the ground in Syria and spillover to neighboring states like Lebanon.

GOP scrutinizes Justice Department

Republicans are quick to seize on any foreign policy objection with the Obama administration as an opening to attack former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is considered the leading possible Democratic presidential contender in 2016.

In the House, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has demanded more information on erroneous talking points by the administration four days after the terrorist attack last September on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the panel’s GOP chairman, also is a leading critic of Attorney General Eric Holder over the botched “Fast and Furious” gun walking program and other issues.

Holder now faces further scrutiny over the Justice Department’s secret subpoenas of phone records for Associated Press journalists last year as part of an investigation of a classified leak.

He has told legislators he recused himself from that case and never would prosecute a journalist for doing investigative reporting.

Republicans question if Holder lied to Congress when he told a congressional hearing last month that he had no knowledge of any possible prosecution of journalists linked to classified leaks.

Avlon said the various issues provide grist for Obama critics now, but the major factor in determining public opinion on a presidency will be the economy, which is moving in the right direction for the White House.

“Teflon presidents are Teflon in part because of the economy,” he said, rejecting accusations by some conservatives that Obama’s troubles amount to scandals that could lead to impeachment.

“The impulse to simply throw out Nixon narratives as a poster boy for the second-term curse is silly,” Avlon added. “This ain’t Watergate and calls for impeachment reflect hyperpartisan wishes rather than reality.”

Maybe not impeachment, but certainly fodder for television comedians. For example, David Letterman joked that for his daughter Sasha’s birthday, Obama gave her Justin Bieber’s phone records.

Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked at the daily briefing about Obama's repeated claim -- which he asserted most recently during a speech in Tennessee on Tuesday -- that Washington is getting distracted by phony scandals. Asked what the president was referring to, Carney listed the scandals over the IRS targeting of conservative groups and over Benghazi.

""What we've seen, as time has passed and more facts have become known, whether it's about the attacks in Benghazi and the talking points or revelations about conduct at the IRS, that attempts to turn this into a scandal have failed,"" Carney said.

Carney was specifically referring to claims by GOP lawmakers that the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack, by stressing the connection to an anti-Islam film. The administration denies this. But lawmakers continue to have concerns that extend far beyond the so-called Benghazi talking points.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., in an interview with Fox News, called the administration's latest comments unacceptable.

More On This...

""His recently calling these phony scandals, that, to me, is incredibly wrong. It's misleading to the American people,"" she said.

Specifically, lawmakers on Wednesday renewed their concerns -- in a letter to the newly confirmed FBI director -- about the status of the investigation into the attack.

Eight Republican lawmakers, voicing frustration about the seemingly slow pace of the investigation 10 months after the Sept. 11 attacks, were sending the letter to James Comey, demanding he make the Benghazi probe a priority. Comey was confirmed on Monday to replace Robert Mueller at the helm of the FBI.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who started the letter along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that the FBI is failing to interview key people connected with the militant group Ansar al-Sharia.

""Our FBI has never talked to these people, and that's just wholly unacceptable,"" Chaffetz said.

""This is a pathetic effort to bring people to justice,"" Graham said, in a separate interview with Fox News.

In the draft letter, the lawmakers ask for a status report within 30 days.

""Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack. The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don't know more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave Americans,"" they wrote.

""It has been more than 10 months since the attacks. We appear to be no closer to knowing who was responsible today than we were in the early weeks following the attack. This is simply unacceptable. We encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi.""

Obama administration officials have tried to assuage lawmakers' lingering concerns and questions about the Benghazi attack, including over allegations that the administration misled the public about the nature of the assault last September. But lawmakers have also grown increasingly frustrated over the fact that nobody has been brought to justice since four Americans were killed in the attack on two U.S. posts in the eastern Libya city that was a home base for the anti-Qaddafi rebellion.

Lawmakers probed further on Wednesday, when they had a closed hearing with Col. George Bristol, who was the commander of a task force operating in northern and western Africa. He briefed members of the House Armed Services Committee."

She added, ""The reporters who work for the Times in Washington have told me many of their sources are petrified even to return calls"" in light of the Justice Department's agressive investigations into leaks.

Late Thursday afternoon, The Times published another scathing editorial about the sweeping court order that allowed the NSA to collect Verizon customers' phone data. The board wrote:

Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it. That is one reason we have long argued that the Patriot Act, enacted in the heat of fear after the 9/11 attacks by members of Congress who mostly had not even read it, was reckless in its assignment of unnecessary and overbroad surveillance powers.

The board added that it was not objecting to the legality of the court order but argued against using the Patriot Act for this purpose.

This stunning use of the act shows, once again, why it needs to be sharply curtailed if not repealed.

The suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, a naturalized American citizen, remained hospitalized on Saturday for treatment of injuries sustained when he was captured by the police on Friday night, and it was not clear whether he had been questioned yet. But the administration’s effort to stretch a gap in the Miranda rule for questioning about immediate threats to public safety in this and other terrorism cases has alarmed advocates of individual rights.

Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said it would be acceptable for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to ask Mr. Tsarnaev about “imminent” threats, like whether other bombs are hidden around Boston. But he said that for broader questioning, the F.B.I. must not “cut corners.”

“The public safety exception to Miranda should be a narrow and limited one, and it would be wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional to use it to create the case against the suspect,” Mr. Romero said. “The public safety exception would be meaningless if interrogations are given an open-ended time horizon.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/opinion/the-republicans-benghazi-obsession.html,2013-05-10 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],The Republicans’ Benghazi Obsession - The New York Times,"Before Wednesday’s hearing on the attack in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans in Congress promised explosive new details about the administration’s mishandling of the episode. Instead, the hearing showed, yet again, that sober fact-finding is not their mission. Common sense and good judgment have long given way to conspiracy-mongering and a relentless effort to discredit President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The attack on the lightly protected consulate in Benghazi in September that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans was a tragic event, and Americans should know the full story. The most authoritative account, completed in December, came from an independent inquiry, led by two respected and now retired officials — Thomas Pickering, a former deputy secretary of state, and Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Their report was unsparing in concluding that “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels” in the State Department’s bureaus of diplomatic security and near eastern affairs resulted in a “security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place.” Mrs. Clinton took responsibility for the security failures when she testified at a Congressional hearing in January.

Wednesday’s hearing, led by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California who is chairman of the House oversight committee, featured three witnesses who testified about those failures. One of them, Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 official at the American Embassy in Tripoli, was at the embassy the night of the Benghazi attack. He said he was later demoted for raising questions about how the incident was handled, a charge the State Department denied."

It’s a move Pruitt called not only unconstitutional, but damaging to the ideal of a free press in the country in his first television interviews on the scandal Sunday.

In a separate interview with the AP, Pruitt said, ""It's too early to know if we'll take legal action but I can tell you we are positively displeased and we do feel that our constitutional rights have been violated.""

He said President Obama ""should rein in that out-of-control investigation.""

""They've been secretive, they've been overbroad and abusive -- so much so that taken together, they are unconstitutional because they violate our First Amendment rights,"" he added.

Although the Justice Department has not explained why it sought phone records from the AP, Pruitt pointed to a May 7, 2012, story that disclosed details of a successful CIA operation in Yemen to stop an airliner bomb plot around the one-year anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of Usama bin Laden.

The AP delayed publication of that story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security.

""We respected that, we acted responsibly, we held the story,"" Pruitt said.

Pruitt said the AP published the story only after officials from two government entities said the threat had passed. He said the administration still asked that the story be held until an official announcement the next day, a request the AP rejected.

The news service viewed the story as important because White House and Homeland Security Department officials were saying publicly there was no credible evidence of a terrorist threat to the U.S. around the one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death.

""So that was misleading to the American public. We felt the American public needed to know this story,"" Pruitt said.

The AP has seen an effect on its newsgathering since the disclosure of the Justice Department's subpoena, Pruitt said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

“It will hurt,” he said. “We’re already seeing some impact. Officials are saying they’re reluctant to talk.”

The Justice Department sought phone records for a two-month period from more than 20 phone lines in four bureaus, including Washington and New York.

""Their rules require them to come to us first,"" Pruitt said.

But the Justice Department maintains that telling the AP would have posed a threat to their investigation.

Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder faced aggressive questioning at a hearing by the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee amid the outcry over the gathering of phone records.

Holder said he had recused himself from the AP investigation and that it was Deputy Attorney General James Cole’s decision to authorize the subpoena. Holder had said he supported the decision and said that the department had seized the phone records in an effort to find out who leaked confidential information about a foiled terror attack in Yemen.

The DOJ went a step further and said the AP’s actions put Americans at risk, something the news organization strongly refuted.

“Rather than talk to us in advance, they seized these phone records in secret, saying that notifying us would compromise their investigation,” Pruitt said in a statement on the AP’s website.

Sen. John Cornyn, who was also on “Face The Nation,” called for Holder’s resignation. “I think it’s time for him to go,” he said.

He Has Previously Served As The Post'S National Editor""]",Petraeus’s role in drafting Benghazi talking points raises questions,"The controversy over the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attack last year began at a meeting over coffee on Capitol Hill three days after the assault.

It was at this informal session with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the ranking Democrat asked David H. Petraeus, who was CIA director at the time, to ensure that committee members did not inadvertently disclose classified information when talking to the news media about the attack.

“We had some new members on the committee, and we knew the press would be very aggressive on this, so we didn’t want any of them to make mistakes,” Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.) said last week of his request in an account supported by Republican participants. “We didn’t want to jeopardize sources and methods, and we didn’t want to tip off the bad guys. That’s all.”

What Petraeus decided to do with that request is the pivotal moment in the controversy over the administration’s Benghazi talking points. It was from his initial input that all else flowed, resulting in 48 hours of intensive editing that congressional Republicans cite as evidence of a White House coverup.

A close reading of recently released government e-mails that were sent during the editing process, and interviews with senior officials from several government agencies, reveal Petraeus’s early role and ambitions in going well beyond the committee’s request, apparently to produce a set of talking points favorable to his image and his agency.

The information Petraeus ordered up when he returned to his Langley office that morning included far more than the minimalist version that Ruppersberger had requested. It included early classified intelligence assessments of who might be responsible for the attack and an account of prior CIA warnings — information that put Petraeus at odds with the State Department, the FBI and senior officials within his own agency.

The only government entity that did not object to the detailed talking points produced with Petraeus’s input was the White House, which played the role of mediator in the bureaucratic fight that at various points included the CIA’s top lawyer and the agency’s deputy director expressing opposition to what the director wanted.

“What [committee members] were looking for was the lowest common denominator,” said a senior administration official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the editing process. “That’s not what the agency originally produced.”

Petraeus did not respond to e-mailed requests to clarify questions surrounding his role in drafting and reviewing the talking points. He resigned as CIA director in November after details of an extramarital affair became public.

The attack

At 9:42 p.m. Sept. 11, 2012, as violent anti-American demonstrations unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa over an anti-Islam video made in the United States, a group of armed men attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Recriminations in Washington began within hours. But it was not until a month later that it became clear that the CIA, rather than the State Department, maintained the most significant presence in Benghazi.

Near the diplomatic outpost was a CIA installation where about two dozen intelligence and security personnel were based. Their mission was to track weapons shipments out of the country and to identify the numerous militias operating in Benghazi.

Security at this annex was the responsibility of the CIA, not the State Department. But because the annex operated under diplomatic cover, its existence as an intelligence facility was classified.

The State Department and the White House became the primary focus of the public criticism.

The debate within the CIA

After Petraeus’s morning coffee on Sept. 14, the CIA’s Office of Terrorism Analysis sent an internal agency e-mail with the subject line: “FLASH coordination — white paper for HPSCI,” referring to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

The committee “has asked for unclassified points immediately that they can use in talking to the media,” the e-mail said.

Then, shifting into the first person, the office’s director, who had accompanied Petraeus to the coffee, wrote, “I have been asked to provide a bit on responsibility,” including “warnings we gave to Cairo prior to the demonstration, as well as material on warnings we issued prior to 9/11 anniversary.”

Included was a six-point draft that began, “We believe based on currently available information that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired” by anti-American demonstrations elsewhere “and evolved” into assaults against “the U.S. consulate and subsequently its annex.”

It followed with a reference to previous attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi and a mention of Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda. That information, put in at Petraeus’s request, would become the chief source of tension between the agency, the State Department and the FBI.

Fifteen minutes after that e-mail, the CIA’s Office of Congressional Affairs sent its own internal message, with the subject line: “Due-Outs from HPSCI coffee.”

The first item for the committee was a “white paper” on media guidance — the talking points that would emerge a few hours later.

In addition, the e-mail listed two items “For DCIA,” a reference to Petraeus. That request included “Cable(s) to [redacted] warning of protests linked to the film and response” and “cable(s) to stations on 9/11 security.”

Republicans would later contend that the CIA had wanted to tell the truth about what unfolded that day but that the State Department, with White House support, removed the information for political reasons amid a heated presidential campaign.

But the e-mails reveal that the initial talking points also generated tension and confusion within the CIA, as officials sought to understand how Petraeus’s requests squared with what the committee had asked for.

Stephen W. Preston, the CIA’s general counsel, was among those most concerned with the first draft.

In an internal agency e-mail at 4:24 p.m. that Friday, he acknowledged that “there is a hurry to get this out.” The talking points should not “conflict with express instructions” from the National Security Council, the FBI and the Justice Department, he wrote, and that “in light of the criminal investigation, we are not to generate statements with assessments as to who did this.”

Although Ansar al-Sharia had quickly backed off an initial assertion of responsibility for the Benghazi attack, the group did not deny that some of its members were involved.

But its likely involvement was a classified matter, senior administration officials said, and the FBI had objected to including the information in the talking points on the grounds that doing so would undermine its investigation of the attack.

“I am copying the CIA front office,” Preston wrote, referring to Petraeus’s department, “who may be more familiar with those instructions and the tasking arising from the HPSCI coffee.”

Less than an hour later, the agency sent the talking points, which had been strengthened to include repeated CIA security warnings, to the White House and other agencies for review. The reference to Ansar remained in the draft, as did a line particularly beneficial to the CIA.

“The Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya,” the fifth talking point began.

At 6:21 p.m., then-National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor e-mailed the CIA Office of Public Affairs saying that Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, who has since become the White House chief of staff, had asked that “highlighted portions” of the draft be “coordinated with the State Department in the event that they get inquiries.”

The highlights indicated that McDonough’s main concern was the information about the prior CIA warnings to U.S. diplomatic missions in North Africa — information that was included at Petraeus’s request.

State Department balks

At 7:39 p.m. Friday, Victoria Nuland, then the State Department’s chief spokesperson, e-mailed deputy national security adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes; Jake Sullivan, director of policy planning at State; Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; and others. She expressed “serious concerns” about including Ansar and mentioning “warnings” in the talking points.

Nuland said the mention of the warnings “could be abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to Agency warnings.”

Rhodes responded, “We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation,” and suggested that the issue be resolved the next morning during a previously scheduled meeting of the national security deputies.

“We’ve tried to work the draft talking points for HPSCI through the coordination process but have run into major problems,” the CIA’s Office of Public Affairs wrote to Petraeus at 9:52 p.m. Sept. 14. “The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns.”

Early the next morning, CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell, informed of the State Department’s concerns, took his own editing pencil to the talking points.

He agreed with Nuland that the warnings about other protests in the region were irrelevant to the committee request, senior administration officials said, and that any mention of Ansar could expose classified information.

At 9:45 a.m. Saturday, Morell sent out his edited version of the talking points, pared down to three bullet points. A few minutes later, the terrorism analysis director, who had written the original version after attending the coffee with Petraeus, responded.

“They are fine with me. But, pretty sure HPSCI won’t like them,” the official wrote, signing off with a smiley-face emoticon.

A little more than two hours later, an e-mail to Morell from Petraeus’s front office staff expressed concern about what was happening to the talking points.

“Before going to the committee, may I please ask you to send these to the Director?” the front office wrote. “He needs to know in advance what is going to the Hill in his name, even if it is going with the force of the full interagency coordination.”

Morell responded with concern about whether Petraeus would approve the document, even after other agencies had signed off.

“Please run the points by the Director, then get them to

HPSCI,” he wrote soon after. “I spoke to the Director earlier about State’s deep concerns about mentioning the warnings and the other work done on this, but you will want to reemphasize in your note to DCIA.”

Morell was right to be worried.

In an e-mail sent two hours later to Morell and others inside the agency, Petraeus wrote, “No mention of the cable to Cairo, either? Frankly, I’d just as soon not use this, then. . . [National Security Council] call, to be sure; however, this is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get for unclas use.”

Asked about Petraeus’s warning, Ruppersberger said, “I’m not sure what he meant. I had no expectations.”"

Every shot missed.

Republican senators and congressmen on the foreign affairs committees of both houses had insisted that the departing secretary of State come in for a full day of hearings about the deadly terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Some of them must have thought this was a great chance to do preemptive damage to the most popular choice for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, she made them look like the clumsy bad guys in an Aaron Sorkin political drama.

The State Department’s own independent investigative board has already answered most of the serious questions about the Benghazi tragedy in which four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The panel cited the failures of mid-level officials and suggested 29 ways to improve the system. Clinton said implementation of those steps was already 85% complete.

A productive hearing would have concentrated on what else can be done to prevent similar tragedies in the future -- a discussion that would have also included examining why Congress not only consistently underfunds the State Department, but has blocked expenditure of money that has already been appropriated to shore up American diplomatic efforts in several international trouble spots.

Instead, too many of the Republican committee members had been coached to dredge up old questions about the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice. Last September, on the weekend following the attack, Rice went on the Sunday TV news shows and underplayed the terrorist connection, instead suggesting that the incident may have been connected with riots in other Muslim countries that were set off by an online preview of a never-made movie defaming the prophet Muhammad. Questions about why Rice said what she said have been answered repeatedly: She was parroting talking points provided by U.S. intelligence services.

A useful line of questions would have followed up on that answer. An L.A. Times Op-Ed article by former Joint Chiefs of Staff aide Sarah Chayes suggests where such an inquiry would lead: “One lesson to be drawn from the Benghazi snafu is that powerful bureaucratic filters prevent crucial information from reaching senior U.S. government leaders. Whether the client at the top is the U.N. ambassador, the director of Central Intelligence or the president, bureaucracies consistently massage and filter information before passing it up the chain.”

But the Republicans did not want to explore the tendency for bad information to emerge from the intelligence bureaucracy, they wanted to resurrect a specious political attack that got them nowhere in the final days of the presidential campaign. In their wild imaginings, Rice’s ill-informed comments were not just the result of bad information, they were part of an Obama administration effort to dupe the American people.

Clinton easily slapped back this and other equally off-the-wall lines of inquiry. Unlike most of her inquisitors who seemed to be working from Fox News talking points, Clinton was working from fact-based briefings. With their cranky theatrics, Kentucky’s freshman Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson proved to be perfect foils for Clinton’s virtuoso performance.

At the end of the day, Clinton left the stage looking stronger than ever. The only people who may feel worse about that than the Republicans are the ambitious Democrats who are contemplating a run for the Democratic presidential nomination next time around. On Wednesday, Clinton did not look too old, too tired or too vulnerable. She looked like she could beat anyone."

Two of the whistle-blowers' opening statements were obtained by Fox News, and in the statements they defend their credibility in testifying about what happened last Sept. 11 in Libya.

""I am a career public servant,"" Greg Hicks' statement reads. ""Until the aftermath of Benghazi, I loved every day of my job."" He was deputy chief of mission in Libya and became top U.S. diplomat in the country after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terror attack.

The other statement, by Mark Thompson of the State Department Counterterrorism Bureau, is mostly biographical. Testimony also is due Wednesday from Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was formerly the regional security officer in Libya.

The administration has parried Republican allegations lately by arguing that the attack is old news, that the State Department already has investigated it and that Republicans are engaged in a political witch hunt.

More On This...

But a series of carefully timed leaks on the whistle-blowers' testimony indicates House Republicans could have the goods to at least merit a second look at the administration narrative.

""The question is, where's the accountability for lying to the American people?"" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told Fox News. ""The American people were lied to.""

Issa claimed one ""cover-up"" is ""undeniable"" -- that the State Department botched security in Benghazi in the run-up to the attack. But, he said, ""it still doesn't explain the president misleading the American people over a period of weeks.""

Three whistle-blowers are set to testify shortly before noon to the oversight committee Issa chairs.

Issa's Democratic counterpart on the committee, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, voiced skepticism about the leaks of the witnesses' claims in advance of the hearing.

""If there was any matter that cries out for bipartisanship, it's this,"" he told Fox News, while raising criticisms that information about some witnesses wasn't available in advance to Democrats. ""This is about making sure that our diplomatic core are safe. ... I want to go wherever the evidence leads, but I want all the evidence.""

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, a member of that committee, said if it weren't for lawmakers' persistence, ""we would be left with a whole host of lies coming out of this administration, because they were not truthful about this.""

The ""truth"" surrounding the Benghazi attack has been elusive. The Obama administration has adamantly denied several of the latest charges, including a claim that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making on Sept. 11. The administration also denied that the whistle-blowers in question were intimidated -- while behind the scenes questioning the credibility of the witnesses.

The witnesses are expected to cover a breadth of material in their testimony Wednesday. Lawmakers have questioned to what extent security requests were ignored before the attack, whether the military could have done more to respond the night of the attack and whether talking points were intentionally changed for political reasons after the attack to downplay terrorism. The witnesses could address all three areas on Wednesday.

A key area of interest is how the attack was described in the immediate aftermath.

The Weekly Standard reported last week that the initial CIA talking points on the attack said ""Islamic extremists with ties to al Qaeda participated in the attack."" The reference to Al Qaeda was later taken out, and the initial reference to ""attacks"" was reportedly changed to ""demonstrations.""

According to The Weekly Standard, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland raised ""serious concerns"" at the time about the draft, concerned it could fuel criticism of the department.

The language continued to be watered down.

Issa told Fox News, in reference to the revisions, that ""it's very clear ... that this was a political change.""

State Department officials released a statement Tuesday night labeled ""Benghazi Attack Fack Check"" to defend its security efforts.

""No one is more determined than the State Department family to bring those who perpetrated this attack to justice and do everything we need to do to keep our people safe,"" the statement reads. ""That's where our attention is, and we hope Congress and the media, too, can keep the focus.""

Hicks, according to a transcript, also told congressional investigators that he thought it ""was a terrorist attack from the get go.""

The whistle-blowers will be able to provide a new perspective on what was happening on the ground that night.

Hicks, according to transcripts, told investigators that the U.S. military could have prevented one wave of the deadly attack on American personnel in Benghazi if fighter jets had been promptly deployed. Further, he claimed that a second rescue team that was supposed to go from Tripoli to Benghazi early the next morning was told not to go.

He said Special Forces personnel were planning to board a C-130 flight at around 6 a.m. local time on Sept. 12 but got a phone call when they were on their way to the flight telling them ""you can't go now, you don't have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight.""

He added: ""They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it,"" apparently because they did not have the ""right authority.""

Thompson has also claimed that Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the loop that night.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied the claim on Monday.

Daniel Benjamin, who ran the department's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time, also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges.

""I ran the bureau then, and I can say now with certainty, as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism, that this charge is simply untrue,"" he said. ""Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack, I was in frequent contact with the Department. At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of."""

The intrusions were detected in December while Attkisson was reporting almost exclusively on the government’s response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The attack on Sept. 11, 2012, killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Attkisson has previously investigated the Justice Department’s gun-tracking operation known as “Fast and Furious.”

In a statement Friday, CBS did not identify a culprit. It said Attkisson’s computer “was accessed by an unauthorized, external, unknown party on multiple occasions late in 2012.”

It added: “Evidence suggests this party performed all access remotely using Attkisson’s accounts. While no malicious code was found, forensic analysis revealed an intruder had executed commands that appeared to involve search and [removal] of data. This party also used sophisticated methods to remove all possible indications of unauthorized activity, and alter system times to cause further confusion.”

Attkisson said she noticed unusual activity in her CBS-issued laptop and her home computer, such as dormant computers spontaneously “waking up” at odd hours. The unusual activity, which also included disruptions on her home phone line, predate the December 2012 breach that CBS confirmed.

She said in an interview Friday that she was “outraged” by the breach, which did not appear to be aimed at extracting personal financial information.

“This wasn’t any ordinary malware of a phishing attempt,” that is, an effort to gain personal information, she said. “I assume someone wanted to see what I was working on.

“The privacy and security of every American citizen in his own home, not to mention the work of a journalist, is sacrosanct. The idea that an unknown party could come into your home electronically is upsetting and disturbing. . . . People should be disturbed that a reporter would be spied on and intimidated this way. I do feel that this was an attempt to make me feel intimidated.”

Attkisson said she stopped using the computer and the TV network’s internal data system in January after the security firm hired by CBS began looking into it.

CBS said it is still trying to identify “the responsible party and their method of access.”"

John McCain (R-Ariz.) pressed Sunday for a special congressional committee to investigate the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, last year, insisting that questions about former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s role remain unanswered.

“I don’t know what level of scandal, unquote, this rises to, but I know it rises to the level where it requires a full and complete ventilation of these facts,” McCain said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We’re still uncovering information which frankly contradicts the original line that the administration took.”

His comments came after the disclosure that administration emails on talking points about the deadly attack showed that the original CIA document underwent several revisions, including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to warnings about the terrorist threat around the facility.

PHOTOS: The controversy over Benghazi

McCain, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), first called for such a special panel on Benghazi last November. But the demand has gathered new backers this week since the emails appear to contradict initial claims by White House Spokesman Jay Carney that changes to the talking points in the days after the event were minor ones.

At least 139 House members are now backing a plan by Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) to name a special committee. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has so far resisted the appointment of a special panel, arguing that multiple committees already looking into the attack can handle the job.

The head of a panel of retired diplomats and ex-military officers, which investigated the attack, said Sunday that there was no reason to conduct another probe into what happened at Benghazi and the U.S. response in the hours and days that followed.

“I don’t see yet any reason why what we did at the accountability review board should be reopened,” said retired Ambassador Thomas Pickering on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

He noted that the panel had a narrow mandate to look at security arrangements at the facility. But he acknowledged that the panel had not questioned Clinton, who was still secretary of State, and other top State Department officials about their actions.

“We didn’t believe that was necessary, and I don’t see any reason to do so now,” he said.

Instead, he said, when they met with Clinton, they briefed her on their findings.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he has asked Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, who co-chaired the investigation, to answer questions after State Department officials criticized their review in hearings last week.

McCain said Clinton’s role was one issue still to be examined. “I think the secretary of State has played a role in this,” he said. “She had to have been in the loop some way, but we don’t know for sure.”

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), also appearing on “This Week,” said there was “absolutely not” a coverup by the administration but acknowledged that the talking points became a “consensus document that avoided all of the difficult issues.”

Mr. Obama departed from his script at a health care event in California to try to reassure Americans that he had not abused government authority by collecting telephone call logs and foreigners’ e-mail messages. But the disclosure hours later of secret contingency planning to target other countries for possible cyberattacks made his get-together with President Xi Jinping later in the day all the more awkward because cyberattacks by the Chinese are high on the American agenda.

The latest of three documents published over three days by the British newspaper The Guardian added to the understanding of the Obama administration’s approach to national security in an age of multifaceted threats and became another factor in the renewed debate over the balance between privacy and security.

The identity of the person who gave those documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post is not known, but The Post has described its source as a career intelligence officer angry at “what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy” by the Obama administration."

With no good answer, Carney plays to the media crowd and renews the White House attacks on Fox News.

A full five days after the September 11 terror attack in Benghazi, we are apparently supposed to believe Susan Rice was the only person in America who had no idea whatsoever four Americans might have just maybe/probably been the victims of a terror attack:

Henry: You described (Rice) as one of the most qualified, experienced foreign policy experts in America. If that’s the case, how did she get the information on Benghazi so wrong five days after the attack?

Carney: Ed, I would welcome the opportunity to correct the record especially for some news outlets who persist in misrepresenting the facts. You have seen the so-called talking points. You have seen the testimony of the deputy director of the CIA and the documents that demonstrate that the central point that they made was drafted in the first instance and every instance thereafter.

Henry: Then why did various intelligence officers say that they almost immediately knew that this was terror and if she’s so experienced why wouldn’t she see that as they saw it?

Carney: So you are suggesting that a senior member of the national security team should disagree with the assessments of the intelligence community because somebody appeared on Fox News and said something?

A crucial piece of context the media ignores about Susan Rice is that after her appointment to U.N. Ambassador, President Obama turned that position into a cabinet position. This means she was part of security briefings.

Still, a full five days after the attack, when everyone but the White House was admitting what we all knew to be true, Rice claimed there was no evidence of a premeditated terror attack.

That means she is either dumb or dishonest. Either way, she is not qualified to serve fries much less as a top-level adviser to the American president.

Carney, though, can get away with openly mocking Fox News as a defense because the rest of the lapdogs in that room hate Fox News just as much as Obama does. When it comes to Obama, the media focus is always about hammering those who search for the truth.

Fox has been searching for the truth, and that makes them a media target.

Darrell Issa revealed several new pieces of information about the Obama administration’s controversial description of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, casting doubt that the White House mischaracterized its cause by mere accident.

“The talking points were right and then the talking points were wrong,” Issa explained in response to a question about reporting at the Weekly Standard. The CIA and Greg Hicks, who took over as Charge d’Affairs in Libya after the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens, both knew immediately that it was an attack, not a protest.

Hicks, who did not appear on the show but whose reactions were featured based on transcripts of interviews with Issa’s committee, said he was stunned by what UN Ambassador Susan Rice claimed on five different news shows on Sep. 16. When she appeared on Face the Nation, she followed an interview with the President of Libya who claimed he had “no doubt” it was a terror attack. Moments later, Amb. Rice contradicted him and claimed a spontaneous protest was more likely.

Acting Ambassador Hicks watched the Sunday shows and said he found this contradiction shocking. “The net impact of what has transpired is the spokesperson of the most powerful country in the world has basically said that the President of Libya is either a liar or doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” he accused. Hicks added, “My jaw hit the floor as I watched this…I’ve never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career as on that day.”

Hicks believes the stunning failure of diplomacy on the Sunday news shows explains why ittook the FBI three weeks to gain access to the Benghazi site. The U.S. had effectively humiliated the Libyan President on national TV. That decision, he believed, probably compromised our ability to investigate and track down those responsible.

According to Hicks, no one from the State Department contacted him about what Amb. Rice would be saying in advance. The next morning he called Beth Jones, Acting Assistant Secretary for Near East Affaris, and asked her why Amb. Rice had made the statements she had. Jones responded, “I don’t know.”

A report published Friday by the Weekly Standard suggests that State Dept. spokesperson Victoria Nuland took issue with the initial talking points and, with backing from the White House, removed any evidence of al Qaeda involvement and of prior attacks on western targets in the region. According to emails reviewed by the Weekly Standard, Nuland said her superiors (unnamed) were concerned about criticism from Congress."

Not only has the scandal picked up steam in the mainstream press (Jake Tapper’s ABC News report tonight is a must-watch), but high-ranking members of the President’s own party are now demanding answers. This includes the man most often cited as a likely Secretary of State should Obama win a second term, Senator John Kerry:

Senate Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in questioning the Obama administration’s handling of the fatal Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and why the administration refused for days to acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack linked to al Qaeda.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., circulated a bipartisan letter addressed to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, asking for an “accounting of the attacks against U.S. missions in Egypt, Libya and Yemen,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Examiner.

The lawmakers are also demanding to know whether the administration had any advance warnings of the Libyan attack and, if so, whether it had shared that information with U.S. personnel on the ground.

The letter marks the first time congressional Democrats have so directly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration’s response to inquiries about the attacks, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others and raised questions about U.S. security throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa.

A Kerry aide confirmed that the committee intended to enlist the support of Republicans and Democrats and said the letter would likely be sent Friday. Another aide told The Examiner that the panel’s 10 Democrats and nine Republicans plan to sign it.

The false White House narrative blaming the murders on a protest gone bad over a YouTube video never really passed the smell test. But Obama maintained that illusion straight through to his speech before the United Nations two days ago, even as reports surfaced that our government knew al-Qaeda was behind the attack within 24 hours. Apparently, this has become too much to sweep under the rug for some of the mainstream press and Democrats.

The behavior of Obama and Secretary of State Clinton over the past 14 days is a scandal of the highest order. Lies, cover ups, and neglect for security of American intelligence and personnel that borders on criminal.

I’ve been skeptical that the same media, that early on conspired in this cover up by intentionally pouring all of its focus and fire on Mitt Romney’s criticism of the Cairo Embassy apology, would go near this before the election. But the sins are so great and glaring, it doesn’t look as though ignoring it will be possible for another 40 days.

The truth of the matter is the Americans who survived that attack cannot legally reveal to members of the press or most lawmakers that they were even witnesses to the attack in Benghazi.

According to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, immediately following the attack, the FBI, as part of the agency’s investigation, interviewed survivors of the Benghazi attack.

Bill Bransford, a Washington, D.C. attorney at Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. who specializes in federal employment law told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “First of all, I’m assuming that most of these people who witnessed the attack, except for the State Department folks, would be intelligence people, and they are not covered by the whistle blower protection laws.”

Bransford added, “They are covered by whatever policies their agency has. An executive order that President Obama issued in the late fall in which he ordered the intelligence community to come up with a more effective whistle blower protection system, which has not yet been developed.”

However, as federal employees, State Department personnel must sign non-disclosure agreements. Bransford stressed, “If somebody violates one of these non-disclosure agreements, the consequences could include: interfering with a criminal investigation, obstruction of justice, criminal charges for releasing classified information, and those are pretty serious.”

Serious indeed. The Obama administration’s Justice Department has prosecuted more federal employees for leaking information to the press under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other administrations combined. Bloomberg News reported last September:

Lowell, the Washington defense lawyer who has counted as his clients the likes of Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist, and political figures including former presidential candidate John Edwards, said the Obama administration is using the Espionage Act “like a club” against government employees accused of leaks. The prosecutions, which Obama and the Justice Department have defended on national security grounds, mean that government officials who speak to the media can face financial and professional ruin as they spend years fighting for their reputations, and, in some cases, their freedom.

Since Breitbart News first broke in December that the Obama administration was hiding Benghazi attack survivors, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began demanding the FBI hand over to Congress the interviews the agency conducted with individuals who survived the deadly attack.

Senator Graham spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday last weekend about his frustration regarding the issue:

WALLACE: Senator, let me pick up on one of them I find, frankly, quite astonishing. What is the administration’s explanation for the fact the FBI interviewed the survivors, all the Americans who safely got out of Benghazi, right after the attack, months ago, and that they refused to give the transcripts of the interviews to Congress. What’s their explanation for that? GRAHAM: This is an ongoing criminal investigation is what they told me. We are going back to the law enforcement model, where we’re treating al Qaeda as sort of a mafia, common criminal element rather than enemy combatants. And here’s what was really stunning, the FBI interviewed the survivors, two days after the attack in Germany and, the CIA never called the FBI for weeks, wanting the results of the interview before they made their assessments — we are going back to the pre-9/11 mentality of — where we treat it as a law enforcement function, and FBI and the CIA never talk to each other, which is very dangerous. Benghazi was system failure, before, during and after.

Clinton testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January that there were about 25 to 30 survivors and she only spoke to one. Many of the individuals who worked at the U.S. compound were either CIA or State Department employees.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is not only heavily guarded on the outside but on the inside as well, some say. In December 2012, visitors to the amputee ward at the NNMMC (Bethesda Hospital) observed what appeared to be Secret Service personnel moving in and out of a closed wing of the floor that was off-limits to everyone else.

According to Fox News, former Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, visited Benghazi survivors at Walter Reed on February 4th. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren asked Senator Graham about Kerry’s visit.

I’ve been asking in November, we wrote to the president. The person I blame above all others is President Obama, did you know president Obama, in April or June why wasn’t the Congress informed. They were interviewed two days by the FBI you know the CIA never called up the FBI and say, what did they say about the attack. If you talk to the survivors, you would have known it was a coordinated terrorist attack and not a mob.

Bransford points out that, to the extent that these potential witnesses are State Department employees, they are governed by the whistle blower protection act as modified by the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which just went into effect six weeks ago. According to Bransford, it does have a provision in it about non-disclosure agreements, but that some of the changes may not yet be in effect because the law is so new and the employee is supposed to be aware of the non-disclosure policies.

For example, it would be consistent with the law on classified information and what they’re allowed to tell Congress. That’s an area that’s kind of brand new and it would only apply to the non-intelligence people–like diplomatic security agents. The FBI probably interviewed them. It is customary and probably consistent with valid non-disclosure policy to tell somebody who is a witness in an ongoing criminal investigation, which of course the FBI is there, so it’s criminal and counter-terrorism, to tell (witnesses) they are not to discuss the substance of the interview or what they discussed with the investigating agents with anyone. And that would be consistent with a valid non-disclosure policy. So, at this stage, to get (Benghazi survivors) to talk might be tough.

Is there any recourse for Benghazi survivors to ever tell their stories? Certain members of Congress who are authorized to receive information of an ongoing FBI investigation may be these individuals’ only outlets to do so.

He added, “Does that mean that they can’t release it later? Maybe. Meaning there could be some political stuff going on to try and get that information but I’m not sure what’s going to happen with that.”

Senator Charles Grassley (R – IA), the co-author of the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act sent a statement to Breitbart News on the law:"

Told Me Not to Talk to Congress,"Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission for the United States in Libya, and the top US official in Libya after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today – and he told Congress that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department lawyers tried to stop him from talking to Congresspeople investigating. “I was instructed not to allow the RSO [Regional Security Officer], the acting deputy chief of mission and myself to be personally interviewed by Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz [of Utah],” said Hicks.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) couldn’t believe what he was hearing: “So the people at State told you, ‘Don’t talk to the guy who is coming to investigate?'” Hicks’ answer: “Yes, sir.” Jordan pressed: “You’ve had several congressional delegations come to various places you’ve been around the world. Has that ever happened, where lawyers get on the phone to you prior to a congressional delegate coming to investigate … Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what took place?” Hicks: “Never.”

Jordan then asked Hicks whether a lawyer from State had been sent with Hicks when the Congressional delegation arrived – whether State had forced a minder on Hicks. “Yes, sir, that’s true,” said Hicks. Hicks went on to describe a classified briefing he had with Rep. Chaffetz in Libya: “The lawyer was excluded from the meeting because his clearance was not high enough, and the delegation had insisted that the hearing not be limited.” Hicks stated that the lawyer attempted to get into the briefing anyway, and the annex chief would not allow it.

After that meeting, Hicks was called by Cheryl Mills, counselor for the State Department and staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills was deputy White House counsel under the Clinton administration, and she was termed the “shining star of the defense team” for President Clinton’s Senate impeachment trial. Jordan described Mills as “as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton.” Hicks told the story: “A phone call from that … person is generally not considered to be good news …. She demanded a report on the visit … She was upset … She was very upset.”

Koch said his only shock was that it happened so soon, citing Obama’s nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary, according to The Algemeiner newspaper.

Is it true? Did Koch really say that?

“I did say it,” he told me Tuesday, adding he was making a point about why he had endorsed Obama, despite such misgivings.

“People don’t really change when you get to his age,” the former mayor said of Obama. “So I had no doubt that with the course of time, his new strength would weaken.”

[pullquote]

Still, he insists, “I don’t regret supporting him. I believe it bought time . . . I’m just sorry it was so short-lived.”

Now it was my turn to be shocked. Not over the fact that Koch thinks Hagel is a disaster for America and Israel. I agree. Rather, I’m shocked that Koch is shocked at Obama.

How could he not see that the betrayal would be instant?

Except during his two campaigns, Obama consistently tilted away from Israel and toward its enemies. His uncertain policy toward Iran, which has threatened to wipe Israel off the map, has unnerved many Israelis and Americans, and his antagonistic attitude toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sealed the impression of hostility.

Koch is no stranger to Obama’s history, but takes a more pragmatic view, one leavened by the president’s personal charm in a private meeting they had.

“He’s not anti-Semitic, he’s not anti-Israel,” Koch told me. “He has a philosophy of getting Islamic nations close to the US, even if it means creating tension with Israel.”

He believed Obama would win re-election and that support would earn his views a hearing. He also credits Obama for rejecting full Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, and for helping Israel during its fight with Hamas.

“He stood like an oak in support of Israel,” Koch declares.

Or maybe that was the price Obama had to pay for support in the campaign. My view is that, now that he’s got four more years, with about 65 percent of the Jewish vote, Obama’s free to stop pretending—and to nominate Hagel.

Obama didn’t pick him despite Hagel’s dovish views on Iran, hawkish views against Israel and eagerness to cut our military. He picked Hagel because of those views.

Remember what Obama told the Russians — he would have “more flexibility” once he never again had to answer to voters. Well, welcome to the Mideast Reset.

Similarly, Obama’s choice of John Brennan to head the CIA isn’t a clumsy breach of liberal faith. The Bush administration’s use of water boarding on three murderous detainees was deemed torture by Obama, and Brennan, who was part of the Bush team, got his job in the Obama White House by claiming he had opposed water boarding.

Whatever the truth, under Obama, Brennan blessed the drone killing of hundreds of foreign fighters. So, he went from fake drowning to fatal droning, and is now considered Grade A to leftists who called Bush a Nazi.

It’s all part of the Obama double standard, where down is up — if he says so.

Elections have consequences, none more than this one. With Obama free from voter accountability and blessed with weak and divided opponents, America better be prepared for even more radical policies, sweetened with semantic fakery.

Take his priceless introduction of Hagel. “Chuck represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in Washington,” Obama said. That sounds like one thing but means another, because Obama’s definition of bipartisanship is when Republicans agree 100 percent with him.

Hagel, by endorsing Obama in 2008, fits the definition. Ergo, he’s bipartisan and, by picking him, Obama is, too.

And both are friends of Israel.

USA TODAY

Surveillance procedures now controversial will %27poll damn well after the next attack%27

He argues that proposed operational changes would reverse changes put in place after 9/11

He endorses idea of splitting NSA from Cyber Command%2C an idea Obama has rejected

WASHINGTON — Retired general Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, called on President Obama Monday to show ""some political courage"" and reject many of the recommendations of the commission he appointed to rein in NSA surveillance operations.

""President Obama now has the burden of simply doing the right thing,"" Hayden told USA TODAY's Capital Download. ""And I think some of the right things with regard to the commission's recommendations are not the popular things. They may not poll real well right now. They'll poll damn well after the next attack, all right?""

Obama, who received the report from the five-member advisory committee just before he left to vacation in Hawaii, has promised to make ""a pretty definitive statement"" in January about its 46 recommendations. He appointed the panel in the wake of a firestorm over disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about surveillance of all Americans' telephone calls and spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other friendly foreign leaders.

The commission, led by former acting CIA director Michael Morell, said the recommendations were designed to increase transparency, accountability and oversight at the NSA.

Hayden, who headed the super-secret agency from 1999 to 2005, oversaw the launch of some of the controversial programs after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. He defended them as effective and properly overseen by congressional intelligence committees and a special court.

""Right now, since there have been no abuses and almost all the court decisions on this program have held that it's constitutional, I really don't know what problem we're trying to solve by changing how we do this,"" he said, saying the debate was sparked after ""somebody stirred up the crowd."" That's a reference to Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia.

Snowden's revelations have fueled objections by civil liberties advocates that the NSA goes too far in collecting information about Americans not suspected of any wrongdoing. This month, a federal judge in Washington called the program ""almost Orwellian,"" although a few days later, another federal judge in New York said it was legal.

Hayden's blunt warnings about the risks he sees in accepting the commission's recommendations underscore the difficult balancing act Obama faces between ensuring the nation's security and respecting citizens' privacy. No decision he makes is likely to avoid criticism.

""Here I think it's going to require some political courage,"" said Hayden, 68, a retired Air Force general whose service in the nation's top intelligence posts gives him particular standing. ""Frankly, the president is going to have to use some of his personal and political capital to keep doing these things.""

In the interview with USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series, Hayden:

•Said the vast data on Americans' phone records are ""far safer and privacy is far more secured with NSA holding the data than some third party."" The commission recommended that the phone companies or a third party take over responsibility for storing the data.

•Protested that requiring the NSA to seek individual court orders when it wants to search the data would reverse changes put in place after the 9/11 attacks.

•Ridiculed a proposal to increase protections for personal data about non-citizens abroad. ""The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution is not an international treaty,"" he said. For those who aren't covered by its protections, he said, ""if your communications contain information that make Americans more safe and more free, game on.""

•Said the idea of requiring the president and his advisers, not the intelligence community, to approve any spying operation on foreign leaders would be ""a little cumbersome"" but not a significant change from the way things effectively work already. ""If you don't think the national command authority had a broad understanding of what we're doing, I've got a bridge I want to interest you in,"" he said.

•Endorsed the recommendation to split leadership of the NSA from the Cyber Command, the military's cyber-warfare unit. The two positions were combined in 2009. Obama has rejected the proposal. ""That might be an OK idea, not because Keith Alexander, the general who now holds both positions ... has too much power but because Keith has too much work. I just can't understand how one man can do both jobs.""

Hayden opposed the idea of granting Snowden amnesty, in part to learn more about what he did and how he did it and to prevent him from leaking additional information. ""It's kind of like negotiating with terrorists,"" he said. ""All that does is tell the next Edward Snowden out there, if you're going to do this, make sure you steal enough."""

Not only has the scandal picked up steam in the mainstream press (Jake Tapper’s ABC News report tonight is a must-watch), but high-ranking members of the President’s own party are now demanding answers. This includes the man most often cited as a likely Secretary of State should Obama win a second term, Senator John Kerry:

Senate Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in questioning the Obama administration’s handling of the fatal Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and why the administration refused for days to acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack linked to al Qaeda.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., circulated a bipartisan letter addressed to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, asking for an “accounting of the attacks against U.S. missions in Egypt, Libya and Yemen,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Examiner.

The lawmakers are also demanding to know whether the administration had any advance warnings of the Libyan attack and, if so, whether it had shared that information with U.S. personnel on the ground.

The letter marks the first time congressional Democrats have so directly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration’s response to inquiries about the attacks, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others and raised questions about U.S. security throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa.

A Kerry aide confirmed that the committee intended to enlist the support of Republicans and Democrats and said the letter would likely be sent Friday. Another aide told The Examiner that the panel’s 10 Democrats and nine Republicans plan to sign it.

The false White House narrative blaming the murders on a protest gone bad over a YouTube video never really passed the smell test. But Obama maintained that illusion straight through to his speech before the United Nations two days ago, even as reports surfaced that our government knew al-Qaeda was behind the attack within 24 hours. Apparently, this has become too much to sweep under the rug for some of the mainstream press and Democrats.

The behavior of Obama and Secretary of State Clinton over the past 14 days is a scandal of the highest order. Lies, cover ups, and neglect for security of American intelligence and personnel that borders on criminal.

I’ve been skeptical that the same media, that early on conspired in this cover up by intentionally pouring all of its focus and fire on Mitt Romney’s criticism of the Cairo Embassy apology, would go near this before the election. But the sins are so great and glaring, it doesn’t look as though ignoring it will be possible for another 40 days.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Darrell Issa and the overblown scandals,"This is how a scandal implodes:

First, the head of the investigation overpromises. “This was a targeting of the president’s political enemies, effectively, and lies about it during the election year so that it wasn’t discovered until afterwards,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House oversight committee, said in May of the IRS targeting scandal. He later declared President Obama’s press secretary a “paid liar” for stating otherwise.

Next, facts emerge to undermine the investigator’s presuppositions. Documents released by Ways and Means committee Democrats this week show that the IRS, in addition to targeting tea party groups, also had “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) lists for groups using descriptors such as “progressive,” “health care legislation,” “medical marijuana,” “paying national debt” and “green energy.”

Finally, evidence surfaces that the investigator stacked the deck. Tuesday night, the Hill newspaper quoted a spokesman for Treasury’s inspector general, Russell George, saying the group was asked by Issa “to narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” The inspectors knew there were other terms, but “that was outside the scope of our audit.”

Certainly, something went badly wrong at the IRS that caused groups to be targeted because of ideology. But it’s nothing like the conspiracy Issa cooked up in which the president and his men supposedly used the tax authority to attack their political foes.

The White House deserves some of the blame for letting things get this far; a full release of information by the administration at the outset would have put the controversy to rest quickly. But the collapse of the Issa-driven scandal has reinforced a growing impression in the capital that ultimately will help Obama: The chairman is full of it.

When I covered President Clinton’s second term, White House officials were delighted to have the eccentric Dan Burton in charge of the House oversight committee. He gained prominence by shooting a melon to try to prove that Clinton aide Vince Foster hadn’t killed himself but had been murdered.

Now Issa has fallen to Burtonian levels of credibility. He’s launched a dozen or so probes, but what often begins as a legitimate inquiry into government failure turns quickly into a lunge for the Oval Office, missing each time.

Even before the Republican victory in 2010 gave him the chairmanship, Issa announced the discovery of “Obama’s Watergate” — the White House floating an administration job for a Democratic congressman to keep him out of a Senate primary. Issa backed off after learning that the Bush administration had done similar things.

Shortly before the 2010 election, Issa told Rush Limbaugh that Obama “has been one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.” He later said Obama isn’t “personally corrupt” but his administration is.

Issa then set out to prove it. He led a probe into the failed “Fast and Furious” gun sting by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Issa declared that “it went all the way to the White House,” insisting that the plan was approved “at the highest levels of the Obama appointees,” and that the Justice Department “has blood on their hands.”

The Justice Department inspector general determined that Attorney General Eric Holder didn’t even know about the program until after it was shut down.

After the failure of Solyndra, a government-aided solar company, Issa probed Energy Department loan guarantees, saying “I want to see when the president and his cronies are picking winners and losers ... that it wasn’t because there were large contributions given to them.”

The committee documented no cronyism and no presidential involvement.

Issa probed the response to Freedom of Information Act requests by the Department of Homeland Security, saying the matter “reeks of a Nixonian enemies list, and this committee will not tolerate it.”

Nothing Nixonian surfaced.

After the killing of U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, Issa accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of giving false information to Congress when she said she wasn’t involved in denying the Libyan diplomats’ security requests. He also said that it was “perhaps the White House” that later changed talking points to make it appear that the assault had begun as a protest.

It turned out Clinton wasn’t involved in the security decision and the White House wasn’t behind the change in the talking points.

Then came the IRS. Instead of delivering on Issa’s promise to reveal politically motivated harassment of conservatives by the Obama administration, the committee instead turned up evidence (including the account of a “conservative Republican” who managed IRS screening) that the actions weren’t political.

The most Issa et al. can hope to prove now is that conservatives were hassled by the IRS more than liberals. That’s a worthy topic to explore, but it’s no Watergate.

Eric Nordstrom, the regional security officer posted in Libya when the U.S. Embassy was reopened after the country’s 2011 civil war, choked up while giving his opening statement at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s hearing on the Benghazi attacks. (The Washington Post)

Three State Department officials on Wednesday provided a riveting, emotional account of last year’s fatal attack on U.S. installations in eastern Libya as they accused senior government officials of withholding embarrassing facts and failing to take enough responsibility for security lapses.

The testimony provided new details on the Sept. 11, 2012, assaults on U.S. installations in Benghazi and their aftermath. But the new information failed to break the political logjam the attacks spawned, with Republicans and Democrats offering starkly different interpretations of what happened and who within the U.S. government is to blame.

Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) opened the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing by saying that panel Democrats had “mostly sat silent” while Republicans tried to wrest the truth from an uncooperative Obama administration.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the senior Democrat on the committee, countered that Issa’s GOP majority had launched a “full-scale media campaign . . . of unfounded accusations to smear public officials.”

But in expanding the narrative of the intensely politicized episode, the witnesses raised fresh questions about whether then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her deputies were sufficiently engaged in assessing the security posture of diplomatic posts last year.

Speaking before the panel, they also reiterated criticism of the administration’s initial reluctance to describe the attacks as premeditated terrorist acts. The Libyan government had labeled the attacks a terrorist assault, and the absence of similar descriptions from the United States made it more difficult for Libyan officials to assist the FBI’s investigation of the incident, according to the former deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Libya.

“It negatively affected our ability to get the FBI team quickly to Benghazi,” Foreign Service officer Gregory Hicks said. President Mohamed Yusuf al-Magariaf was “insulted in front of his own people. His credibility was reduced. His ability to lead his country was damaged,” Hicks said.

Clinton and her senior aides should have paid more attention to deteriorating security in Libya over the months preceding the attacks, along with requests from the post for additional resources, said Eric Nordstrom, who served as the embassy’s security chief until July.

If for no other reason, Nordstrom said, Clinton was planning to travel to Libya later in the year and had signaled that she wanted the United States to turn its temporary mission in Benghazi into a formal diplomatic post.

“Certainly, there’s a reasonable expectation that her staff would have briefed her” on a March 28 cable from the embassy in Tripoli asking for additional security personnel and resources, Nordstrom said.

The State Department has defended the review carried out after the Benghazi assault, calling it exhaustive. The former top diplomat who led the probe, Thomas Pickering, told MSNBC that “the notion of a coverup,” as some Republicans allege, “has the elements of Pulitzer Prize fiction.”

A team of Special Operations troops that had been assigned to the embassy in Libya in 2011 to provide security was significantly downsized and its mission changed to training shortly before the attack, Hicks testified. The team of 14 to 16 elite troops was whittled down to four after two of them were carjacked, a decision Hicks said was made by the U.S. military’s Africa Command.

After the State Department’s lightly defended Benghazi compound came under siege by a mob of 60 or so assailants, Hicks said, he initially sought to get the Pentagon to scramble jets from a U.S. base in Italy to fly over Benghazi, in hopes it would intimidate militants. When he was told that no planes could arrive for several hours, Hicks said, he tried to get the remaining four Special Operations troops on a Libyan military aircraft heading to Benghazi early on the morning of Sept. 12. Senior military leaders rejected that request, Hicks said, even though “there was every reason to continue to believe that our personnel were in danger.”

Pentagon spokesman George Little told reporters Wednesday that the stand-down order was given because the troops were needed to protect U.S. personnel in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and that they could not have reached Benghazi in time to have made a difference.

“We continue to believe there was nothing this team could have done to assist during the second attack in Benghazi,” Little said.

The three witnesses — also including Mark Thompson, acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism — were critical of the inquiry into Benghazi headed by Pickering, saying that it did not assign enough blame to senior officials.

Nordstrom and Hicks singled out Patrick Kennedy, the longtime undersecretary for management, who had ultimate responsibility for weighing security requests made by diplomatic posts.

Hicks, a 22-year veteran of the department, said senior U.S. leaders, including President Obama and Clinton, lauded his performance during the crisis. After he questioned why Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had delivered talking points that linked the attack to a demonstration, his superiors turned on him, Hicks testified. He specifically alleged that Clinton counselor Cheryl Mills and Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Jones criticized him harshly.

Early in the hearing, Hicks delivered a detailed account of the events of that night, keeping spectators in the crowded hearing room riveted.

After being alerted that the mission’s villa in Benghazi was being assaulted, Hicks said, he managed to get Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens on the phone for a few seconds — just long enough to hear him say, “Greg, we’re under attack.”

Hicks said he and his colleagues worked the phones madly that night, asking Libyan government officials for reinforcement while they waited for Washington to spring into action.

Scott Wickland, the ambassador’s main bodyguard, sought to rescue Stevens from the burning building, Hicks said.

“He tried repeatedly to go back in to try to rescue Sean [Smith] and the ambassador but had to stop due to exposure to smoke,” the diplomat testified.

A team from a house nearby that was used as a base by the CIA responded to the attack on the main compound and managed to repel it initially, Hicks said, but it later had to retreat under fire, leaving Stevens behind.

Hicks learned that Stevens had been taken to a hospital controlled by a militia, and he began hearing reports that the ambassador had died. A call from the Libyan prime minister confirming the news, Hicks said, was “the saddest phone call I have ever had in my life.”

When they realized the U.S. military would not be bailing them out anytime soon, Hicks said, his team sprang into action.

“Okay, we’re on our own,” he said, describing his reaction. “We’re going to have to try to pull this off with the resources that we have available.”

Alarmed by the possibility that the residential area where U.S. diplomats were housed in Tripoli could come under attack, Hicks began planning to move to an annex as soon as dawn broke. A female diplomat packed ammunition into their armored vehicles and then used an ax to destroy hard drives and other sensitive items that would be left unguarded.

The Tripoli team was able to move safely and coordinated medical care for the Benghazi attack survivors, who were flown to the capital on the morning of Sept. 12."

Should federal judges weigh in on a president's decision to pursue and kill terrorists overseas?

The suggestion, raised at this week's nomination hearing of John Brennan to be CIA director, goes to the heart of the debate on whether President Barack Obama or any U.S. leader should have unfettered power to order the targeted killing of Americans overseas who are al Qaeda terrorists.

Some Democratic senators argued there should be a check on the president's authority to use lethal force, particularly against Americans, as occurred in September 2011 when a CIA-operated armed drone killed American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.

Al- Awlaki was a senior operational planner for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who had been linked to a number of terrorist plots against the United States.

One solution offered at the hearing was to create a new court to oversee such presidential decisions.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said she would review ideas for legislation ""to ensure that drone strikes are carried out in a manner consistent with our values,"" including a proposal to create ""an analogue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review the conduct of such strikes.""

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is a top-secret body that reviews federal warrants to intercept electronic communications of suspected foreign agents and terrorists. One reason is to protect Americans from improperly or inadvertently having their communications collected.

Creating a similar type of court to oversee lethal actions taken overseas may be easier said than done.

The intelligence panel has yet to begin drafting legislation, a Feinstein aide told Security Clearance. For now, the panel was reading through proposals and suggestions by experts and commentators.

According to the aide, who spoke on condition of not being identified, writing a bill raised ""a lot of questions to wrestle with."" Consultations with the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees as well as the White House must occur before a final proposal can be developed, the aide added.

Ben Powell, the former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence, said legislators will have to deal with ""a number of thorny legal issues ... with very complex implications"" to put an FISC-style court together.

According to Powell, major questions that must be addressed include specifying what the court would rule on, such as whether the target was part of al Qaeda or posed an imminent threat or was unlikely to be captured.

In addition, legislation would have to define whether the court's rulings would cover U.S. citizens who don't belong to al Qaeda but pose an imminent threat, as well as what role it would have in issues outside the United States, he said.

Powell also said legislators would have to clarify how the new court interacted with the president's constitutional power to defend the nation, specifically whether a new law would seek to limit such power.

Some legal experts believe the court's review would be limited to determining whether an individual should be put on a target list.

University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney wrote on Lawfare Blog that the question should be ""whether there ought to be judicial review of some kind in connection with the nomination process pursuant to which particular person may be pre-cleared for the possibility of using lethal force, a decision made long in advance of an actual attack decision.""

However, Chesney raised the issue of whether such a system would be constitutional, especially if it went beyond just considering American citizens.

Powell questioned whether any court would even accept the role, saying ""it would immerse the court deeper and deeper into national security judgments.""

At a recent American Bar Association panel discussion, retired federal Judge James Robertson said he would want no part of such a role.

""That's not the business of judges to decide without any adversary party to sign a death warrant for somebody who is on foreign soil, for anybody, but certainly not for an American citizen on foreign soil,"" Robertson said.

Chesney said proponents of the court should think twice if they expect judges will ever rule against a government decision to target a particular person.

""Judges famously tend to defer to the executive branch when it comes to factual judgments on matters of military or national security significance,"" Chesney said. ""Especially when the stakes are as high as they will be represented to be in such cases.""

At Brennan's confirmation hearing, Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, argued for establishing a new court, saying the president should not be the ""prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the executioner.""

Brennan told King such a court was ""worthy of discussion,"" but added: ""The commander in chief and the chief executive has the responsibility to protect the welfare, the well being of American citizens"" from terrorist attacks."

U.S. intelligence has been tracking a growing threat against American and Western targets from al Qaeda’s affiliate organization in Yemen for the last several weeks.

But in recent days, there has been additional intelligence about a potential attack in Yemen, as well as threats against U.S. interests in the Middle East and North Africa, leading to the Obama administration’s decision to shut down U.S. embassies and warn publicly of the threat, U.S. officials tell CNN.

Based on the intelligence, officials say, there is particular concern about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday. Sunday, one of the holiest days in Islam, marks the end of Ramadan, and officials say they are concerned about attacks on that day.

The threat against the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was a primary concern, but it was ambiguous and could indicate threats against other U.S. and other Western targets in the Mideast and North Africa, another U.S. official told CNN.

The officials say the threat is linked to al Qaeda, rather than emanating directly from al Qaeda’s traditional stronghold in Pakistan.

“This is a higher-than-normal threat stream,” one official told CNN. Officials declined to say whether the information came from telephone intercepts, website postings or agents on the ground. “But it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future,” the official said.

A senior U.S. official said there was “more than the usual chatter” about potential terror threats.

Separately a second official acknowledged there are differences within the administration about what the intelligence shows about the credibility and specificity of the threats and the potential timing of any attacks. But, as a third official said, “How often do you see so many embassies shut down? That tells you something about how serious it is.”

Vice President Joe Biden, along senior State Department officials in Washington, briefed congressional leadership and key committee chairs and ranking members about the new threat, a source who attended the meeting said. The briefing, earlier this week, was scheduled to discuss embassy security after the Benghazi attack, but included a discussion on this new concern.

This source said there was a lot of concern about increased chatter and about embassies being a potential target, though Biden did not mention in the briefing that the embassies would be closed.

Another source with knowledge of the government concerns and the meeting with the vice president said this is not something in the margins.

A U.S. law enforcement official says the threat information is ""nonspecific and not corroborated,"" but it was important enough that U.S. national security officials issued an alert. Some of the reaction by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies that helped issue the alert can be explained by the Benghazi attack, another official said. Before that attack, this type of information may or may not have resulted in such an alert. But certainly, in light of the Benghazi attack, the alert was issued out of ""abundance of caution,” the official said.

State Department officials insist the wording of the worldwide caution issued Friday is not ""boilerplate."" They point to the first line, which is specific: ""The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens to the continued potential for terrorist attacks, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula."" The State Department does use some of the same language in alerts and warnings, but that is for consistency's sake.

State Department officials say they are taking this threat ""very seriously."" They issue worldwide cautions periodically, but this one is specific and applies to a large number of embassies. One official could not remember when the last time as many embassies were ordered closed. There have been previous major warnings, and the official recalled the one for Europe in 2010.

The embassies and consulates affected will be closed to the public. One reason is to avoid having long visa lines outside, which could turn into a target for attacks. Even when the embassies are closed, however, there are personnel working inside, and they can provide emergency services such as emergency passports.

The State Department has a 24-hour operations center that monitors threats all the time."

Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth, they’ve been told to be quiet.”

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors, telling Fox News last week, “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking,”

Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them.

“To our leadership in the House, you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi,” the South Carolina Republican said.

Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack.

Since then, Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault, while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same.

Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.

Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.

“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that,” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen,” he said.

Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors,” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.”

Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration, Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us, there’ll be some hell to pay.”

Issa agrees, saying, “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.”

Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain, however, as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.

The Michigan Republican explained, “Like I said, I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.” He added, “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy, so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/benghazi-talking-points-reportedly-revised-12-times-official-concerned-would/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,[],"Benghazi memos reportedly revised 12 times, official 'concerned' they would hurt State","New details about the Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack are raising additional questions about top-level efforts to downplay terrorism, with one report showing a State Department official pushed to delete a section that could have been used to ""beat up"" her department.

The fresh reports have surfaced two days after three whistle-blowers testified on Capitol Hill about the Benghazi attack. One of them sharply challenged the administration's decision to describe the attack out of the gate as a protest gone wrong.

ABC News reported Friday that, despite administration claims that the flawed description reflected the best intelligence at the time, the talking points that led to the statement were revised 12 times.

Initial versions, as has been previously reported, contained references to Al Qaeda that were later deleted. But the latest excerpts show how State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland pressed the CIA to scrub references to the agency's prior security warnings.

According to ABC News, the original paragraph read:

""The Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa'ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya. These noted that, since April, there have been at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants, including the June attack against the British Ambassador's convoy. We cannot rule out the individuals has previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks.""

But Nuland wrote that the lines ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...""

The paragraph in question was then reportedly deleted.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki defended her agency's actions Friday after the excerpts were published.

She said in a statement: ""The State Department first reviewed the talking points on Friday evening with the understanding that they were prepared for public use by members of Congress. The spokesperson's office raised two primary concerns about the talking points. First that the points went further in assigning responsibility than preliminary assessments suggested and there was concern about preserving the integrity of the investigation. Second, that the points were inconsistent with the public language the Administration had used to date -- meaning members of Congress would be providing more guidance to the public than the Administration.""

The Weekly Standard, which referenced the Nuland exchange briefly in a prior account, also reported new details Friday, describing how then-CIA Director David Petraeus voiced surprise when he learned the Saturday after the attack that officials had deleted all prior references to Al Qaeda and jihadists, leaving only the word ""extremists.""

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice would use the final version of the talking points to say on several Sunday shows that the attack was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film.

While administration officials and congressional Democrats have described the protracted debate over the talking points as politically motivated and inconsequential, the testimony this week drew new attention to it.

Greg Hicks, former deputy chief of mission in Libya, said Rice's comments actually hurt the FBI investigation by insulting the Libyan president -- who gave a conflicting account at the time by saying the attack was premeditated.

Hicks said the anti-Islam film was actually a ""nonevent"" in Libya, and his ""jaw dropped"" when he heard Rice's comments.

ABC News reported that the CIA's first drafts did say the attack appeared to be ""spontaneously inspired"" by the protests at the embassy in Cairo. However, the early versions also said ""we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack.""

The State Department and White House have continued to defend their actions and intervention in light of the new details.

After it was first revealed that references to security concerns -- in addition to references to Al Qaeda -- were removed, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said: ""What we said and what remains true to this day is that the intelligence community drafted and redrafted these points.""

He defended administration claims that the faulty statements were merely the product of incomplete intelligence in a rapidly changing environment. Despite the excerpts, he stood by claims that White House involvement was minimal.

""The fact that there are inputs is always the case in a process like this. But the only edits made by anyone here at the White House were stylistic and non-substantive. They corrected the description of the building or the facility in Benghazi from 'consulate' to 'diplomatic facility' and the like,"" he said.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell also said Rice's comments were based on the intelligence community's ""best assessment that there was not any evidence of months-long pre-planning or pre-meditation, which remains their assessment."""

Napolitano made the declaration in an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) when he was questioning her on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have alleged that political officials in the Obama administration, including her, have blocked them from enforcing the law.

Sessions noted that ICE agents’ union president Chris Crane had testified on Monday “that agents are prohibited from enforcing the law and, indeed, the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit [to that effect].”

“I started out as a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice in 1975,” Sessions said. “I have never heard of a situation in which a group of law officers sued their supervisor and you for blocking them from following the law. They weren’t complaining about pay, benefits, working conditions. They were saying their very oath they took, to enforce the law, is being blocked by rules and regulations and policies established from on high and that this is undermining their ability to do what they’re sworn to do.”

In her response to those remarks from Sessions, Napolitano said she believes she and other political officials have the authority to tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore.

“There are tensions with union leadership, unfortunately, but here’s what I expect as a former federal prosecutor and attorney general, and that is that law enforcement agents will enforce the law in accord with the guidance they’re given from their superiors,” Napolitano said. “That’s what we ask of ICE, that’s what we ask of Border Patrol, that’s what we ask throughout the Department and I believe that would be consistent with all law enforcement. Agents don’t set the enforcement priorities. Those are set by their superiors and they are asked then to obey that guidance in accord with the law.”

Sessions was not pleased with Napolitano’s response, so he followed up by asking: “”Well, what Mr. Crane testified to was that there are law provisions that say an agent shall do this, that and the other, and that the policies set by their political supervisors refuse to allow them to do what the law plainly requires. You are not entitled to set policies, are you, that violate the mandates of congressional law?”

Napolitano answered that question by saying she “disagree[s] with almost everything” Sessions has said, “but we’ll just have to respectfully disagree with each other.”

“But, I think it does point to why this bill needs to be passed, because what we want our officers doing is focusing on narco-traffickers and human smugglers and money launderers and others who misuse our border and our immigration system,” Napolitano said. “By having a process by which those in the country illegally can pay a fine, pay fees, register so we know who they are, by dealing with the employer demand for illegal labor, by opening up the visa system, that will have the effect, basically, of confirming the focus of resources where they need to be.”

Despite Napolitano’s and the administration’s belief that they can tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore, the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill cedes even more authority away from Congress and gives it to the administration.

In their lines of questioning with Napolitano during Tuesday’s hearing, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) focused on how the bill cedes authority. In a statement he issued after the hearing indicating he is not satisfied with the bill’s so-called “border security triggers” that are supposedly meant to ensure the border actually gets secured, Cruz said he does not trust the bill will actually secure the border.

“As it stands, the border security component – which numbers only 58 pages of the 844-page bill – largely cedes authority to the Department of Homeland Security to determine when and how the border would be secure,” Cruz said. “However, today’s hearing revealed that the last clear metric for border security – ‘operational control’ – reflected that in 2010, DHS had secured 873 miles of the more than 2,000 mile border. When that metric did not demonstrate success, DHS decided to simply abandon the metric. In order for a metric to be real, it must be meaningful. Currently, there are no objective metrics in place to ensure any triggers in this bill will be meaningful, all while the pathway to citizenship component remains contingent on this undefined border security.”

Lee similarly questioned why the Gang of Eight bill gives Napolitano and the administration so much authority. “Some of the questions that I have as I’ve read through this bill over the last few days relate to the amount of discretion you are given, you and your successors will be given over time, should this become law,” Lee opened his line of questioning with Napolitano on Tuesday.

Even Gang of Eight member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) admits the amount of authority the bill would cede to the administration is controversial. “Biggest challenge on #immigrationreform has been well founded lack of trust that Obama administration will enforce the law,” Rubio Tweeted on Tuesday. “Its [sic] a big problem”"

Instead, they have got themselves all steamed up and snarling about heinous, impeachable offenses that are figments of their imaginations.

The latest round of House hearings about the Benghazi incident provides a perfect example of how American politics has been warped and gummed up by bombastic, partisan extremism. A cool, methodical inquiry could well uncover serious mistakes and provide remedies so that future incidents can be thwarted before more American diplomats are killed in the line of duty. But the current generation of Republican lawmakers does not know how to do cool. Hot rhetoric more suited to a Glenn Beck tirade seems to be the only way they know how to communicate.

A prime example is Rep. Steve King of Iowa. On Wednesday, he said he did not know “what took place, and who was where doing what and why,” yet he declared, “I believe that it’s a lot bigger than Watergate, and if you link Watergate and Iran-Contra together and multiply it times maybe 10 or so, you’re going to get in the zone where Benghazi is.”

Yup, King does not actually know any details, but he is sure Benghazi is vastly bigger than the two biggest political scandals of the last 40 years. Either King does not really have a clue what Watergate and Iran-Contra were all about or he simply thinks if he really, really believes, wishes upon a star, picks a crop of four-leaf clovers and asks Santa, he and his party will luck into a scandal big enough to topple a president they despise.

That seems to be what Mike Huckabee is praying for. On Monday, the former preacher and presidential candidate said on his radio show, “I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term. I remind you, as bad as Watergate was, because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die.”

Of course, none of these folks were calling for impeachment of President George W. Bush in 2001 when he and his top advisors ignored warnings of an impending attack and 3,000 people died on the morning of Sept. 11. That was a failure that went right to the top. Whatever lack of foresight there may have been at Benghazi, it pales in comparison to 9/11. With Benghazi, the fault appears to lie with mid-level bureaucrats (and perhaps with a myopic Congress that saw no need to provide adequate funding for State Department security).

It is a fever dream for Republicans to think they can bring down President Obama with this pipsqueak of a scandal. Possibly, though, they could do some harm to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the strongest Democratic prospect for the 2016 presidential election. A smartly targeted investigation might do that.

More likely, though, Republicans will continue to overreach and come off looking like hyper-partisan, blustering witch hunters."

Told Me Not to Talk to Congress,"Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission for the United States in Libya, and the top US official in Libya after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today – and he told Congress that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department lawyers tried to stop him from talking to Congresspeople investigating. “I was instructed not to allow the RSO [Regional Security Officer], the acting deputy chief of mission and myself to be personally interviewed by Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz [of Utah],” said Hicks.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) couldn’t believe what he was hearing: “So the people at State told you, ‘Don’t talk to the guy who is coming to investigate?'” Hicks’ answer: “Yes, sir.” Jordan pressed: “You’ve had several congressional delegations come to various places you’ve been around the world. Has that ever happened, where lawyers get on the phone to you prior to a congressional delegate coming to investigate … Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what took place?” Hicks: “Never.”

Jordan then asked Hicks whether a lawyer from State had been sent with Hicks when the Congressional delegation arrived – whether State had forced a minder on Hicks. “Yes, sir, that’s true,” said Hicks. Hicks went on to describe a classified briefing he had with Rep. Chaffetz in Libya: “The lawyer was excluded from the meeting because his clearance was not high enough, and the delegation had insisted that the hearing not be limited.” Hicks stated that the lawyer attempted to get into the briefing anyway, and the annex chief would not allow it.

After that meeting, Hicks was called by Cheryl Mills, counselor for the State Department and staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills was deputy White House counsel under the Clinton administration, and she was termed the “shining star of the defense team” for President Clinton’s Senate impeachment trial. Jordan described Mills as “as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton.” Hicks told the story: “A phone call from that … person is generally not considered to be good news …. She demanded a report on the visit … She was upset … She was very upset.”

Under sweeping subpoenas, Justice Department obtained AP phone records in leak investigation

By Sari Horwitz,

In a sweeping and unusual move, the Justice Department secretly obtained two months’ worth of telephone records of journalists working for the Associated Press as part of a year-long investigation into the disclosure of classified information about a failed al-Qaeda plot last year.

The AP’s president said Monday that federal authorities obtained cellular, office and home telephone records of individual reporters and an editor; AP general office numbers in Washington, New York and Hartford, Conn.; and the main number for AP reporters covering Congress. He called the Justice Department’s actions a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” into newsgathering activities.

The aggressive investigation into the possible disclosure of classified information to the AP is part of a pattern in which the Obama administration has pursued current and former government officials suspected of releasing secret material. Six officials have been prosecuted, more than under all previous administrations combined.

In a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the AP’s president and chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said that the Justice Department sought information beyond what could be justified by any specific probe and demanded that the government return the phone records and destroy all copies.

“There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,” Pruitt wrote to Holder. “These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.”

The inquiry is one of two leak investigations ordered last June by Holder. The second involves a New York Times report about the Stuxnet computer worm, which was developed jointly by the United States and Israel to damage nuclear centrifuges at Iran’s main uranium-enrichment plant.

The two leak inquiries were started after Republicans in Congress accused the Obama administration of orchestrating news stories intended to demonstrate the president’s toughness on terrorism and improve his chance for reelection. The Republicans sought a special prosecutor, but Holder instead named two veteran prosecutors to handle the inquiries.

In the AP case, the news organization and its reporters and editors are not the likely targets of the investigation. Rather, the inquiry is probably aimed at current or former government officials who divulged classified information.

But experts said the scope of the records secretly seized from the AP and its reporters goes beyond the known scale of previous leak probes.

“This investigation is broader and less focused on an individual source or reporter than any of the others we’ve seen,” said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. “They have swept up an entire collection of press communications. It’s an astonishing assault on core values of our society.”

The office of the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on Monday released a statement saying it is not required to notify a media organization in advance of issuing such subpoenas if doing so “would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.”

“We take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws, federal regulations, and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations,” said a statement from Bill Miller, spokesman for the office. “Those regulations require us to make every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means before even considering a subpoena for the phone records of a member of the media.”

Justice Department guidelines require that subpoenas of records from news organizations must be approved personally by the attorney general. Holder’s office did not reply to repeated requests for comment.

Lucy A. Dalglish, dean of the journalism school at the University of Maryland, said she thought the scope of the seizure was unprecedented. “Unfortunately, the Justice Department does this now and again,” said Dalglish, former executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “What’s very unusual is the scope of the subpoenas.”

Republicans also quickly condemned the targeting of journalists and sought to portray the Justice Department’s actions as part of a pattern of Obama administration overreach, noting that the Internal Revenue Service was already enmeshed in a scandal over the reported targeting of conservative groups.

“Coming within a week of revelations that the White House lied to the American people about the Benghazi attacks and the IRS targeted conservative Americans for their political beliefs, Americans should take notice that top Obama administration officials increasingly see themselves as above the law and emboldened by the belief that they don’t have to answer to anyone,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement that he is “very troubled by these allegations” and wants to hear the government’s explanation. “The burden is always on the government when they go after private information — especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,” Leahy said. “I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden.”

In the AP investigation, Pruitt said, the Justice Department obtained the records without notifying his news organization or narrowing the scope of its subpoenas to specific matters relevant to an ongoing investigation.

The story at issue included details of a CIA operation in Yemen that foiled an al-Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to set off a bomb on an airplane headed to the United States. The April and May 2012 phone records of the reporters and editor of the story were among the material seized by the Justice Department.

Pruitt said that on Friday, the AP’s general counsel, Laura Malone, received a letter from Ronald C. Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, who was appointed by Holder to lead the AP inquiry. He said that last year, the Justice Department obtained telephone records for more than 20 separate phone lines assigned to the AP and its journalists.

A grand jury based in Washington’s federal court has been investigating the possible leak of classified information to the AP for several months, according to a government official familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case.

In most cases when investigators seek information about a media organization’s source, the news organization moves to quash any subpoena for its records. But in this case, the AP was not aware that the records had been obtained.

Law enforcement officials say leak cases are difficult because hundreds of people often have access to the classified information. In the AP case, knowledge of the details of the al-Qaeda plot would have been highly compartmentalized, which would limit the number of people with access to it. A former government investigator said telephone records could be valuable in narrowing the pool of suspected leakers.

Numerous senior government officials have been interviewed in connection with the investigation into the AP story. Among those questioned was John O. Brennan, who served as Obama’s counterterrorism adviser before becoming CIA director this year.

In his confirmation hearing in February, Brennan said he had cooperated voluntarily with the Justice Department and had been interviewed. He acknowledged speaking to former U.S. government officials who work as commentators on television news, but he denied sharing any classified information.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Obama’s summer swoon,"The Gallup polling organization reported Monday that President Obama has had a particularly pronounced summer swoon each year of his presidency, and that August typically brings his lowest approval ratings of the year.

Throughout the day, the White House proceeded to demonstrate why this is so.

The death toll is approaching 1,000 in the Egyptian military’s crackdown, the Edward Snowden case is straining international relations and new questions are emerging about privacy violations at the National Security Agency. But Obama, who just returned from a nine-day, six-golf-round vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, remained out of sight at the White House.

Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney, was away, so the task of representing the White House to the outside world fell to one Josh Earnest, a deputy press secretary who lived up to his surname on Monday. For an hour, reporters quizzed him on the news of the day, and Earnest, his face burned by the Vineyard sun except where his sunglasses had been, responded by reading from a binder full of bromides.

“As you’ve heard the president talk about quite a bit, the economic interests of middle-class families is his top domestic priority,” Earnest informed the assembled reporters.

“The president believes and understands that his chief responsibility as president of the United States is the national security of the United States of America and her citizens,” he announced.

Right, right, but what about all the people being killed in Egypt?

“What you’re asking is a pretty broad question,” Earnest said, “because we’re talking about a large number of people in a large country, under a lot of different circumstances.”

This is not to pick on Earnest, a genial product of Kansas City, Mo., who is well-liked by the White House press corps. He was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing: trying to get the president through the August doldrums without making news. And that’s the problem.

Since the earliest days of the republic, Washington has been a sleepy town in August. Lawmakers once fled the capital to avoid heat and malaria; now they do it for fundraising and boondoggles. In 2002, President George W. Bush delayed making the case for war in Iraq until the fall because, his chief of staff said at the time, “you don’t introduce new products in August.”

But it no longer works to push the snooze button throughout the month. August of 2001 was when the Bush administration failed to connect the dots that could have warned of the Sept. 11 attacks. August of 2009 was when the tea party movement rallied public opposition to Obamacare.

By now it should be obvious that running the country is not an 11-month job, yet the administration is still operating under the old ways.

At the White House this week, Obama is holding an event to honor the Miami Dolphins team that won the Super Bowl — in 1973. “This is an opportunity for them to get the kind of White House visit that contemporary Super Bowl-winning teams get to enjoy,” Earnest explained Monday. “I can tell you, the president is certainly looking forward to it.”

He is also, Earnest disclosed, looking forward to a bus trip at the end of the week, during which he will talk about paying for college. “I think it is going to be, hopefully, both fun and informative,” the spokesman said, tipping the reporters off to the fact that Obama believes that “never has a college education been more critical to the economic success of middle-class families in this country.”

“What’s the fun part?” NBC’s Chuck Todd asked.

“Getting on a bus for a couple of days and seeing America? Sounds pretty good to me,” the earnest man at the microphone replied. “Maybe you don’t think it’s fun. I think it’s going to be.”

Best of all, Earnest said, “the current plan is for the vice president to join the president in his home town of Scranton. So that should be fun.”

Reporters agreed: Biden is fun. “Okay. See? We’re lots of fun,” Earnest said.

Less fun is all the other stuff going on in the world while the president is feting long-retired football players: an Egyptian military ignoring Obama’s calls for restraint and an NSA committing thousands of privacy violations, undermining the president’s claim that surveillance programs aren’t being abused.

On the NSA, Earnest offered the platitude that “there is an important balance for us to strike.” On U.S.-Egypt ties, he attested that “we certainly value that relationship. I think it’s fair to say that the Egyptian government does as well.”

But not enough to heed Obama’s demands. Or maybe they just aren’t paying attention. It’s August, after all.

Former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates just issued a beat-down of epic proportion on Face the Nation. Here's a sample from: http://www.cbsnews.com/...

1. On the charges that the administration did not do enough to prevent the tragedy in Benghazi:



""It's sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities and military forces,"" he said. ""The one thing that our forces are noted for is planning and preparation before we send people in harm's way, and there just wasn't time to do that.""

""Frankly, had I been in the job at the time, I think my decisions would have been just as theirs were.""

""We don't have a ready force standing by in the Middle East, and so getting somebody there in a timely way would have been very difficult, if not impossible.""

""I would not have approved sending an aircraft, a single aircraft, over Benghazi under those circumstances.""

""Send some small number of special forces or other troops in without knowing what the environment is, without knowing what the threat is, without having any intelligence in terms of what is actually going on on the ground, would have been very dangerous.""

""Why should it be us?"" Gates asked. If anything, he said, we could carefully select elements in Syria who align with American values and interests and ""provide them with intelligence, with basic military equipment."" ""But I think our direct involvement and particularly our direct military involvement would be a mistake.""

2. Regarding how he would have handled the attack if he was in charge:3. Regarding why we didn't send in some ready forces:4. What about the dumbest idea of all (my words) of sending in fighter jets to ""scare"" away the attackers:5. Regarding sending in a small group of ""special forces.""6.

I could go on and on but now I guess you see the picture:

(CNN) —

Two Secret Service supervisors on President Barack Obama’s protective detail are under investigation for alleged misconduct, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the internal Secret Service investigation told CNN’s John King.

The details were first reported in the Washington Post Wednesday night.

The investigation began after an incident at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel near the White House in May. As first reported by the Post, one Secret Service agent allegedly removed ammunition from his service weapon and left a bullet in the room of a female guest, whom he had met in the hotel bar.

The agent tried to regain entry to the room when he realized the bullet was left behind, the Post said. Hotel staff notified the White House after he identified himself as a Secret Service agent and demanded to be let in to the room.

No police report was filed and no complaint was filed with the Secret Service by any of the parties involved, a government source told CNN’s Joe Johns Thursday.

“The Secret Service takes allegations of improper behavior seriously and works diligently to investigate and resolve issues. Any misconduct is regrettable, but when it is identified, appropriate action is always taken based on established rules and regulations,” Edwin M. Donovan, deputy assistant director of the Secret Service, said in a statement.

Investigation revisits Secret Service prostitution scandal

The internal investigation was launched as a result of inquiries by the Post, the government source said.

That probe led to a routine search of the agent’s agency-issued BlackBerry, the Post reported.

The federal law enforcement source confirmed that the agent, a supervisor, and a second supervisor were discovered to have sent sexually suggestive e-mails to a female Secret Service employee. Nothing explicitly suggestive has been found, the government source said.

The first supervisor was removed from his position, the source said, but the second supervisor remains on the presidential security detail. The Post reported that the second supervisor was removed from the security detail.

While the paper named the two supervisors involved, CNN is not yet identifying them.

The investigation follows the Secret Service scandal in April 2012 involving prostitution and drinking before a presidential trip to Cartagena, Colombia. A review prompted new rules of conduct for Secret Service employees in the wake of the incident.

Sen. Ron Johnson said at a Senate hearing Thursday that despite assurances from Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service that the 2012 Cartagena prostitution scandal involving presidential detail agents was an anomaly, congress has found similar instances in 17 countries.

“Yesterday we learned that two senior level United States Secret Service agents assigned to the President’s detail were recently disciplined for sexual misconduct. According to whistle-blowers, one of these men helped lead the USSS internal investigation of the sexual misconduct in Cartagena in April of last year. This is like the fox guarding the hen house,” the Wisconsin Republican said. “This type of behavior jeopardizes the security of the President of the United States and makes U.S. government personnel susceptible to coercion and blackmail.”

While not addressing the specifics of the most recent case, William Hillsburg, acting director of the Public Affairs Department of the Homeland Security office of the inspector general, said that in the next couple of weeks his office is expected to release an inspection report with an in-depth look at the culture of the U.S. Secret Service.

The report will look at whether there’s something in the Secret Service culture that led to the behavior in Cartagena. It will also include recommendations on how agents are trained.

At a speech on Wednesday in Buffalo, N.Y., former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took on a heckler, and won, by dealing with him in the same way that many believe politicians should fix the breakdown in civility in Washington.



That is — make it clear that citizenship doesn’t include yelling. “It includes sitting down and talking,” she said, to a rousing ovation from the 6,500 in attendance.



The man, who had been yelling from an upper section of the bleachers during the event on the campus of the University of Buffalo, was eventually led away by security, but not before Clinton addressed his actions from the podium. According to WIBV.com, the man screamed ""Benghazi, Benghazi, you let them die"" in reference to the terror attack on a U.S. Embassy in Libya in which four Americans were killed.



“We can’t move from crisis to crisis,” she said, according to reports, “we have to be willing to come together as citizens to focus on the kind of future we want.”



A question of attitude



It has been a particularly divisive few years in the nation’s capital, capped off by the recent government shutdown and the looming debt ceiling fight, leading many Americans to question the attitudes of those in Congress.



According to a poll released earlier this month by Quinnipiac University, 72 percent of Americans opposed the federal shutdown and 74 percent disapprove of the job being done by congressional Republicans. Congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama didn’t fare much better, posting 32 percent and 45 percent overall job approval ratings in the survey, respectively. Respondents also opposed by 64 to 27 percent the idea of blocking an increase in the nation's debt ceiling as a way to stop Obamacare.



“Americans are certainly not in love with Obamacare, but they reject decisively the claim by congressional Republicans that it is so bad that it’s worth closing down the government to stop it,” Peter Brown, assistant director of the university's polling institute, told Bloomberg.



Maybe it’s time for congressional leaders to take Clinton’s advice and just talk through their issues.



What do you think? Is it time for more civility in Washington?"

But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal.

Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one.

Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.

IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question.

The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done.

Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media.

Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered.

And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking.

For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)

Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts.

Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation.

As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:

In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”

“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.

That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year.

Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department.

Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead.

During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media is what you call a luxury problem.

Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok.

Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

Story highlights NEW: There'd better be a ""damned good explanation"" for subpoenas, Boehner spokesman says NEW: Federal review of AP phone records is unprecedented but looks legal, Toobin says The AP calls the subpoenas a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" It says federal agents collected records from bureau and personal phone lines

(CNN) —

The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press, the news service disclosed Monday in an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.

The records included calls from several AP bureaus and the personal phone lines of several staffers, AP President Gary Pruitt wrote. Pruitt called the subpoenas a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” into its reporting.

“These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,” wrote Pruitt, the news agency’s CEO.

The AP reported that the government has not said why it wanted the records. But it noted that U.S. officials have said they were probing how details of a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft leaked in May 2012. The news agency said records from five reporters and an editor who worked on a story about the plot were among those collected, but it said none of the information the government has shared with it suggested agents listened in on any reporters’ calls.

The news immediately raised questions among members of Congress.

“The First Amendment is first for a reason,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. “If the Obama administration is going after reporters’ phone records, they better have a damned good explanation.”

The subpoenas were disclosed to the news agency on Friday, Pruitt wrote. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote.

“We regard this action by the Department of Justice as a serious interference with AP’s constitutional rights to gather and report the news,” he told Holder. Pruitt demanded that the department return all records collected and destroy all copies.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington responded that federal investigators seek phone records from news outlets only after making “every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means.” It did not disclose the subject of the probe.

“We must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,” it said. “Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.”

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the Obama administration “has been incredibly aggressive” about prosecuting leakers, and there’s no privilege in federal law that allows reporters to protect their sources. But he said past administrations have avoided going that far.

“I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,” Toobin said. “It’s legal, as far as I can tell. The administration isn’t violating the First Amendment. But they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists. And we’ll see if there’s any political check on them, because there doesn’t appear to be any legal check on what they’re doing.”

The White House was unaware of the subpoenas, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday night.

“We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department,” Carney said.

Holder announced in June 2012 that he had assigned two U.S. attorneys to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets, and members of Congress have complained about disclosures of electronic warfare campaigns against Iran, U.S. drone attacks overseas and Obama’s personal involvement in “kill lists” of militants in Yemen and Pakistan.

But Pruitt wrote that most of the records collected from the AP “can have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation,” and the American Civil Liberties Union called on the Justice Department to explain its actions.

“Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,” Ben Wizner, the head of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a written statement. “Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources.”

In a statement issued Monday night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, “I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government’s explanation.”

“The burden is always on the government when they go after private information – especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,” said Leahy, D-Vermont. “I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden.”

And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN that the Justice Department already has the ability “to listen, very transparently, to all the government phones and government activities.”

“You can imagine if Congress wanted to know about leaks that obviously came out of the administration that ended up in the press, they would be outraged if we tried to get that information,” said Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of Holder. “But that’s exactly what they’re doing. They’re looking at what is considered to be confidential.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/us-angry-over-released-mexican-drug-lord-051722166.html,,[],US angry over released of Mexican drug lord,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. law enforcement officials expressed outrage over the release from prison of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero and vowed to continue efforts to bring to justice the man who ordered the killing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.

Caro Quintero was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena but a Mexican federal court ordered his release this week saying he had been improperly tried in a federal court for state crimes.

The 60-year-old walked out of a prison in the western state of Jalisco early Friday after serving 28 years of his sentence.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it found the court's decision ""deeply troubling.""

""The Department of Justice, and especially the Drug Enforcement Administration, is extremely disappointed with this result,"" it said in a statement.

The Association of Former Federal Narcotics Agents in the United States said it was ""outraged"" by Caro Quintero's early release and it blamed corruption within Mexico's justice system for his early release.

""The release of this violent butcher is but another example of how good faith efforts by the U.S. to work with the Mexican government can be frustrated by those powerful dark forces that work in the shadows of the Mexican 'justice' system,"" the organization said in a statement.

The DEA, meanwhile, said it ""will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro-Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed.""

But experts say the case against Caro Quintero was flawed from the beginning and his release is the result of a stronger federal justice system in Mexico, and it's not likely to have an impact in U.S.-Mexico relations.

Caro Quintero was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. He helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa that later split into some of Mexico's largest cartels, including the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels.

Story continues

But he wasn't tried for drug trafficking, a federal crime in Mexico. Instead, Mexican federal prosecutors, under intense pressure from the United States, hastily put together a case against him for Camarena's kidnapping and killing, both state crimes.

""What we are seeing here is a contradiction between the need of the government to keep dangerous criminals behind bars and its respect of due process,"" said Raul Benitez, a security expert at Mexico's National Autonomous University.

""The United States wants Mexico to comply with due process but it is likely that due process was not followed when many criminals were caught 10 or 15 years.""

Mexican courts and prosecutors have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay. Such practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms, but past cases, including those against high-level drug traffickers, are often rife with such legal violations.

Mexico's relations with Washington were badly damaged when Caro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed, purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220-acre (89-hectare) marijuana plantation in central Mexico named ""Rancho Bufalo"" — Buffalo Ranch — that was seized by Mexican authorities at Camarena's insistence.

Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, a major drug trafficking center at the time. His body and that of his Mexican pilot, both showing signs of torture, were found a month later, buried in shallow graves. American officials accused their Mexican counterparts of letting Camarena's killers get away. Caro Quintero was eventually hunted down in Costa Rica.

Times have changed since then, and cooperation has strengthened and this is likely to have little impact on the overall relationship between Mexico and the United States, said Tony Payan, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations at the University of Texas-El Paso.

The U.S. and Mexico ""will scramble for a bit, but in the end they will understand this is a very complex relationship and nothing is going to happen,"" Payan said. ""They are not going to jeopardize the overall relationship over this.""

Caro Quintero still faces charges in the United States, but Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it was unclear whether there was a current extradition request.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam later said in a statement that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against Caro Quintero.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it ""has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in securing Caro Quintero's extradition so that he might face justice in the United States.""

Samuel Gonzalez, Mexico's former top anti-drug prosecutor, said the U.S. government itself has been promoting, and partly financing, judicial reforms in Mexico aimed at respecting procedural guarantees for suspects, an approach Gonzalez feels has weighted the balance too far against prosecutors and victims.

""This is all thanks to the excessive focus on procedural guarantees supported by the U.S. government itself,"" Gonzalez said. ""I warned them (U.S. officials) that they were going to get out, and they are all going to get out,"" he said referring to long-imprisoned drug lords such as Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who is also serving a sentence related to the Camarena case."

Bolivian state politician Domingo Alcibia Rivera was allegedly caught on camera raping an unconscious woman on the floor of the provincial Assembly of Chuquisaca.

The security video, uploaded to YouTube -- be warned, it is disturbing -- shows an unconscious woman get placed on a chair in an empty room. A man, identified by local media as Alcibia Rivera, then enters the room and cuts the lights.

Through the blurry images, it appears that he then removes the woman from the chair and rapes her on the floor. When the lights turn back on -- apparently because someone tried to enter the room -- the man hops up and the woman appears to move. The lights then turn back off and the man appears to pull up his pants and return the woman to a chair.

People return to the room to check on the woman. Toward the end of the video, when she tries to stand up, she falls to the floor.

The video was reportedly taken on Dec. 20, after a holiday party at which Rivera and others allegedly drank too much. After being posted on YouTube, local news stations ran with the story this week, and it later appeared on international news sites including Spain’s ABC and the U.S. blog Jezebel.

Alcibia Rivera, who belongs to the governing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS, in Spanish) denies wrongdoing and says he’ll cooperate with an investigation, according to Bolivian daily La Razón.

“They’re saying that is was rape, but that wasn’t rape,” Alcibia Rivera said, according to La Razón.

MAS’s ethics committee kicked Alcibia out of the party, along with legislator Javier Humana, who was involved in the incident. The allegations drew condemnation from Bolivian President Evo Morales, who said Alcibia Rivera had committed a “serious error.”

Bolivian prosecutors say they’ll take action against local media for showing the video, saying it endangers the victim."

* Concern as deadline approaches on debt limit

* ""This whole thing is crazy"" -Democratic representative

* Republicans ready to negotiate, senior House member says

By Phil Stewart and Thomas Ferraro

WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Saturday it would recall most of the roughly 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees sent home during the government shutdown, in a move that could greatly lessen the impact of the shutdown on America's armed forces.

The exact number to be recalled remained uncertain. Civilian Pentagon employees comprise about half the 800,000 federal employees currently furloughed.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said a legal review of the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" signed by President Barack Obama on Monday on the eve of the shutdown, would allow him to bring a still unspecified number of civilians back to work next week.

The announcement came as Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed to pay all furloughed employees retroactively once the government reopens. It was a rare moment of cooperation in the House as the two parties were entrenched in their positions on the shutdown. The U.S. Senate is expected to go along.

But the actions did not solve the basic problem - the failure of Democrats and Republicans to settle their political differences and agree on a bill to fund and reopen the government.

The House measure prompted Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York to suggest that since the employees were going to get their salaries anyway, ""why don't we just let them come back to work?""

""This whole thing is crazy,"" she said.

Outside the Capitol where Congress was meeting on Saturday, two small children sat at the foot of the stairs holding placards reading: End the shutdown"" and ""Stop acting like children.""

As they moved into the second week of a shutdown, members appeared no closer to finding a way to end it, or to head off a possible default by the government on Oct. 17, the deadline for Congress to increase the government's authority to borrow money.

Talk of using broader budget deals to bring the standoff to an end has picked up in recent days, but without any visible result.

Democrats say bills to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling could be resolved quickly if House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner permitted votes on simple, no-strings-attached measures.

But most House Republicans want strings attached, including one aimed at crippling Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, and Boehner has so far refused to promise votes on either, in part because he could face a revolt that might cost him his job.

Democrats have already begun efforts to force a vote on the shutdown using complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedures.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Boehner signed by 195 of 200 House Democrats, demanding a vote on a bill to reopen the government without any rollback in Obamacare.

Pelosi said if Boehner did so, they would agree to the Republicans' government funding level for the next six weeks, more stringent than the Democratic level, which has already been approved by the Senate.

Democrats are also trying to persuade Boehner to convene a ""conference committee"" with the Senate to discuss broader budget issues, something Boehner has resisted, fearing that Democrats might use arcane House rules to bring other measures to the House floor, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.

Pelosi made what she called ""an unprecedented offer."" She said if he would permit a House-Senate conference on funding for the rest of the year, Democrats would surrender their right to use the rules to add items that might embarrass Republicans.

Boehner's press secretary, Michael Steel, brushed off Pelosi's offer, saying, ""At this point, it's Senate Democrats and the president who are blocking progress on reopening the government and providing the American people fairness under Obamacare.

DEBT CEILING

The standoff, which began at the start of the new fiscal year on Tuesday and shuttered all but essential government operations, was sparked by Republicans' determination to block or delay implementation of the healthcare law.

The law aims to provide healthcare to millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans argue it is a massive government intrusion into private medicine that will cause insurance premiums to skyrocket, put people out of work and eventually lead to socialized medicine.

Republicans are also seeking concessions in exchange for raising the nation's $16.7 trillion debt limit. If the borrowing cap is not increased, the United States could go into default, with what officials and economists say would be seriously damaging consequences for the U.S. and global economies.

Democrats vow they will make no such concessions on the funding bill or the debt ceiling.

Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press released on Saturday that he did not expect to have to take any unusual steps to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt because he believes Congress will raise the debt ceiling.

""I don't expect to get there,"" Obama said. ""There were at least some quotes yesterday that Speaker Boehner is willing to make sure that we don't default,"" he said.

""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat,"" Obama said.

Republicans blame the White House for the fiscal deadlock, saying the president is refusing to compromise.

After the House vote on retroactive pay, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican majority whip, said his party was ready to negotiate with Obama and his fellow Democrats. ""The president is here this weekend, we are here this weekend. Now is the time, since everyone is in town, to pick up the phone and talk,"" he said.

Scott Rigell, a Republican representative from Virginia who has called for a ""clean"" vote to fund the government that does not involve Obama's healthcare law, said as far as he knew, there were no behind-the-scenes negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over the shutdown or the debt ceiling.

""No one is talking,"" Rigell told Reuters.

Facing public anger over the government shutdown, House Republicans have adopted a strategy of voting piecemeal to fund some popular federal agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service and the National Institutes of Health - that are partially closed.

Democrats have rejected that, arguing Congress has a duty to pass a bill funding the entire government."

Sandy formed in late October and hit the New York-New Jersey area Oct. 29. This version has been corrected.

Congress approved $9.7 billion in new aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy on Friday, with a face-

saving quick move by the House three days after Speaker John A. Boehner earned scathing criticism from New York and New Jersey Republicans for canceling a late-night vote on the funds.

The bill, which will allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay out claims to those who held federal flood insurance, was approved in the House on a 354 to 67 vote. After the House action, the Senate also adopted the bill in a quick, unanimous voice vote, sending it to President Obama.

Boehner (R-Ohio) seems to have had reason to be concerned about bringing a larger $60 billion spending measure to the floor Tuesday: All the votes against the smaller bill Friday came from his own party members.

They were encouraged by the conservative Club for Growth, which argued that the additional disaster spending should be offset with cuts to other government programs. The continued GOP opposition could spell trouble for a larger $51 billion Sandy bill that Boehner has promised will come before the House on Jan. 15.

And it provided a second example in a week of a bill approved with more Democratic support than Republican backing, an outcome that deeply troubles conservatives about the efficacy of their governing majority in the House.

Former vice presidential candidate and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.) was among the Republicans opposing the measure. So too were more than a dozen House freshmen who took office Thursday.

Still, the bill’s passage quieted a political storm for Boehner that erupted when he pulled the bill from the floor late Tuesday, worried he would have trouble corralling GOP votes for it from members exhausted from a debate over a bill to avert the “fiscal cliff” by raising taxes on the wealthy.

Boehner’s decision prompted an eruption of anger from lawmakers and others from states affected by the Oct. 29 superstorm. Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) told reporters that Boehner had ignored four calls from him Tuesday night, and he blamed “toxic internal politics” in the Republican caucus for dropping the ball.

The New York Daily News ran a cover with Boehner’s face next to an image of the Statue of Liberty — with a bloody knife in her back.

Canceling the Tuesday vote meant the 112th Congress expired without action, delaying the vote until the 113th Congress took over Thursday. Still, Friday’s vote — with the speedy Senate approval — seems to have quieted the GOP criticism.

Republicans from affected states who had been threatening to withhold their support for Boehner to serve as speaker in the new Congress all backed him when the vote was held Thursday.

Still, Democrats pressed their criticisms of Boehner for the delay, noting that the $60 billion bill that passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote died with the congressional turnover. The fate of the bulk of that bill will not be settled until later this month.

“This was the most callous action I’ve ever seen,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “The leadership of this House should be condemned for it.”

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he feared that the second, much larger installment of aid would get tripped up in the House in coming weeks.

“To be a bride and left at the altar once is bad enough. To be left twice would be unconscionable,” he said, calling Friday’s measure a “good, but small” step.

But Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), who was pushing for passage of the legislation, warned colleagues that the nation’s flood insurance program is “unsustainable,” with more money being paid out in claims than is collected in premiums.

“That can’t go on,” he said. “We must work together on that.”

In a joint statement, Christie and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) praised the House action as a “necessary and critical first step” but said it was only a “down payment” on the $51 billion package.

The House vote was the first significant legislative act of the new Congress. The House later recessed until Jan. 14. Likewise, after taking action on the Sandy-related legislation, the Senate recessed until Jan. 21, when it will return for inaugural ceremonies."

(CNN) —

A decade ago, Britain’s Labor government was badly divided over whether to join the Euro. The prime minister strongly supported the idea, as did much of the British business community and many leading media voices. One of the proponents’ most effective tactics was to ridicule opponents as cranky and xenophobic – even borderline racist.

Here for example is a correspondent for the Guardian deriding some of them, members of the U.K. Independence Party (Ukip), back, in 2004.

“In the pub I encounter Reg Mahrra, an Indian Ukipper . ‘I want out of Europe,’ he says. ‘Europe is a disease.’ “

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

That’s hardly an argument to take seriously.

Only … the Euro opponents were totally right. Right for the wrong reasons, but still right.

It’s human nature to assess difficult questions, not on the merits, but on our feelings about the different “teams” that form around different answers. To cite a painful personal experience: During the decision-making about the Iraq war, I was powerfully swayed by the fact that the proposed invasion of Iraq was supported by those who had been most right about the Cold War – and was most bitterly opposed by those who had been wrongest about the Cold War.

Yet in the end, it is not teams that matter. It is results. As Queen Victoria’s first prime minister bitterly quipped after a policy fiasco: “What wise men had promised has not happened. What the damned fools predicted has actually come to pass.”

Which brings us to the uproar over the Heritage Foundation’s study of the fiscal effects of immigration – and the revelation that one of the study’s coauthors wrote a Ph.D. dissertation asserting large and enduring differences in intelligence between different ethnic and racial groups.

Heritage is a powerful conservative think tank in Washington, very influential on Capitol Hill. On May 6, Heritage released a study of the likely budget effects of the Senate plan to open a “pathway to citizenship” for the 10+ million people who live in the United States in violation of the nation’s immigration laws.

The study found that the plan would add $6.3 trillion to the nation’s budget deficits over the next 50 years.

That conclusion ignited a huge controversy. Still, even the fiercest critics had to concede the basic validity of Heritage’s claim. In the words of Keith Hennessey, formerly director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush and an ardent supporter of the “pathway to citizenship”: “I expect making 8-9 million people here illegally into U.S. citizens would increase future deficits once these people are eligible for benefits.”

The pathway to citizenship will add to deficits because of these basic demographic facts about the illegal population: It is very large and it is very low-skilled. As is, the immigrant population in the United States earns less and depends more on government benefits than the native-born population. As formerly illegal residents gain access to more benefits, that dependency can only rise.

Perhaps the ultimate cost of legalization will be less than Heritage estimated: $4 trillion, say. Conceivably, the cost could be even higher. But it will be a cost, and it will be large – nobody can gainsay that.

Instead, critics respond with a non-sequitur: never mind the effects on government budgets, look instead at immigration’s impact on the overall economy. The trouble for them, however, is that every reputable study – headed by the most exhaustive of them all, the 1997 National Academy of Science study – finds that the economic benefits of immigration are very small, fractions of a penny for each dollar of national income, with the largest share of those benefits captured by the immigrants themselves.

But it’s a basic rule of politics: If you can’t disprove the message, you try to discredit the messenger.

And one of Heritage’s messengers sure enough proved discreditable. While work on the Heritage study was led by that think tank’s welfare expert, Bob Rector, the heavy number-crunching was done by a recent Harvard Ph.D., Jason Richwine. Richwine believes in a racial hierarchy of intelligence, with Jews and East Asians at the top and blacks at the bottom.

Richwine has expressed that opinion in a number of places, including at a 2008 panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. I happened to be the moderator of that panel. I hadn’t met Richwine before, and this discussion was my first introduction to his work. Afterward, I asked him to come to my office for a talk. I told him then that he faced a choice: He could be a serious scholar of immigration – or he could play in the fever swamps, but not both. Obviously, he did not heed my advice. Shortly after, he left AEI to find employment at Heritage.

U.S. immigration policy has long been sullied by racial prejudice: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the 1907 deal with Japan to stop migration from that country, the immigration acts of 1921 and 1924 that sought to halt migration of all groups except Northwest Europeans. It’s a shameful story, and the Richwine episode scratches at those painful national wounds.

But it’s also true that math is math. We know how much low-skilled legal immigrants earn. We know how much government assistance legal immigrant households use. We can make projections about the likely budget costs of enrolling 10+ million formerly illegal residents as legal ones.

Maybe Richwine did his math wrong. If he did it wrong, it would remain wrong even if he spent his leisure hours rescuing orphans from burning buildings. Maybe he did his math right. Then it would remain right even if he moonlighted as Grand Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

Yet what is especially strange about the Richwine incident is this:

The people who will lose most by the Senate’s immigration plan are precisely American citizens of minority origin. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be unemployed than whites. More ominously, they are more likely to be numbered among the long-term unemployed – people who have been out of work six months or more. The long-term unemployed face an especially difficult path back to the labor market. The New York Times reports:

“Though businesses are reluctant to acknowledge bias in their hiring practices, some human-resource managers and consultants say privately that unemployment can be a red flag on a résumé, signaling that a worker may have outdated skills, or may be a short-timer who is desperate enough to take any work now but will leave when something better comes along. The National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, reported that companies across the country often posted job notices explicitly excluding applicants who are unemployed.

“Such discrimination against the unemployed is becoming more widespread as jobs are in short supply and employers can have their pick of applicants, according to labor and community leaders. They say it has created a blacklist of the unemployed, many of whom were laid off in recession-driven downsizing rather than because of performance issues.

“In New York City, on average, 372,000 people were unemployed in 2012, 38 percent for a year or longer, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blacks and Hispanics accounted for disproportionately large shares of the long-term unemployed.”

There’s only one way to prod employers to hire the long-term unemployed: super-tight labor markets. In the late 1990s, when the unemployment rate tumbled to the lowest levels since the mid-1960s, employers became interested in categories of workers they usually rejected: former welfare recipients, the disabled, and so on. In the late 1990s, the black-white wage differential closed at the fastest rate since the civil rights era.

The Great Recession has hit almost all Americans hard. But – no surprise – mass unemployment has had its worst effect on the poorest and most marginal. A 2013 study by the Urban Institute found that before the recession, the typical white family had four times the wealth of the typical black family. Since the recession, the gap has widened to six-to-one.

The only thing that can close this gap is to tighten the labor market. And yet the Senate plan is a plan to slacken labor markets, and keep them slack for decades. That’s not a bug. That’s a feature. Not only will the plan legalize the formerly illegal, but it will hugely increase future immigration flows of both permanent and temporary workers: agriculture workers, technology workers, even ski instructors.

The labor market is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as any other market. If supply is dramatically increased at a time when demand is already low, expect wages to steeply fall. That’s not an unintended effect of the immigration bill. It’s the intended effect.

America’s legacy of racial oppression casts a long shadow. That legacy is not yet anywhere close to overcome. Yet it’s more than a little astonishing that the proponents of the Senate immigration bill would claim the banner of anti-racism to justify a measure that will deepen and prolong the subordination of those American ethnic groups already most deeply subordinated.

Senate plans votes to stop broad spending cuts%2C but no agreement is likely

Friday%2C federal agencies will have to cut %2485 billion from programs

The House may pass a bill to give the Pentagon more flexibility

WASHINGTON — The Senate will vote on dueling legislative proposals Thursday to prevent sweeping across-the-board federal spending cuts, but there is no confidence lawmakers will reach a bipartisan deal with President Obama before the Friday deadline.

Obama has summoned the top four congressional leaders to a White House meeting Friday to discuss the cuts, known as the ""sequester,"" while House Republicans are maneuvering to give the Pentagon more discretion in how to implement the cuts.

The sequester will require federal agencies to make $85 billion in spending cuts between March 1 and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The cuts are the first tranche of a decade-long plan to reduce spending by $1.2 trillion by applying an across-the-board cut to nearly every program of the federal government, except for military personnel and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Senate Democrats have offered an alternative to pay for the sequester through 2013 with a combination of a minimum 30% tax on millionaires and cuts to defense and farm payments. It will fail because it does not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. GOP senators oppose the plan because it raises taxes.

""Now, less than 48 hours before the clock runs out, all they've offered is a gimmicky tax hike that's designed to fail. I hope they're not expecting a round of applause for this particular act of political bravery,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Senate Republicans are considering an alternative that would require the same level of budget cuts but put the burden on the president to determine which programs would be cut and which would be spared. The White House contends they will not support any sequester alternative that doesn't include both revenue increases and spending cuts.

""What we haven't seen when we hear Republican leaders adamantly refuse to consider revenue as part of deficit reduction is anything like that same spirit of compromise or seriousness of purpose that I think you've seen demonstrated by the president and Democratic leaders,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has not voted on any alternatives to the cuts. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the House will consider alternatives when the Senate finds a plan that can pass the upper chamber.

In the previous Congress, the House twice passed sequester alternatives, but they never became law. ""We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,"" Boehner said Tuesday.

Instead, the House intends to take up a resolution next week to fund the government through Sept. 30. The current funding runs out March 27, threatening a government shutdown if Congress doesn't act. Attached to the bill will be two defense spending bills that will give the Pentagon more flexibility to implement the sequester.

Many lawmakers have expressed concern about how the cuts could impact national security.

""It will require some cuts in defense, but they do not adversely affect readiness or training,"" said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who oversees defense spending bills. Young said the bill has broad support among House Republicans and is expected to pass next week. Even so, it is unclear whether it can pass the Senate. ""This is a fallback position,"" he said.

Boehner also issued a further signal that sequester cuts would not be averted before Friday: He informed lawmakers that he was canceling the use of military aircraft for lawmakers' travel. ""The speaker believes this is the prudent and responsible course of action, and it goes above and beyond the spending cuts the House will be implementing to comply with the president's sequester,"" said spokesman Michael Steel.

Lawmaker travel on commercial airlines, however, can continue."

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

The battle over the future of Detroit is set to begin this week in federal court, where government leaders will square off against retirees in a colossal debate over what the city owes to a prior generation of residents as it tries to rebuild for the next.

Soon after Detroit emergency manager Kevyn D. Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved a bankruptcy filing Thursday, groups representing the 20,000 retirees reliant on city pensions successfully petitioned a county court to effectively freeze the bankruptcy process.

Now, city and state officials, who say the court ruling will not affect their plans, are asking a federal judge to hold hearings early this week to validate the bankruptcy and move forward with a strategy for Detroit to discharge much of its estimated $19 billion debt.

Orr has promised that retired city workers, police officers and firefighters will not see pensions or health benefits reduced for at least six months. But on Sunday, he said those retirement benefits will have to be cut down the road.

“There are going to be some adjustments,” Orr said on “Fox News Sunday.” “. . . We don’t have a choice.”

“This is a question of necessity,” he added.

But the prospect of cuts has sent a deep wave of fear over Detroit’s retirees, who like many in the city are skeptical of Orr, a corporate lawyer who previously worked in the District, and Snyder, a Republican unpopular in this deeply Democratic city.

“It’s been a nightmare for all of us,” said Shirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association. “We don’t have that many people with pensions big enough for anything to be taken away from them.”

Of Detroit’s overall debt, about half — $9.2 billion — represents pension and health benefits that the city has promised retirees but that it now says it does not have enough money to fully pay. The lion’s share of the remaining debt is owed to bondholders.

Orr has discussed a range of steps the city could take to pay off its debts, and some have speculated that they could include selling Detroit’s international airport and valuable collections from the Detroit Institute of Arts. For current workers, he has proposed stopping pension contributions and shifting employees to individual retirement savings accounts.

But no part of the bankruptcy process is stirring as many passions as the potential need to slice pensions and benefits for retirees. Small cities that have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years have significantly cut retirees’ benefits.

Harry Harper, who lives in northeast Detroit and retired in 2003 from the city’s Water and Sewerage Department after 30 years of service, said talk of benefit cuts is making him very anxious.

View Graphic The decline of Detroit.

“I feel very vulnerable. I don’t feel we have any protection,” said Harper, 61, who receives $2,100 a month in pension payments. “I thought that at 30 years, you earned a pension that was accrued and you did not have to have a concern about that.”

Retirees such as Harper say that living in Detroit on a fixed pension is tough since public transit has been cut back and fuel prices have been going up. Michigan’s gasoline prices are among the highest in the country.

“I’m currently living check to check,” Harper said. “Every time I get in my car, the first stop I’m making is at a gas station because of my cash flow.”

Jeanette Fitz, who retired after 35 years working in accounting for the city government, said she fears that a cut to her pension or medical coverage will be devastating.

Fitz said that she pays more than $100 a month for a half-dozen medications and that much of what remains from her pension payments goes toward her housing and other necessities.

“If they cut it, I’m not going to be able to pay my rent,” she said. “I’m not going to have money. I’m going to be homeless. I’m going to be living out of my car, I guess.”

On Sunday, Orr and Snyder said that they empathize with the fears of retirees but added that the city had ignored its problems for too long and that now there is no choice but to limit pension payments.

“You get honest about it to start with,” Snyder said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “. . . In many cases for the last 60 years, people have ignored the realities of the situation. We’re being real now.”

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that one option not on the table is a federal bailout. “I think it’s very difficult right now to ask directly for support,” he said.

Technically, the dispute between the retirees and government leaders is about math — how to calculate how much of the pension system is not properly funded. But that is an unsettled area of accounting, and both sides are able to marshal expertise in their favor.

More fundamentally, though, the question facing Detroit is how much of its remaining financial resources it will use to repay bondholders who will be needed to lend money to the city in the future, to invest in the city’s basic services and to hold fast to promises made to retirees.

“Ultimately, it’s going to come down to a finite ability to pay,” said Brian O’Keefe, a lawyer who represents retired city workers, police officers and firefighters. “We just simply believe that we must honor our obligation to pensioners who spent their entire lives working for the city.”

Detroit’s financial and demographic decline will make that difficult, some experts note. The dramatic population slide the city has experienced over the past decade has hit municipal government hard.

In 2004, for instance, there was an even ratio of city workers to pensioners, but now there are six retirees for every four workers, according to a recent report by Orr.

Orr also has cast significant doubt on the calculations the pension systems have used to determine whether they have enough funding to meet obligations, noting that individuals involved in the pension system have recently faced criminal charges."

Working for hours on end under a punishing sun, the pickers are said to be crowded into squalid camps, driven without a break and even cheated of wages.

But as Congress weighs immigration legislation expected to expand the guest worker program, another group is increasingly crying foul — Americans, mostly black, who live near the farms and say they want the field work but cannot get it because it is going to Mexicans. They contend that they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated shabbily by farmers who prefer the foreigners for their malleability.

“They like the Mexicans because they are scared and will do anything they tell them to,” said Sherry Tomason, who worked for seven years in the fields here, then quit. Last month she and other local residents filed a federal lawsuit against a large grower of onions, Stanley Farms, alleging that it mistreated them and paid them less than it paid the Mexicans.

The suit is one of a number of legal actions containing similar complaints against farms, including a large one in Moultrie, Ga., where Americans said they had been fired because of their race and national origin, given less desirable jobs and provided with fewer work opportunities than Mexican guest workers. Under a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the farm, Southern Valley, agreed to make certain changes."

WASHINGTON -- Department of Defense officials told state lieutenant governors Thursday to plan for possible base closures and cutbacks in civilian work forces as sequestration budget cuts begin affecting every state.

Frank DiGiovanni, the Defense Department training readiness and strategy director, told National Lieutenant Governors Association attendees that states need strategies to brace for military spending cuts, including base personnel and contractors. Military cuts also will affect spending by civilian and uniformed personnel at businesses near military bases in every state, no matter how big the military industry, he said.

“There is a lot to be done coordinating at the state level,"" DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors. He cited Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) for assembling a group that helped prepare for potential military base cuts in the past, and for having a plan to lobby federal officials to protect military installations in his state.

DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors they also should prepare for overseas military cuts, which will shift more activity to U.S. installations. With 200,000 military personnel returning from full time duty overseas, there will be more training at bases, he said. Those personel will contribute to the local economy, but they may spark increased complaints from base neighbors about noise and traffic.

At the same time, DiGiovanni did note that there has been a greater culture of the different military services working together with the budget cuts, including at bases around the country. He said that state leaders can continue to see that going forward.

“Sequestration and this whole fiscal environment is going to require the services to work together to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""The resources they’ve had won’t be there anymore.”

Kansas is a role model in protecting the military economy, said Patrick O'Brien, director of the Defense Department Office of Economic Adjustment,. O'Brien said lieutenant governors in the past have headed state planning groups to study the impact of military bases and industries on the state economy and how to have state government serve their needs.

The lieutenant governors association has long advocated the flexible nature of state lieutenant governors' offices as a way for the officials to be involved in a variety of areas of policy, including those impacting the military and economic development."

I want my money back. Last October, I gave $2,500 to support Heidi Heitkamp’s campaign to become North Dakota’s junior senator. A few weeks later, she won a surprise victory. I have had a long career in government and politics, but I don’t donate heavily to political campaigns. When I contribute, it’s because I know the candidate well or am really impressed with the person. Heidi Heitkamp was one of the latter: She struck me as strong-willed, principled and an independent thinker. But this week, Heitkamp betrayed those hopes. ... Polling has shown that nine in 10 Americans and eight in 10 gun owners support a law to require every buyer to go through a background check on every gun sale. In North Dakota, the support was even higher: 94 percent. Yet in explaining her vote, Heitkamp had the gall to say that she “heard overwhelmingly from the people of North Dakota” and had to listen to them and vote no. It seems more likely that she heard from the gun lobby and chose to listen to it instead.

Marco Rubio showed his true yellow colors last week, joining 45 other cowards to defeat Senate legislation designed to stop criminals from buying firearms online and at gun shows. The vote was nauseating. So is Rubio. A few days earlier, he’d admitted to Fox News that he hadn’t read the complete bill that would expand federal background checks of gun buyers, but he was opposing it anyway. Other pertinent materials that Rubio obviously didn’t read included a recent New York Times sampling of nut jobs, convicted criminals and even one fugitive who purchased assault rifles and other weapons over the Internet.

Carl Hiaasen touches base with the ""reasonable"" GOP alternative.Funny how some people actually hold senators responsible for their own actions. It's almost treating them like... adults.

Ross Douthat hits one of those rare weeks when I agree with him.

...we discovered another world last week. Two, actually — both somewhat larger than Earth, circling a star with the sadly unromantic name of Kepler 62, 1,200 light-years away. These planets are not the first Earth-like bodies astronomers have discovered, but their size and position make them particularly promising candidates to have liquid water — and with it, perhaps, some form of life. But their promise only adds to a mystery that’s been building the further our probes and telescopes have pushed into the unknown. If Earth-like planets are relatively common, as scientists increasingly believe, then where are all the Earth-like civilizations?

Douthat's take on the Fermi Paradox (that ""where is everyone"" question) are all pretty bleak. I prefer a nursery analogy. The grown ups are keeping us out of the galactic mainstream until we mature a bit. Or maybe we just haven't learned to stroke their things. Moving on...

Thomas Friedman only makes it on this page about one every two Friedman units. So what's he up to today?

Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It’s worth recalling: What are we trying to do? We’re trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth — infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness.

The best place to start is with a carbon tax. A phased-in carbon tax of $20 to $25 a ton could raise around $1 trillion over 10 years, as we each pay a few more dimes and quarters for every gallon of gasoline or hour of electricity. With that new revenue stream, we’d have so many more options. One, preferred by Republicans like the statesman George Shultz and the Nobel laureate Gary Becker, is to make the carbon tax “revenue neutral.” It could be offset entirely by a rebate or by cutting tax rates for every U.S. citizen and corporation, which would increase spending. Another option, the one I’d prefer, would devote half the carbon-tax revenues to individual and corporate tax cuts, use a quarter for new investments in infrastructure, preschool education, community colleges and research — which would create jobs now and tomorrow — and then use a quarter on deficit reduction.

... here's another good bipartisan idea that the tax committees should consider: a new federal tax on emissions — more frequently called a carbon tax. We already know that we use more energy from oil, gas and coal than we really need. (America consumes the equivalent of about 48 barrels of oil per person per year; Germany, with the healthiest economy in Europe, consumes just 26.) We know that lower consumption would make us less dependent on other countries for energy, a goal every president since Richard Nixon has pursued. We know that oil and coal produce air pollution, which we'd like to reduce. And we know that those fuels emit carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. Economists call the hidden costs of energy consumption — the prices of climate change, pollution and national security — ""externalities."" They're real costs, but they're not included in the price of the gasoline you put in your car or the electricity you use at home.

Friedman's column overfloweth with the kind of overwriting, self praise and calls for a ""radical center"" that you expect from the flatman, but there is this... Doyle McManus also talks carbon tax (and does it much better). Phillip Roth praises the home room teacher he had when he was twelve. Doesn't sound like something that would catch your attention? Did I mention it was Phillip Roth?

NY Times Magazine talks with another of my favorites.

On a recent Saturday morning in February, two dozen or so scent hounds streamed through the streets of St. Buryan, a small village in Cornwall, England. Behind them drifted a loose formation of men and women perched atop well-groomed horses and wearing boots, breeches and hunting coats. As the fox hunt clopped through town, John le Carré, the pre-eminent spy writer of the 20th century, sipped from a paper cup of warm whiskey punch, doled out by a local pub to riders and spectators. At 81, he remains an enviable specimen of humanity: tall, patrician, cleanlimbed, ruddy-complected. His white hair is floppy and well cut, so much so that the actor Ralph Fiennes, who starred in the 2005 film version of le Carré’s novel “The Constant Gardener,” badgered him for the name of his barber.

le Carré comes off as crusty, snooty, and brilliant. He comes off as le Carré.

Dana Millbank is worried about the new Tea Party fan favorite.

Is there nobody who can tell Ted Cruz to shut up? The young senator from Texas has been on the job for about 100 days, but he has already turned the Senate’s ancient seniority system upside down and is dominating his senior Republican colleagues. He’s speaking for them on immigration, guns and any other topic that tickles his fancy; Republican leaders are seething at being outshone yet are terrified of challenging him. ... GOP lawmakers encouraged the rise of the tea party, which now dominates Republican primaries and threatens the same leaders who nurtured it. Cruz’s fellow Texan, John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, could face a primary challenge next year and therefore can’t afford to cross Cruz, who beat an establishment Republican in the 2012 primary. Likewise, the Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is up for reelection and has to keep on the good side of tea party favorites such as Sen. Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, and Cruz.

Perhaps those leaders are too busy getting stroked to bother with Cruz. (No, I'm not letting that go.)

Stanley Druckenmiller, who Bloomberg reports served as Soros’s “chief strategist” for “more than 10 years” as a client money manager, has joined Zuckerberg’s efforts at FWD.us to push for comprehensive immigration reform.

Druckenmiller served as the lead portfolio manager for Soros’ Quantum Fund from 1988 until 2000. According to Bloomberg, he “produced average annual returns of 30 percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC” from 1986 through 2010.

In addition to hiring Druckenmiller, Zuckerberg funds former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour’s “Americans for a Conservative Direction.” According to the New York Times, that group has been one of the many special interests at the forefront of trying to push conservatives in the House of Representatives to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The Times wrote recently that Barbour’s Zuckerberg-funded group “has been running ads in Iowa lately that implore those watching to ‘stand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.'”

The Mexican government once paid Barbour to lobby on behalf of amnesty for illegal immigrants inside the United States.

Other special interest groups are lobbying for the House to pass an amnesty program, as well.

The American Action Network, a group led by former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television and radio ads pushing the Senate’s immigration bill in the House. Coleman founded the American Action Network with Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign National Finance Committee co-chair Fred Malek. In addition to his various roles in politics, Malek is the founder and chairman of Thayer Lodging Group.

Karl Rove is similarly spending money pushing amnesty. “Certainly the way in which the bill is perceived and Rubio’s own political fortunes are closely entwined,” Steven Law, the president of Rove’s American Crossroads, said a few weeks ago. “Our first priority is to promote and advance immigration reform, and to talk about the ways this advances conservative goals. If we do that we will not only be helping to move legislation, but it will also protect those who stuck their necks out like Rubio.”

Before those special interests started their lobbying and advertising campaigns for amnesty in the House, most of House GOP leadership seemed to brush off the Senate’s bill. After weeks of pressure from these special interests, however, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will hold a hearing on his version of the “DREAM Act” on Tuesday, an amnesty provision for young illegal immigrants.

Beyond Druckenmiller’s role, several Soros-backed groups are involved in the effort to pass amnesty. As Breitbart News has reported, the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) and the National Immigration Forum (NIF) are funded by the progressive billionaire."

(CNN) - In the wake of controversies plaguing the Obama administration, a White House senior adviser admitted Sunday there is a ""healthy skepticism"" about government. But he argued it's up to Republicans to decide how much Washington will focus on the scandals.

""Are Republicans going to continue to work with the president ... or are they going to use this as a reason to not act at all?"" Dan Pfeiffer asked on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

New poll numbers Sunday indicate the president is weathering the storm, with his approval rating holding at 53%, according to the CNN/ORC International survey out Sunday. His rating stood at 51% in April.

As the administration enters another week of congressional hearings over the controversies, Pfeiffer said the president plans to push forward by staying on message about his agenda, which includes improving the economy and working toward immigration reform.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough instructed his team not to spend more than 10% of their time on the controversies, a Democrat aware of McDonough's remarks confirmed to CNN.

Asked on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if that meant the White House wasn't taking the scandals seriously, Pfeiffer said, ""Oh, no. Absolutely not.""

""There are some very serious issues here, particularly the IRS, where there was inexecusable conduct that needs to be fixed and that's going to happen,"" he continued.

Pfeiffer frequently pivoted to Republicans during his multiple talk show appearances Sunday, saying the GOP is getting distracted by hyping up some of the controversies out of political motivation.

""We've seen this playbook from the Republicans before,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""What they want to do when they're lacking a positive agenda is try to drag Washington into a swamp of partisan fishing expeditions, trumped-up hearings and false allegations. We're not going to let that happen. The president's got business to do for the American people.""

The administration has taken heat over a recent report from the Internal Revenue Service inspector general that revealed the agency had been targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status since 2010. Two top IRS officials announced last week they were leaving their posts after the president called the agency's actions ""inexecusable.""

Pfeiffer maintained that the president was not aware of the targeting until the news media grabbed hold of the story a few days before the report came out earlier this month. However, in the last week, IRS officials have said they notified Treasury Department officials that they were conducting the review months before the report came out.

Asked why the White House or top Treasury officials didn't get involved sooner, Pfeiffer argued no one wanted to get in the way.

""Here's the cardinal rule: You do not interfere in an independent investigation,"" he told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley.

Congress has also ramped up renewed scrutiny over the White House's handling of last year's terror attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead.

Responding to criticism over how erroneous talking points were drafted - which were used by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice just days after the attack - the White House last week released more than 100 pages of e-mails to show how it worked with State Department and CIA officials to craft the messaging, which later turned out to be inaccurate.

Asked if the president was aware of the drafting of the talking points as the editing process was taking place, Pfeiffer said on CNN that ""of the many things the president gets involved in, talking points for Sunday shows is not one of them.""

Pfeiffer argued the release of the emails will hopefully put the matter to rest and remove Rice from the GOP firing zone.

""Frankly I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this, now that they have seen the emails, owes Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week.""

White House chief of staff Denis McDonough made his first tour of Sunday talk shows to warn about the impact of $85 billion in automatic budget cuts set to hit on March 1.

McDonough also said President Obama wants to work with Republicans on an agreement to reduce the federal debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, provided it includes new tax revenues as well as budget cuts.

""We're going to insist on doing this in a balanced way, a way that allows us to maintain the kinds of investments that middle-class families in this country rely on,"" McDonough said on ABC's This Week.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other Republicans note that Obama got higher tax rates in the ""fiscal cliff"" deal in early January, and this debt reduction agreement should be spending cuts only.

In the meanwhile, the White House and Congress brace for the March 1 ""sequester,"" $85 billion to be split between domestic and defense programs.

McDonough, who also appeared on NBC's Meet The Press and CBS' Face the Nation, said the automatic cuts would gut items ranging from education to mental health to food inspections, as well as critical national security programs.

""You've already heard the devastating list of horribles that the Pentagon has said are going to be out there,"" McDonough said.

In order to avoid all of that, McDonough said Obama is ""ready to do another $1.5 trillion to get up to the $4 trillion target that economists across the country tell us is needed to stabilize the debt over the next 10 years.""

The president will also insists on a ""balanced"" plan, McDonough said; i.e., new tax revenues to be derived by ending certain loopholes and deductions.

""Let's fix this in a kind of balanced way ... with a reasonable amount of spending cuts and a reasonable amount of revenue raisers so that we can get this thing done and move on to the business of the country,"" McDonough said."

USATODAY

Americans are naturally suspicious of any immigration plan that promises to stop undocumented workers in the future while granting normal status to those already here.

There's good reason for that suspicion. The last major overhaul of immigration law, in 1986, granted amnesty with little enforcement. Within 20 years, the number of people in the United States illegally had swelled from 3 million to 11 million.

That failure helped torpedo a fresh effort, six years ago, to fix the nation's broken immigration system. And it explains why enforcement is the linchpin to the latest effort, announced Tuesday by a bipartisan group of eight senators.

Like the failed effort of 2007, the new measure would enhance efforts to stem illegal immigration while creating an arduous route to citizenship for the estimated 11 million. The ""Gang of Eight"" plan also changes rules for legal immigration and creates a guest-worker plan for labor-intensive industries that have relied on undocumented workers.

All these elements are important, but enforcement is the key. Politically, it is needed to get a law passed. Practically, it is needed to ensure that today's 11 million aren't followed by another 11 million.

Evidence from the past few years suggests that better enforcement is already having an impact. Demographers have been struck by the rapid decline in illegal immigration as Washington has beefed up its presence on the Mexican border and increased deportations. Also playing a part: the soft economy in the United States and the declining birth rates in Latin America.

The proposal released Tuesday includes a number of enforcement targets to be met before undocumented workers could apply for permanent residency:

It would require that all of the border with Mexico be under surveillance and that law enforcement agencies apprehend at least 90% of those trying to cross illegally in areas designated as ""high risk."" The most dubious part of the plan would provide $1.5 billion for more fencing, which has proved to be something of a boondoggle. But if this one-time expense is the price of comprehensive immigration overhaul, so be it.

It would take on the most promising area of enforcement by cracking down on illegal immigration at the workplace. Employers would be required to participate in E-Verify, a federal program that matches a prospective employee's Employment Eligibility Verification form, or I-9, with government records. Currently, the program is voluntary, though some states require it.

It would require a better system to track visitors to the U.S. For all the attention on border crossings, as many as 45% of the undocumented population enter the country legally, then simply overstay their visas.

This kind of multipronged assault on illegal immigration is necessary to prevent the tide from picking up again once the economy improves.

The Gang of Eight plan will undoubtedly undergo changes as it wends through the legislative process. But it's a good starting point for addressing one of the nation's most vexing problems."

IRS plans to reduce victims%27 six-month waiting times

More than 3%2C000 workers assigned to identity theft%2C double 2011number

More than 35%2C000 employees trained to help taxpayers recognize identity theft

The IRS Thursday pledged to provide swifter help to hundreds of thousands of frustrated Americans victimized by tax fraud through identity theft.

""I want you to know that we understand your frustration, and we're working hard to get your cases resolved as quickly as we can,"" said acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller as he announced the federal tax agency's latest efforts to combat the fast-rising crime.

It likely won't be easy.

The IRS caseload — involving victims whose stolen Social Security numbers were used by thieves to collect unwarranted tax refunds — soared to 449,809 in 2012, up more than 80% from the previous year, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson reported to Congress last month.

And victims routinely need to wait more than six months and speak to multiple IRS employees before their issues are resolved, reported Olson, who heads an independent office within the IRS.

The IRS resolved more than 500,000 identity-theft cases during the last calendar year, but still has just under 300,000 similar cases pending, said Miller.

""We still are challenged by our inventory, and folks are waiting longer than they should expect to,"" he said. ""This is going to improve over the next year.""

The IRS as of late 2012 had more than 3,000 employees working on identity-theft-related issues, more than double the 2011 count, said Miller. An additional 35,000 employees have been trained to aid victims and help taxpayers recognize identity-theft indicators, he said.

After absorbing federal budget cuts during the last two fiscal years, the IRS has reassigned workers from other jobs to help with identity-theft response. The shifts affect other work, said Miller, but were needed because ""identity theft in its pernicious nature threatens the IRS as an enterprise"" by undermining taxpayer confidence.

He issued the victim aid pledge at the start of the annual federal tax-filing season while updating IRS efforts to block fraudulent tax refunds related to identity theft and stop the thieves behind the crime wave.

The IRS blocked issuance of more than $20 billion in fraudulent refunds in fiscal year 2012, up from $14 billion the year before, the agency reported.

Working with federal, state and local authorities, the IRS in January took action against 389 suspects in identity-theft-related actions. The effort included 109 arrests and 189 indictments, said Miller. A similar effort in January 2012, the start of the continuing crackdown, resulted in action against 105 suspects.

The IRS hasn't controlled the crime wave yet, said Miller, but he added, ""The more barriers we put up ... the more likely it is that criminals will turn elsewhere."""

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

The Pentagon will recall almost all of its 350,000 furloughed civilian workers in the coming days, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Saturday, in a move that could substantially ease the impact of the government shutdown on the federal workforce.

Hagel’s decision is based on a liberal interpretation of a bill passed by Congress last week and signed by President Obama that ensures uniformed members of the military will not have their paychecks delayed by the shutdown. The law, titled the Pay Our Military Act, includes broad language exempting Defense Department civilians from furlough if they provide direct support to the military.

Robert F. Hale, the Pentagon comptroller, estimated that more than 90 percent of about 350,000 furloughed Defense Department employees would return to work, many of them as soon as Monday. “We hope to move very quickly,” Hale told reporters.

The Defense Department directly employs about 750,000 civilians. Pentagon officials had previously said about 400,000 of them had been furloughed because of the government shutdown. Hale revised that number Saturday, saying that 350,000 was a more accurate figure.

He said he could not precisely say how many people would be able to return to work because officials were still determining which employees qualified under the new law. He said he hoped that “no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough,” and maybe even fewer than that.

“Although we’re very happy we’re getting most of our people back,” Hale added, “we haven’t solved all the problems.”

Regardless, the Pentagon announcement will dramatically scale back the government shutdown. Defense Department civilian employees had represented nearly half of the estimated 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed for the past week.

After consulting with Pentagon lawyers and other Obama administration officials in recent days, Hagel decided that he could justify recalling almost of the Pentagon’s furloughed workforce based on provisions in the Pay Our Military Act.

In a statement, Hagel said the Justice Department advised that the law would not permit a blanket recall of all civilians working for the Pentagon. But he added that attorneys for the Justice and Defense departments agreed that the law does permit the Pentagon to eliminate furloughs “for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.”

Hagel said he has directed the armed services and defense agencies to determine exactly how many employees can come back to work. Workers, he said, can expect to hear from their managers starting this weekend whether they can return to their jobs.

“I expect us to significantly reduce – but not eliminate – civilian furloughs under this process,” he said. “We will continue to try to bring all civilian employees back to work as soon as possible. Ultimately, the surest way to end these damaging and irresponsible furloughs, and to enable us to fulfill our mission as a Department, is for Congress to pass a budget and restore funds for the entire federal government.”

Paradoxically, however, the Pentagon’s announcement could actually relieve political pressure on lawmakers to end the shutdown by cancelling furloughs for at least 300,000 federal employees.

Moreover, Hagel’s decision could bring some relief to thousands of private contractors who work for the Defense Department but had faced the threat of layoffs because of the government shutdown. On Friday, for example, Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin said it would furlough about 3,000 employees next week and expects that number to grow if the budget standoff doesn’t end soon.

“I am very pleased to see so many of our national security workforce will be able to return to work,” Rep. Howard P. McKeon (R-Calif.), Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Congress gave the Executive Branch broad authority to keep our Armed Forces and dedicated defense civilians working throughout the government shutdown. Though I do not believe the law required these hundreds of thousands of workers to be furloughed in the first place, it is welcome news.”

In a memo, Hagel noted that the Pay Our Military Act appropriates funds “as are necessary to provide pay and allowances to contractors” working for the Pentagon. He said that government lawyers are still “analyzing what authority is provided by this provision.”

Hagel’s memo offers some general guidance for which furloughed Defense Department employees can expect to return to work.

Those who will likely receive a green light include people who provide health care to troops and their families; buy, repair or maintain weapons systems; work at commissaries or acquire other supplies for the military.

Those who might not be covered include auditors, employees who work in public affairs or legislative affairs, or civilian employees of the Army Corps of Engineers, according to the memo.

The Pentagon’s announcement will affect a vast global workforce. Hale said that 86 percent of the department’s civilian employees work outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

Are we going to wade into a struggle we don’t really want to fight? Are we going to mire ourselves in a senseless, grinding conflict whose possible outcomes range from bad to worse?

I’m talking about the upcoming budget battles in Washington, of course. (What, you thought I meant something else?)

Incredibly, Congress seems determined to spend much of the fall demonstrating its boundless talent for dysfunction. House Republicans say they will threaten once again to send the nation into default — and the economy over a cliff — by refusing to raise the federal debt ceiling, now set at $16.7 trillion. This means that by mid-October, the government would exhaust its borrowing authority and be left without enough money to pay its bills.

“The president doesn’t think this is fair, thinks I’m being difficult to deal with,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week at an Idaho fundraiser. “But I’ll say this: It may be unfair, but what I’m trying to do here is to leverage the political process to produce more change than what it would produce if left to its own devices. We’re going to have a whale of a fight.”

In other words, Boehner is looking forward to the opportunity to threaten the nation with grievous harm. Nice little economic recovery you’re working on. Wouldn’t want anything to happen to it.

1 of 76 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Congress View Photos A collection of cartoons about Capitol Hill. Caption A collection of cartoons about Capitol Hill. Wait 1 second to continue.

President Obama, who has seen this movie before, says there will be no fight because he categorically refuses to negotiate over the debt ceiling. He demands that Congress do its job — which amounts to a routine bit of bookkeeping — without all the needless drama.

Investors around the world still consider U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds to be the ultimate safe haven, especially in times of economic uncertainty. It is unthinkable that our elected officials, supposedly working in the nation’s best interests, would threaten this exalted and immensely beneficial status by intentionally triggering a default.

So who’s going to blink?

Obama certainly has the stronger political position. His approval numbers may be stuck in the 40s, but ratings for Congress are down in the teens — and sinking.

Boehner has almost no room to maneuver. House Republicans are still fuming at having been forced to swallow a modest tax increase for the wealthy as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal earlier this year. The responsible thing would be for Boehner to bring a simple bill raising the debt ceiling to the floor, where it would pass with the votes of Democrats and non-crazy Republicans. But that would probably cost Boehner his job.

You’re depressed already? I’m just getting started.

Before we even get to the debt-ceiling fight, the government will run out of authority to spend money on Sept. 30 — which means no ability to function — unless Congress approves a continuing resolution. Doing so should be another no-brainer, but some Republicans are itching for a government shutdown. Because, you know, that worked so well for Newt Gingrich in the ’90s.

Boehner wants none of that. But in an attempt to get House Republicans to avert a shutdown by passing a short-term funding bill, he promises them a “whale of a fight” later over the debt ceiling. (He treats his caucus as if it were a cage full of rabid wolverines.)

Oh, and there’s another whole dimension to the pointless political snarling and bickering we will have to endure over the next few months: Obamacare.

Some Republicans believe, or say they believe, that they can use the continuing-resolution fight or the debt-ceiling fight, or maybe both, to force Obama to sign legislation nullifying all or part of his health-care reforms. One idea is to take away Obamacare’s funding. Another is to delay the individual health insurance mandate, due to take effect next year.

Do they really believe the president is willing to forsake his most important legislative accomplishment? Before it even comes fully into effect?

This is a tragic waste of time and effort, and the House Republicans are to blame. Remember when Democrats captured the House in 2006? They worked with George W. Bush even though they disagreed with his policies. Most Democrats adamantly opposed the Iraq War, but then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi made sure that Bush got the funding he required for the troops.

Boehner and his crew need to act like grown ups. If they don’t, voters need to send them home.

http://news.yahoo.com/flying-without-a-safety-net--212833456.html,,[],Government shutdown leaves airlines in charge of the skies,"With the U.S. government in its third day of shutdown and an unprecedented number of Federal Aviation Administration inspectors on furlough, American skies now are more or less in the hands of the airline industry — a situation that could erode safety margins for air travel, industry experts and observers say.

More than 2,900 safety inspectors are not working, with no date set for their return, according to the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a labor organization representing FAA employees. “All of this decreases the safety margin,” says Mike Perrone, national president of PASS. “People have good intentions, but at the end of the day it’s about money. For right now, the airlines are on their own.”

Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, posted the 2014 Plan for Appropriation Lapse and the news was grim — it dictates 15,514 staff suspensions among 46,070 at the FAA, or 34 percent of the workforce, including 2,490 in the Office of Aviation Safety. Employees and union officials say the totals are even higher.

Airlines for America, the industry’s major trade organization, said in a statement: “At this point, we do not expect airline operations to be impacted.” But the air traffic controllers’ union notes that those on the job are “working without pay” and essential support staff has been furloughed, suggesting “this is akin to a surgeon performing an operation without any staff to prep the room, clean the equipment, or provide support during the surgery.”

Ever since U.S. airlines were deregulated in 1978 and the government ceased micromanaging routes and fares, industry experts have debated what the right amount of oversight should be. But Washington’s shutdown has created a scenario only Ayn Rand could have imagined — with airlines policing their own operations now.

Safety concerns have arisen not necessarily because safety advocates think the worst of the airlines, but because the lack of a regulatory body is unprecedented, even during the 1996 government shutdown. As Perrone says, “It’s like driving on the highway when you know there are no police out there. Right now the airline industry is like kids in a candy store.”

Story continues

Surveillance and spot inspections of airplanes, cockpits, tarmac operations, hangars and outsourced maintenance facilities are suspended, with only one manager answering phones at many of the FAA’s 105 key offices in the U.S. Dozens more overseas are shuttered. The FAA’s broad and critical responsibilities include not only maintaining air traffic control but certifying and inspecting airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and tens of thousands of licensed pilots, mechanics and other personnel, as well as overseeing the world’s largest general aviation system.

The FAA’s public affairs office is closed, but a spokeswoman sent this statement: “Safety is our top priority. …The FAA has prepared a contingency plan in which air traffic controllers and other essential employees will continue working in order to maintain the safety of the national airspace system. If the furlough extends longer than a few days, we will incrementally begin to recall specific employees back to work to meet continuing safety needs. These personnel may include safety inspectors, engineers, and technical support staff.”

John Goglia, a licensed aircraft mechanic and former board member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the aviation system is not easily subjected to rapid shifts and changes that could occur under the shutdown scenario: “For most of the major carriers, their size is too great for quick changes,"" he said. ""For two weeks without inspectors, there’s no change. But after that, it could deteriorate. Then there could be problems.”



The industry’s outsourced aircraft maintenance shops, which have become ubiquitous and are often located in countries where safety standards are lax to begin with, also create concerns, he said. On Wednesday, Goglia posted an opinion column asking if the U.S. is actually violating an international aviation treaty by removing inspectors.

Says Perrone: “God forbid there’s an accident. It will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.”

Experts note that residual effects will linger and are difficult to calculate, even after resolving the shutdown situation. After multiple ""sequesters,"" spending cuts from earlier in the year many mistakenly thought would be restored, inspectors report FAA morale is at an all-time low. And continuity is disrupted, since catching up with a backlog will defer new projects. As the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO noted, ""The air traffic management system will be suspended again, as it was during the partial FAA shutdown in 2011.”

For the FAA, perennially understaffed for years, the furloughs likely make a bad situation worse. For example, in June, the DOT’s inspector general reported: “For fiscal year 2013, FAA did not request any additional [safety inspector] positions, even though the staffing model projected a shortage of 389 positions.” And according to PASS, one-third of the FAA workforce will be eligible to retire in 2014.

For travelers: What to expect

Many passengers may not realize airline travel is dependent upon an alphabet soup of federal agencies, from the NTSB to the Agriculture Department. Here’s a brief rundown at press time:

• For now, Transportation Security Administration airport screening has been deemed essential, says a spokeswoman.

• Customs and Border Protection also is scheduled to continue.

• The Association of Corporate Travel Executives reports that U.S. passports will continue to be processed, but offices located inside federal buildings might be closed. The Global Business Travel Association said: “During the 1996 shutdown, hundreds of thousands of passports went unissued and tens of thousands of visa applications went unprocessed.”

One notable irony is some airline executives have long derided government subsidies for Amtrak. But yesterday the for-profit rail line stated it will “continue normal operation” despite the shutdown.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: America is not in decline or retreat,"We are about to have a major foreign policy debate in the guise of a confirmation battle over Chuck Hagel’s nomination as secretary of defense and the related argument over how long American troops should stay in Afghanistan. President Obama should use this opportunity to stand up for his broader vision of how American power can be sustained and used, even if that doesn’t come naturally to a pragmatist who likes making decisions one at a time.

Underlying this clash will be another over whether the United States is in long-term decline. We are not, and the decline discussion should not scare us. We seem to have it every few decades.

We had it in 1960 when John F. Kennedy promised to “get the country moving again.” We had it in 1980 after Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the taking of American hostages in Iran. Ronald Reagan pledged to “make America great again.”

And in 2008, with China rising, our country bogged down in a dispiriting war in Iraq and an economy in free-fall, Obama came along touting “hope” and “change we can believe in.” The operative verb was “believe,” and in 2012, Mitt Romney paid Obama the compliment of using the very same word in his “Believe in America” slogan. We desperately want to believe in ourselves.

Obama’s harshest critics are essentially charging that he has accepted American decline. They are convinced he wants to pull back from the world and slash the Pentagon budget to make room for more domestic spending. He’s often accused of making the Western European choice: less for the military, more for the welfare state. Hagel, a critic of Pentagon bloat and of America’s engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, is seen as Obama’s nominally Republican agent in achieving this transformation.

Let’s look first at the partial truths embodied in a critique that otherwise misreads Obama’s intentions.

The president always considered our intervention in Iraq a distracting mistake. Most Americans are happy our troops are out. He’s been far more ambivalent about Afghanistan, for political as well as substantive reasons. Like many Democrats, he saw the war in Afghanistan as justified by the events of Sept. 11, 2001, in a way Iraq was not. But time and conditions on the ground have convinced him that there are limits to what the United States can accomplish there. He’s trying to extract our troops in a careful but expeditious way. He has been reluctant to commit to large-scale public action in Syria on the grounds of prudence: The calculus of costs and benefits is not at all clear to him or to his advisers.

In the meantime, he is reorienting our foreign policy toward a surging Asia and concentrating on rebuilding the American economy. (We also should be paying more attention to Latin America, but that’s another story.) The appointments of Hagel and of John Kerry as secretary of state could have the additional benefit of strengthening our ties to Europe. The personal histories of both, as Financial Times columnist Philip Stevens observed last week, show they have “Atlanticism in their blood.”

None of this is about retreat, decline or isolationism. It’s an approach rooted in realism about the true sources of American power and the urgency of getting our domestic and economic act together. It’s the view reflected in the well-chosen title of a forthcoming book by Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a quintessential realist: “Foreign Policy Begins at Home: The Case for Putting America’s House in Order.”

Haass is a Republican and has his differences with Obama, but this only underscores the quiet consensus that’s developing around what our priorities must be now. Preserving America’s influence abroad depends on first restoring economic growth, upward mobility, fiscal stability and enhanced social solidarity at home. This will require a somewhat leaner defense budget for a time, but the idea that Obama will slash it indiscriminately is absurd.

The declinists are wrong because they underestimate the resilience of the American economy, the magnetism of our culture, the continuing appeal of the democratic idea and the difficulties our competitors, particularly China, confront.

Only our rancid domestic politics stands in our way, and getting beyond our divisions requires Obama to build support for the consensus that’s waiting to be born. That’s why he should not shrink from a broad debate about our purposes in the world. He should welcome it, and join it.

Republicans accuse administration of inflicting added budget pain,"Is the Obama administration employing a make-it-hurt strategy to gain political leverage in the budget battle on Capitol Hill?

Republicans are making that charge as the stalemate drags on, and point to the Pentagon furlough of 400,000 civilian staffers -- even though Congress passed and the president signed a bill to supposedly keep them on the job.

The partial government suspension, which started Monday after lawmakers failed to strike a budget deal, is expected to result in the furlough of roughly 800,000 total government workers. Many federal agencies have significantly curtailed their operations; national parks and monuments are closed.

But Republicans are accusing the Obama administration of making the situation worse than it has to be. They complained overnight that the Pentagon furloughed 400,000 of its civilian staffers.

""This is no time to use national security or our national security workforce as a political pawn,"" Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

More On This...

The dispute comes ahead of a planned White House meeting late Wednesday afternoon. House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders have agreed to meet with Obama to discuss the stalemate. ""We're pleased the president finally recognizes that his refusal to negotiate is indefensible. It's unclear why we'd be having this meeting if it's not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

The bill concerning military pay was the only piece of legislation that Congress passed -- and Obama signed -- in the run-up to the midnight deadline on Monday. According to the text, it would pay the Armed Forces, as well as civilian and contractor personnel deemed to be ""providing support"" to the Armed Forces.

Nevertheless, the Pentagon determined that 400,000 were ""not necessary"" to that mission and sent them home on Monday. According to a document circulated in the Pentagon, they will be considered ""non-pay, non-duty"" until the budget standoff is over.

Asked about McKeon's letter, a senior Defense official indicated there was no way to respond. ""Unfortunately, most of the staff who draft congressional correspondence are furloughed,"" the official told Fox News.

Pentagon officials have indicated a willingness to examine the law to see if there's any wiggle room to bring more civilians back to work.

Republicans argue that the intent of the law was to keep them on the job, and that the Obama administration ""narrowly interpreted"" it against congressional intent in order to furlough more employees.

It's one example of how, Republicans say, the administration is making the partial shutdown of government services worse than it needs to be. Many have complained about the National Park Service cordoning off even open-air monuments in Washington, D.C., such as the World War II Memorial.

House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., accused the administration of selectively closing parks. His office noted that less-visited sites like the Constitutional Gardens remain open, while major draws like the National Mall are closed.

""It appears as though only the highly visible monuments and areas are being closed to the public -- further proof that the Obama Administration is only playing politics and purposely choosing to make this shut down as painful as possible,"" he said in a statement.

House Republicans are trying to push a series of mini-spending bills aimed at prying open certain portions of the government, including national parks and monuments.

After failing to get the bills passed on Tuesday, Republicans will try once again on Wednesday. In addition to bills funding the National Park Service and Veterans Affairs operations, and allowing the District of Columbia to spend money, Republicans are putting up more spending bills specific to the National Institutes of Health and the National Guard and Reserves.

But Democrats have made clear that they do not intend to accept any of them, pressuring Republicans to instead pass a ""clean"" budget bill -- or one that does not include any riders that would chip away at ObamaCare.

Republicans have insisted that the budget bill include measures that defund, delay or rein in parts of the health care law. Democrats refused, and both parties were at an impasse at midnight on Monday.

Democrats have telegraphed that they don't want to let Republicans pry open select parts of government in order to ease the pressure.

""It is time for Speaker Boehner to stop the games, think about the people he is hurting, and let the House pass the Senate's bill to re-open the government with Republican and Democratic votes,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday night.

The White House has also rejected the bills in advance.

""The president and the Senate have been clear that they won't accept this kind of game-playing, and if these bills were to come to the president's desk he would veto them,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""These piecemeal efforts are not serious and they are no way to run a government.""

Mike Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, fired back, ""How does the White House justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans, National Parks, and District of Columbia? The President can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans, visitors at National Parks, and DC while vetoing bills to help them. The White House position is unsustainably hypocritical."""

The small-government, fiscally prudent Republicans in the House have voted to preserve a significant expansion of government power — and to keep spending nearly $1.6 million per prisoner per year at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. They did all that in just a few hours.

Recently, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, along with Rep. Chris Gibson, Republican of New York, sponsored an amendment to repeal a dangerous provision in the 2013 military budget. That provision authorized military detention for anyone captured in the United States on suspicion of terrorism, and did not explicitly exclude American citizens.

Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, said President Obama has pledged not to use the detention power for Americans, but “this is only binding on his administration, but that won’t tie the hands of future administrations.”

House Republicans killed the amendment last night.



Mr. Smith, who’s been very busy, also proposed an amendment to the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, which would have required the closure of Guantánamo by the end of 2014.

It would have enhanced the authority of a presidential appointee charged with finding places to send the almost 90 prisoners who have been cleared for release — many of them because they didn’t actually do anything in the first place.

The bill also would have ordered the transfer of the rest of the prisoners to the United States from their current cells on land leased from the Communist Party of Cuba, either for trial in federal courts or for detention under the laws of war until the “end of hostilities.” (That, of course, is going to be hard to define, but a logical point would be the end of the current war in Afghanistan.)

The first, eligible-for-trial group includes men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 attacks who is slated to go before one of the military tribunals that President Obama has improved from President Bush’s kangaroo courts, but which remain deeply flawed. The second, “end of hostilities” group includes prisoners who are believed to be threats but cannot be tried because there is no evidence against them, or because they were tortured (Mr. Bush’s legacy) and the evidence is not admissible in court.

Mr. Smith pointed out in a press release that the federal courts have convicted “more than 400 defendants charged with crimes related to international terrorism” since Sept. 11, 2001. They have done so without a single security issue or release of sensitive information. These defendants do not receive any greater measure of constitutional rights in the federal courts, including the rights of habeas corpus and the right of appeal, than in military tribunals.

No convicted terrorist has even tried to escape from a federal prison since 9/11. We spend about $34,000 per inmate each year at one of those prisons, Mr. Smith said, compared to $1.6 million per inmate at Guantanamo, where the Pentagon also wants to spend $260 million on new construction.

Republicans were deaf to these solid arguments, and voted down the amendment this morning.

The House did manage to pass one amendment from a Democrat, Jim McGovern, today. It requires an “accelerated” withdrawal from Afghanistan, which sounds good, but the date is the end of 2014, which happens to be when President Obama said he would do it anyway. Now that must have taken courage."

At The Washington Post', 'She Has Written About The Federal Workforce', 'State Politics', 'Government In Annapolis']",Military service chiefs warn budget cuts will undermine readiness,"After staying largely on the sidelines of the debate over deficit reduction, the U.S. military’s service leaders have begun painting a stark picture of the toll a congressionally mandated budget cut could take on the readiness of the world’s largest armed forces.

The $46 billion dent to the Pentagon’s fiscal 2013 budget, long considered by the brass as nothing more than a political pawn, has taken on an air of inevitability, forcing commanders across the military to plan for painful reductions and argue that American lives and livelihoods are hanging in the balance.

Injecting ominous warnings about national security into policy debates has in the past snapped elected leaders into action, but there is no sign that Republicans and the White House are close to compromising on a more measured approach to reducing the deficit. Some lawmakers and analysts have dismissed the caution as posturing by a force reluctant to shrink too much in a postwar era.

In response, the military’s service chiefs are amplifying the months-long warnings of Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and others and providing what they have described as the specific and serious consequences of the across-the-board cuts.

Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army’s chief of staff, recently warned that the cuts may curtail training for 80 percent of ground forces, including some in the deployment pipeline, forcing him to extend the deployments of troops already in Afghanistan.

One is to avoid the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts included in sequestration and another is raising the country’s debt ceiling. Here is a look at some of the issues involved in these two fiscal challenges. Sequester If Congress and Obama can’t reach a deal to avoid sequestration, then the country would see budget cuts of $1.2 trillion through 2021. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said that the defense cuts would be a “disaster.” But if you look at this graph, the blow isn't as bad as the military has faced in the past. Even if the sequestration was implemented, the drop in spending would be less than the military experienced after the Korean, Vietnam or Cold wars. The Center for Strategic and International Studies Wait 1 second to continue.

Facing a $8.6 billion shortfall, the Navy has delayed the deployment of the USS Harry Truman, leaving just one aircraft carrier instead of two in the Persian Gulf, where tensions continue with Iran. The budget crunch also will mean delays for repairs of a carrier and the construction of another.

The Air Force has warned that slashing $12.4 billion from its budget for the remainder of the fiscal year would require cutting 200,000 flying hours. That means that by May, two-thirds of the force’s pilots would “drop below acceptable level of readiness,” Air Force chief Mark Welsh told lawmakers recently.

After holding out hope for a compromise, Pentagon civilians were startled Wednesday when Panetta notified 800,000 employees that they might face a 20 percent pay cut if furloughs are implemented starting in April. Although the payroll for uniformed personnel is spared, the threat of extended deployments has confounded troops in Afghanistan.

“It’s like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said one service member there, Maj. Dustin Navarro, 31. “I’d rather have higher taxes and fewer base resources at home than have this kind of uncertainty while deployed.”

With cuts set to begin March 1, Odierno said in a speech last Friday that the Army is scrambling to find up to $24 billion in reductions for the last seven months of the fiscal year. The shortfall will affect training, he said, presenting a thankless choice between sending untrained troops to Afghanistan and keeping certain units there months beyond their exit dates. American lives are at stake, he warned.

“It is our responsibility to ensure that we never send soldiers into harm’s way that are not trained, equipped, well-led and ready for any contingency, to include war,” Odierno told lawmakers last week. “If we have to reduce the amount of training we give our pilots, they will go in with a hell of a lot less capability. That means mistakes will be made. That means we’ll have accidents. That means we’ll be more likely to be shot down by enemy fire.”

Some lawmakers have reacted apologetically to the predictions of a dangerous drop in readiness. But other lawmakers and analysts say the Pentagon’s doomsday predictions have a measure of hyperbole and might be, at least in part, an attempt to protect budgets and programs as the war in Afghanistan draws to an end.

“Across-the-board cuts are bad policy,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of 22 Congress members from both parties who wrote to President Obama and congressional leaders arguing that defense spending should be part of any debt-reduction deal. “At the end of the day, if cuts are going to be made, the military cannot be spared.”

Anthony Shaffer, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, said he was skeptical of the dire predictions about readiness.

“A lot of us who look at this hard say it’s disingenuous to say, ‘We can’t deploy the Truman because the money’s not there,’ ” said Shaffer, a former Defense Intelligence Agency official. “This is all political theater. It’s being prompted by those in the Pentagon who do not want to make hard choices and cut back.”

Among the most striking examples in a country where most people pledge steadfast support for the troops, Odierno warned that some might have to do without air conditioning later in the year at bases nationwide. But the cuts also probably would have consequences for U.S. forces overseas — Panetta planned to warn NATO defense chiefs during a two-day meeting that began Thursday in Brussels that the belt-tightening could impair the United States’ ability to pay its bills to the alliance and to participate in alliance programs.

Few members meet NATO’s defense spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. In recent weeks, the Obama administration has warned allies with their own economic problems, including NATO stalwarts such as Britain and France, that significant cuts would undermine its arguments to Congress on the need to support defense spending.

“What is particularly tragic to me is that sequestration is not the result of an economic recession or emergency,” Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told the House Armed Services Committee last week, using the term for the automatic cuts. “It’s not in reaction to a more peaceful world. All this is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.”

Pentagon contractors are making preemptive moves that could affect thousands of employees. BAE Systems Ship Repair, a major defense contractor, issued layoff warnings this week to 3,500 shipyard workers — including 1,600 in Virginia’s Hampton Roads area — who could lose their jobs if the Navy puts ship maintenance on hold. The Navy told BAE that it plans to cancel or defer maintenance and upgrades on 13 destroyers and cruisers the company is contracted to work on.

“We regret the anxiety [this] causes our employees and their families,” BAE Systems President Bill Clifford said in the letter that warned of layoffs.

The potential cuts are creating anxiety in Hampton Roads, where 40,000 people work in shipbuilding and repair.

“Once these availabilities are missed, they can’t be made up,” said Tom Taylor, the owner of MF&B Marine in Chesapeake, a small ship-repair company in Hampton Roads, referring to contracts.

Taylor said he fears he might have to lay off some of his 46 employees as he waits to see whether the Navy will lock in plans to cancel or delay billions of dollars more in ship maintenance and repairs.

“There’s no HR department I can send them to,” he said. “I’ve got to look them in the face and tell them they’re out of a job. If we’re going to have a smaller defense, fine, but this is nothing but politics. How can a ship go to sea without its capability?”

Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers, a Labor Department program, is a spinoff of the federal-state unemployment insurance program. The Labor Department says the overall program is meant to help ""eligible workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own"" such as during layoffs.

But eligibility for the military compensation requires only that a person served in uniform and was honorably discharged. In other words, anyone who joins the military and serves for several years, then decides not to re-enlist, is potentially eligible for what could amount to more than 90 weeks of unemployment checks.

The program's cost rose from $300 million in 2003 to $928 million last year.

""It eats away at other parts of the budget, and is for people they no longer have control of,"" said Air Force veteran Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

""Why are we spending so much on (the program) at a time when we can't afford to build a new fighter jet?"" said Samuel Wright, a former Navy lawyer who helps troops with employment and other legal issues. The Pentagon is facing across-the-board cuts because of automatic spending reductions that took effect this month.

Defense officials and outside experts have become increasingly concerned about the rising cost of the compensation program. And some believe it's evidence of weaknesses in other programs, such as those designed to help veterans find jobs. Some military experts suspect the availability of the money may be discouraging some veterans from actively looking for work and thus falsely inflating data on their unemployment -- data that shows higher joblessness for Iraq and Afghanistan vets than for older ones and for society in general.

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman, said a factor in the higher costs is the increased use of National Guard and Reserve units over the past decade for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is, once they were activated, came home and were deactivated, they were added to the rolls of ex-active duty troops.

Another factor could be the recession, which resulted in higher overall national unemployment rates, he said.

The program for former military members started under a 1958 law aimed partly at helping troops transition from life in uniform to the private sector. Unlike the larger U.S. unemployment insurance program, there is no paycheck deduction from troops to fund the military one. In the private sector, employers pay a tax to fund compensation checks; in the military program, the service branches are the employer.

Claims are filed with the states. The Labor Department then tallies compensation sent to former military members and sends the bill to their individual service branches, as well as to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, where a smaller number of former employees also are covered.

Former military members are subject to the same state requirements as others when they apply to a given state for the money. All states have a requirement of some kind that recipients search for work while getting compensation, the Labor Department says. States vary in the types of search activity needed and the effort required, with some, for instance, requiring two job interviews within a certain period or different types of documentation on the search.

Nearly 120,000 people filed first-time claims for money in the military program over the last budget year, compared with 71,000 in 2008, the Labor Department says. Well over 515,000 have gotten compensation since 2008.

Wright, now director of the law center at the Reserve Officers Association, says the payments ""ought to be for people who are actively seeking re-employment -- it's not just free money.""

Officials worry, too, about what will happen to costs when the military draws down from its wartime size, sending more troops out of the services.

A 2008 analysis for the Pentagon by the RAND Corp. research institution found that the sharp rise in military unemployment payments did not mean the civilian labor market for recent veterans had weakened. The study suggested ""a rethinking"" of the program and also noted the big increase in reservists called up over the decade.

It's not solely the number of reservists activated that matters, but also how many know about, and claim, their legal right to go back to their former civilian employers after coming home from mobilization.

""I think one reason that a lot of (recent) veterans are unemployed and have great difficulty finding work is because employers are routinely violating"" the law on returning troops and that too few are being prosecuted for it, Wright said. He says his law center gets more than 700 calls a month from people complaining about that or other employment or legal issues.

There are plenty of other reasons troops may not go straight from life in uniform to one in the private sector.

The need for ""down time"" -- particularly among those who saw combat -- can be a huge factor in re-acclimating.

Some troops also find it hard to face civilian life after the more authoritarian and regimented style of the military.

It also can take time for some to figure out how their military skills and experience translate to private sector jobs.

And some may not want what's being offered in the job market.

""A lot say, `Hey, I joined the Army or Marines so I could get out of working at McDonald's,""' Wright says.

The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is 9.4 percent, compared with 7.7 percent among all Americans, and has been higher for some years.

The compensation ""could be funding the acclimation period for veterans; some veterans may be declining employment opportunities or choosing not to seek employment,"" said a study last year by analysts at the Center for a New American Security.

That may be inflating the program's cost and ""artificially inflating the ranks of unemployed veterans with individuals who are not actively seeking employment,"" said the study, which looked at how American business executives view hiring veterans.

It said the Defense Department should work to better understand the complex needs of veterans during transition to civilian society and figure out how ""efficient, helpful and necessary"" the unemployment compensation is.

""Questions to be considered include which veterans require an acclimation period, how much time is generally needed and whether (the compensation) is currently supporting recently separated veterans through that acclimation period,"" the authors said."

Raymond Odierno (R), and Secretary of the Army John McHugh speak before the Senate Armed Services Committee, on April 23, 2013 in Washington, DC.

By David Alexander

WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Two years of budget cuts and fiscal uncertainty have forced the U.S. Army to greatly curtail spending on training, leaving it with only two combat brigades fully prepared to go to war, the Army's top officer said on Monday.

""Right now, we have in the Army two brigades that are trained. That's it. Two,"" General Ray Odierno told a news conference at the annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army.

Odierno's comments came as he and Army Secretary John McHugh discussed the impact of the recent U.S. government shutdown as well as across-the-board budget cuts that forced the military to slash spending in March, nearly halfway through its fiscal year.

McHugh and Odierno both appealed to Congress to find a way to give the military more financial predictability so it can plan effectively. McHugh said that with the way the military is currently funded, budgets that are approved today are based on planning that occurred three years earlier.

""You can't run the most important military on the face of the Earth locked into three-year-old budgets,"" McHugh said.

The Army was hit particularly hard by the cuts in March, known as sequestration, because of higher-than-projected Afghanistan war costs and the need to make up those funds from its operations accounts, which include money for training.

""We had to stop training, basically, in the last six months of the year,"" Odierno said.

The ongoing uncertainty with the defense budget could make the situation worse in the fiscal year that began in October. The U.S. government began the year with a shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks and put many federal workers on unpaid leave.

The government resumed operations last week under a deal to fund operations at last year's spending levels and priorities.

The Army chief said he hoped to be able to devote enough money to training this fiscal year to ensure that seven combat brigades are fully ready by June to respond to a conflict. He said the current lack of training was his biggest concern.

A combat brigade team has about 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers.

""The worst-case scenario is you ask me to deploy thousands of soldiers somewhere and we have not properly trained them to go because we simply don't have the dollars and money because of the way sequestration is laid out,"" Odierno said.

Odierno said that while troops going to Afghanistan had been trained, they were ""trained now to do training and advising only. They're not trained to do combat operations ... because that's not their mission in Afghanistan any more.""

The Army grew to about 570,000 uniformed personnel over the past decade. But with the war in Iraq over and the one in Afghanistan winding down, officials plan to reduce the size of the force to 490,000. The number of brigade combat teams is due to fall from a total of 45 currently down to 33.

With the Pentagon increasingly likely to face cuts of nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, the Army could be forced to cut further. A management review this summer conducted by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated the Army might have to shrink by up to 70,000 more soldiers, to 420,000.

McHugh said that if the across-the-board cuts continue in force, essentially all of the Army's programs will be affected.

Odierno also said the Army needs a replacement for its armored fighting vehicles, its workhorse Humvee vehicles and its helicopters. ""The bottom line is we can't afford all of that. And so we're going to have make some tough decisions,"" he said. (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Glenn Hubbard', 'Tim Kane']",Republicans and Democrats Both Miscalculated - The New York Times,"TWO years ago, Adm. Mike Mullen, at the time the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that debt was the “single biggest threat to our national security” — not some rogue nation, or terrorist group, but debt. What makes the threat of exploding debt especially dangerous is that it’s not like a faucet that can be easily turned down. Federal, state and city governments in the United States have lost their fiscal grip, and the saga of Detroit’s bankruptcy is just one example.

Astonishingly, when the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its forecast of future deficits, many voices on the left claimed that the problem had been overblown by “austerity scaremongers” (that’s us). Even more astonishingly, some voices on the right have renewed calls to “starve the beast” now that deficits are supposedly under control.

Both responses are wrong, but for different reasons.

First, “the deficit is now under control” fallacy. The C.B.O. did indeed say that the average federal budget deficit would be $62 billion lower per year than was predicted before. That sounds good, but it lacks context. The C.B.O. still anticipates a 2015 deficit of $378 billion. And Uncle Sam is heading — and this is the best-case scenario — toward nearly a trillion dollars of red ink every year after 2023. In an effort to alert Congress to the danger, the C.B.O. also publishes a more realistic alternative fiscal scenario that anticipates how much will actually be spent by the Treasury in the coming decade. The realistic scenario predicts $1.76 trillion more in debt than the old baseline. For anyone willing to question authority, it gets worse. Both official scenarios naïvely assume a return to old norms of full employment, robust growth and moderate interest rates. How many unfulfilled summers of recovery will pass before policy makers will adjust that rosy outlook?

The still larger problem lies with Republicans who refuse to face facts. “Starve the beast” has been the mantra of conservatives since Ronald Reagan was president, a belief that, if taxes were low enough for long enough, rational Democrats would have no choice but to agree to bring federal spending down as well. Even though total federal revenue held level at around 18 percent of gross domestic product in recent decades, spending soared. When Reagan was sworn into office, gross federal debt equaled 32.5 percent of G.D.P. Under President Obama’s leadership, it has risen above 100 percent."

The changes would apply to current active-duty and retired military personnel under the age of 62. Many military families view these changes as a broken promise and, Breitbart News has learned, are convening a “Twitter Town Hall” Monday night in opposition to the budget deal. The grass roots event is targeting Senators up for reelection next year with the hashtag #KeepYourPromise.

“The President and Congress’s failure to watch the back of those who have served their country for twenty or more years in the military, particularly over the last twelve years of war, will ensure the next generation of potential recruits understands that their word means nothing,” Jeremy Hilton, an organizer of the event told Breitbart News.

Hilton is a Navy veteran and in 2012 was named “Military Spouse of the Year” by Armed Forces insurance. His wife currently serves as an officer in the Air Force.

“Military families understand that costs must be constrained,” Hilton continued. “[B]ut all of us have watched DoD flush money down the drain in Afghanistan, here in the states by buying Aeron chairs “because we have to spend it before the end of the year”, or multi-billion congressional boondoggles….we have seen waste that borders on the obscene.”

The Ryan-Murray deal pushes active-duty and veterans into a new pension plan that lowers their yearly cost-of-living adjustment. Instead of keep pace with inflation, the new yearly adjustment would be equal to inflation minus 1%. Once the veteran turns 62, the yearly adjustment would fully account for inflation going forward.

The change is expected to save around $7 billion over the next decade. The money coming out of veterans’ pension checks wouldn’t go to deficit reduction or paying down debt, however. It would go to finance increased government spending.

Rep. Paul Ryan defended the cut to military pensions over the weekend. “We give them a slightly smaller adjustment for inflation because they’re still in their working years and in most cases earning another paycheck,” Ryan said.

Ryan’s defense is beside the point. It isn’t really a question of whether or not a veteran can “afford” the pension benefit cut. It’s a question of whether the government should honor a commitment it’s made to its military personnel, especially at a time when the demands on them and their families are so great.

“So, at the end of twelve years of fighting,” Hilton told Breitbart News, “you are going to break faith with the men and women who have spent half of that time away from their families?”

http://news.yahoo.com/panetta-defense-budget-cuts-damage-economy-154844125--finance.html,,[],Panetta: Defense budget cuts will damage economy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Wednesday laid out a grim list of spending cuts the Pentagon will have to make in the coming weeks that he said will seriously damage the country's economy and degrade the military's ability to respond to a crisis.

Slamming members of Congress as irresponsible, Panetta said lawmakers are willing to push the country off a fiscal cliff to damage their opposing political parties.

He said that if Congress doesn't pass a budget the Pentagon will have to absorb $46 billion in spending reductions in this fiscal year and will face a $35 billion shortfall in operating expenses.

""My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude that is developing among some Republicans and some Democrats, that these dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame the other party for the consequences,"" Panetta said in a speech at Georgetown University. ""This is a kind of 'so what?' attitude that says, 'Let's see how bad it can get in order to have the other party blink'.""

In separate, highly detailed memos sent to Congress, the military services described widespread civilian furloughs, layoffs and hiring freezes that will hit workers all around the country. Overall, the military will furlough 800,000 civilian workers for 22 days, spread across more than five months, and will lay off as many as 46,000 temporary and contract employees.

The Navy says it will cease deployments to South America and the Caribbean and limit those to Europe.

The Air Force warned that it would cut operations at various missile defense radar sites from 24 hours to eight hours. And the Army said it would cancel training center rotations for four brigades and cancel repairs for thousands of vehicles, radios and weapons.

""These steps would seriously damage the fragile American economy, and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe,"" Panetta said, adding that the self-made crisis ""undermines the men and women in uniform who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to protect this country.""

In addition to all of the more immediate cuts, U.S. troops are also likely to see a smaller pay hike next year than initially planned, due to strains on the budget. According to a defense official, the Pentagon will recommend that the military get a 1 percent pay increase in 2014, instead of a 1.7 percent raise.

The Georgetown appearance was likely one of Panetta's last speeches. He is set to leave the Pentagon this month. Former Republican senator Chuck Hagel has been nominated to take his place and a vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee is expected this week."

Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), is the third installment in a series outlining the impact of sequester-related cuts. The report, provided to The Huffington Post in advance of its Wednesday release, is blunt, arguing that Congress has made the impact of sequestration worse by adjusting individual parts, rather than pursuing a larger fix.

""A few departments and agencies have found ways to mitigate some very specific impacts of sequestration,"" the authors wrote. ""However, these strategies merely replace one set of cuts with cuts to other parts of the same agency. All will have an impact, and nearly all will have to be made up with future appropriations.""

""Piecemeal efforts to manage sequestration are counterproductive,"" the report concluded. ""They often require underfunding long-term needs to mitigate short-term pain. In many instances, the annual savings mask increased longer-term costs.""

To illustrate this point, the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee looked at the efforts made by Congress to end the furloughing of air traffic controllers shortly after complaints surfaced over flight delays. While the Federal Aviation Administration was granted flexibility to end those furloughs, it came ""at the expense of another priority,"" the report said. In this case, the FAA can no longer fund construction projects with discretionary funds. Officials estimated the costs of congestion and delays at airports will exceed $34 billion by 2020.

Food safety inspectors were also spared the hit of sequestration. But here too, congressional Democrats pointed out that the cost was only moved elsewhere, with funding taking the hit for U.S. Department of Agriculture building maintenance and for a program to upgrade school kitchen equipment.

""Again, sequestration forced a difficult sacrifice of long-term necessities to avoid short-term pain,"" the report concluded.

Much of the 26-page report is devoted not to the fixes made to sequestration, but to the impacts to come. Under the sequester, $85 billion will be cut this fiscal year, and an estimated $1 trillion will be cut over the next decade.

The report predicted that taxpayers may end up paying more because of the indiscriminate and shortsighted nature of the cuts.

Take, for instance, the $50 million reduced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary weather satellite program. ""The cut will cause a 3-6 month satellite launch delay,"" the report said. ""The delay, as with any construction delay, ends up raising the cost to taxpayers over the next few years, in this case by up to $200 million.""

Then there is the case of federal public defenders, facing steep reductions in funding.

""Reductions in the Federal Defender Services account actually cost the taxpayer money in the form of private attorneys,"" the report said. ""If the Federal Defender cannot accept a case due to sequestration (as many are currently experiencing), representation is provided by private panel attorneys, who are paid at a higher cost than Federal Defenders.""

Those dreaded flight delays, the authors noted, may still end up a reality. Sequestration cuts to the Transportation Security Administration ""may not currently impact wait times for travelers moving through our nation’s airports, but TSA anticipates an increase in the number of delays during the peak summer travel months,"" the report said.

Other highlights in the report:

Research projects will feel the budget cuts, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that it will support 1,357 fewer grants in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012.

The Department of Energy will face challenges ""remediating the contamination from the nation’s nuclear weapons development effort"" because of a $430 million cut.

Rural rental assistance for those in need will be hit, with an estimated 15,000 aid recipients expected to get less while an estimated 70,000 children ""will lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start.""

The Forest Service will enter the 2013 firefighting season with 500 fewer firefighters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will place fewer vaccines, drugs and supplies into the national stockpile used for ""countermeasures needed to respond to bioterrorist attacks.""

Sequestration, the report ominously concluded, may hamper the Department of Defense in confronting pressing national security issues.

""In total,"" the report said, ""DoD estimates the shortfall caused by sequestration in the operation and maintenance accounts is $22 billion for the remainder of FY 2013. The significance of degraded readiness is that units, other than those deploying to Afghanistan (e.g., units that may respond to crises in Syria, Iran or the Korean Peninsula), will not have completed the training necessary to conduct the full range of assigned tasks.""

http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/19/news/economy/government-shutdown-what-happens/index.html,2013-09-19 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Government shutdown gears in motion,"Experts agree: A federal government shutdown would be a dumb way to go.

Yet the risk of a shutdown on Oct. 1 is now a distinct possibility. And federal agencies have been instructed to make plans for one just in case.

The House on Friday will vote on a short-term government funding bill that will include a provision to defund Obamacare. That provision is a no-go for Senate Democrats and President Obama.

If they can't work out a compromise, many functions of the federal government will be shut down indefinitely on Oct. 1.

Besides causing inconvenience and delays, a shutdown could have larger consequences.

A long, broad shutdown could weaken an already modest economic recovery, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf said Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, meanwhile, noted that ""a government shutdown and, perhaps even more so, a failure to raise the debt limit could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy.""

To say nothing of the fact that a shutdown wouldn't come cheap. Federal agencies have to use up time, energy and resources to plan for one. Shutting down, and then reopening the government, also costs money. Two shutdowns in the mid-1990s cost an estimated $1.4 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service.

There's no telling exactly what a shutdown this October would look like because the White House has some discretion in terms of what's hit and what's not. But based on the shutdowns in the mid-1990s, the following is a pretty good bet.

What will be closed for business: Many, if not most, federal government offices, programs, museums and parks would be shuttered.

So if the shutdown lasts awhile, the travel industry could take a hit as vacations and business trips are scuttled -- whether because people can't get a visa or passport or because they have to cancel their plans to visit Yosemite.

For federal contractors, projects may be delayed because the agencies they work for can't issue the paperwork needed to move forward.

And Americans who need something from a federal office affected by the shutdown may be out of luck.

What will be open for business: Parts of the government that provide what the White House budget office deems critical would still operate.

Critical services, broadly speaking, protect human life and property. Typically that has included air traffic control, national security, the handling of hazardous waste, food inspections, border protection, maintenance of the power grid and disaster assistance.

In addition, taxes likely would still be collected, and U.S. bonds issued. Anything else deemed essential to the preservation of the country's banking system would likely carry on as well.

Who will come to work and who won't: Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed without pay. Historically that pay has been restored when the shutdown ends, but there's no guarantee of that in law.

Many federal employees, however, would be exempted from furloughs. President Obama and his presidential appointees, as well as members of Congress, fall into that category.

Also expected to work through a shutdown are federal employees needed to preserve key parts of the money and banking systems.

Anyone authorized to work during a shutdown would be paid, although in most instances they will not get their checks until after the shutdown ends.

How mail would be affected: The mail would still be delivered.

How justice will be served: The federal judiciary estimated that if a shutdown had occurred this year, the court system could have functioned for roughly 10 working days on the basis of fees and funds from prior appropriations, according to CRS.

Related: Budget follies: 3 crazy years and counting

When that funding runs out, the judiciary would allow ""essential work"" to be performed, including the resolution of cases.

Federal court staff and officers who work through the shutdown would not be paid during the shutdown. But Supreme Court justices and federal judges appointed under Article III of the Constitution would.

If you're called for federal jury duty, you won't get paid for it on time.

What happens to Social Security and other benefits: Funding for entitlement benefits is considered mandatory, meaning it's not subject to the annual appropriations process.

So the money will be there to pay the benefits. The only question is whether the federal workers who process them will be.

Social Security checks did go out during the last shutdown, and the White House should be able to ensure the same thing happens again if need be.

During the mid-1990s shutdowns, the Social Security Administration initially retained nearly 5,000 employees to send benefits to those already enrolled in the program. But during the second, longer shutdown, it realized it would need closer to 50,000 employees to process applications for new claims or Social Security cards, address changes and other benefit-related tasks.

How Obamacare will fare: Those who would threaten to shut the government down are those who most want to see Obamacare delayed and defunded.

But an analysis by the CRS concludes that the implementation of Obamacare is likely to continue in the event of a shutdown."

Do we dare to hope that the Bush administration is finally at an end? After four years of bending the Constitution, the constitutional law professor now in the White House is trying to unloose the Gordian knot of W.’s martial and moral overreaches after 9/11. Safely re-elected, President Obama at long last spoke bluntly about the Faustian deals struck by his predecessor, some of them cravenly continued by his own administration. In a speech at the National Defense University, Obama talked about how we “compromised our basic values,” and he concluded with a slap at W.: “Our victory against terrorism won’t be measured in a surrender ceremony at a battleship or a statue being pulled to the ground.”

See, Maureen? Stop trying to make silly prom metaphors and you get to go places. Like this page.

Doyle McManus takes a deeper look at Obama's defense speech.

President Obama's speech last week on the future course of America's 11-year-old war against Al Qaeda was long overdue. Never before has he offered the public such a detailed explanation of his anti-terrorism strategy. In part, that's surely because so much of it was officially secret — but also because the public hasn't demanded a position more nuanced than ""tough on terrorism."" The president did three big things in his speech Thursday at the National Defense University in Washington. He argued that America's fight against terrorism should be narrower and more sharply focused. He formalized, in particular, new limitations on drone strikes. And he promised that the war against Al Qaeda will end someday.

Like it or not, this speech is likely to define Obama's legacy a decade from now.

Catherine Rampell has bad news for anyone hoping to build their own blimp... or fans of common sense.

The values of gold and silver have dropped like a stone in international trading markets. Coffee futures are hovering near a three-year low. But the price of one commodity has been rising as if it were lighter than air — and in this case, well, it is. The market value of refined helium gas has nearly doubled over the past five years, even as the Standard & Poor’s benchmark commodities index, the GSCI, has fallen by some 20 percent. ... What makes this market saga particularly quirky, though, is the role played by the United States government. For much of the 20th century, the federal government had a domestic monopoly on the production of helium, which was used for airships, missile guidance and other national security measures. In 1960, it began a program to stockpile the helium it was extracting in an underground reservoir near Amarillo, Tex., amassing a debt of $1.3 billion in the process.

Short version: Congress passed a law forcing the government to sell off the helium reserve in about the stupidest way possible. The revenues generated are small, the impact on the market large, and both health and science research are threatened. In the meantime, I'm socking away tanks of helium in my basement (yes, really).

On Thursday, senators held a confirmation hearing for Obama’s nominee to be commerce secretary: a billionaire who benefits from offshore tax havens, whose family owned a failed savings and loan and who is accused by unions of mistreating workers. Turns out the wealthy didn’t lose the 2012 election; rather, the Republican rich lost to the Democratic rich. ... “You will certainly have my vote,” commerce committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (average estimated net worth: $103 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics) assured the nominee (net worth $1.85 billion, according to Forbes). “My hope,” said Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner ($228 million), is that “this committee will recommend you.” Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill ($22 million) told Pritzker, “I find it very refreshing to find someone who is stepping up like you are in this position.” Another committee member, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut ($100 million), didn’t speak at the hearing but issued a statement calling the heiress “a longtime friend with a lifetime of business experience and acumen that will serve her well.”

Sometimes, you really long for a zombie uprising.

Robert Kaiser says the problems with Congress go beyond partisan differences.

Congress is a human institution with a distinct culture, and the modern version of that culture is hostile to creative problem-solving. If we have a mediocre Congress — even when it manages to accomplish something — it is because of the people in it and the culture they have created. The men and women who now run for Congress have special features. Most of them are much wealthier than their constituents. Surprisingly few have strong policy interests or experience. Most are willing to spend a day or two or three each week asking strangers for money on the telephone, a demeaning but obligatory exercise. Most have internalized an ethical code that allows them to solicit campaign contributions from people directly affected by legislation they vote on. This is not rare or even unusual — it’s standard.

Again, it doesn't matter what you think is the most important issue facing the nation. That issue won't be solved until the connection between huge dollars and politics is smashed. If you think that can never happen, then don't bother looking for solutions on anything else.

Max Plotkin doesn't think much of Virginia's all Tea Party, all the time GOP lineup.

One candidate stood out right away. There was a sea of red baseball hats with yellow lettering bearing the name “Jackson” and the slogan “Let liberty light the way for Virginia.” No other candidate had hats. Hats carried the day! E.W. Jackson was a political nobody when he ran in 2012 against George Allen for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate. Relegated as “fringe,” he finished a distant fourth. But last weekend Jackson was the story, the steak and the sizzle. He gave a stemwinder of a speech. Even country-club Republican Jay Garner of Westmoreland County, attired in seersucker with a perfectly tied bow tie, told me Jackson was the only candidate that “brought them to their feet.” He said that Jackson “can rally folks” and “tells it like it is.” Jackson is a dazzling eclectic: an African American, a Marine Corps veteran, a Harvard Law grad and a practicing preacher from Chesapeake. He has also made life difficult for himself and his party with inflammatory rhetoric, such as this: “Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was.”

One of the great untold stories in science is the process of science itself. I don't mean stories about what scientists have discovered and what those discoveries tell us; we (and many others) cover those every day. ... What's missing is the background for these stories of discovery. How do you take an idea from its beginning as a casual musing all the way through an actual research program? What's involved in that process? How do you sort out the good ideas from the bad and choose what to pursue and what to abandon? That's the story I want to tell. To understand how I choose between good ideas and bad ideas, we need to step back from actual physics and science and take a look at the structure of the research community that I work in. Research takes resources. I don't mean money—all right, I do mean money—but it also requires time, people, lab space, and support. There is a human and physical infrastructure that I have to make use of. I may be part of a research organization, but I have no automatic right of access to any of this infrastructure."

(CNN) —

When President Barack Obama headed to the Jersey Shore this week to tout the recovery effort from Superstorm Sandy, congressional Republicans sought to keep the nation’s focus on Washington.

On the same day Obama played “Touchdown Fever” with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on the Point Pleasant boardwalk and urged Americans to come spend money in the devastated region, House GOP committee leaders ensured that a series of controversies dominating the start of the president’s second term remained in the headlines.

Obama quoted from the Tom Waits song “Jersey Girl” popularized by local hero Bruce Springsteen, while GOP officials announced subpoenas of State Department records involving last year’s deadly Benghazi terrorist attack, questioned if Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress about cracking down on journalists and announced another congressional hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups.

And on Friday, Obama stood in the Rose Garden to push Congress to extend student loan rates that are set to double on July 1 if the White House and Republicans can’t strike a deal.

It’s all part of a high-stakes showdown over political messaging, with the White House trying to shift the focus from the controversies that Republicans seek to emphasize in their efforts to retain their House majority and perhaps win control of the Senate in next year’s congressional elections.

“Voters react against what they perceive to be excess and overkill,” said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who noted that recent polls show the public believes one of the current controversies – the IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status – amounted to government overreach.

“Any political party that overreaches usually gets slapped back by the public,” she added, referring to losses suffered by parties in power in mid-term elections in 1994, 2006 and 2010.

The GOP narrative depicts a government gone wild, with party leaders and strategists accusing the Obama administration of routinely abusing its powers. To bolster their argument, they lump the three controversies together in an effort to create a sweeping example of leaders avoiding accountability and responsibility.

“Benghazi. The IRS. AP phone records. The failures for which Barack Obama will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration,” Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, recently wrote in an opinion piece. “They are the failures of an old idea – that big, old, dumb, top-down, factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times.”

Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, complained of “an arrogant abuse of power” by the president.

“Now in his second term, now that he’s implementing his agenda, we are seeing big government in practice,” the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday on Fox.

Asked if the controversies would bring Republican victories in next year’s congressional elections to take control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House, Ryan said it was “just way too premature to make a comment like that.”

White House emphasizes business as usual

For his part, Obama seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on Wednesday night in Chicago, telling supporters that “sometimes we take a bad turn, sometimes we make mistakes.”

At the same time, the president complained of “obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism” by political foes who appeared interested “only in scoring political points or placating a base, as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people.”

“We’ve got to figure out a way to work around that,” he continued, declaring that the solution would be for Democrats to regain majority control in the House next year.

Obama’s schedule this week demonstrated how the White House took a “business as usual” approach that emphasized low-risk issues for the president, such as Tuesday’s visit to New Jersey for a bipartisan review of recovery efforts with Christie, a leading Republican.

The joint appearance benefited both men by portraying them as reasonable leaders able to work with political foes on major issues such as responding to a crisis like last year’s storm.

Other events on the president’s agenda included two Chicago fundraisers and remarks at an Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Celebration at the White House, all following last week’s major speech on security issues including U.S. drone policy and closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that houses terror suspects.

Despite the White House efforts to shift the focus from the Washington controversies, Wednesday’s briefing with reporters by chief spokesman Jay Carney showed the difficulty.

While the first questions were about other matters – a reported drone strike, the Syrian civil war and cyber-security issues with China – CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked about GOP accusations that Holder may have lied to Congress about the secret subpoenas and search warrants obtained by the Justice Department in recent years for information from journalists involved in reporting classified information.

Reporters from NBC, CBS and Fox quickly followed up on the same topic, forcing Carney to defend Holder and reiterate Obama’s confidence in him.

On Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One from Chicago that Obama would later attend his annual hurricane season briefing. He then faced more questions about Holder, with Earnest expressing Obama’s confidence that the controversies would not affect the attorney general’s ability to do his job.

GOP singles out Holder

Republicans have taken particular aim at Holder, an old nemesis from his days in the Clinton administration who has been a political lightning rod in the Obama administration.

He was cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans last year in a dispute over documents related to the botched “Fast and Furious” gun-walking operation. Holder rejected the vote boycotted by most House Democrats as political theater.

Critics now seek to link him to two cases stemming from Justice Department investigations of classified leaks – one involving secret subpoenas last year of phone records of Associated Press journalists, and the other about subpoenas and search warrants obtained in secret three years ago for phone records, e-mails and security badge details of Fox correspondent James Rosen.

Some Republicans attempt to group the classified leaks cases with the other controversies – IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points from the administration four days after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, last September that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

“I think it is time for Mr. Holder to step aside,” Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida told Fox News on Wednesday. “We need a new attorney general, especially with all of these matters that are now going to need investigation from the IRS to the DOJ treatment of reporters. I just don’t think he is in a position where he can do that in a way that the American people expect.”

Obama and Democrats joined Republicans in condemning the IRS targeting, which is under investigation by congressional committees as well as Holder’s Department of Justice.

The classified leaks investigations also raised concern among Democrats including Obama, who ordered Holder to conduct a review of how the government investigates such cases.

However, Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter, a CNN political contributor, described Republican calls for Holder to resign as overkill, noting that GOP legislators had demanded an investigation into classified leaks in the first place.

“I think that if the president took action every time a House Republican criticized a member of his Cabinet, we’d have a pretty empty government,” Cutter said when asked if Holder was proving a liability to Obama. “… For average Americans, they’re not really paying attention to this and they’re wondering, you know, why shouldn’t the Department of Justice investigate, you know, intelligence leaks about some of our most pressing national security issues?”

Public responds to IRS

A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday appeared to back up some of Cutter’s assertion.

According to the survey, 44% of registered voters responded that the IRS probe of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status was the most important of the controversies facing the Obama administration, while 24% said the handling of the Benghazi attack was the biggest concern. Only 15% called the Justice Department’s seizure of journalists’ phone records as the most important.

By contrast, 73% of respondents said the economy was a higher priority than the three controversies, according to the survey. However, it also showed that more than three-quarters of respondents wanted a special prosecutor – rather than Holder – to investigate the IRS targeting.

To liberal political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Republicans have attacked Holder as part of a broader strategy to tarnish the administration.

“Typing Holder as the font of secrecy, manipulation and wrongdoing in the Obama administration will be played and replayed in the run-up to the 2014 elections,” Hutchinson wrote Thursday on his website. “The aim will be to paint Holder as an incompetent, conniving political hack who supposedly typifies the poor and untrustworthy judgment of Obama in picking his political appointees.”

Conway, the GOP pollster, argued that the controversies all started with problematic acts by the administration.

“It’s an advantage to the party out of power if the party in power is seen to be obfuscating or hiding the truth,” she said, noting that “these are not investigations that began in (Republican House Speaker) John Boehner’s office.”

Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University constitutional lawyer, noted that most recent presidents faced accusations if not outright evidence of scandal in their second terms.

In the Obama administration, Turley said, Holder serves the role of “sin-eater,” or “people that would take your sins away for a price.”

“Holder is the ultimate sin-eater in the beltway,” Turley argued on CNN. “He protects the president and he has an important use in that sense.”

Hardest-hit states include Alabama%2C Texas%2C Virginia and Pennsylvania

Army depots face the biggest potential cuts

At least 450%2C000 jobs could be affected

WASHINGTON -- Budget cuts by the Air Force, Army and Navy scheduled to take effect March 1 will force almost $34 billion in wage and spending reductions and prompt furloughs or layoffs for millions of people, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.

The Army's estimated cuts will force $15 billion in wage and spending reductions and prompt furloughs or layoffs for 300,000 people nationwide, while the Navy could face $11 billion in similar cuts affecting a potential 186,000 employees, records show. The Air Force estimates $7.7 billion in lost pay for its civilian employees.

Hardest hit states by the Army cuts include Alabama, Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Among the least affected: Delaware, Wyoming, Montana and Rhode Island.

The Navy meanwhile expects sequestration will force it to cut $7.75 billion from its shipbuilding programs and another $4 billion in funds for operations and maintenance, according to Navy planning documents. The Navy's civilian employees could lose 20% of their salaries through furloughs.

California, Florida and Virginia would be most affected by the Navy cuts, the planning documents show.

Overall, the military faces $500 billion in budget cuts over 10 years from sequestration -- automatic budget cuts. The Pentagon anticipates that it will need to slash $46 billion in spending cuts by the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30 for all the services to meet the requirement for 2013. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the cuts could render the U.S. military a second-rate power.

""It reaffirms what we have continued to say about the serious implications that sequestration will have on our national defense and broader economic well-being,"" said Mike Amato, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

The cuts will affect every Army installation, according to the documents. States with large bases and military contractors are taking the biggest hits.

Texas, for instance, would face a $2.4 billion economic loss from the Army's budget cuts. Nearly 30,000 Army civilian employees will be furloughed if the cuts go into effect. They will lose $180 million in pay. Texas is home to two of the Army's largest installations -- Fort Hood and Fort Bliss.

""These states are where the soldiers are -- Texas especially,"" said Thomas Donnelly, a defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute.

Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the services were playing politics to a degree by releasing figures showing cuts in the most dramatic ways. However, he said the cuts could have lasting, damaging impacts.

Texas would also be hard-hit by Air Force cuts, losing $127 million in wages. Other states affected by the Air Force cuts include Oklahoma, whose civilian employees stand to lose $124 million in lost wages.

President Obama stepped up pressure on Republicans in Congress to help avoid the cuts by passing a plan including other spending cuts and changes in tax policy that would bring extra revenue. The cuts, he said Tuesday, are ""not an abstraction — people will lose their jobs.""

In testimony last week on Capitol Hill, Gen. Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told lawmakers that 3,100 temporary employees were being laid off and a hiring freeze had been implemented because of the budget crisis. Maintenance would be canceled and training for soldiers not headed to Afghanistan or South Korea would be curtailed.

The Army's plan might overstate the budget crisis a bit, but it also points out major problems on the horizon, Donnelly said. Since military personnel costs are exempt from sequestration, the cuts fall more heavily in other areas, particularly training. That affects readiness for fighting, he said.

The states most affected have big maintenance depots, which will be shuttered in coming months because of the cuts. Pennsylvania, for example, has two major maintenance depots and is targeted for $751 million in savings. Its Letterkenny Depot upgrades weapons systems, including Patriot missiles.

Alabama's Anniston Army Depot could see $710 million in cuts, while the Corpus Christi Army Depot in Texas could face $799 million in cuts, the documents show.

Closing the depots would stop repairs on 17,000 weapons, 14,000 communication devices and 1,000 vehicles, according to the Army. Purchase orders would also be reduced, affecting 3,000 companies and putting 1,100 at risk of bankruptcy.

Glenn Hubbard', 'Tim Kane']",Republicans and Democrats Both Miscalculated - The New York Times,"TWO years ago, Adm. Mike Mullen, at the time the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that debt was the “single biggest threat to our national security” — not some rogue nation, or terrorist group, but debt. What makes the threat of exploding debt especially dangerous is that it’s not like a faucet that can be easily turned down. Federal, state and city governments in the United States have lost their fiscal grip, and the saga of Detroit’s bankruptcy is just one example.

Astonishingly, when the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its forecast of future deficits, many voices on the left claimed that the problem had been overblown by “austerity scaremongers” (that’s us). Even more astonishingly, some voices on the right have renewed calls to “starve the beast” now that deficits are supposedly under control.

Both responses are wrong, but for different reasons.

First, “the deficit is now under control” fallacy. The C.B.O. did indeed say that the average federal budget deficit would be $62 billion lower per year than was predicted before. That sounds good, but it lacks context. The C.B.O. still anticipates a 2015 deficit of $378 billion. And Uncle Sam is heading — and this is the best-case scenario — toward nearly a trillion dollars of red ink every year after 2023. In an effort to alert Congress to the danger, the C.B.O. also publishes a more realistic alternative fiscal scenario that anticipates how much will actually be spent by the Treasury in the coming decade. The realistic scenario predicts $1.76 trillion more in debt than the old baseline. For anyone willing to question authority, it gets worse. Both official scenarios naïvely assume a return to old norms of full employment, robust growth and moderate interest rates. How many unfulfilled summers of recovery will pass before policy makers will adjust that rosy outlook?

The still larger problem lies with Republicans who refuse to face facts. “Starve the beast” has been the mantra of conservatives since Ronald Reagan was president, a belief that, if taxes were low enough for long enough, rational Democrats would have no choice but to agree to bring federal spending down as well. Even though total federal revenue held level at around 18 percent of gross domestic product in recent decades, spending soared. When Reagan was sworn into office, gross federal debt equaled 32.5 percent of G.D.P. Under President Obama’s leadership, it has risen above 100 percent."

Rep. Nancy Pelosi is a California Democrat and the leader of Democrats in the House of Representatives. She met this week with USA TODAY's Editorial Board. Her comments were edited for length and clarity.

On the coming debt ceiling fight:

""Here's the thing -- the president is one of the most practically non-partisan presidents I have seen in the White House. I've been there since Ronald Reagan, and he really is working to try to get some bipartisan agreement. They've been working very hard to try to get the Senate consensus or some agreement on how we can avoid a shutdown of government but also how you can even remove all doubt that we're not going to honor the full faith in credit of the United States of America by lifting the debt ceiling. There are some glimmers, a possibility of coming to a grand bargain. The president is talking about a grand bargain for middle-income jobs, but the bigger, the grander the bargain the more you can accommodate, shall we say, other things you don't like so much. But weighing all the equities, this is the way that we need to go forward.

On how entitlement spending could help cut the deficit:

One of the things we did was pass the Affordable Care Act because the biggest contribution to the growth of the deficit has been the rapidly rising cost of health care. Prescription drugs, services, all the rest. And passing the ACA is already projected to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. And you see evidence of it now that the ACA is partially responsible for the reduction of the deficit. And that is really important because you have to reduce those costs. We had to pass the Affordable Care Act, even if everybody loved their health care and they loved their insurance company, which they didn't, but even if they did, the costs were unsustainable to individuals, to families, to businesses, to our country's competitiveness in the world. And so the Affordable Care Act not only accomplished what we want is good health for America, not just health care, prevention and wellness and health for America, but reducing the cost.

On the decision to postpone the ACA's employer mandate:

The president didn't postpone the mandate, he postponed the penalties for not engaging in the mandate. So you might say it's the same thing, but it's a technicality. When the (administration) informed us, I thought that that was fine. What it could lead to is some others looking for some postponement, which might be OK too. There's no bill that has ever been written that you can say every single thing in it on its timetable and in its specifics should never be changed. And to the extent that the president has the executive authority to do some changes, that's fine.

On the National Security Agency's Internet and phone data collection:

Here's the thing, I think that technology has been a friend in terms of protecting our national security. The balance between security and liberty has always been a challenge in our country. That's why I insisted on the establishment of the civil liberties and privacy board to be watchdog on how this is done. Congress has to make decisions about intelligence budgeting and policy. We need much more information. People say, well, Congress was informed. Well, yeah, but Congress changes. In the aggregate, we want Congress informed – not this one day and that another year and then say we told Congress. Yeah, we told Congress at large. We want Congress informed in aggregate.

On the court that supervises the NSA:

Let me say this -- when the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court was established and it was decided that the chief justice would name the judges, would anybody have thought the chief justice would name 10 people from one party and one of another? How do you allay concerns, fear, established trusts with that kind of appointments. So let's take a look at how those judges are appointed. I do think the appeal that is made to the court has to meet certain standards, and they probably do. But we shouldn't take that at face value. We should have a release of that information over a period of time."

USA TODAY

Obama wants to make it clear he will not budge

President says he has made offers and is willing to negotiate%2C but only after government is reopened

WASHINGTON— In his ongoing battle with Republicans over a government shutdown and a looming default, President Obama armed himself on Tuesday with an olive branch and an anvil.

For a brief moment at his hastily arranged White House news conference, Obama emphasized his willingness to work with Republicans to get past this fiscal crisis that's shut down the federal government for eight days and is now threatening to inflict real pain to an American economy.

Asked whether he'd willing to negotiate with Republicans, even if they just passed a short-term budget deal, the president brightly responded ""absolutely."" Obama added that he doesn't expect to get 100% of what he wants. And he noted that doesn't believe he has the answers to everything and joked that his wife could tell you about some of his flaws.

But in between the fleeting moments of conciliatory rhetoric, Obama pounded away at a Republican party—and particularly House Speaker John Boehner--who he says is trying to extract a ransom to do their job.

Obama cast himself as the adult in the room—the one who has been willing to go more than halfway in past negotiations much to the chagrin to many Democrats—and is willing to sit down with Republicans again if they agree to even short-term deals on the budget and debt ceiling.

At this point, the president lamented that he has no true negotiating partner. The Tea Party is ""forcing"" the speaker to issue threats to the economy, he said. Obama even scoffed at Boehner's recent suggestions that there aren't the votes in the House to pass a clean budget resolution or debt limit hike.

""Let them vote to keep the government open or not, and they can determine where they stand and defend that vote to their constituencies,"" Obama dared. ""And let them vote on whether or not America should pay its bills or not. And if, in fact, some of these folks really believe that it's not that big of a deal, they can vote no.""

In this latest round of budgetary wars, Obama has maintained a rhetorical consistency: There will be no negotiations until Congress passes a clean budget and debt ceiling hike.

Obama says if he gives in now to what he sees as unreasonable Republican demands—which include defunding or delaying his signature health care law which Congress passed three years ago-- it would weaken the institution of the presidency and change American democracy.

His tough talk also could bolster fellow Democrats who are less than enthused by his track-record for negotiations.

Democrats grouse that he caved earlier this year when agreed to extending George W. Bush era tax cuts to those making less than $450,000, after vowing to sunset the provision for all top earners. And the bad taste lingers for Democrats from the 2011 fight in which Obama relented after demanding a clean increase to the debt limit.

But on Tuesday, Obama seemed to be trying to send the message that this time will be different.

""I think what has changed is they're aware of the fact that I'm not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States,"" Obama said about the debt ceiling. ""You don't pay a ransom, you don't provide concessions for Congress doing its job and America paying its bills.""

Boehner, however, doesn't yet sound convinced. He told reporters shortly after Obama's remarks that Republicans won't blink to the president's call for ""unconditional surrender.""

""The long and short of it is, there's going to be a negotiation here,"" Boehner told reporters.

Who blinks first remains to be seen. But eight days into the impasse, there isn't even the semblance of common ground."

All 200 Democrats would need to stick together and team up with those Republicans to pass the bill, but House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put it to a vote, which so far he has given no indication he will do. But if he does, the votes appear to be there. The Senate would pass the bill in no time, sending it to be signed by President Barack Obama and ending the shutdown.

Read the tally here to see who those House Republicans are, and why they say they're done with trying to force through provisions on Obamacare before agreeing to keep the government running.

By Global Public Square staff

Last week’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit saw the presidents of China, Mexico, Russia and many others in Bali, Indonesia. In the video, tucked away on the far right, you see John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State. And where is President Obama? Well, he was stuck in Washington, of course, dealing with the government shutdown and threats of default. Obama missed not only APEC, but also ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations summit, as well as planned visits to Malaysia and the Philippines.

For Asians, the symbolism was clear. The United States was struggling to get its house in order. And perhaps to highlight a contrast, China was present in full force, putting on an exhibition of power and diplomacy. President Xi Jinping attended the APEC meeting and then made special trips to Malaysia and Indonesia. The Premier, Li Keqiang, attended the ASEAN meeting and traveled to Thailand.

Consider the deals that were struck last week. President Xi promised to triple his country's trade with Malaysia within four years. In Indonesia, he promised tens of billions of dollars in investment. And he courted Australia's new prime minister, Tony Abbott, to whom he promised more trade and more cooperation in technology and energy.

And it’s not just trade. A new report from the non-profit Rand Corporation outlines the dramatic escalation of China's foreign aid. In 2001, Beijing spent $1.7 billion dollars on foreign aid. By 2009, it was spending nearly $125 billion. In 2010, the figure rose to $169 billion, by 2011 it reached $189 billion dollars – about 3 percent of China's GDP – and it is still going up.

The money trail points to a country flush with cash, looking to snap up resources and opportunities around the world.

What has been less clear in the last two years is the effectiveness of Beijing's foreign policy. As the Chinese scholar Zheng Wang points out, not a single member of China's seven-member Standing Committee – the pinnacle of power in Beijing – is a foreign policy expert. The country’s foreign minister doesn't make it into Beijing’s 25-person Politburo.

More from CNN: World wants U.S. soft power

And China has made several missteps in the past three years. It escalated territorial disputes with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. It was seen as a bully flexing its muscles with its neighbors. These signals, mostly rhetoric, were a contradiction not only of China's stated policy of a “peaceful rise,” but also of its actual track record. Remember: China has actually not been involved in a single war since 1979, when it had a skirmish with Vietnam. But the moves worried its neighbors enough that they publicly asked for greater American involvement in Asia.

This past week, China's leaders were at pains to display a softer face. They described China as a gentle giant, not an aggressor. Meanwhile, they put the focus back on the economy and building business ties with their Asian neighbors. As Li put it last week, “We should make the pie bigger, and share this pie with our people.” It's a smart, win-win move. China's neighbors may worry about a big, powerful giant – but they still want to trade with it.

President Obama's pivot to Asia has been one of his wisest foreign policy moves, well-conceived and well executed. But it, too, has now been weakened, one more consequence of the vicious partisanship in Washington.

So you see a China that learns from its mistakes, smartens up, and moves ahead. Washington on the other hand, keeps returning to deadlock, repeats its most stupid moves, and continues to govern from crisis to crisis. It is a sad contrast that Asia and the world can see."

In the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., there is a priority in the region’s schools: ensuring safety. At West Springfield High in Fairfax County, Officer Joe Plazio patrols the halls.

In the anxious weeks after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the idea of bringing more police into the nation’s schools has picked up support. But for many parents and educators, there is a more immediate priority: protecting schoolhouse doors.

Some schools in the Washington area lack buzzer entrance systems. Some leave a main door open, with a sign asking visitors to report to the office. Some, according to parents, do not closely screen all visitors or use different rules for after-school activities and child-care programs.

What happened at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14 — when gunman Adam Lanza overcame a security system, shooting out glass near the school entrance, police said, before killing 20 children and six staff members — sent the nation reeling and brought new attention to school entry points.

Across the Washington region, officials in many school systems — including those of the District and Fairfax, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties — say they have strong practices already in place and are taking a close look for areas of improvement.

But the aftermath of the Connecticut tragedy has spotlighted inconsistencies at schools, funding concerns and a heightened interest in basic security measures, even if they would not prevent an attack like the one at Sandy Hook.

In Virginia, 2012 data show that controlled access systems are in place at 59 percent of elementary schools, 51 percent of middle schools and 37 percent of high schools.

Seventy-three percent of schools said they lock up during school hours, and 46 percent said they had someone posted at the front entrance to ensure that visitors check in. Just more than half of schools said all classroom doors could be locked from inside and outside. Maryland and D.C. officials said they could not provide similar figures last week.

“We just have to do everything possible . . . and just say a prayer,” said Montgomery County Board of Education member Patricia O’Neill (Bethesda-Chevy Chase) moments before a January vote to speed up a $364,000 project to install buzz-in systems, with exterior cameras and intercoms, at a final group of elementary schools.

In Maryland, Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) has proposed spending $25 million in construction money in the coming year to tighten physical security at public schools, with cameras at entrances, automatically locking doors, shatterproof glass and buzzer entrance systems.

“A lot of what we’re doing is strengthening what’s already in place,” said State Superintendent Lillian M. Lowery, who noted that Maryland is reviewing every district’s emergency plans while seeking best practices and looking to “put in as many safeguards as possible.”

In Virginia, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) created a school safety task force that is expected to issue a set of recommendations Thursday.

At a Jan. 16 public meeting about security in Rockville, the father of a kindergartner focused on beefing up security at elementary schools. The mother of a high-schooler asked about doors near portable classroom trailers.

Then there was parent Mike Richman’s pointed question: Shouldn’t all middle school doors be locked?

“Are they?” Richman asked.

Officials in local systems say schools lock exterior doors, but not all entrances are locked in all school systems. In some districts, schools with younger students often have tighter building controls, and schools with older students have more security staff or police on the premises.

“Security is always a balance,” said Robert Hellmuth, safety and security director for Montgomery schools. The goal, he said, is to control who gets inside schools while not turning them into fortresses.

Experts say schools are among the safest places for the young. Researcher Dewey Cornell, who studies school safety at the University of Virginia, says 99 percent of homicides of children ages 5 to 18 occur outside of school.

Nationally, schools became more vigilant about locking doors, and some installed buzzer systems, after the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, said Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant.

“The momentum faded four to six years after Columbine,” Trump said. “The mind-set became more and more lax.”

Trump said secure entrances are critical in schools — and need to be paired with well-trained school staff so that visitors are noticed and screened.

At Sandy Hook, the security system might have prevented more deaths, Trump said, because it slowed the gunman’s entrance.

“Those were seconds that gave people on the inside time to lock down,” he said. “Seconds count.”

Police officers, although the focus of many proposals nationally, are primarily used locally in secondary schools, with the greatest number in the District, which has 100 “school resource officers” and 300 security guards in its 118 buildings.

Elsewhere, there are 53 armed school resource officers in Fairfax, 27 in Loudoun County, 22 in Prince George’s, 19 in Prince William County, and six each in Montgomery and Alexandria. Many systems rely on unarmed security staff in large numbers.

Elected leaders are now rethinking how much security is enough.

An effort to boost the law enforcement presence in Montgomery schools has gained momentum since Sandy Hook. “I think people are thinking about it now and connecting the dots,” County Council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty) said.

The tragedy also has spurred new action in Prince George’s, where a push is underway for increasing the number of buzzer systems and closer monitoring of school visitors. Other recommendations expected to come before the school board include hiring 10 more resource officers and buying panic buttons to allow a surreptitious call for help in an emergency.

“Certainly, this has heightened everyone’s awareness,” said Michael Blow, director of security services in Prince George’s schools.

Prince George’s County Council member Ingrid Turner (D-Bowie) raised concerns at a meeting last week about visitors appearing to enter schools unnoticed. “When I’m home, my door is locked,” she said later. “It’s a question that needs to be discussed and dialogued.”

In Fairfax, every elementary and middle school is equipped with buzz-in systems except three that will have the work completed in coming weeks. “We’ve asked our vendors to step up, and they’ve been great,” said Fred Ellis, director of safety and security.

Still, Ellis says access control systems are not “a panacea” and all security measures rely on good judgments inside a school, such as questioning someone who buzzes at the door or stopping a visitor without a pass.

Ellis and others also pointed out that security measures often reflect what people are “willing to give up in terms of convenience, access, the whole environment of the school, and what are they willing to pay to fund it.”

School Board member Megan McLaughlin (Braddock) said any security changes in Fairfax should be thoughtful and made with a focus on preserving a welcoming learning environment. “I would rather have all of our doors locked and secured than have armed officers in our schools,” she said. “To me, that’s a healthy trade-off.”

The project to install buzzer entrance systems in Montgomery’s 139 elementary schools was in the works before Sandy Hook. But a final group of 26 schools was not due for the improvements until next school year.

Parents wrote letters.

“I’ve never seen anything go through local government so quickly,” said Arielle Grill, a Bethesda parent who urged the project be accelerated. Grill said she does not want schools to become fortresses but thinks that “locking the front door of an elementary school is just so fundamental to keeping kids safe.”

The project is to be completed by June.

Some also wonder about the pressure that buzz-in systems place on front office staff to make what may be tough se curity calls. “There are so many angles that need to be studied,” said Montgomery School Board Member Michael A. Durso (District 5). A national nonprofit safety group, Safe Havens International, which has developed safety plans for thousands of schools, said that in recent years, it has defeated security systems in more than 90 percent of the 200 schools it has been asked to test with in-person visits.

In but one example, Michael Dorn, the group’s executive director, said he has made his way into schools a number of times after introducing himself as Ted Bundy — the name of an infamous serial killer — and explaining the purpose of his visit as “an ax to grind with the principal.”

Dorn says the problem is often lack of training or the culture of a school.

“Sometimes the culture is, ‘We don’t want to offend anybody,’ ” he said. “They have not been taught to politely screen people in an effective manner. They just hit the buzzer.”

The message of Sandy Hook, Dorn said, is not to rush to spend lavishly on security extras but to take a look at potential gaps.

“It should not be a knee-jerk, big purchase but a thoughtful assessment of what school systems need and can afford,” he said.

For Sharon Burns, a first-grade teacher in Reston, Sandy Hook brought classroom doors into more urgent focus. Her elementary school, built in the “open classroom” era, was designed without individual room doors.

Burns had long wanted doors, she said, and the week after the Connecticut tragedy she collected 300 signatures on a petition. “I started thinking, what would I do with my 20 kids? Having that door could make all the difference,” she said.

Just after winter break, she learned the project had been approved. Officials say the last seven schools with an open design are getting doors, a $467,000 project. “I was so excited,” she said.

In D.C. schools, security is heavy, with guards at entrances, a buzzer system at most schools, and scanners for visitors at entrances to most middle and high schools. School leaders are working with the D.C. police to determine what else might be needed, officials said.

In Loudoun, all schools have buzzer entrance systems. Officials said the school system is reviewing all security practices, with plans to increase safeguards.

In Prince William, some schools have buzz-in systems, and processes are in place to monitor access, officials said. “We are, like everyone else, taking a hard look at our security arrangements, ” spokesman Phil Kavits said, “and seeing where they can be enhanced.”"

When asked for which one he would vote, McCain laughed and said: “It’s gonna be a tough choice.”

It is quite telling that McCain would say such a thing to the left-wing New Republic, especially after he seemed so outraged after the bungling and subsequent cover up surrounding the September 11 anniversary attacks on our consulate in Libya.

Whatever differences McCain and Paul might have over policy, four people were murdered on Hillary Clinton’s watch at the State Department, and her reaction to those trying to get to the bottom of it were famously met with Clinton screeching, “What difference does it make?”

Moreover, you would think Clinton’s indifference to repeated requests for increased security for our diplomatic team in Libya would border on something close to unforgivable for a former POW. Not to mention the fact no one in the administration even tried to rescue or reinforce a group of Americans under attack.

But we are undoubtedly in the middle of a changing of the guard in the GOP. The McCains, Roves, and Grahams see their time coming to an end, and in response they have, at times, launched nihilistic campaigns against the Tea Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, etc.

Rove runs to the New York Times to attack his own, McCain runs to the New Republic to slash away at one of our rising stars by giving The Grand Dame of Libya a credibility boost…

Seems that the mayors of the village are willing to burn it down rather than see themselves replaced.

Bush and Obama administrations, described a highly dysfunctional culture within the agency's Civil Rights Division that ""contributed to the appearance of politicization"" involving the division's enforcement decisions.

However, investigators determined that there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude"" that key decisions involving voting cases were based on race or partisan considerations.

More than two years in the making, the report comes as Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, chief of the agency's Civil Rights Division, is a likely nominee for Labor secretary.

Perez's conduct was not seriously faulted. His confirmation in 2009 came after key decisions were made about the handling of a voter intimidation case against members of the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) in Philadelphia.

That case focused on the actions of two black men, one of whom carried a nightstick outside a polling place on Election Day 2008. The bulk of the case, which included the New Black Panther Party chairman and the party organization, was dismissed during the Obama administration, prompting Republican lawmakers to call for the review.

""Critics of the decisions made in the NBPP case have alleged that the decision to dismiss … reflected hostility in the current administration to enforcing the voting rights laws on behalf of white victims or against black defendants,"" Horowitz said in the report. ""We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that (Justice officials) who approved the decision were so motivated.""

The report did document a ""disappointing lack of professionalism by some department employees over an extended period of time."" Investigators found a series of Internet postings by employees using pseudonyms that ""contained heated political and even racist commentary.""

""One used the expression 'po' Niggrahs' in describing a manager's attitude toward blacks,"" according to the report, which did not identify the employee. In another posting, an unidentified employee described the likely neighborhood of a conservative career attorney colleague as a place where ""everyone wears a white sheet, the darkies say 'yes'm' and equal rights for all are the real land of make believe.""

In a written response, Perez said steps have been taken to improve the ""atmosphere and professional culture within the voting rights section during the past several years.""

""The voting section is a far different place in 2013 than it was in 2005 or 2007,"" Perez said. ""Nonetheless, we acknowledge … that voting rights enforcement is a particularly important area in which to assure professionalism and integrity.""

Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., one of the lawmakers who called for the review, said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the report's findings.

""The report makes clear that the division has become a rat's nest of unacceptable and unprofessional actions,"" Wolf said."

SACRAMENTO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A group of Republican California lawmakers is breaking with their party's skepticism over immigration reform and asking the U.S. Congress to give immigrants a path to citizenship to help their state's heavy dependence on migrant labor for agriculture and construction.

Flanked by representatives of the state's agricultural, construction and restaurant industries, 16 Republican state senators and assembly members joined a national push to demand a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

""We're assembled today to call upon the House of Representatives to take immediate action to reform our broken immigration system,"" said State Senator Anthony Cannella, who represents Salinas and for years was a lone Republican voice in favor of reform. ""Congress must deal with immigration directly, and in a compassionate and practical manner.""

Cannella was one of 15 lawmakers who signed a letter released Thursday asking the state's Congressional delegation to ""act on reform this year to put this challenge behind us."" A sixteenth lawmaker, state Senator Andy Vidak of Bakersfield, sent his own letter.

A landmark immigration overhaul passed by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate in June includes a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants currently living illegally in the United States, but it faces scant chance of passage in its current form in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

The California lawmakers calling for an overhaul - who comprise nearly half of the Republican delegation to the state legislature - are pushing back against the party's national leaders for a variety of reasons. The state relies heavily on its agricultural, construction and hospitality businesses, all of which depend on immigrant labor.

The state's demographics also work against a highly conservative approach to immigration: A recent study showed that 7 percent of California's population, or about 2.6 million people, are living in the country illegally.

The California Republican party has suffered years of damage politically from prior efforts to crack down on illegal immigration to the state, including backing a 1994 ballot initiative that would have denied public education, health care and other services the undocumented.

Simply calling on Congress to pass reform would not erase all those years worth of mistrust and animosity, but it is the right thing to do, Cannella said.

'REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT YOU'

Republican State Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who represents parts of San Diego County, said he wanted to send Latinos the message that his party understands their concerns.

""To the Spanish speakers of California: Republicans care about you,"" Chavez said, before reading somewhat haltingly from a statement in Spanish.

Failing to address immigration reform would have economic implications as well as political ones, said Robert Lapsley, president of the Business Roundtable of California, who also spoke at the event.

""If we don't get this done, it's going to impact our entire economy,"" Lapsley said.

Throughout the nation in recent months, representatives of industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor have been lobbying Republican representatives to support reform.

In Minnesota, business executives have peppered Republican U.S. Representative John Kline with questions on immigration at several private events, said Bill Blazar, a vice president at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.

In Colorado, a group of six business executives who collectively donated nearly $500,000 to Republicans in the 2012 election wrote a letter in July to the state's four Republican House members last month urging them to support changes in immigration laws.

In Arizona, where state law requires police to question those they stop and suspect of being in the country illegally about their immigration status, business leaders have argued that a hard-line stance is not the political winner it once was.

In California, the farm, hospitality and construction businesses could not survive ""without the hard work and skill provided by immigrant communities,"" said State Senator Tom Berryhill, a fourth-generation farmer and the son of a former Secretary of Agriculture.

""For Congress to put off once again enacting a policy that allows a reasonable path to citizenship for a group of people that contribute so much to the California economy is just wrong,"" said Berryhill, who represents parts of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.

Pollak'],"Left Targets Cruz, Conservatives–but Case Against Hagel Stronger than Ever","Decrying yesterday’s filibuster of the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense, the White House and the media have decided to target his critics, especially Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Yet they should welcome the extension of debate, which provides an opportunity for Senators who once expressed concerns, such as Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to revisit their conclusions in light of new information.

The case for Hagel remains exceedingly weak. Some Democrats claim that he has the necessary qualifications to lead the Pentagon, but not even the Obama-friendly Politico supports that argument, noting Jan. 31 that Hagel’s main qualification was “politician.” Hagel’s supporters keep citing his admirable military record, but it is not a qualification for a primarily civilian post which requires an intimate knowledge of defense policy.

Hagel, by his own admission, does not know much about the Department of Defense. During his two terms in in the Senate, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. He has some broad views about how the country’s defenses ought to change, but these are shifting, and vague. He has argued both for and against defense cuts, for example, and does not understand the defense sequester.

The case against Hagel, on the other hand, grows stronger every day. From a left-wing point of view, his weaknesses were obvious from the start. He had expressed hostile views toward gays and supported “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He had led the fight to block climate change from moving through the Senate, and would now be stepping in to lead a Pentagon that has committed in recent years to the use of green fuels and technology.

Hagel also had subscribed to the slate of socially conservative views demonized by the Democrats as a “war on women,” such as opposition to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The Armed Services Committee also quietly examined criticisms about how Hagel had dealt with allegations of sexual harassment among members of his staff–a bad sign when the military is trying to stamp out such abuse.

For Democrats, an additional irritation was that Hagel’s nomination sent a signal that the party still lacked the self-confidence to run the Pentagon. As Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote in December:

Hagel is a Republican who voted for all of George W. Bush’s pet wars….And yes, while he has reneged on his past support for our nation’s disastrous wars, there are plenty of good qualified Democrats who weren’t idiotic enough to support them in the first place. It’s time for Democrats to embrace the fact that yes, they know what the hell they’re doing on matters of national security.

The only case for Hagel, from a left-wing perspective, was that the “neoconservatives”–i.e. those who favored a dominant military, an assertive foreign policy, and a strong U.S.-Israel alliance–were opposed to him. Hagel’s nomination offered the anti-war movement, especially its anti-Israel elements, a chance to shift the debate in their favor.

The Obama administration worked hard to prevent Democrats from defecting, sending Hagel to consult with Schumer and to write regretful letters to the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), expressing regret for having used such phrases such as “Jewish lobby” and reassuring her of his commitment to carry out President Barack Obama’s policies, with which his own previous views were in apparent conflict on a variety of subjects.

But the administration could not head off Republican queries, especially as more new information about Hagel’s past positions, much of it unearthed by the conservative new media, began to surface. Even the mainstream media began to take a skeptical view, with editorials opposing Hagel in both the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.

The principal worry was Hagel’s views on Iran. Not only had Hagel opposed the use of military force, if necessary, to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but he had also opposed the use of sanctions. He had also advocated “engaging” the Tehran regime, which to this day shows no interest in direct talks. Hagel’s appointment was therefore a sign of weakness in opposing Iran–the worst possible signal at the worst possible time.

Hagel’s views on Israel were also troubling–not least because of their implications for the American military. He had opposed designating Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a terror group, and advocated U.S. talks with Hamas in Gaza. He also denounced Israel’s war of self-defense against Hezbollah in 2006, calling it “disproportionate” and equating it with terror against Israeli civilians, undermining the basis of the U.S. war against terror.

Much controversy centered around Hagel’s use of the term “Jewish lobby,” a misnomer that implies Jewish control over U.S. foreign policy, and which was in vogue among the extreme left at the time as a scapegoat for the war in Iraq. Hagel now says that he misspoke, but new allegations that he claimed in 2007 that Israel controlled the U.S. State Department reinforce worries that he may have entertained antisemitic bias.

Perhaps the most self-destructive position Hagel had previously adopted was support for global nuclear disarmament, including the specific idea that the U.S. should begin to disarm unilaterally if necessary. In his confirmation hearing, Hagel attempted to deny that he had endorsed that view, but patient cross-examination by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) demonstrated that Hagel had, in fact, affixed his name to that radical suggestion.

The most recent nuclear test by North Korea, the ongoing atrocities by a Syrian regime that Hagel once suggested the U.S. should court, the continued belligerence of Iran and persistent terrorism by Hamas are all evidence that Hagel’s views on defense and foreign policy were naive at best, and dangerous at worst. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) also took Hagel to task for his strident opposition to the successful surge in Iraq.

In his confirmation hearing, Hagel not only failed to defend his views, but failed to show familiarity with the official policies of the administration he hoped to enter, mistakenly referring to a policy of “containment” with Iran and describing the Tehran regime as a “legitimate” government. Having failed to demonstrate that his recent shifts on several issues were sincere, he meekly asserted that his own views on policy would not matter.

The problem with Hagel’s performance at the hearing was not just that he stumbled, but that he dissembled, making a number of assertions that were shown to be untrue. Hagel also failed to provide more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given in previous years, and explained that he had “given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there.”

Yet in the days that followed, several speeches emerged about which Hagel had not informed the committee, including some within the five-year timeframe that members of the committee had requested. Hagel and the Obama administration maintained that these speeches had been “informal,” but the fact that Hagel spoke extemporaneously did not make the speeches any less official, as video of one such speech confirmed.

Hagel also refused to provide complete information about possible sources of possible foreign income over the past five years, particularly indirect compensation he may have received through organizations or funds with which he has been affiliated. The Atlantic Council, which he chairs, is known to have accepted large donations from the Hariri family, which is active in Lebanese politics and supportive of the Hamas organization.

After missing the deadline that Senators had imposed for disclosure, Hagel provided a list of foreign government and corporate donors to the Atlantic Council. He refused to provide additional information, saying he could not force other organizations to do the same. Democrats charged that Republicans were holding Hagel to an unprecedented standard; Republicans cited Democrats’ own demands that Henry Kissinger provide a list of his firm’s clients when he was nominated to the 9/11 commission, as well as the case of Hillary Clinton, who released a list of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation.

It was Hagel’s refusal to come clean–and his evident attempts to evade transparency–that ultimately united the Republican caucus in the Senate behind a filibuster, including some members who had initially expressed strong reservations about using the tactic.

The resulting delay will provide the Senate with several more days in which to consider Hagel’s candidacy, and for the White House to consider other options. The very fact that Hagel’s nomination has proved so divisive, and has exposed so many weaknesses in the nominee, is itself an argument for withdrawal. In a time of rising threats and looming budget challenges, the Pentagon will not be served by a perception of weak leadership.

Any one of the many factors above should, by itself, have disqualified Hagel from even being considered for the post. But President Obama has thrown out the rules many times before in his quest to transform America. Hagel is, in a sense, the Obamacare of Cabinet nominations: a deeply problematic policy choice that may have the votes to pass but lacks broad public support and may ultimately cost far more than advertised.

The Republican filibuster may hold; it may not. But if even a few Democrats make the right choice–the kind of well-considered choice made by moderate Sen Susan Collins (R-ME), for example–then Hagel’s nomination will collapse on the merits. If they are honest with themselves, Democrats must admit that they would not even think about confirming Hagel except for the fact that Obama has staked his political capital on it.

The left’s attacks on Sen. Cruz, on conservative media, and on pro-Israel activists may serve the president’s political interests. He relishes opportunities to paint the opposition as intransigent. Yet the Hagel nomination is a good example of why the filibuster is necessary as a restraint on the majority, a way to help it correct its mistakes before they become irrevocable. Obama and his party have one last chance to do the right thing."

President Obama says the U.S. will take military action against Syria, but only with Congress’s approval. (Sandi Moynihan/The Washington Post)

President Obama has put his and the nation’s credibility at stake with his call for congressional authorization to launch a military strike against Syria. But the coming debate also provides an early and important test for any Republican contemplating a campaign for the White House in 2016.

Whether serving in Congress or not, prospective GOP presidential candidates will be pressed to answer whether they agree with Obama about the need to retaliate militarily against Syria for its alleged chemical weapons attack and, if not, whether any response is required.

The answers to these and the other questions that will arise with regard to Syrian policy will begin to define areas of agreement and disagreement in a Republican Party whose foreign policy consensus has been frayed by a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the emergence of new voices within the party.

As others have learned from past debates about using military force, there are potentially serious political consequences later to the words said and votes taken now. None of these politicians can know now how their actions will be judged in two or three years. Inevitably, some will then find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion, whether among GOP primary voters or the electorate at large.

Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2002 vote as a senator to authorize the invasion of Iraq, which seemed relatively safe at the time, proved enormously costly when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Her support provided Obama, who had opposed the war, an opening to grass-roots liberal activists.

Grenada: Unilateral U.S. military action In October 1983, the United States led a military invasion of Grenada, a tiny Caribbean island nation, after a bloody coup ousted the government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who was assassinated. President Ronald Reagan was said to have been concerned about a 10,000-foot-long airstrip that the communist country's military was building, which he thought would enable planes loaded with arms from Cuba to reach insurgents in Central America. The administration was also concerned about the safety of 800 American medical students studying in Grenada. AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama’s stuttering week, in which he surprised his own advisers and the rest of the world by putting seemingly imminent military action on hold and calling for congressional approval, has focused renewed attention on his leadership — which is why he has so much to lose if he is rebuffed.

The coming debate in Congress will provide Obama with an opportunity not just to argue for a limited strike — a “shot across the bow” of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as he put it in an interview on PBS’s “NewsHour” last week — but also to provide greater clarity to the administration’s overall Syrian strategy.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry has been the administration’s most forceful advocate for retaliation over the alleged Aug. 21 sarin gas attack, as he demonstrated with a speech Friday and again Sunday while making the rounds of the morning talk shows, but that is a role rightly reserved for a president at moments like this. Obama’s Saturday statement in the Rose Garden presumably was a beginning, not an ending.

As Obama makes that case, how will Republicans, particularly those with presidential aspirations, respond? There are a variety of questions for them to answer. Do they support military action as retaliation for the recent attack? Do they accept the evidence of the use of chemical weapons or doubt U.S. and other intelligence findings? Do they think the limited military action under consideration would be insufficient and therefore unwise? If that is the case, what kind of military action do they favor? Do they oppose all military intervention in Syria? If so, what would an effective strategy be toward Syria?

There are other questions: Do the Republicans support the administration’s resolution as written, or would they advocate amending it? If they are critical of the administration’s general strategy on Syria, what approach would they recommend? What precedent do they think military action, or inaction, would set for future uses of chemical weapons by Assad or others?

The debate comes at a time of shifting sentiments and even role reversals. The Democratic Party was long saddled with criticism that its leaders were soft on defense. Republicans were the party of muscularity in foreign policy. Now, a president who won office in part by promising to end wars and who has been criticized for weak leadership by his political opponents is leading the call for military action, while Republicans, at least some, are hesitating.

Some Republicans may oppose the president simply because they are opposed to the president. But that does not constitute a foreign or national security policy. The Republican Party now is divided among those in the neoconservative wing who led the call for invading Iraq and who continue to argue in favor of more robust action in Syria; those in the libertarian wing who want the United States generally to stay out any conflicts; and those in the middle who see a need for U.S. leadership but are tempered by public weariness with war.

Fissures within the Republican coalition broke into public view this summer over the question of surveillance vs. civil liberties, sparked by the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) attacked Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and other libertarians for tilting too far in the direction of protecting civil liberties. Similar divisions are likely to be exposed in the coming debate between those who favor military action in Syria and those who do not.

So far, most of the prospective GOP candidates in Congress have resisted making any definitive statements about where they stand on the president’s latest move.

Paul praised the president for taking the issue to Congress, but on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday he said he thinks that “it’s a mistake to get involved in the Syrian civil war.” He added, “If Congress votes this down, we should not be involved in the Syrian war. And I think it’s at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down involvement in the Syrian war.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said military action “taken simply to send a message or save face” does not meet his standard of using military force only when there are “clear and attainable” national security goals. He also wrote last week that failing to act would “further embolden Assad . . . leaving the impression that the United States is feckless and weak.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said he was glad Obama listened to calls from Republicans and Democrats to put the issue before Congress, but he offered no signal about the substance of the case. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, has been silent, as have other prospective candidates who are not serving in Congress but are eyeing 2016 campaigns.

Prudence argues for careful statements as Congress remains in recess. But in putting his own presidency at stake by calling for a congressional debate about the use of force, Obama has put Republicans on notice that they too must declare exactly where they stand.

During his 2000 presidential run, a New Hampshire voter asked Republican Sen. John McCain who he might choose as secretary of defense.

McCain responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague, the very man who would be nominated to that post by a Democrat and frequent McCain target 13 years later.

“There’s a lot of people that could do that,” he told voters at a January town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire. “One of ‘em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel.”

Now Hagel has been nominated for that same job, by McCain’s 2008 campaign rival, President Barack Obama. But when the Senate Armed Services Committee meets on Thursday to discuss the nomination, McCain will be one of Hagel’s biggest skeptics.

What Hagel will say Thursday

“My biggest concern is his overall attitude about the United States, our role in the world – particularly in the Middle East and whether we should reduce the Pentagon further – but mainly his general overall world view,” McCain told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer about his former colleague.

To understand the depth of the fallout between the two men one needs to understand how close the senators once were.

McCain loaned his star power to Hagel’s first Senate campaign in 1996, traveling to appear with him in Nebraska.

When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam. In 1997 they attended a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

Speaking about his comrades in arms, McCain mentioned the “unique bond that exists between us of which I am eternally proud.”

“When I see them on the floor of the Senate or somewhere in the Capitol, I feel a little lift,” he said.

Hagel spoke of McCain’s service, declaring “no one during this entire time ever gave more, or showed more courage, than John McCain.”

Five things Hagel may be asked about

Their friendship led to a close working relationship during the 2000 presidential campaign, when Hagel served as a loyal surrogate and campaign co-chair for McCain.

Then, Hagel said his friend felt he owed the country his service. “His life has been committed to something larger than he is,” Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush. “He’s a selfless person who’s given much to his country.”

Later that year, Hagel introduced McCain on the stage of the party’s convention with a giant embrace.

Back in the Senate, the long-time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the Iraq war.

But their views diverged as McCain came to support President Bush’s proposed troop surge in 2007, a military decision that drew Hagel’s scorn. He famously called the proposal “the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam if it is carried out.”

Why some conservatives are still going after Hagel

A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences. But even McCain acknowledged the change.

“I’ve noticed over the years that our views on the United States of America and what we should be doing in the world have diverged rather dramatically,” he said earlier this month.

By McCain’s 2008 presidential run, Hagel was more in line with McCain’s anti-Iraq war opponent Barack Obama.

The two traveled together on a Middle East Senate trip Obama used to beef up his foreign policy chops, and Hagel was never seen on McCain’s iconic Straight Talk Express campaign bus.

Avlon: Reality check for Hagel bashers

Hagel and McCain spoke after the former senator’s nomination to the Defense Department. Afterward, McCain said he had concerns about Hagel’s positions on Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.

“Sen. Hagel and I are, are old friends and we had a very frank and candid conversation and I’ll be looking forward to the hearing and asking questions,” McCain said on January 22. “I think that he should be given the opportunity of a hearing before any of us make a judgment.”

USA TODAY

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says he'll block a vote on President Obama's nominees until the White House provides more information about the survivors of last year's deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya.

Graham, a vocal critic of what happened at Benghazi, posted on Twitter that he'll block ""every appointment"" from getting a vote in the U.S. Senate.

Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Graham's threat comes a day after CBS' 60 Minutes aired a report that included an eyewitness account from a former British soldier.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said all presidential nominees should move through the Senate process ""expeditiously,"" and noted the Obama administration has cooperated with seven congressional committees looking into Benghazi.

While declining to call out Graham directly, Carney said too many Republicans are ""playing politics"" with the deadly attack. ""I think in general that has been the case,"" Carney said. ""It's unfortunate to hold up any nominee.""

It's not uncommon for senators to place a ""hold"" on a presidential nominee to extract information on another issue or topic. Ultimately 99% of presidential appointees are confirmed by the Senate, according to a Congressional Research Service report released earlier this year.

There are several judges awaiting a Senate vote on confirmation as well key deputies at the Defense, Interior and Energy Departments and members of the Federal Communications Commission. A lengthy delay by Graham could also affect two of Obama's high-profile nominees — Janet Yellen at the Federal Reserve Board and Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security — who are awaiting their confirmation hearings.

Graham's opposition will not affect the nomination of Richard Griffin to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Griffin's nomination, which has long been opposed by Republicans, will be voted on later Monday as scheduled.

Washington (CNN) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would be ""disappointed"" in the American electorate if Hillary Clinton becomes a serious candidate for president in 2016.

The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee argued Clinton would not be right for the role as commander in chief after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, died last year in a terrorist attack against a U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

""If (Benghazi) doesn't have an impact on the 2016 presidential election, if she is a candidate, then America, I am very disappointed in our electorate,"" Palin said Sunday on Fox News, where she's a contributor.

She said ""anyone who would just throw away 200 years of military ethos and leave our men behind to be murdered"" should ""never be considered as a commander in chief.""

The lack of security at the consulate and the September 11, 2012 attack are poised to be a major point of contention by Republicans if Clinton decides to run for president. Clinton ultimately took responsibility for diplomats' safety, and was grilled before two congressional committees in January.

At one point she lost her temper while responding to questions from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin. He was asking her about the erroneous, initial talking points that claimed the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, though the administration later defined it as a terrorist attack and said a protest never happened.

""What difference at this point does it make?"" Clinton responded. ""It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.""

The attack on Benghazi is still a matter of congressional investigation by House Republicans.

""That's why I'm so grateful for Congress to be pursuing what happened in Benghazi,"" Palin said. ""Because at this point, it still makes a difference what happens in Benghazi.""

""Anyone who doesn't understand that and dismisses it as being indifferent, they should not be our commander in chief,"" she continued.

For her part, Clinton said in a recent interview with New York Magazine that she is in no hurry to decide about a potential 2016 bid for the White House, saying it is a decision ""not to be made lightly.""

Asked how she plans to combat any conflicts she may face related to her political legacy, she said the best course is to ""find common ground.""

""I have a lot of reason to believe, as we saw in the 2012 election, most Americans don't agree with the extremists on any side of an issue,"" Clinton said in the interview. ""But there needs to continue to be an effort to find common ground, or even take it to higher ground on behalf of the future.""

Palin's comments mark a stark contrast to high praise Clinton received Sunday from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said if Clinton decides to run, ""she will win.""

""And when she becomes president, she'll be one of the best-equipped, best-prepared people to enter the White House in a very long time,"" Pelosi said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Noting Clinton's experience as secretary of state, as a U.S. senator from New York and as a first lady, Pelosi said Clinton would be ""more prepared than President Obama; certainly more prepared than President Bush; certainly more prepared than President Clinton I might admit."""

Bush said when asked about Obama Jimmy Carter hasn't adhered to the rule and regularly critiques Democrats and Republicans Dwight Eisenhower is considered the gold standard for working with a successor

(CNN) —

In President Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns, his predecessor loomed large; Obama and Democrats regularly laid the blame for the downtrodden economy at George W. Bush’s feet.

When pressed on their pledge to turn the faltering economy around, Obama and Democrats often pointed out that they had inherited the product of the Bush administration’s policies.

Bush, however, in his limited public appearances has stayed mute about his successor, maintaining a custom among former presidents that dates back decades. While not all presidents have adhered to the practice, it has created a mostly amicable brotherhood of former presidents.

“George W. Bush is a traditionalist,” CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. “I think he holds to an old-fashioned standard that the presidency is one of the world’s greatest fraternities and its members don’t criticize each other.”

After leaving the White House, Bush made it clear that he was finished with the public stage. Although he has been more public since his presidential library opened in April, Bush has maintained that he will not criticize Obama.

“I don’t think it does any good,” Bush said Monday in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Robyn Curnow in Zambia, where he was helping to renovate a women’s clinic. “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult. A former president doesn’t need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that’s mine.”

Bush’s new mission: Helping those with the least

In “The Presidents Club,” a book by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy about the fraternity, a Bush adviser says the most the former president will say about Obama’s decisions is, “Well, I might have done it differently.”

In public, though, Bush has refused to comment on Obama.

“He deserves my silence,” Bush said in a March 2009 speech. “There’s plenty of critics in the arena. I think it’s time for the ex-president to tap dance off the stage and let the current president have a go at solving the world’s problems.”

CNN Exclusive: George W. Bush interview

Unexpected friendships

Gergen said he feels Bush’s silence about Obama stems from how Bush was treated in his last few years in office.

“There was a sense among the Bush people that a lot of this criticism was gratuitous and ill-informed and painful,” Gergen said. That could be “part of his staying away from issues with Obama.”

When you are president, there are literally only a handful of people in the world who can relate to the pressure, the commitment, the arduous decision making. This unique understanding has led many presidents to rely on one another after leaving office.

Former, current presidents on George W. Bush

Some of these relationships have led to unexpected political friendships.

Despite the fact they faced off in the 1992 presidential election, the relationship of Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush has been described as father-and-son-like. They are so close that Clinton joked at the opening of George W. Bush’s library that he “had become the black sheep son” of the Bush family.

He even jokingly referred to former first lady Barbara Bush as his “mother.”

Other presidential relationships have been similarly close. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, opponents in the 1976 election, grew close in their retirement and worked together on a number of international issues.

President Harry Truman also befriended a predecessor, Herbert Hoover. After working together to restructure the executive branch, Truman called Hoover “the best man that I know of” and an appreciative Hoover wrote Truman to say, “For all of this and your friendship, I am deeply grateful.”

Most former presidents look better through history’s eyes

Gergen, who served in the White House in four administrations, said that once in the Oval Office you appreciate the “continuity of the office.”

“You form part of a chain and each link is important. You almost have a sacred responsibility to keep the office strong,” he said.

Breaking the club’s rules

Not all former presidents have held their tongue.

Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served one term in office, has a history of biting criticism of those who followed him in the White House.

In 2007, Carter delivered a blistering critique of the Bush administration, telling the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration has been the worst in history.”

Carter hasn’t directed his criticism only at Republicans, though. In a February 2013 speech, he faulted the Obama administration for its dealings with North Korea and Iran.

“Our country is now looked upon as the foremost warlike nation on Earth, and there is almost a complete dearth now of commitment of America to negotiate differences with others,” Carter said.

And throughout much of Clinton’s presidency, Carter was a Democratic agitator. He embarked on his own foreign policy projects, at times at direct odds with the White House, and after Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Carter questioned Clinton’s morals.

Even after Clinton left office, Carter continued to criticize.

In February 2001, a month after the Clinton presidency had ended, Carter said Clinton’s last-minute pardon of Marc Rich was a “most serious mistake” and even alleged that the reason Rich was pardoned was donations that Rich had made.

“I don’t think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts,” Carter said. “In my opinion, that was disgraceful.”

But Carter has been the exception, not the rule. While some presidents have stepped out and criticized during the heat of a political campaign, it is a rare occurrence.

“Carter puts issues ahead of fraternity and will often speak out about things,” Gergen said. “I think it is part of his nature. Maybe being a one-term president changes your view.”

’Little Boy Blue’ and the Bay of Pigs

Dwight Eisenhower is by most accounts the gold standard for how to deal with other presidents.

Eisenhower chewed out his successor, John F. Kennedy, in private for the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, but publicly offered him a level of support.

Kennedy had been in office for just three months when he called for a meeting with Eisenhower in April 1961 after the attempt to topple the young Castro regime in Cuba was a massive failure. The operation had originated before Eisenhower left office and Kennedy’s administration had carried it out.

The Kennedy-Eisenhower relationship had been frosty. Eisenhower had long viewed Kennedy as naive and young – he referred to Kennedy as “Little Boy Blue” in private – and Kennedy had disparaged the Eisenhower administration in his 1960 presidential campaign.

The two put their chilly relationship aside, however, and Kennedy invited the former general to Camp David to review the mistakes in Cuba.

According to Eisenhower’s notes from the meeting and a number of media reports, the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises:

Kennedy: “No one knows how tough this job is until he’s been in it a few months.”

Eisenhower: “Mr. President. If you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago.”

After the meeting, Eisenhower stood in front of television cameras and said, “I am all in favor of the United States supporting the man who has to carry the responsibility for our foreign affairs.”

In “The Presidents Club,” Gibbs and Duffy write that despite the fact that all of these men have risen to the highest level of their profession, they not only work better together, but they need one another.

“There is no fraternity like it anywhere, and not just because of the barriers to entry of the privilege of membership,” they write. “For all of the club’s self-serving habits and instincts, when it is functioning at its best, it can serve the president, help solve his problems and the nation’s, and even save lives.”"

Chuck Hagel to head the Defense Department, the Left is struggling with Obama’s decision to nominate John Brennan as the new CIA Director. Dubbed the “Assassination Czar” by the far-left program Democracy Now, Brennan was Obama’s original choice to head the CIA when he was first elected in 2008. An uproar from the left, however, caused Brennan to withdraw his nomination. With reelection safely behind him, though, Obama clearly feels emboldened to push again for Brennan.

The left’s ire was particularly acute four years ago, because Brennan had been a high-level CIA official during the Bush Administration. At the time, the left was consumed with moral urgency to reverse many Bush anti-terror policies. Brennan was seen as a key player in the development of those policies.

Brennan spent years at the CIA and served as chief of staff to former director George Tenet during the creation of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer described him as a “supporter” of the programs, which included torture and the use of secret prison “black sites.”

After he withdrew his name for consideration for the CIA job, Brennan was appointed by Obama to be his chief counter-terrorism advisor. In that role, he has overseen a sweeping expansion of the drone program and adoption of a “kill list,” where the President can order targeted assassinations of terrorists.

Brennan has helped construct and justify the Administration’s claim that it can kill people, including American citizens, abroad on its own authority, even when those people are not in countries with which we are at war. His speech in April was a sort of catechism, culminating in “targeted strikes are wise.” We have done it in Pakistan and Yemen; could we do it in London or Paris?

In the aftermath of Brennan’s nomination yesterday, the ACLU cautioned the Senate not to proceed with confirmation “until it assesses the legality of his actions in past leadership positions in the CIA during the early years of the George W. Bush administration and in his current role in the ongoing targeted killing program”. ACLU’s statement is telling, since the organization doesn’t usually take positions on nominees for the executive branch.

Obama’s decision to forge ahead with Brennan’s nomination suggests he feels he has a personal political mandate following his reelection. Brennan’s legacy hasn’t changed in the four years since his name was first floated as CIA Director. If anything, the civil libertarian critique of his record has strengthened, given the increased use of drone strikes and targeted assassinations.

Obama understands, however, that much of the left’s outrage directed against Bush wasn’t as much about his specific policies as his political affiliation. Obama has continued most of the Bush-era anti-terror policies, as even staunch leftists now wearily acknowledge.

Although I actively opposed Brennan’s CIA nomination in 2008, I can’t quite muster the energy or commitment to do so now. Indeed, the very idea that someone should be disqualified from service in the Obama administration because of involvement in and support for extremist Bush terrorism polices seems quaint and obsolete, given the great continuity between Bush and Obama on these issues. Whereas in 2008 it seemed uncertain in which direction Obama would go, making it important who wielded influence, that issue is now settled: Brennan is merely a symptom of Obama’s own extremism in these areas, not a cause. This continuity will continue with or without Brennan because they are, rather obviously, Obama’s preferred policies.

A tiredness usually settles in during a President’s second term. Even the left gets weary of its moral outrage. While the usual suspects are expressing outrage over Brennan’s nomination, his confirmation fight will likely end with a whimper. As Greenwald notes, these are “obviously Obama’s preferred policies.”"

Job approval ratings for the former senator and first lady are at stratospheric levels, suggesting that her four years as chief U.S. diplomat could be an important asset if she runs for president in 2016.

But scholars and diplomatic insiders say she has never dominated issues of war and peace in the manner of predecessors Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger, or laid down an enduring diplomatic doctrine.

President Obama has tightly controlled foreign policy in the last four years — more so even than his recent predecessors. Clinton has had a seat at the table on every key issue, officials say, but she did not “own” any of them.

She devoted long hours to signatures issues, including empowerment of women and girls, gay rights, Third World development, health and Internet freedoms. Clinton lent her support to a wide range of new projects and organizations, and she appointed new officials in the State Department to shepherd them. Some of these may eventually have huge effects, but many are at an early stage.

At the same time, the most important and toughest foreign policy issues of the day — Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan-Pakistan, the Arab-Israeli standoff — weren’t resolved during the four years. Some grew more intractable. Though none of that may be Clinton’s fault, the lack of diplomatic breakthroughs on her watch limits her legacy.

“She’s coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime U.S. peace negotiator who is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “But you can’t say that she’s really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy.”

Expectations ran high that Clinton would be a heavyweight — maybe even a “co-president” on foreign policy — from the time Obama picked his bitter rival in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign to take the Cabinet’s senior spot. She had star power from 20 years in national life that dazzled foreign audiences and guaranteed worldwide attention to whatever issue she focused on.

“She’s the first secretary who’s also been a global rock star,” said a senior State Department official who was not authorized to be quoted by name. “It’s allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do.”

Obama praised her performance Sunday in a joint interview with Clinton that he proposed to CBS’ “60 Minutes.” Obama described her as “one of our finest” secretaries of State and one of his most important advisors on a range of issues, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Al Qaeda.

In the interview, Clinton brushed aside questions about her future in politics and pronounced her health as good — although she said she had some “lingering effects” from a concussion she suffered in December when she fainted and hit her head after suffering from a virus that left her dehydrated. The concussion led to a blood clot behind her right ear, for which she was hospitalized.

“The doctors tell me that will all recede,” she said, referring to the continued symptoms. “And so, thankfully, I’m looking forward to being at full speed.”

As secretary of State, Clinton has shared Obama’s democratic take on the proper role of American diplomats, believing that the world is no longer a place where a handful of powers can dictate the terms of the world order. Rather, the job of U.S. diplomats is collaborating with dozens of other countries in the “constant gardening and tending” of institutions and projects that advance common goals, the senior State Department official said.

Foreign audiences warmed to this attitude, which they found appealing after eight years of a George W. Bush administration many associated with a go-it-alone approach. As they did, the American image abroad improved.

At the same time, Clinton quickly removed a potential internal stumbling block, insisting on no infighting between her loyalists at the State Department and Obama’s team. Former President Bill Clinton’s kibitzing on foreign policy never became the problem some had predicted.

A hard worker and team player, Clinton won praise from many in Obama’s circle who had initially doubted her.

But as time passed, it became clear that she wouldn’t have the lead role on key issues of war and peace.

Clinton’s original plan was to have three powerful “special envoys” in charge of key security issues and reporting to her — a flow chart that would have enabled her to tightly control the biggest security issues.

But Richard C. Holbrooke, in charge of the Afghanistan-Pakistan militant threat, was marginalized after clashing with White House officials. Former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell resigned in May 2011 after the painful collapse of the administration’s opening Middle East peace initiative; and diplomat Dennis Ross, the envoy for Iran, moved to the White House in June 2009 to better help manage the range of Mideast problems that were bubbling over.

“She was a fully functioning member of the team,” said a former administration official, who asked to remain anonymous speaking about a former colleague. “But not a first among equals.”

“If you go down the line, it’s tough to see what’s happened in world politics over the last four years that wouldn’t have happened without her,” the official said. “So it’s tough to see how she gets into that category of truly great, transformational secretaries, like Acheson and [George] Marshall,” who presided over U.S. foreign policy in the years after World War II.

On Libya, for example, Clinton helped persuade Obama to support a NATO military intervention in March 2011. But her voice was one of several, including those of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; Samantha Power, a human rights advocate at the White House; and a group of younger staffers at the National Security Council.

Clinton decided in February 2011 that the United States needed to urge its longtime ally, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, to leave office after weeks of angry “Arab Spring” demonstrations against him. But again, she was one of a crowd: Other members of the foreign policy team took the same view.

Key decisions on another top security threat, Iran’s nuclear program, were made largely by Obama and the White House inner circle. Clinton ably led administration efforts to round up international support for economic sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to accept curbs on the nuclear program.

Advertisement

Through most of the four years, she seemed immune to criticism. The most notable exception came near the end, with the death of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Although Clinton said she took responsibility for security weaknesses there, Republican criticism largely focused not on her, but on Rice, who had appeared on a Sunday morning talk show a few days after the killings to defend the administration’s handling of the matter.

Rice’s appearance helped sink her chances to succeed Clinton at the State Department. Clinton, who had stayed away from the talk show circuit, saw her approval rating remain about 70% — an all-time high.

Advertisement

Similarly, although Clinton has been the administration’s point person on the Syrian civil war and the becalmed Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, criticism of administration efforts on those have rarely found their way to her.

Walter Russell Mead, a foreign policy specialist and historian with the Council on Foreign Relations, said Clinton was like James A. Baker III, secretary of State to President George H.W. Bush, in her ability to avoid association with the administration’s perceived failures.

“Trouble was always where Baker wasn’t,” he said.

Despite the glow, however, there have been limits to her impact.

Advertisement

Issues of global poverty or the plight of women “showed limited movement due to any idea of hers while secretary of State,” Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution foreign policy and defense analyst, wrote in a recent evaluation.

“Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved,” he wrote. Clinton, he added, has been “more solid than spectacular.”

Comey, a former senior Justice Department official who famously challenged warrantless eavesdropping under President George W. Bush, to replace Robert S. Mueller III as director of the FBI, officials said Wednesday.

For the Obama White House, Comey’s Republican credentials and record as a federal prosecutor made him an appealing candidate for the nation’s top law enforcement job. By tradition, the FBI director is considered nonpartisan.

The White House will seek to win Senate confirmation for Comey, 52, before the August congressional recess, though it is uncertain exactly when he will be nominated, according to officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mueller, who has served as FBI chief since 2001, is set to retire in September.

It was unclear whether Comey’s chances of confirmation will be affected by his dramatic history in the Bush administration. Comey threatened to resign as deputy attorney general rather than consent to secret surveillance of telephone calls by the National Security Agency. Bush had authorized the effort after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but the Justice Department had determined the program was illegal.

If the program were to continue, the department needed to certify its legality. In March 2004, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft lay in the hospital, critically ill. Comey, the acting attorney general, refused to certify the program. As Comey would later tell the Senate Judiciary Committee, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. and White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales tried to go around him.

When Comey learned that Card and Gonzales were en route to the hospital, he rushed to Ashcroft’s room, arriving before them. Card and Gonzales tried to persuade Ashcroft to authorize the program’s extension. He refused and told them Comey was in charge.

Bush subsequently agreed to change the program to satisfy Comey’s objections. The incident helped cement Comey’s reputation as a principled lawyer who would not bend the law to please his superiors in the White House.

During Comey’s two years as second-in-command at the Justice Department, he ran day-to-day operations and won credit for seeking to shield U.S. attorneys around the country from political pressure. But he made powerful enemies.

In December 2003, he took the lead role in appointing Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago and a close friend, as a special prosecutor to pursue the CIA leak investigation that ensnared I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.

Libby ultimately was convicted of four felony counts and sentenced to 30 months in prison, although Bush later commuted the sentence.

That investigation put a cloud over the Bush White House, and ended any possibility that Comey would be named attorney general when Ashcroft retired in early 2005. Gonzales got the job instead.

Comey left that August to become senior vice president and general counsel of Lockheed Martin Corp., the aerospace and defense giant. More recently, he worked in private practice and taught at Columbia Law School, although he occasionally emerged in the public eye.

In February, Comey signed onto a Supreme Court brief with more than 100 former Republican officials and lawmakers to support the right to gay marriage in California’s Proposition 8 case.

And in June 2011, Comey had urged a Senate committee to extend Mueller’s FBI tenure because America faced “an unusual and unique threat environment” after the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden the month before in Pakistan, and with the looming 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

“I don’t think there’s ever a great time to change FBI directors, because something is always lost in a transition,” Comey testified. “But I think there are bad and even potentially dangerous times to change an FBI director, and I think this is one of them.”

FBI and Justice Department officials said Comey and Lisa Monaco, now the White House counter-terrorism advisor, were interviewed in April about the FBI director’s job and were the two top candidates.

Comey was born in Yonkers, N.Y., and grew up in Allendale, N.J. He graduated from the College of William & Mary in Virginia, and earned his law degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985.

After a stint as a law clerk for a federal judge in Manhattan, Comey was hired as a federal prosecutor in 1987 by then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York, and later took a similar post in Richmond, Va.

He got President Bush’s attention for his work on the 1996 terrorist bombing at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. Air Force personnel. The case had stalled and then-FBI Director Louis J. Freeh got Ashcroft to transfer it to Comey, who quickly obtained an indictment of 14 suspects.

In January 2002, Bush appointed him the top federal prosecutor in New York, where he brought criminal charges against lifestyle business magnate Martha Stewart, as well as mobsters, Wall Street tycoons and gun-toting thugs. Ashcroft brought him to Washington in December 2003 to be his top deputy.

The FBI has changed dramatically since Mueller assumed the job a week before the Sept. 11 attacks. Detecting and preventing terrorist attacks became the bureau’s chief mission for the first time.

FBI agents foiled numerous plots and arrested hundreds of would-be terrorists for planning strikes within the nation’s borders. But several potentially catastrophic attacks, including attempts to take down passenger jets and to bomb New York’s Times Square, failed only because the bombs malfunctioned, not because the FBI had detected the plots.

The lucky streak seemed to run out on April 15, when two homemade bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon, the first successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 2001. The blasts killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

Lindsey Graham reiterated his pledge to block all of Obama’s nominees for executive branch positions until Congress is allowed to hear testimony from those on the ground during the Benghazi terrorist attacks in 2012.

“I shouldn’t have to do this – to make these threats,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Graham says there are still too many unanswered questions about the Sept. 11 attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

While there have been a number of Capitol Hill hearings on the deadly attack in Benghazi, Graham is among a group of lawmakers who say they aren’t satisfied with the information provided and want more.

“I don’t think it’s over the top to find out what happened to four dead Americans,” he said. “I don't think it’s over the top to talk to survivors. The State Department interviewed these survivors.”

Along with Ambassador Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed in the attack.

Graham has been asking for the FBI’s transcripts of interviews with State Department and CIA survivors who were evacuated to Germany after the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate.

In an Oct. 28 letter Graham, the State Department’s Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, Julia Frifield, referred to ""significant risks"" and ""serious concerns about having the survivors of the attack submit to additional interviews.""

Graham and other Republicans believe the transcripts will show the survivors told the FBI it was a terrorist attack and made no mention of a video or anti-U.S. demonstration at the consulate.

“So I’m going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,” he said.

Graham also called on fellow lawmakers in Washington for help.

“The only way this will work is if my GOP colleagues get behind me and Democrats too and support my request to find out exactly what happened,” he said."

Wald']",Divisive Debate on Need for More Nuclear Safeguards,"Many of these lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have received significant campaign contributions from the industry. For instance, Mr. Barrow’s top contributor in the 2012 election was the Southern Company, a Georgia-based utility that is a major player in nuclear power. Some of the lawmakers also have nuclear reactors in their districts, a major source of tax revenue and jobs.

The appointment books for certain commission members, reviewed by The New York Times, show frequent meetings with the industry, including private sessions at the commission’s headquarters. Nuclear industry opponents occasionally have had their own private meetings, but not nearly as often, the records show.

E-mails obtained by The Times also demonstrate the teamlike approach taken by the industry and the regulators in dealing with safety questions, as they have worked behind the scenes with the Nuclear Energy Institute, the leading trade association, to try to prevent a reaction against nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident.

“It would be nice if the industry was even more proactive by having N.E.I. send us a letter that says something to the effect that in the wake of the Japanese disaster here is a list of all the things the commercial U.S. nuclear licensees are doing,” wrote Brian Sheron, the head of nuclear regulatory research at the regulatory commission, in an e-mail to his colleagues, referring to the Nuclear Energy Institute.

Mr. Sheron, in a statement, said he was prodding the industry, not trying to protect it, as he realizes the “industry never seems to want to aggressively get out in front of issues.” Since the accident in Japan, American regulators have imposed several mandates on the industry but none are likely to cost the industry much money, industry officials said.

The filtered vent proposal, by far the most expensive, would be required only on boiling water reactors like Nine Mile Point, which are considered much more prone to leaking during an accident because they have unusually small primary containment chambers and pressure can build quickly.

But how well the filters work is unclear because the vents to which they would be attached have never been used successfully in an accident at a modern commercial reactor, experts said. The vents failed at Fukushima, which would have rendered filters moot. A panel of independent senior advisers to the commission opposes a strict requirement for filters."

The inquiry, disclosed by a senior Pentagon official, comes amid questions about how the gunman, Aaron Alexis, was able to obtain and keep a security clearance despite a record that included numerous disciplinary infractions while in the Navy; three arrests over the last decade, two of which involved guns; and mental health problems for which he sought treatment at a veterans healthcare facility, according to law enforcement officials.

Hagel’s review will examine access given to contractors and other non-military personnel, among other issues, the Pentagon official said. The review is expected to be announced officially Wednesday.

The firm for which Alexis worked, The Experts, based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., said in a statement Tuesday that he had been employed by the company for approximately six months over the last year.

WHO THEY WERE: Navy Yard shooting victims

The firm hired another company to do two background checks on him, “and we confirmed twice” with the Defense Department that he held a security clearance at the secret level, the statement said.

“The latest background check and security clearance confirmation were in late June of 2013 and revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation,” the statement said.

“To my knowledge we were never made aware of any criminal or health issues,” said Thomas E. Hoshko, chief executive of The Experts. “I have more questions than you, and I am working to find out what can be done to improve security on bases, as well as the security process.”

A secret level clearance is relatively low-level, below top secret level and even higher clearances. But it is sufficient to gain unescorted access to most military facilities.

The OCS Web site says its mission is to “train, screen and evaluate candidates, who must demonstrate a high level of leadership potential and commitment to success in order to earn a commission.”

The school breaks down into three components: leadership, academics and physical training.

At the beginning of training, candidates take a physical fitness test including a 3-mile run, pull-ups and crunches. The minimum requirements, according to the OCS, are 8 pull-ups, 70 crunches and a 3-mile run in 24 minutes for men; and 50 flexed arm hangs, 70 crunches and a 3-mile run in 27 minutes for women.

The OCS site says candidates complete hikes of up to 12 miles in full combat gear and train in obstacle courses and combat conditioning.

In 1997, OCS added the Crucible, a grueling 60-hour training session where sleep-deprived candidates march extremely long distances, the Washington Post has previously reported.

The academic topics covered include land navigation, maneuver tactics and general orders, as well as history, traditions, operations and organization of the Marine Corps, the OCS says.

USA TODAY

Officials have identified seven of the 12 victims in Monday's fatal shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard.

They are, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

Details about their lives are beginning to emerge.

None of the victims have been identified as active-duty military personnel, officials said.

Officials still need to notify the loved ones of the five remaining victims.

An additional victim was identified by the Washington Post as Arthur Daniels, 51.

Michael Arnold's uncle, Steven Hunter, told the Associated Press that his nephew was an avid pilot who was building a light airplane at his home. ""It would have been the first plane he ever owned,"" Hunter told the AP in a telephone interview from Rochester, Mich., Arnold's hometown. ""It's partially assembled in his basement.""

According to the AP, citing a LinkedIn profile in her name, Sylvia Frasier had worked at Naval Sea Systems Command as an information assurance manager since 2000.

Frasier studied at Strayer University, earning a bachelor of science in computer information systems in 2000 and a master's in information systems in 2002. Her duties at NAVSEA included providing policy and guidance on network security, and assuring that all computer systems operated by the headquarters met Department of Navy and Department of Defense requirements.

Kathy Gaarde, a financial analyst from Woodbridge, Va, was a Washington Capitals fan, and devoted wife and mother of two, neighbor and friend Patrick Bolton told the Post.

""The mother was just the kindest lady in the world,"" Bolton told the news organization. ""I've never seen her do anything but nice things for people.""

Gaarde's husband, Douglass, wrote an email to the AP early Tuesday. ""Today my life partner of 42 years (38 of them married) was taken from me, my grown son and daughter, and friends,"" he wrote. ""We were just starting to plan our retirement activities and now none of that matters. It hasn't fully sunk in yet but I know I already dearly miss her.""

No information was immediately available for John Roger Johnson.

A neighbor of Frank Kohler's in St. Mary's County, Md., on the Chesapeake Bay, told the Post Kohler was married with two daughters.

Kenneth Proctor worked as a civilian utilities foreman at the Navy Yard, his ex-wife, Evelyn Proctor, told the AP. He spent 22 years working for the federal government, Evelyn Proctor said.

""He just went in there in the morning for breakfast,"" she told the AP, speaking Monday of the building where the shooting took place. ""He didn't even work in the building. It was a routine thing for him to go there in the morning for breakfast, and unfortunately it happened.""

Online records identified a Vishnu Pandit in his 60s living in North Potomac, Md. A person who answered the telephone at the address said, ""Please tell your colleagues not to call.""

Neighbor Mike Honig told the Post that Pandit was ""a very nice man with an Irish setter.""

The Navy established two telephone numbers for families to call for information about their loved ones: (202) 433-6151 and (202) 433-9713.

President Obama refers to Boston bombing as an act of terrorism

Obama says agents don%27t know who carried out the attack or why

The FBI and other agencies briefed Obama on Tuesday

President Obama, who declared the Boston Marathon bombings ""an act of terror"" on Tuesday, will visit the city on Thursday to attend a memorial service for the victims and survivors.

Obama plans to make remarks ""at an interfaith service dedicated to those who were gravely wounded or killed in Monday's bombing,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

The announcement came hours after Obama said the FBI is investigating the Boston Marathon bombings as an ""act of terrorism,"" but that the perpetrators and motives remain a mystery.

""What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack or why,"" Obama said during brief remarks at the White House. ""Whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.""

The president said ""clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation,"" but he said investigators will learn what happened and why: ""We will find whoever harmed our citizens, and we will bring them to justice.""

Obama, who had held off using the term ""terrorism"" in brief remarks on Monday night, spoke again Tuesday morning after being briefed by FBI Director Robert Mueller and other officials about what he called a ""heinous and cowardly"" crime.

""Given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism,"" Obama said. ""Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.""

In addition to Mueller, the president was briefed by Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and White House counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco.

FULL TEXT: President Obama's remarks

During the conference, Obama heard about the FBI's ""close coordination with state and local law enforcement in Boston,"" as well as the Department of Homeland Security's work with ""state and local partners across the country to share information, including any additional security steps state and local law enforcement may take,"" according to a White House readout.

The Boston bombing killed at least three people and injured more than 170 others.

""Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston,"" Obama said, pointing out that the death toll includes an 8-year-old boy.

Regardless of who carried out the attack, Obama said, ""the American people refuse to be terrorized.""

The president spoke of the ""heroism and kindness and generosity and love"" of those who rushed to help in the aftermath of the twin bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. He cited ""exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets.""

He added: ""So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil, that's it. Selflessly. Compassionately. Unafraid.""

While vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice, Obama said authorities don't know whether the attack was carried out by a group or an individual or individuals, or what the motive might have been.

""So everything else at this point is speculation,"" he said.

Shortly before his remarks, Obama ordered flags at the White House and other government buildings be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims of Monday's attack.

The flag-lowering is ""a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013,"" Obama said in a proclamation."

http://news.yahoo.com/disagreements-fast-furious-negotiations-163806591--politics.html,,[],Disagreements on Fast and Furious negotiations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and a congressional committee disagree on the pace of their talks to settle a lawsuit over congressional efforts to get records related to Operation Fast and Furious, a bungled gun-tracking operation.

In a joint filing Friday night, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told the judge in the case that a settlement offer it received from the Justice Department this week was a ""grave disappointment"" and that a settlement is not possible.

""The parties are very, very far apart,"" lawyers for the GOP-led committee wrote. ""Indeed, they are not even conceptually on the same page. After nearly four months of negotiating in good faith, the committee reluctantly has concluded — principally as a result of the department's settlement document — that the attorney general is not serious about settlement."" The committee added that it didn't think court-ordered mediation would help.

President Barack Obama has invoked executive privilege and Attorney General Eric Holder has been found in contempt of the House for refusing to turn over records that might explain what led the Justice Department to reverse course, after initially denying to Congress that federal agents had used a controversial tactic called gun-walking in the failed law enforcement operation.

The department has already turned over 7,600 pages of documents on the operation itself. The continuing dispute is over documents describing how the department responded to the congressional investigation of the operation.

In the same filing Friday, the Justice Department said it disagreed with the committee's characterization of the settlement negotiations and that a settlement is still possible.

Without getting into specifics, the department said it ""provided a meaningful offer to the committee to produce documents directly responsive to the committee's identified outstanding interests."" The department added that mediation by a judge would be helpful.

Story continues

""Mediation would provide the parties a forum within which to frankly and confidentially present their respective positions before a neutral third party, who could then offer assistance on how to bridge the differences remaining between the parties,"" the department wrote.

In a January court filing, the Justice Department had reported progress in settlement talks, prompting U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to postpone a hearing that had been scheduled for the following week. That hearing is scheduled to take place next month.

Since that filing, Holder told ABC News that the contempt voted didn't bother him.

""But I have to tell you that for me to really be affected by what happened, I'd have to have respect for the people who voted in that way,"" Holder said in the interview last month. ""And I didn't, so it didn't have that huge an impact on me.""

In a footnote in Friday's filing, the committee wrote that ""recent public statements by the attorney general also suggest that he is not interested in compromise,"" citing the ABC News interview.

Fast and Furious was a flawed gun-tracking investigation focused on Phoenix-area gun shops by the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Agents lost track of about 1,400 guns, and two guns in Operation Fast and Furious were found on the U.S. side of the border at the scene of a shooting in which U.S. border agent Brian Terry was killed.

Two weeks ago, an appeals court in Italy convicted a C.I.A. station chief and two other Americans for kidnapping a radical cleric in Milan in 2003 and sending him to Egypt. The decision means all 26 Americans tried in absentia for the abduction have been found guilty. On Tuesday, Italy’s former military intelligence chief was sentenced to 10 years in prison for complicity in the case. In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the kidnapping and treatment of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen mistaken for a terrorist and brutalized by a C.I.A. team at the airport in Macedonia in 2003, amounted to torture. He was never charged with a crime or given access to a lawyer. The case was brought against Macedonia because the European court does not have jurisdiction over the United States. Both judgments are important condemnations of C.I.A. tactics under the Bush administration. They are also a warning to Mr. Obama that pressure for the United States and its partners to acknowledge and make amends for gross violations of international legal and human rights standards is unlikely to subside.

Today, the United States has less equality of opportunity than almost any other advanced industrial country. Study after study has exposed the myth that America is a land of opportunity. This is especially tragic: While Americans may differ on the desirability of equality of outcomes, there is near-universal consensus that inequality of opportunity is indefensible.

In a bow to the gun lobby, Obama has endorsed an exception to universal background checks for transfers of firearms within families. The argument is that a father who wants to pass on to his son a beloved rifle shouldn't be burdened by having to conduct a background check. And family members, who are most at risk, should have every incentive to refuse to give a felon or dangerously mentally ill person a gun. The data, however, suggest the opposite. It's precisely those closest to a prohibited purchaser we should trust the least. In studies of prison inmates, nearly 35% obtained their guns from friends and family members — the largest single source of criminals' guns.

Leonard Pitts Jr. at the Miami Herald joins a growing chorus in On use of drones, Obama overreaches:

[T]the Justice Department says its definition of “imminent threat” doesn’t require “clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.” [...] The idea of a secret killing program, answerable to no one, is jarringly inconsonant with who and what we are supposed to be. One fears that, in the name of expedience, we will become what we abhor. Indeed, the danger is imminent. Whatever that means.

Drugs are ubiquitous in this country, and yet we know that some people have the privilege of doctor-prescribed intoxication, while others are thrown into dungeons for seeking the same relief. We know that the war on drugs is heavily inflected with Jim Crow–ism, economic inequality, gun culture myths and political opportunism. We know that Adam Lanza’s unfortunate mother was not the sole Newtown resident stocking up on military-style weapons; plenty of suburban gun owners keep similar weapons to protect their well-kept homes against darkly imagined, drug-addled marauders from places like Bridgeport. We divert resources from mental health or rehab, and allocate millions to militarize schools. The result: the war on drugs has metastasized into a war on children. Best publicized, perhaps, is the plight of young people in Meridian, Mississippi, where a federal investigation is probing into why children as young as 10 are routinely taken to jail for wearing the wrong color socks or flatulence in class.

If the bill passed, Georgia would be the first state to endorse repealing the 17th Amendment, but the idea has gained traction among conservatives over the last few decades. Texas Gov. Rick Perry supports it; so do GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Just before the November election, news leaked that the Congressional Research Service had been strongarmed by Senate Republicans into withdrawing a report that analyzed the last six decades of economic data and found, contrary to deeply held Republican dogma, that there was no correlation between top marginal tax rates and economic growth. Six weeks later, after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, we were reminded that 15 years ago the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied to kill all federal funding of gun research, leaving the public without solid information with which to debate gun control. Now, as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has begun calling for an end to federal funding for social science research, Paul Krugman has labeled the modern GOP “the ignorance caucus.”

Soldiers and veterans are keenly aware of the ethical damage of war and which they've instigated, each in their own way. Everyone reacts differently, but guilt and shame are hard to avoid. Sharing such feelings is immensely hard, as many fear being condemned and consequently feel exiled in society."

An air of mystery has surrounded the FBI shooting of Ibragim Todashev, 27, since it occurred in Todashev’s apartment early on the morning of May 22. The FBI said in a news release that day that Todashev, a former Boston resident who knew bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during an interview with several law enforcement officers.

The FBI has provided few other details, saying that the matter is being investigated by an FBI review team that may not finish its probe for several months.

“The FBI takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents and as such we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally,” FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said in a statement Wednesday. “The review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.”

The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations on Wednesday called for an independent investigation by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Officials said the division and local prosecutors are already reviewing the case.

At the time of the shooting, Todashev was being interviewed about his possible connection to a triple murder in Waltham, Mass., on Sept. 11, 2011. Law enforcement officials said he had acknowledged involvement in the murders and had implicated Tsarnaev. Officials said Todashev was not suspected of involvement in the April 15 Boston bombing.

Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police four days after the bombing. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured later that day and remains in custody.

In the statement about Todashev’s shooting issued on the day of the incident, the FBI said that an agent, along with two Massachusetts State Police troopers and other law enforcement personnel, were interviewing “an individual” in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation when a “violent confrontation was initiated by the individual.”

An agent sustained non-life-threatening injuries, later described by one law enforcement official as “some cuts and abrasions.”

Initial reports citing anonymous law-enforcement individuals provided conflicting accounts of what happened. Some law enforcement officials said Todashev wielded a knife and others suggested that he attempted to grab the FBI agent’s gun.

One law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said Wednesday that Todashev lunged at the agent and overturned a table. But the official said Todashev did not have a gun or a knife. A second official also said Todashev was unarmed.

An official said that according to one account of the shooting, the other law enforcement officials had just stepped out of the room, leaving the FBI agent alone with Todashev, when the confrontation occurred.

The shooting followed hours of questioning by the law enforcement officials that had begun the night before.

Todashev’s father said after the shooting that he didn’t believe the FBI’s account of why they killed his son.

“My son could never commit a crime, I know my son too well,” Abdul-Baki Todashev, who lives in Chechnya, told the Daily Beast Web site. “He worked helping disabled people in America and did sports, coached other sportsmen. The FBI made up their accusations.”

Todashev, a martial arts fighter, met Tamerlan Tsarnaev in fighting circles in Boston before Todashev moved to Orlando.

Todashev’s family said he had a ticket to fly to Russia this month and planned to spend the summer in his native Chechnya."

The shooter at the Navy Yard was a former Navy reservist who since leaving the military had been working as a defense contractor. Fox News has learned that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus on Tuesday plans to order a review of security at all Navy and Marine installations.

But Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee, revealed late Monday that a forthcoming inspector general report will address security procedures at Navy installations. Though that report has not yet been released, Fox News confirms that it determines the Navy is not taking enough security precautions when it comes to outside contractors.

The audit was expected to look at the Navy Installations Command, which is part of the Washington Navy Yard, among other locations. The details of the audit were first reported by Time.

Turner wrote to the Department of Defense inspector general on Monday calling for an ""immediate briefing"" on the findings.

More On This...

""Given the disturbing events of today, I am highly concerned that the access control systems at our nation's military installations have serious security flaws,"" he wrote.

""It is my understanding the IG report indicates the Navy may have implemented an unproven system in order to cut costs. I also learned that potentially numerous felons may have been able to gain unrestricted access to several military installations across the country due to the insufficient background checks, increasing the risk to our military personnel and civilian employees.""

According to an inspector general memo, the audit began in September 2012. Officials were looking at how Navy facilities were ""mitigating access control risks to Navy installations.""

Details are still emerging about how and why Aaron Alexis, 34, walked into a single building at the Navy Yard and started shooting, killing 12. Alexis also died.

Proposal mirrors NRA plan unveiled last week

Critics say plan would endanger students%2C faculty

Supporters say plan worth risk%2C teachers can be trained

INDIANAPOLIS -- Ashley Woolf was an eighth grader at Martinsville West Middle School two years ago when pandemonium erupted.

Gunshots echoed in the hallway outside the school cafeteria doors. Two bullets had hit a 15-year-old. The shooter, another 15-year-old.

""A teacher said, 'Stay here, lock the doors,'"" Woolf recalled. ""People were freaking out and confused. I was terrified and frightened.""

Within a week, Martinsville had armed police officers in every school. More than two years later Woolf, now a high-school sophomore, says she feels much safer.

""I think they could get to someone if it happened again,"" Woolf said.

Whether that's so is at the heart of the debate over a controversial proposal offered last week in the Indiana General Assembly. If passed, the proposal would require every public or charter school in the state to have at least one designated school ""protection"" officer on campus, with a weapon, at all times.

Most notably, the proposal says if schools can't afford a police officer, it can arm a teacher, principal or other employee. Not specified is what training would be required or what would be expected of the protection officer in a crisis.

How to prevent school shootings has been part of the national conversation for more than a decade, gaining intensity after the December killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

Some say the answer is tougher gun restrictions; others favor a stronger armed presence on campuses. It is an intellectual and emotional debate taking place not only in academia, among lawmakers and policy advocates but also in living rooms and at dinner tables across the state. Even among gun-rights advocates, some question the wisdom of Indiana's proposal -- including Ashley's father, Mark, who is a National Rifle Association supporter.

""Teachers are not prepared for that kind of responsibility or adversity,"" said Woolf, 56. ""That would be a recipe for disaster.""

Paul Helmke supports putting police in schools if local districts decide that's right for them. But a statewide mandate that puts guns in the hands of teachers, cafeteria workers and janitors is what he calls ""a bad idea for a number of reasons.""

Helmke, a former mayor of Fort Wayne, official with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and now a professor at Indiana University, envisions all sorts of trouble -- from teachers accidentally shooting bystanders in a crisis to students finding stored weapons.

""It puts our students and our faculty at more risk,"" Helmke said.

The Indiana proposal mirrors an NRA plan unveiled last week. However, the NRA plan recommends 40 to 60 hours of training for teachers and school staffers who want to carry firearms. The organization said it would prefer police officers in schools but realized not every district could afford the cost.

But law enforcement officials say more than 60 hours of training would be needed to prepare someone for such a responsibility.

The Indiana Law Enforcement Academy devotes about 200 hours to training police officers in the use of deadly force.

""The use of force is the most critical thing we deal with,"" said Rusty Goodpaster, the academy's executive director. ""Target practice is one part but there is a whole mental decision making process.""

Police candidates go through hours and hours of simulator training just to become familiar with possible confrontations.

If a gunman bursts into a school, an officer must work through a mental checklist in the matter of seconds, then have the skill to act on it.

""Then there is the mental part of being prepared to deal with the consequences of taking someone else's life,"" he said.

Kevin Quinn, president of the National Association of School Resource Officers, said psychological readiness takes discipline, training and resolve.

""There has to be a singular focus,"" he said. ""If it isn't you are in trouble.""

""Mr. Smith, the history teacher, has a lot of other things to be worried about, teaching and tutoring kids,"" he said. ""Protecting the school and children has to be your only job.""

Someone who thinks those obstacles are not insurmountable -- and worth the risk given the carnage of mass school shootings -- is Noble County Sheriff Doug Harp.

Located 30 miles northwest of Fort Wayne, Noble County has 20 schools.

After Sandy Hook, Harp approached the schools with the idea of creating special deputies from the ranks of the school employees. He wanted to, train them in the use of firearms and tactics and give them psychological exams and stress tests -- the same training his officers must undergo. And he wanted them to work in schools carrying concealed weapons.

The idea was not only to make the guns inconspicuous but also to keep potential shooters from knowing who's packing. The schools agreed. Several employees came forward for training. But county commissioners and the company that provided worker's compensation insurance for the schools opposed of the idea.

As of now, Harp said, his program is ""dead in the water.""

That's why he was glad to see a similar idea draw a spark in the Indiana General Assembly. He said the reality is that, without an armed presence in schools, they always will be soft targets and body counts will be higher than in a school that's defended.

""We get there after the fact,"" Harp said of outside law enforcement. ""It's plain and simple. We're reactionary and we're not proactive when it comes to active shooters.""

Harp said teachers shouldn't just be handed a gun, but with training they can learn skills to keep their weapons secure and to know when to shoot and when not to shoot.

At a minimum, others say, armed school staffers would give a shooter a reason to pause.

""A gunman would now have to ask himself if there is someone in the school who is armed and is going to offer resistance,"" said Mike Hammond, executive director of the Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, an organization that lobbies to protect gun owner rights.

""It might change their mind about doing it in the first place. I think the deterrent effect would be substantially higher than the actual effect of a teacher ever using the gun.""

As with much in the debate, there are counter arguments.

Helmke, the former mayor and gun control advocate, pointed out that there was armed security at Columbine High School, site of a mass shooting in 1999. At Virginia Tech, terrorized in 2007, there was a police force.

""You always wish you had the scenario where the good guy had the gun and was able to take the John Wayne/James Bond kill shot and save the day,"" he said. ""Real life doesn't usually happen that way.""

Rather than requiring guns in schools, Helmke said, communities should decide whether and how to put armed adults in schools. Beyond that, they need to focus on more proven strategies -- making it tougher for intruders to enter a school, sniffing out problems early and doing more to keep guns out of the hands of the bad guys.

For some, the doubts about arming teachers and other school staffers are simply too much to overcome.

Amanda Olmstead, 33, had two sons in Martinsville Middle School West at the time of the 2011 shooting. But she says there are too many ""ifs.""

""I'm iffy on the whole issue of fighting guns with more guns,"" Olmstead said. ""I'm not comfortable with it.""

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is consulting with top leaders over the scope of the look-see, reports ABC News. The news network also revealed that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus had already ordered two reviews of Navy and Marine Corps installations after Monday's bloodbath at the Navy Yard in Washington.

The new action came after the Pentagon inspector general questioned cost-cutting measures that a report in Time magazine said could tie in to the attack.

The Navy “did not effectively mitigate access-control risks associated with contractor-installation access” at Navy Yard and other Navy installations, the report by the Department of Defense Inspector General’s office says. Parts of the audit were read to TIME by a federal official with access to the document.



The risks were the result of Navy officials' desires “to reduce access-control costs,"" Time said, and the audit found a ""history of those with criminal records managing to bypass the Navy’s security."" It asserts that 52 ""convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access, placing military personnel, attendants, civilians in installations at an increased security risk.”



The gunman, Aaron Alexis, was shot dead by police on Monday, but not before at least 12 victims were killed.



Alexis is reported to have had a history of trouble with the law as well as mental health issues. Law enforcement officials told the AP that Alexis, who held a valid pass to access the Navy Yard, suffered from a sleep disorder and paranoia — and hearing voices in his head. His family said he had received treatment, according to the AP.



Officials are questioning how Alexis still had access to the military facility despite his troubles and a history of misconduct.



On CNN, Washington Mayor Vincent Gray remarked, ""It really is hard to believe that someone with a record as checkered as this man could conceivably get, you know, clearance to get ... credentials to be able to get on the base.""



Gray said budget cuts associated with the government sequestration might have led to a poor vetting process for access and security.



""We'll continue with this investigation, but certainly as I look at for example sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, that we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk,"" Gray told CNN.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-says-hes-determined-ever-gun-bill-221018585--politics.html,,[],Obama says he's 'determined as ever' for gun bill,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — With time running out on the chance to pass gun control legislation, President Barack Obama on Monday warned Congress not to use delaying tactics against tighter regulations and told families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims that he's ""determined as ever"" to honor their children with tougher laws.

Obama's gun control proposals have run into resistance on Capitol Hill, leaving their fate in doubt. Efforts by Senate Democrats to reach compromise with Republicans over expanding required federal background checks have yet to yield an agreement, and conservatives were promising to try blocking the Senate from even beginning debate on gun control legislation.

""The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency,"" Obama said in an emotional speech from Connecticut's capital, an hour's drive from Newtown. ""But I've got to tell you, if we don't respond to this, that'll be a tough day for me too.""

Some of the Sandy Hook families are making an attempt to push through the bill. Obama met with them privately before his speech at the University of Hartford Monday evening, then brought 12 family members back to Air Force One for the trip back to Washington. The relatives want to meet with senators who've yet to back the legislation to encourage their support in memory of their loved ones.

""Nothing's going to be more important in making sure that the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them,"" Obama said. His eyes teared as he described Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son, Dylan, saying how she asks him every night to come to her in her dreams so she can see him again.

""If there's even one thing we can do to prevent a father from having to bury his child, isn't that worth fighting for?"" Obama asked.

Obama's speech was interrupted repeatedly by standing ovations from the packed gymnasium. At one point, the room erupted with chants of ""We want a vote!"" Audience members, many wearing green ribbons in support of the victims, were stomping their feet on the bleachers and clapping their hands in unison with the chant.

Story continues

""This is not about me. This is not about politics. This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here who have been torn apart by gun violence,"" Obama said, his voice rising with emotion as he shook his finger in the air.

Obama argued that lawmakers have an obligation to the children killed and other victims of gun violence to allow an up-or-down vote in the Senate. That would require 50 votes to pass, rather than a procedural maneuver some Republican senators are threatening to require 60 votes, potentially sinking the legislation.

""Some back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support. They're saying they'll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They're saying your opinion doesn't matter. And that's not right.

Obama rode to the speech with Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who signed sweeping gun control legislation into law Thursday with the Sandy Hook families standing behind him. But legislation in Washington faces a tougher challenge, as the nation's memories of the shooting fade with time and the National Rifle Association wages a formidable campaign against Obama's proposals.

Majority Leader Harry Reid brought gun control legislation to the Senate floor on Monday, though actual debate did not begin. He took the step after receiving a letter from 13 conservative Republican senators including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, saying they would use delaying tactics to try preventing lawmakers from beginning to consider the measure. Such a move takes 60 votes to overcome, a difficult hurdle in the 100-member chamber.

The conservatives said the Democratic measure would violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms, citing ""history's lesson that government cannot be in all places at all times, and history's warning about the oppression of a government that tries.""

Further underscoring the tough road ahead for the Obama-backed legislation, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that the Kentucky Republican would join the filibuster if Reid tries to bring the measure to the floor.

Obama said the vote shouldn't be about his legacy, but about the families in Newtown who haven't moved on to other matters.

""Newtown, we want you to know that we're here with you,"" Obama said. ""We will not walk away from the promises we've made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I'm here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We're not forgetting.""

A group of Sandy Hook families originally planned to travel to Washington earlier on Monday, but the White House offered to give the families a ride so they could also attend Obama's speech before their lobbying push. The White House lit up the steps of Air Force One with flood lights so photographers and television cameras could capture the image of Obama climbing the plane's steps with the families at dusk.

Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter Ana was among the victims at Sandy Hook, held up a sign that said ""Love Wins"" as she walked toward the steps of Air Force One.

The families' lobbying trip was organized by Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit started by community members in the wake of the shooting. ""The group is encouraging senators to come together around legislative proposals that will both save lives and respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans,"" the group said in a statement.

With time running out on negotiations, the White House is making an all-hands-on-deck push this week. Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder planned to promote their plan at the White House on Tuesday with law enforcement officials. First lady Michelle Obama planned to wade into the debate Wednesday with a speech on youth violence in her hometown of Chicago. And on Thursday, Biden was taking part in a discussion on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" with people who have different views on gun control.

Organizing for Action, the grassroots group being formed out of Obama's re-election campaign to support his agenda, said it was launching online ads Monday asking the public to urge their senators to support background checks. The ads will target 11 senators — all Republicans — through Facebook and search engines. An OFA spokesman said the group was not disclosing the cost of the ad campaign.

Gun control is divisive in Newtown, Conn., as in the rest of the country. Not all Sandy Hook families support gun control, and even those involved with the lobbying push organized by Sandy Hook Promise are not backing the assault weapons ban. But those families are asking lawmakers to expand background checks, increase penalties for gun trafficking and limit the size of magazines.

While The Washington Correspondent For The Las Vegas Sun', 'She Contributed As The Paper Won The Pulitzer Prize For Public Service. An Economics', 'Political Science Graduate Of Uc Santa Barbara', 'She Also Studied In Budapest']",Filibuster agreement expected for vote late Thursday,"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement Thursday for rules changes that would limit the use of the filibuster as a weapon in the partisan obstruction that has ground action in the chamber to a near standstill.

The deal, between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), fell short of the sweeping reforms sought largely by liberal senators and their allies at the start of the new Congress. The package of changes was expected to come to a vote late Thursday.

Excluded from the deal was a key component that would have required any senator wishing to conduct a filibuster to remain talking on the Senate floor in the style James Stewart made famous in the film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”

Instead, the top Senate leaders have crafted a more modest agreement that would allow legislation to be more quickly brought up for debate, and limit debate over certain nominations from the White House, including those for judges on the circuit courts and positions of sub-Cabinet members.

The past few years have seen record numbers of filibusters, largely led by Republicans seeking to block President Obama’s agenda in the Senate in what has become an escalating procedural arms race. A filibuster can tie the chamber in knots because it only comes to an end with a 60-vote supermajority, which has proven difficult in this partisan era.

Even if the supermajority is reached, procedures still require at least three days for each filibuster to be overcome. Democrats also sought to obstruct then-President George W. Bush with the filibuster.

“The incremental ‘reforms’ in the agreement do not go nearly far enough to deliver meaningful change,” said a statement from Fix the Senate Now, a coalition of legal scholars and liberal activists that has pushed the issue. The group said the Senate “missed an opportunity to restore accountability and deliberation to the Senate, while not raising the costs of obstruction.”

To be sure, the agreement being forged between Reid and McConnell would help usher legislation along more swiftly in the slow-moving chamber.

Under the deal, senators would give up their ability to filibuster -- or hold endless debate -- on the procedural step that is required to proceed to a piece of legislation. In exchange for giving up the right to filibuster on the motion to proceed, both sides would be guaranteed the opportunity to offer two amendments to the bill -- a particularly important provision for the minority Republicans, who have long complained they are forced to filibuster because Reid blocks them from trying to amend bills with votes on provisions Democrats dislike.

Even though senators could still filibuster the actual bill, eliminating the filibuster on the procedural step would cut days off the debate time.

Over the years, senators have reached a gentlemen’s agreement not to press the requirement that they remain on the floor talking for any filibuster, as was the case in the Frank Capra classic, and that arrangement appeared to be holding on Thursday.

One aspect of the so-called “talking filibuster” would be put in place: Once the Senate achieves the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster and vote on a bill, senators would need to remain speaking on the floor if they refused to waive the 30 hours of final debate time that is allowed. But that change was expected to be a gentlemen’s agreement rather than an official rules change as senators and activists sought.

Once the vote threshold is reached to end a filibuster on White House nominees to district court, debate time would be reduced from 30 hours to two; for sub-Cabinet positions, it would be limited to eight hours.

“It’s not everything I wanted, and what we filed and advocated for, but I think this is progress in terms of making the institution work better,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who had led efforts with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to change the filibuster rules.

The ability to filibuster has long been part of Senate history, and the ability to cut off debate with a supermajority was only allowed after a rule change in 1917, when then-President Woodrow Wilson sought to overcome Senate reservations about entering the post-World War I Treaty of Versailles. Then-Sen. Strom Thurmond’s record 24-hour filibuster stalled civil rights legislation.

The result has gummed up the Senate, a chamber the forefathers designed to move more slowly than the fiery House -- but perhaps not as slowly as this. But veteran senators have been hesitant to change the rules of the Senate, often considered the more institutional of the two chambers.

Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, at least for the time being.

Fifty-eight senators voted to move forward with the nomination process, short of the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster. Four Republicans joined 54 Democrats on the losing side. Forty-one Republicans supported the winning side. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted against proceeding, but his vote was purely procedural—voting against proceeding allows him to bring the vote back up again in the future. If there'd been enough votes to hit 60, he'd have voted in favor of ending the filibuster.

This doesn't kill the Hagel nomination—it merely means Senate Republicans have exercised their power to block a vote on the nomination. However, even though at least 57 senators support his nomination, it does mean that unless two more Republicans agree to allow a vote on the nomination, Hagel won't be confirmed by the Senate without fixing the filibuster.

The whole thing is something of a dark comedy. Last month, a handful of Senate Democrats blocked efforts to reform the filibuster. If they hadn't blocked reform, Republicans would have been required to actually speak on the floor to continue their filibuster. Instead, they settled on a handshake agreement between Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. And now, to nobody's surprise, McConnell is stabbing Reid in the back.

Just before the vote, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) actually claimed Republicans weren't filibustering Hagel. Instead, he said, they were merely asking for a 60-vote threshold. Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), who was one of the handful of Democrats to kill filibuster reform, then took the floor to explain that Inhofe was in fact completely full of shit.

If nothing else, today's vote should be a lesson to Levin, Reid, and other Senate Democrats that they made a mistake to give up on filibuster reform. Fortunately, it's a mistake they can fix—if they choose to act. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism.

Reid says the Senate will vote again on Tuesday to move forward with the Hagel nomination. Wouldn't it be nice if instead of losing another vote on Tuesday they instead voted to reform the filibuster?

Apparently, it won't be next Tuesday, it'll be Tuesday February 26.

Republican senators are continuing to deny that this is a filibuster. But they are full of crap. Proof:





@streitfeldcnn via Twitter for BlackBerry® Murkowski explains her yes vote: ""Because I said I was not going to support a filibuster and I stuck by my word.""

They are seriously having a debate on the senate floor about whether this is actually a filibuster. Jesus. What a complete bunch of assholes."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/obama-gun-policy_n_3105547.html,2013-04-17 00:00:00,"['Senior Politics Editor', 'Senior Politics Reporter']",Obama Gun Policy Agenda Comes To Maddening End,"WASHINGTON -- It ended in a flash. Months of work aimed at revamping the nation's gun laws prompted by one of the worst shooting tragedies in U.S. history met an inglorious conclusion on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.



Every single measure pushed by President Barack Obama -- expanded background checks, a strengthened federal gun trafficking statute, limits on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines -- failed to receive the necessary 60 votes to prevent a filibuster. By the time all seven amendments (including those sponsored by Republicans) had been rejected, family members of gun violence victims were left sorrowed, the president was left seething and advocates for the bills were left searching for explanations.



""I'm going to keep on fighting,"" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), sponsor of the background check bill, told The Huffington Post in an interview shortly after the votes. ""The only thing I've said is I cannot knowingly put a loophole in a gun show or an Internet sale just for the sake of getting a vote. I cannot do that. But if there is some wording that would prohibit someone from misinterpreting what we are trying to do ... I'm more than willing to listen to that and work with them.""

The background check bill, Manchin noted, had been his ""coming out party"" in the Senate -- the first high-profile piece of legislation in his 2 1/2 years in the chamber. That it ended with a thud perplexed him.

""The pressure! Oh, the outside pressures,"" Manchin said of the forces that ultimately felled him. ""I guess sometimes the trappings of being in elected office are overwhelming.""

For the West Virginia Democrat and others, there was simply no good answer to the question of what could have been done differently. At least not in the immediate aftermath of the defeat The president had barnstormed the country and lobbied lawmakers on the phone. Allied groups had run ad campaigns and organized in congressional districts. One group had even injected itself into a special election. The administration's gun working group could have moved a bit quicker in making legislative recommendations. But only by weeks.

""I’ve heard the theory advanced that if he just moved quickly, Congress would have been forced to act,"" said David Axelrod, Obama's former top aide. ""But I think the forces of delay would have taken hold anyway.""

Democrats could have tried to trade the assault weapons ban in negotiations later, rather than discarding it as impossible to pass early on. But, as one leadership aide said, ""No one would take it seriously as a bargaining chip.""

In the end, the Senate -- where members from rural areas have just as much sway as their colleagues from heavily-populated states -- proved to be the cooling saucer it has always been, much to the chagrin of those who expected this time to be different.

Obama was ""tremendously committed and emotionally engaged"" in the gun debate, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who shepherded Newtown families through the halls of Congress in the days before the vote. And while the debate moved far over the past four months, he added, in the end ""the NRA has exercised a stranglehold.""

Speaking in the Rose Garden later Wednesday, Obama was far less courteous with his ire. Word had just come that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would pull the entire gun bill from the floor on Thursday. Surrounded by family members of gun violence victims, Obama called the outcome ""shameful.""

""There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this,"" said Obama. ""It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.""

Hours earlier, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the scene was somber. Those same family members trickled out of the Senate, their emotions ranging from disappointment to rage.



""I'm more aware than anyone in this entire world that background checks wouldn't have saved my mom,"" said Erica Lafferty, whose mother Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the Newtown shootings. ""But background checks might make sure that another 27-year-old doesn't have to get buried.""



Lafferty, whose eyes filled with tears as she spoke, was referring to Vicki Soto, a teacher killed in the Newtown shootings. Soto's sister Carlee was on Capitol Hill to watch the vote, too. And although she had conditioned herself for disappointment, she couldn't hide her sorrow over the outcome. Having met with a number of senators in the days leading up to the vote, she couldn't wrap her head around their reasons for opposition.



""It's too much paperwork. It's too time-consuming,"" Soto said, voice rising, of criticisms over background check legislation. ""Time-consuming? The Newtown shootings took three minutes. You can't take three minutes out of your day to fill out a background check? That's nonsense. And it's disgusting.""



Some people had gripes with specific senators. Pam Simon, a former aide to former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) who was shot two times in the 2011 Tucson massacre, said she was ""extremely proud"" of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for supporting the background checks bill. As for Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a close friend of Giffords who voted against the measure, she had to censor her opinions. Asked what she thought about Flake's vote, Simon only smiled and said, ""That I can say into your microphone?""



""I reminded him that he has a poster on his office wall of 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'"" Simon said, adding. ""He needs to re-watch that movie.""



As lawmakers filtered out of the chamber, they commiserated with the disappointed.

Soto collapsed in tears into the arms of Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).

""We're not giving up,"" Soto told him. ""We're not going away.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) put her hand on Simon's shoulder.

""Don't give up and don't give in,"" she said. ""The gun industry does not control America.""



Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) hugged several of those in attendance. ""This is just the beginning,"" he offered.

Giffords, who sat in the Senate during the failed vote, told reporters she was still ""optimistic” about future action. At the White House later, the president pledged to her and others that this wouldn't be the last legislative push for background checks during his term, an administration aide confirmed. Reid left the door open to revisiting the measure too, using a procedural motion that allows him to bring the bill back up if lawmakers want to take another crack it.

Still, there was little in the way of encouragement that anyone, even the president, could offer the family members, except the promise to renew the legislative fight later. The Senate was a stubborn institution, they all explained. And it might take changing its membership to pave the way for anything to happen.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month.

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will announce the proposals, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday.

They will be joined by a group of children who wrote letters to the president in the aftermath of the December 14 shooting rampage by a lone gunman who killed 20 students and six adults at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school, Carney said.

Obama will propose legislative steps he previously has backed, such as a ban on assault weapons, restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines and strengthening federal background checks of people attempting to buy guns, according to Carney.

The president also will push for other steps that could include executive actions on his part that don’t require congressional approval, Carney noted.

More specifically, the source – an official familiar with the process – said the president’s proposal will press for a ban on high capacity magazines with more than 10 rounds, universal background checks and a request that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety.

Vice President Joe Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden’s recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced Wednesday.

Opponents promise a political fight, with an NRA spokesman saying Tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an “unprecedented” spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month.

An NRA spokesman said Tuesday the group has experienced what he called an “unprecedented” spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month.

Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization’s existing 4.25 million members, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

“This is in direct response to the threats and accusations coming from” Obama and other political leaders, Arulanandam said, adding that “if anyone is wondering if the American people cared about the Second Amendment … those numbers give a very clear answer.”

In addition to new members, the NRA is also receiving an influx of financial contributions, he said.

“This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight,” Arulanandam noted.

The federal government estimates that more than 300 million non-military guns are owned or available for purchase in the United States.

At the White House, Carney acknowledged the challenge, saying: “If these things were easy, they would have been achieved already.”

“It’s something we have to do together,” he said. “It’s something that cannot be done by a president alone. It can’t be done by a single community alone or a mayor or a governor or by Congress alone. We all have to work together.”

Carney also reiterated Obama’s belief in the Second Amendment right of citizens to be armed.

“He has made clear that he believes we ought to take common sense, and enact common sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights but prevent people who should not have weapons from obtaining them,” he said.

His executive actions signed Wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks.

The recommendations by Biden’s panel included as many as 19 executive actions, such as tougher enforcement of existing laws, legislators briefed by the vice president said Tuesday.

Obama could demand that agencies provide data for background checks that are supposed to accompany gun sales, ensuring that information included in the checks is as “comprehensive and complete as possible,” Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California told CNN.

The president also could immediately appoint a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has been without a permanent chief for six years, Thompson said.

A Democratic member of Congress who was briefed on the recommendations said some of the 19 executive actions discussed included improving the way the government administers current law.

The legislator, speaking on condition of not being identified, cited loopholes in the federal database for background checks on gun sales as well as issues involving mental health checks as possibilities for executive action.

Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales.

Obama also called for more money to strengthen gun safety at schools, including hiring more counselors such as retired law enforcement officers to help educate students on gun issues. He also called for more funding for communities to hire more police officers, but stopped short of seeking the NRA’s proposal for armed guards at every school.

Obama has not ruled out issuing executive orders on some gun control measures to enforce laws already on the books, such as bolstering the way gun sales are tracked.

The president reiterated his desire on Monday for more robust background checks for gun buyers, keeping high capacity magazines away from criminals, and a ban on assault weapons.

“Will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know,” Obama said. “But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference.”

Working with Congress will be paramount in curbing gun violence, Thompson said, singling out a ban on high capacity magazines as an example of a measure that could garner Republican support. A full-scale assault weapon ban would be tougher to pass the GOP-controlled House, he argued.

Obama also said on Monday that the gun lobby was “ginning up” fears the federal government will use the Connecticut tragedy to seize Americans’ guns. At least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing, he implied.

“It’s certainly good for business,” the president said, responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks since the December killings.

Biden has said he’s found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines, which gun control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings.

The influential NRA, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions – like an assault weapon ban.

Gun control advocates, gun violence victims, the NRA, video game makers and others have met with the Biden-led task force.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations – the nation’s first since the Newtown shootings.

Both New York’s GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins.

It includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state, altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard.

Residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10.

“The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,” said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described state’s existing regulations as “the toughest gun laws in the United States.”

Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year.

Meanwhile, new national polls indicated a majority of Americans support some or most gun control measures.

By a 51%-45% margin, Americans questioned in a new Pew Research Center poll said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights.

And by a 52%-35% margin, a new ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month’s massacre. However, the polls showed continuing divisions on political and gender lines.

Article 3%2C Section 12 of the Mississippi Constitution adopted in 1890 guarantees the right to bear arms

Lawmaker wanted to clarify that by saying adults don%27t need a permit for a gun unless it%27s concealed

A circuit court judge had agreed to block the law from taking effect after several people sued

JACKSON, Miss. — The Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state's open carry gun law Thursday after a lower-court judge previously blocked it from going into effect.

State leaders are hailing the ruling as a victory for the right to bear arms. The bill's author, GOP state Rep. Andy Gipson of Braxton, Miss., said he knew his bill, which says adults don't need a permit to carry a gun unless it is concealed, was constitutional.

""When the lawsuit was first filed, I said I never seen a lawsuit filed over the constitutionality of a law in the Constitution,"" Gipson said.

Gov. Phil Bryant called the new law, which was to go into effect July 1, an important clarification of citizens' right to keep and bear arms under the state and federal constitutions.

Supporters of the law said it simply restates the right to bear arms that's listed in the Mississippi Constitution.

Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves hailed the ruling as a win for the Constitution and for every Mississippian.

""I'm proud the Supreme Court confirmed our goal of protecting our right to bear arms,"" Reeves said.

Article 3, Bill of Rights, Section 12. The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question, but the legislature may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons.

Hinds County's district attorney, sheriff, four constables and four state senators had sued to block the law, saying they feared people could become trigger-happy and put law enforcement officers and civilians in danger.

Hinds County Circuit Judge Winston Kidd ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague and indefinitely extended his temporary injunction on the law until the state Legislature could clarify it. But state Attorney General Jim Hood, who earlier had expressed some concerns about the law, filed the appeal with the state Supreme Court to overturn Kidd's ruling.

The new law only clarifies what constitutes a concealed weapon without changing any law, Hood said.

Even with the open-carry law taking effect, a previous law bans guns on school and college campuses. Bryant has said he has no problem with guns being banned in government buildings. Many counties and cities also have bans on openly carried guns in public buildings.

SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R-TX (4/17/2013): This is one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that the founding framers of our Constitution felt so passionately about that they made sure it was included in our Constitution as part of the first ten Amendments to the Constitution.

SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R-TX (5/11/2006): This is not somewhere where the President or the intelligence community is running like a rogue elephant across, trampling our civil liberties. I think we ought to lower our language and our rhetoric a little bit and be conscious of what's at stake. And what's at stake is the safety and security of the American people.

ERIC BOLLING (4/2/2013): Your right to bear arms shall not be infringed upon.

4/22/2013: ERIC BOLLING: Should the FBI be allowed to now go into mosques, and wiretap and surveil? BOB BECKEL: No. ERIC BOLLING: Why not? BOB BECKEL: Because I think.... ERIC BOLLING: See, I think this is a great case for opening that line of surveillance. BOB BECKEL: Because I think that's... I think if you....

When it comes to guns, the Constitution says you don't have to answer any questions.



SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SC (12/11/2012): Why should my Constitutional right be limited because you don't understand why I want eight guns?

And why should my Constitutional rights be limited because you don't understand why I don't want the government to have my phone number?



SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SC (6/6/2013): The way you protect the homeland is you try to find out what the enemy's up to. I'm a Verizon customer. It doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.

You know, if you define mass shootings as four or more people getting shot at one time, we've had nearly 250 so far this year. We've only had 260 days! Our mass shooting average is 96%! Our mass shooting scores shouldn't be that much higher than our math and science scores. There have been more mass shooting days than Jewish holidays, and there are a shitload of Jewish holidays! (audience laughter)

I'm just telling you, I think... my guess is there's probably a Jewish holiday about how many mass shootings there are, Tisha, B'ang, I don't know.

When it comes to terrorism, a terrible crime that doesn't kill a whole lot of Americans every year, we're willing to bargain away the entire Bill of Rights. Why is that?

The number of American “patriot” extremist groups has reached a record level, according to a new study, and experts are warning of a wave of anti-government violence.

A report released Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 1,360 “patriot” extremist groups in 2012 – up by 7% from 2011. The study defines patriot groups as anti-government militias driven by their fear that authorities will strip them of their guns and liberties.

“They believe the Constitution is being raped. With hate groups, things are going to get worse because they feel like they’re in battle,” said David Gletty a former FBI informant who spent time undercover with various militia and extremist groups. “It’s not surprising with their hatred of President (Barack) Obama that there are even more hate groups out there.”

The study said California has the most patriot extremist groups, with 81.

The SPLC report also offers a bit of good news: The number of “immigrant-bashing” extremist groups – so-called nativism organizations – is way down from 2011, falling by 88%.

The new statistics come after a string of crimes linked to extremist groups. A year ago, a Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to federal gun charges. Last August, a 40-year-old ex-soldier-turned singer for a white supremacist rock band shot up a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six people, before taking his own life. A few weeks later, a group of Georgia men was linked to an anti-government militia plot to assassinate Obama.

Obama’s election as the first African-American president and his pro-gun control stance have fueled the increase in anti-government groups, according to the report.

“We are seeing a huge reaction to the potential for gun control, and that reaction is so angry that it’s hard not to be afraid of what’s coming down the road,” said Mark Potok of the SPLC.

Domestic terror: Are we doing enough?

The rise in such groups echoes a period almost 20 years ago, around the time when Congress passed the 1993 Brady Bill and the 1994 ban on assault weapons, the SPLC said. That legislation came near a period of infamous and deadly anti-government violence in Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge, Idaho; and Oklahoma City, “and led to the first wave of the patriot movement,” the report said.

Extremists, Gletty warned, “are in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall.”

They are in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall. David Gletty, ex-FBI informant

Skeptics

But Jesse Walker, of the Reason Foundation and author of an upcoming book, “The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory,” said counting groups isn’t a good way to measure the threat. “It’s dubious to assume growth in numbers is related to violence.”

Also, the center’s definition of hate groups has changed in the past year, kicking up a controversy. Critics accused the group of unfairly bundling together organizations with vastly different points of view – and painting them all as potentially violent.

For example a North Carolina-based group calling itself “Granny Warriors” appears on the SPLC list of active “patriots.”

But founder Linda Hunnicutt says her organization is harmless.

“I am deadly!” she joked. “I’m 74 years old. I have COPD. I have congestive heart failure. I’m sewing a quilt.”

Hunnicutt acknowledges she’s no friend of the federal government, but, she wishes no harm on anyone.

“All these people that want to bomb places and kill children, come on,” she said. “Who would be in sympathy with them?”

Hunnicutt said she and her group just want Uncle Sam to leave them alone. When Granny Warriors showed up on the SPLC list, Hunnicutt said she wasn’t surprised. But it made her wonder, “Is this all they have to do?”

Nonetheless, Hunnicutt’s thankful to be on the list because she said it increases her group’s notoriety.

Fringe elements

Gletty said most of the fringe elements characterized in the report hate the government more than they do specific races. They hate everyone, Gletty said.

Now a private investigator, Gletty spent years undercover as an FBI informant watching the internal workings of white supremacist groups.

The groups named in the SPLC study came from information compiled from “field reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports.”

Other highlights of the report include:

– The state with the most neo-Nazi groups: California, with 9.

– The state with the most Ku Klux Klan groups: Texas, with 26.

– The report breaks out a group it calls “Christian Identity,” which the SLPC defines as “a religion that is fundamentally racist and anti-Semitic.” Texas has the most, with five.

– Another category in the report, called “General Hate,” is defined as groups that are anti-gay, Holocaust deniers, racist musicians or radical traditionalist Catholics. California has the most such groups, with 37.

“The country needs to do better,” Potok wrote in an editorial. The Department of Homeland Security, he said, needs to act to avoid a repeat of the kind of hate-based violence the nation saw in the 1990s."

No, really, once upon a time, the media saw it as its duty to be forever questioning and skeptical of Power, especially when Power was in pursuit of more power.

For example, Obama is attempting to grab more power for The State and criminals by way of gun control laws that infringe on our Second Amendment civil rights. In order to make his case, Obama is attempting to appear reasonable on the issue of guns, and one way he did this was to reassure Americans that he too is a sport shooter, and enjoys skeet shooting at Camp David.

Now, to those familiar with Obama’s record of opposing guns at every turn and lying about almost everything, that struck us as odd.

Today, however, the White House released a photo that purports to show Obama (love that tucked-in shirt) shooting skeet last August. Except… he’s shooting straight ahead, which means that there’s either a barn door somewhere in need of some patching, or Obama is such an awesome skeet shooter, he hits them as they come out of the firing device.

I keed, I keed. There are legitimate reasons that would explain the angle of his gun, but….

Because the photo is odd, some are asking perfectly legitimate questions.

But not the media.

What did the media do?

Because the media no longer questions or is skeptical of Power, and instead sees its role as protector of The State, the media mocked those who were skeptical:

That doesn’t include tweets mocking skeptics that the likes of Ben Smith and a number of Politico reporters are gleefully retweeting.

Thus far, I haven’t seen a single tweet from the media making the point that a single photo doesn’t quite square the circle of Obama making it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet.

Couple important things to keep in mind: Again, Obama is using skeet-shooting as a political talking point to further an agenda. So this is not an inconsequential matter, as some claim.

Secondly, while firing off this talking point, Obama made it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. But it won’t matter that the White House has only released a single photo and thus far refuses to disclose how many times Obama’s actually shot skeet.

You see, the media is proud to publicly proclaim that it doesn’t matter if Obama lies. No, really. How depressing to know a White House reporter at a major news outlet doesn’t give a “rat’s a**” if the president of the United States is lying:

—

So why so much immediate mockery from the media? Well, rather than pushback against a White House trying to shut down skeptics, as soon as this tweet was released from a top Obama guy, the media did as it was told:

(CNN) —

How bad of a year was 2013 for President Barack Obama? The economy is strengthening as he starts to wind down America’s longest war, but his poll numbers are the lowest since he took office almost five years ago.

Usually, a growing economy and bringing the troops home mean public love for the commander in chief, but not this time.

The flush of success from Obama’s re-election last year faded quickly as his administration faced a series of controversies – some unavoidable and some self-inflicted – that eroded Obama’s credibility along with the belief that he can bring about the kind of change he called for in running for president.

“People don’t think he’s as competent as they used to think,” said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. “They don’t think he’s as trustworthy as they used to think.”

Here are six reasons for the President’s difficult year, starting with his greatest achievement toward the promised change of his first term that became perhaps his biggest liability: the health care reforms known as Obamacare.

1) Obamacare blues

If one day in 2013 exemplified Obama’s change in fortune from his first term, it was October 1.

That was the launch of the long-awaited HealthCare.gov website that would, in Obama’s words, make getting health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act as easy as shopping on Amazon.com.

Obamacare site down… and back up

On the same day, a highly unpopular government shutdown started because of Republican demands to dismantle Obamacare as part of a needed spending measure to keep federal agencies running.

It should have been a decisive double play for Democrats, with public anger at Republicans over the eventual 16-day shutdown rising as Americans finally got to experience the full benefits of the health care reforms they had been promised since the law was passed in 2010.

But the website malfunctioned badly from the start, with repeated stalling and error messages that made successful navigation impossible for most users.

Once the shutdown ended on October 16, media focus shifted to the full extent of the Obamacare website problems.

CNN poll: Democrats lose 2014 advantage in Obamacare uproar

That gave Republicans fiercely opposed to the health care reforms a new opening to attack both the overall law and the big government approach of Democrats.

On top of all this came reports that insurers were sending cancellation notices to individual policy holders that undermined Obama’s repeated pledge of previous years that “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.”

While less than 5% of the population, the individual health insurance market comprised several million people whose stories of canceled policies took over the media narrative. PolitiFact declared Obama’s false promise its “lie of the year.”

Now Republicans trying to dismantle the reforms warn of more hidden impacts including higher premiums and canceled coverage in the first full year of Obamacare in 2014.

“This really represents the single … biggest instance of consumer fraud in the nation’s history,” GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters this week. “And the American people are increasingly led to the conclusion they cannot trust this administration to say what it means or mean what it says.”

Obama brought in outside tech experts to get the website working better, and enrollment figures increased in November and December. However, it remained unclear if the administration can regain control of the narrative.

On Friday, the website was down again for a few hours, but Obama boasted to reporters at his year-end news conference that more than 1 million people had enrolled so far.

2) How low can you go?

Polls show Obama’s support at the lowest levels of his presidency.

A new CNN/ORC International survey released Friday showed a drop of 14 percentage points since January in the President’s approval rating, down to 41%.

Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed 45% of Americans trusted Republicans to do a better job handling the economy compared to 41% for Obama.

It was a different story last December, when the President had a 54%-36% advantage on the same question just after his re-election.

Poll: Obama loses large lead over GOP on key issues

“It’s crazy how this has switched, even given the fact that the Republicans blew the government shutdown like they did in October,” Borger said.

Obama shrugged off the low poll numbers on Friday, telling reporters at his year-end news conference that “if I was interested in polling, I wouldn’t have run for president.”

Instead, he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress such as the growing Obamacare enrollment.

“That is a big deal. That’s why I ran for this office,” Obama said.

His approval ratings started declining in most national surveys in June as he dealt with controversies such as IRS targeting of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status and classified leaks that revealed National Security Agency surveillance of phone records.

“Many people assume that Obama’s low approval ratings today are due to the flawed health care website that debuted in October,” CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said Thursday. “But the biggest drop in Obama’s numbers came in the late spring and early summer. In mid-May, Obama’s approval rating was at 53%; by mid-June, after revelations about the IRS and the NSA, it had dropped to 45% and stayed there for several months.”

Holland concluded: “It’s been a bad year for Obama, but his troubles didn’t start in October – they date back to May and June.”

3) Snowden leaks

The Patriot Act passed after the 9/11 attacks led to a huge NSA surveillance network that operated under review by secret courts, with little public knowledge.

Then former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about it in June.

Suddenly, a program Obama inherited became a major problem, as Snowden’s revelations showed the government routinely collected phone records – but not the content of calls – for possible use in tracking terrorism suspects.

Suspicions that the government spied on its own people ensued, fueled by incomplete or misleading administration responses such as when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper denied to a congressional committee that such surveillance occurred.

Snowden’s leaks also made public embarrassing revelations of U.S. spying on allies such as Brazil, France, Mexico and Germany.

While Obama never personally bore the brunt of direct responsibility for the extent of the NSA surveillance, the Snowden leaks enhanced a public perception of an administration steeped in secret activities that it denied or tried to continue hiding.

Surveillance program now Obama’s to own

The issue caused rifts in Obama’s Democratic base, with liberals opposed to the surveillance that the President defended as important for national security.

He also has angered the liberal wing by continuing the policy of his immediate predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, to use drone strikes against terrorism targets abroad.

4) IRS targeting

An inspector general’s report in May that showed the IRS targeted conservative groups in determining extra scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status was the scandal du jour in Washington before being relegated to back-burner status by the Snowden leaks.

Republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of Nixonian dimensions, while Democrats condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance.

IRS proposes new rules for tax-exempt organizations

An internal investigation found no evidence of anti-conservative conspiracy, and officials eventually determined that IRS employees also used terms referring to liberal or progressive groups in their screening.

Regardless of the outcome, the IRS controversy bolstered Republican efforts to portray the administration as willing to push a partisan agenda to the edge of legal limits and perhaps beyond.

5) Stalled agenda

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King called Obama “0 for-2013” in terms of what he proposed in his State of the Union Address in February with what got passed by Congress.

No immigration reform. No jobs program. No tax reform. No increase in the minimum wage. No expanded background checks on gun purchases in the wake of the Newtown school massacre despite a major push by the President.

Obama and Democrats blame Republicans for obstructing possible progress in a divided government with different parties controlling the House and Senate.

“This last year has been totally obstructed. Everything we’ve tried to do, we have been stopped,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid complained on Thursday.

Republicans contend it was Obama who prevented progress by refusing to seriously consider their positions or concerns, accusing him of a “my way or the highway” approach.

The partisan impasse was most evident in the repeated showdowns over federal spending that culminated in the October shutdown.

Conservative Republicans got the most blame for the shutdown because of their failed effort to tie the budget negotiations to dismantling Obamacare.

But polls showed public anger at everyone over the brinkmanship that economists said hindered the nation’s slow but steady economic growth.

A budget compromise worked out after the shutdown amounted to rare bipartisan cooperation on spending issues.

The House and Senate easily passed the two-year spending framework that puts off further shutdowns over the budget until after next year’s congressional elections, and Obama has signaled he will sign it.

“It’s probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it’s also fair to say that we’re not condemned to endless gridlock” that led to the government shutdown in October, Obama said on Friday.

The question is whether election year politics will bring the usual hardening of partisan positions, or if legislators believe further compromise will boost their standing with voters.

Obama called for Congress to make 2014 a “year of action” on issues such as immigration reform, job creation and expanding background checks on gun buyers.

However, he refused to budge in his rejection of Republican calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit – known as the debt ceiling – when required as soon as early March.

6) Reality versus perception

What do you remember about Obama’s speech at Nelson Mandela’s funeral?

For most people, the answer will be the interpreter accused of making up sign language, or Obama huddling with the Danish and British prime ministers for an apparent “selfie” photo, rather than anything the President said.

He isn’t the first President to be trivialized by the media and joked about on late-night talk shows, but coupled with the endless Republican attacks and low poll numbers, the perception of Obama has changed dramatically from the freshly re-elected leader praised for a dynamic inauguration speech last January.

Critics enjoyed skewering him over a series of diplomatic jabs scored by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ignored a U.S. request to return classified leaker Snowden to face prosecution and intervened diplomatically in Syria after Obama failed to muster an international force to punish the Syrian regime for crossing his “red line” on using chemical weapons.

In the end, though, Obama appeared to get what he wanted without putting any U.S. troops at risk, as Syria – under pressure from ally Russia – handed over control of its known chemical weapons arsenal to the international community.

A bad year for sure, but not the death knell of his presidency.

“Can he turn it around? Sure he can,” CNN Political Commentator Ryan Lizza said. “I think his fortunes will be about the improving economy, and there’s a lot of good economic news coming out right now and 2014-2015. If the economy turns around, those (poll) numbers that we saw will turn around.”

Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3,000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy, would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants.

Consequently, employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants, rather than current citizens, including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.

The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.

Beginning in January, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration, must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3,000 per employee.

Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time,” in the language of ObamaCare, is averaging 30 hours per week, employers will, in general, receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.

If the immigration bill becomes law, many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition, these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time,” an advantage for companies and businesses as well, while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status, American workers.

Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle, and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process.

“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare, and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken,” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems, and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.”

However, as Klein said a couple of weeks ago, the issue has not been addressed and, in fact, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.

As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken,” that seems to have gone with the wind as well."

(CNN) —

In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House.

After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration’s nominations.

The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year, and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter.

But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House.

“This is an administration that has been very, very good at its politics, but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One,” he said Monday.

“It’s an administration which has some really smart people in it, and a lot of younger people. It doesn’t have very many heavyweights.”

The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all – not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to “take control of his own government,” CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said.

If you’re the President, how do you make sure that subordinates aren’t withholding information you should know? How do you strike the right balance, and explain it clearly, on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships? And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you?

“Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right,” Borger writes in an analysis. “And now Obama probably feels the same way.”

Does Obama still have faith in government?

Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today:

Obamacare

Another week, another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama’s health insurance program.

This time, Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – which is in charge of the Obamacare website – became the first administration official to formally apologize to Americans for the troublesome start.

She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee.

“We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage, and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use Healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,” she told lawmakers.

The website, which would-be applicants have found difficult to use, at best, embarrassingly crashed over the weekend, leaving consumers completely locked out.

Then, the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that, despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration, some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies.

An insurance industry source told CNN Monday that the vast majority of Americans who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under Obamacare rules.

It’s been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change – the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies wouldn’t meet regulations allowing them to continue under what’s called “grandfathered” status.

That refers to plans allowed to continue even though they don’t provide all the rights and protections of those offered under Obamacare.

White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements.

“There are existing health care plans on the individual market that don’t meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “There are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that’s substandard.”

And those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges – some of them at a subsidized price, he said.

But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters.

“If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” the president said in 2009, and frequently since.

It also offered Republicans ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan.

“The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. “It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit with massive premium increases they can’t afford.”

NSA spying

After months of seemingly endless leaks about U.S. surveillance programs, the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the German news magazine Der Spiegel that the United States was collecting the communications of allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Obamacare and NSA spying: What did Obama know, and when did he find out?

German leaders respond angrily to the news, with Merkel demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country’s confidence in the United States had been “shaken.”

But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism – from both the right and the left.

Rep. Peter King, the Republican chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, was incredulous that the president didn’t know what was going on.

“He certainly should have known, if he didn’t,” the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.” “I think that’s almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it.”

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said not knowing about the program was a “big problem” for both Obama and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs.

“As far as I’m concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing,” her statement said. “To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs.”

Benghazi

Longstanding Republican criticism of the administration’s handling of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead, resurfaced this week with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, threatening to hold up administration nominations over the issue.

Senators are expected soon to review Obama’s nominations for several high-profile judicial appointments and other nominations.

Senate rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations, and Graham says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony.

“I’m going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,” he said. “I’m tired of hearing from people on TV and reading about stuff in books. We need to get to the bottom of this.”

The White House said Monday that Graham and other Republicans are using Benghazi for political purposes, “and we find that unfortunate.”
