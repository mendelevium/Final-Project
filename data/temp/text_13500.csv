Two landmark laws — including the sweeping 2010 health law — have been enacted since 2008 to improve mental health treatment. But the Obama administration is still writing rules for both measures that will change how insurers deal with millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness and addiction.

That unfinished task has proved extremely fraught, as administration officials struggle to find a balance between the mental health needs of patients and concerns that more government mandates will inflate insurance premiums or complicate implementation of the president’s healthcare law.

“There have been difficult issues to deal with,” Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, acknowledged Friday in an interview.

Obama this week directed Sebelius’ department to quickly complete the regulations that will direct insurers to cover more mental health services. When the 2010 Affordable Care Act is fully implemented next year, millions of Americans stand to gain access to such care for the first time.

Nationwide, more than 45 million adults suffered from some mental illness in 2011, according to an annual survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 11 million had a serious illness, and of those more than 40% did not get care.

Among the biggest barriers to treatment have been cost and limits placed on care by insurance companies.

In 2008, President George W. Bush signed legislation that ended differences in the way health plans treat medical benefits and benefits for people who suffer from mental illness or substance abuse. No longer could health plans charge higher co-payments or deductibles for mental health services or place tighter limits on the number of therapy visits they would cover.

The protections in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act applied only to health plans offered by large employers, however. Obama’s health law is slated to extend those protections in 2014 to plans offered by small employers and to insurance that Americans buy on their own.

The Obama administration also made it clear this week that Medicaid, which together with the Children’s Health Insurance Program covers more than 65 million mostly poor Americans every year, will also have to offer equivalent mental health benefits.

“This was a giant step forward,” said Carol McDaid, a lobbyist who has been working for nearly two decades to expand protections for the mentally ill.

It remains unclear how the Obama administration will resolve a debate over how much information insurance plans must reveal about the way they structure their mental health and medical benefits.

For example, insurance companies sometimes require prior authorization for some treatments, or they may limit provider networks or require patients to undergo less costly treatments first.

But companies do not typically disclose these practices in detail, which can make it difficult for patients to know if insurers are treating mental health benefits differently than medical benefits.

“The consumer is at a complete loss,” said Julie A. Clements, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the American Psychiatric Assn., a leading advocate of more information for consumers.

The insurance industry has resisted more disclosure, however, arguing that outlining these limits would be extremely complicated and unhelpful to consumers.

“We supported the Mental Health Parity Act, and our members are committed to implementing it in the best way for patients,” said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. “But comparing a treatment plan for a patient with a mental health condition to one with a medical condition is not as simple as just comparing co-pays.”

Sebelius said Friday that the administration would issue final regulations later this year.

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","Despite gov't assurances, some could see insurance costs soar under ObamaCare","While the administration maintains that ObamaCare will make health insurance more affordable for Americans, experts say that won’t be the case across the board – and some people could see their rates soar.

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius released an overview of premiums and plan choices, saying “For millions of Americans, these new options will finally make health insurance work within their budgets.”

The administration also said premiums would generally be lower than what congressional budget experts had estimated during debate on the legislation.

But former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin said Thursday, “unfortunately you can go all through that HHS report and not be able to answer the most important question: will my insurance rates go up in 2014?""

""They cherry picked the data in order to highlight the fact that people of low income will benefit under the law,"" adds Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a New York-based think tank. ""But people of middle income will not. And they didn’t really talk about that.""

The new law requires the addition of what it calls essential benefits -- a list of things that must be covered and which make insurance more expensive than it is now.

""This report is intended to send the message, 'hey everybody wins, this is a great thing, please show up,""says Holtz-Eakin.

""That's not the reality. The reality is much messier. There's going to be some people who do better. There are going to be a lot of people who do much, much worse.""

The Manhattan Institute analyzed rates around the country and found that for people of medium income, costs will soar -- up by as much as 99 percent for men, and up about 55 percent for women.

""Even if the average American gets some subsidy, a partial subsidy,"" says Roy, who authored the study,""that partial subsidy won't be enough to overcome the dramatic increase in the cost of insurance, the underlying cost of insurance ObamaCare imposes on the market.""

But insurance premiums are only one part of the puzzle. Most plans also have very high deductibles.

""Do you have a large deductible?"" asks Holtz-Eakin. ""How much do you have to pay before the insurance starts picking up the cost?""

Analysts expect deductibles to be in the $5,000 to $6,000 range for the lowest level of coverage, the bronze plan.

Dan Mendelson, CEO and founder at Avalere Health in Washington,says,""So, if you're in a bronze plan, the premiums are going to be relatively low, you know, as HHS said, in some cases people won't pay premiums at all.

“But there are going to be very high out of pocket costs and deductibles in some cases are going to be over $5,500.""

That means a person with a plan at that level might only pay $100 dollars a month in premiums, as the administration has said.

But depending on medical events, the deductible could add almost $500 dollars a month more, without even counting the co-pays"

Updated 4:19 p.m. ET, 11/6/2013

(CNN) - A stack of daily updates written by Obamacare contractors shows the October rollout hit more walls than previously known: In the first days, half of the calls to the phone center had problems, paper applications could not be processed and up to 40,000 people at a time were sitting in the waiting room of http://www.HealthCare.gov.

The 175 pages of internal updates during the sign-up chronicle the growing ailments and efforts to heal the system during October. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Republican Darrell Issa, obtained the documents from contractors involved and released them Wednesday.

""50% of the call center calls have issues,"" reads an entry on day three of the sign-up. ""Anecdotal evidence supports a widerspread problem (with the call centers),"" the October 3 document says.

Phone trouble continued into the next week. ""Our call center reps can't see their screens,"" wrote an unnamed consultant on October 7. ""So we need to train them ... with this issue."" The following day, another note: ""Call Center – Working with them to help them triage their issues.""

At the same time, the paper applications starting to arrive were in limbo. ""Serco still cannot process online the 500+ applications they have,"" reads one line from October 8 war room notes. Serco is the company paid to handle all the paperwork involved with the Affordable Care Acts sign-ups. Website problems meant that Serco, like individual consumers themselves, could not file applications online.

The Department of Health and Human Services points out the problems were at their worst at the beginning and either were fixed or are being fixed. “These are just notes by a contractor,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters wrote to CNN in a statement, stressing that these documents present just one piece of the HealthCare.gov effort. “Many of (the documents) are more than a month old and they reflect static points in time in a fast moving process. We have made significant progress, as we have worked to identify issues, diagnose them and fix them.”

The updates indicate that contractors waited for HHS before directing people to the paper applications. An October 3 entry reads that navigators needed ""approval from leadership"" before directing people to the paper option That approval seemed to come by October 21, when another entry indicates navigators should use the paper forms.

The contractor documents are an up-close look at the asteroid field of issues with the Obamacare launch.

According to the war room notes: On day one, October 1, the system mistakenly rejected 90% of Medicaid applicants. The next day, estimates counted 40,000 people in the HealthCare.gov waiting room, while just 100 people had enrolled. By day three, it was clear that insurers were not getting the data for people who had signed up for their plans.

Systemwide issues were compounded by more isolated problems. On day six, Utah asked to shut down its exchange because the main insurance provider in the state had not been able to set up its template in the system. A few days later, on October 9, contractor notes say that the entire system has skipped some questions or information for 30% of all applicants.

A few days later, and another specific problem: insurers in Oklahoma were confused over whether they had to provide coverage for bariatric weight loss surgery (they didn't, sparking the need for changes to some plans).

Issues continued, but after the first week, the trend turned more positive.

On October 9, the war room update for the morning says, ""About 60% of applicants are getting into HealthCare.gov without sitting in the waiting room."" That left 40% who still had to wait. But the number was a vast improvement from the 90% to 95% percent the week before."

Sorry, guys. Your dream of Obamacare repeal hasn't arrived.

As Joan wrote earlier , House Republicans have scheduled a 1PM ET vote on their ""fix"" for health plan cancellations. But even though Republicans claim their bill will achieve a policy goal shared by both congressional Democrats and the White House—allowing people to keep their current health care plans if they want to keep them—it's not going to attract many votes from the Democratic side of the aisle, and the fundamental reason for that is simple: The Republican plan is nothing but Obamacare repeal with a different name, and no matter what Ted Cruz tells himself, Democrats are never going to embrace Obamacare repeal.

Not only would it be political malfeasance for Democrats to run away from Obamacare after spending three years supporting it, running away from the notion that all Americans deserve affordable, quality health insurance would be immoral. That's not to say they won't support changes and adjustments to Obamacare, but the House GOP plan isn't a simple tweak: By allowing insurers to sign up new customers to grandfathered plans, it would create an entirely new health insurance marketplace designed to compete with Obamacare, a marketplace without regulations or protections.

Yes, unregulated plans would probably be cheaper, at least initially, but they'd also be junk, and the costs of the good plans on the exchanges would skyrocket. Moreover, the House GOP plan would keep the mandate in place, so people would be forced to choose between exchange plans (which would be much more expensive than they are now) or junk insurance. It's not hard to see why most House Democrats have figured out it would be insane to vote for this, especially given the fact they are offering an alternative plan that actually would achieve the goal Republicans claim to be pursuing: Allowing existing consumers of health plans to continue their plans if they want.

Unlike the Republican plan, which leaves it up to insurers to decide whether they want to let consumers continue their plan, the House Democratic plan would let consumers make the decision. And it would do it without taking a wrecking a ball to Obamacare. For all the drama and speculation, at the end of the day, what we're going to see is nothing has really changed: Republicans are still fundamentally opposed to Obamacare, both in principle and practice, and Democrats support it."

Affordable Care Act requires insurers to treat mental health as they would any other ailment

One study showed 18%25 of young patients were diagnosed with mental illness

Average cost of treating mental illness was %247%2C000 a year per patient

WASHINGTON — High mental health costs for young adults threaten to undermine a key assumption of the Affordable Care Act: that insuring more young people will lower costs because they are healthier and require less expensive care.

The Obama administration estimates that 2.7 million people between the ages of 18 and 30 need to buy health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces to offset the health care needs of older Americans buying insurance as required by the Affordable Care Act. But while those younger Americans may not have physical ailments, they are more likely to have mental health issues that will now be treated the same as physical problems because of the law.

An analysis of insurance records of 6.8 million people 18 to 35 years old by data analysis firm BeyondCore showed that 18% had been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression or an eating disorder, said Arijit Sengupta, the company's CEO.

Treating a young person for depression costs about $7,000, the BeyondCore study showed, about the same as the cost for treating an older person for high blood pressure. But doctors diagnose twice as many people with depression as for high blood pressure, Sengupta said.

""The bad news is there has been a mental health epidemic,"" Sengupta said. ""The good news is, if, for no reason other than we get mental health out the shadows, it will be worth it."" He added that catching mental health issues early could save a lot of money in the long run.

The administration's hypothesis about younger insurance customers may be false, Sengupta said. ""Healthy older people may be more important.""

""There's a lot of conventional wisdom about young, healthy people, but I think that's been a little bit overplayed,"" said Jon Kingsdale, who headed up the Massachusetts health exchange. ""The most important thing is to get people enrolled, whether they're young or not. That's the point of the law.""

""We have been encouraged by the significant public interest in coverage available on the marketplace so far; we are focused on reaching, educating and enrolling as many people as possible; and we are confident we will have a balanced risk pool at the end of open enrollment,"" HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields Britt said.

As more people become insured, either by staying on their parents' insurance until age 26 as now allowed under the new law, or because of the requirement to buy insurance beginning in January, more people will be diagnosed with mental health issues, Sengupta said.

The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to treat mental illnesses as they would other ailments, such as cancer. In the past, insurance companies offered little or no coverage for mental health disorders or offered limited treatment. For example, a person with depression might be covered for six sessions with a therapist, rather than enough sessions to bring the disorder under control.

While the potential for higher mental health treatment costs may reduce the benefit of adding more young people to the insurance pool, Sengupta and others say middle-aged people who exercise, have healthy diets and have preventive exams may be the ones who help the insurance pool the most.

Several people have predicted a ""death spiral,"" or that so many sick people would sign up for the exchanges that they would force premiums up and make them unaffordable for everyone. The law provides some protection against that, including a tax on non-exchange insurance products that will be used to offset rising costs, if necessary. There are also risk-adjustment provisions for the insurers, as well as $10 billion worth of re-insurance in 2014 for those who sign on higher levels of people with chronic conditions.

Also, Kingsdale said, many young insurance customers may receive federal subsidies to help buy insurance, so they could cost the system more than older customers who have more money to buy insurance without subsidies.

""The tax subsidy pays in, so if you're supposed to pay $100 based on your salary, you're going to,"" Kingsdale said. ""There are higher premiums, but not higher prices for individuals — their price is pretty much fixed based on their income.""

That means younger people are more expensive, he said.

Some analysts have predicted the insurance market could go into a ""death spiral"" without enough young insurance customers buying into the market and driving down rates for everyone. If older and less healthy people dominate the insurance pool, they will end up costing more in benefits and insurers will have to raise premiums to compensate for the higher costs.

So far, however, that hasn't been the case, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, a non-profit group dedicated to persuading young people to buy insurance.

""With all the competition that we've seen in the marketplaces, insurers are putting out a price, and then they're putting out a lower price,"" Mishory said. ""So that's going to drive down costs as much as anything.""

""Having young people as part of the pool is important, but the more people you bring in, the less it matters,"" she said."

U.S. House approved a stopgap spending bill aimed at dismantling the president%27s health care law

It faces opposition in the U.S. Senate and a veto threat from President Obama

Without a resolution by Sept. 30%2C the government will shut down on Oct. 1

WASHINGTON — The House voted 230-189 along party lines Friday to approve a stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government through mid-December, but it is facing certain defeat in the Senate because it includes language aiming to dismantle President Obama's health care law.

Just one Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Va., voted against it and two conservative Democrats, Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina voted in favor.

Without a stopgap spending bill, the federal government will feel the effects of a shutdown when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The bill extends the current rate of government spending at $986 billion a year.

House Republicans attached a provision to defund the Affordable Care Act, a consistent target of congressional Republicans. However, the provision has no chance of approval in the Democratic-controlled Senate and it faces a veto threat from Obama.

Next week, the Senate is expected to begin debate on the spending bill, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will strip out the health care language and send a bill back to the House that simply extends current spending.

If the Senate runs out the clock on the time for debate, the vote could come as late as next weekend, giving House GOP leaders less than 48 hours to respond.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has not committed to allowing a vote on a spending bill that does not address the health care law. House Republicans will then have three options: reject it, pass it or amend it and send it back to the Senate again.

The effects of a shutdown would not be immediately felt by most Americans. Essential government programs such as air traffic control, Social Security, Medicare and mail delivery would all continue, but national parks and museums would be closed, and agency operations would slow down or stop. The White House and the U.S. Congress would continue to operate as well.

But the political risks are great. The last time the government shut down was during the Clinton administration in a budget battle against Republicans led by then-speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., which resulted in a public backlash against the GOP.

Boehner has said Republicans are not seeking a government shutdown, but eye it as an opportunity to start a broader offensive against the health care law. Republicans are also seeking to delay the implementation of the law for one year in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit."

For the second time in a week, President Barack Obama backtracked on his promise to Americans that they could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare, telling a group of activists on Monday that what he had really meant was that Americans could keep their healthcare plans “if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.”

Speaking at an Organizing for Action health care summit in Washington, D.C., Obama revised a signature mantra of his stump speeches during the Obamacare debate and the 2012 campaign in which he repeatedly said that under Obamacare, “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

In 2009, the President even cut off the possibility of modifiers to that plan. In a speech to the American Medical Association, he stated, “If you like your healthcare plan, you’ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.”

In his Monday speech, however, the promise took on newfound nuance. “Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,” Obama said. “So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act, you’re grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we’re saying is they’ve got to change it to a higher standard.

“They’ve got to make it better, they’ve got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling. That’s part of the promise that we made too. That’s why we went out of our way to make sure that the law allowed for grandfathering.”

In addition to the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website, millions of Americans have been receiving cancellation notices from their health insurance providers since Obamacare went into effect in October. Mainstream media outlets and personalities–from the Washington Post to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd–that were some of Obama’s fiercest defenders the last four years have called him out on this falsehood, even admitting in hindsight that they were skeptical of Obama’s signature claim.

Obama attempted his first rewrite of history last Wednesday in his healthcare speech at Boston’s Fanueil Hall after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was grilled in front of Congress and apologized for Obamacare’s rollout, which she conceded was a “debacle.”

“For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,” Obama said last week in Boston. Obama then said that Americans who were receiving cancellation letters merely had “substandard” insurance plans."

Hawkins was forced to relive the nightmare of Gosnell%27s %22House of Horrors.%22

The abortion rights community has opposed legislation to regulate abortion clinics in Pennsylvania.

A Planned Parenthood representative admitted they knew the clinic was unsafe

""If I talk, maybe people will make sure it won't happen again.""

That's what 20-year-old Desiree Hawkins told me last week as she recounted the horror of visiting abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell in December 2009. The jury in Gosnell's trial for the alleged murders of multiple babies and one woman heard closing arguments Monday afternoon, but they won't hear from Hawkins.

Hawkins was forced to relive the nightmare of Gosnell's house of horrors when she was contacted by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent this year. The agent told her that one of the severed feet found in jars at the clinic belonged to her aborted baby. She was set to testify as a rebuttal witness against Gosnell until he chose to not take the stand.

When she was 16, Hawkins sought an abortion at a National Abortion Federation-certified abortion clinic, Hagerstown (Md.) Reproductive Health Services. The clinic told her she was 19 weeks pregnant and referred her to Gosnell. When she recently retrieved her file in anticipation of testifying, she was shocked that her sonogram showed she had in fact been at 21 weeks, which meant she would have been 23 weeks pregnant by the time Gosnell performed the abortion. ""I was so overwhelmed and hurt,"" said Hawkins. ""If I had known I was 23 weeks, I would have (chosen) adoption.""

She also would have avoided the trauma visited upon her by Gosnell. Hawkins described the licensed medical professional as laughing at her during the procedure as she cried and begged him to stop because of the pain. ""Stop being a baby,"" he said.

Hawkins experienced betrayal anew when she read the grand jury report replete with testimony of government officials admitting they ignored repeated complaints about Gosnell because they didn't want to limit access to abortion.

'People die'

Said Hawkins, ""What really got me was when the (health department official) just said, 'People die.' They just decided to look the other way."" She is passionate that ""someone needs to make sure all states' departments of health ... are preventing this from happening.""

Abortion rights advocates have asserted that Gosnell was an ""extreme outlier"" and opposed legislation to increase regulation of Pennsylvania abortion clinics as they have in other states. But how could they possibly know that this is an aberration?

Last week, Ohio officials shut down an abortion clinic after inspectors found that a medical assistant administered narcotics to five patients, that narcotics and powerful sedatives weren't properly accounted for, that pharmacy licenses had expired and that four staff members hadn't been screened for a communicable disease.

This month, a Delaware TV station reported that two Planned Parenthood nurses resigned in protest over conditions at a clinic there. One nurse, Jayne Mitchell-Werbrich, said, ""It was just unsafe. I couldn't tell you how ridiculously unsafe it was.""

Clinic closure drumbeat

Last month, Maryland officials shut down three abortion clinics, two for failings in their equipment and training to deal with life-threatening complications.

Last year, an Associated Press investigation found that Illinois hadn't inspected some abortion clinics for 10 to 15 years. After state health officials reinvigorated their clinic inspections in the wake of Gosnell, inspectors closed two clinics, including one fined for ""failure to perform CPR on a patient who died after a procedure,"" according to AP.

Such problems wouldn't be a shock to Pennsylvania state Rep. Margo Davidson, the only member of the Democratic black caucus to vote for the abortion-regulation bill passed there. She told me, ""We don't know how many (Gosnells) there are. I'm not trying to overturn Roe v. Wade, but if a woman makes this difficult choice, she should at least be afforded the highest level of care."" She said the choice community knew what was going on and did nothing.

Indeed, the grand jury found that the National Abortion Federation inspected Gosnell's clinic, refused to certify him, but didn't tell anyone. Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood representative Dayle Steinberg has admitted that its officials knew the clinic was unsafe after women complained. What did they do? ""We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health.""

Davidson concluded that for the choice community, ""the institution was more important than the individual lives."" Davidson knows firsthand what can happen when people choose to look the other way: Her 22-year-old cousin died after an abortion at Gosnell's clinic.

Jan Brewer (R) through the state legislature on Thursday.

Although Obama's health care law continues to divide elected officials and the public along starkly partisan lines, Brewer is one of nine Republican governors who have bucked their party and embraced the Medicaid expansion.

""With landmark votes today in the House and Senate, legislators have tackled the issue that is Job One every session -- adoption of a responsible State budget -- and enacted Arizona’s most sweeping health care legislation in decades,"" Brewer said in a news release after the vote Thursday. ""It will extend cost-effective care to Arizona’s working poor, using the very tax dollars our citizens already pay to the federal government.""

The Arizona governor aggressively promoted the Medicaid expansion since taking her surprising public stand earlier this year. Brewer assembled a coalition of health care interests and business groups and worked alongside Democratic legislators in addition to campaigning across the state in service of extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor Arizonans using Obamacare funding.

Brewer played hardball with Republican legislative leaders in the state to get her way, earning their ire in the process. She followed through on her threat to veto any bill not addressing the Medicaid expansion last month. On Tuesday, she raised the stakes by calling a special session and forcing the temporarily adjourned legislature back to work on Medicaid and the state's budget.

Democratic lawmakers in both chambers unanimously voted for the Medicaid legislation. ""We have done truly the right thing for the people of this state,"" state Senate Minority Leader Leah Landrum Taylor said during the vote Thursday.

Republican legislative leaders and conservative lawmakers have bristled at Brewer's embrace of the expansion, a key component of Obamacare, and objected to her calling a special session when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene later in the week anyway.

""I'm deeply and profoundly disappointed at the manner in which this came down,"" said Senate President Andy Biggs, before voting against the measure Thursday.

""This proposal is not a freebie for Arizona taxpayers,"" said state Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican and the chairwoman of the health committee, on the floor Thursday. ""Here we are, once again, putting ourselves at the mercy of the federal government.""

The political fallout from the split among Arizona Republicans won't have an immediate effect on Brewer's electoral future: She can't seek another four years as governor when her time runs out next year because of state term limits. She ascended from Arizona secretary of state to the governor's office when Obama tapped then-Gov. Janet Napolitano (D) to be his secretary of homeland security in 2009; voters reelected Brewer in 2010.

Arizona is among the 29 states and the District of Columbia with chief executives who support expanding Medicaid under Obamacare to anyone who earns less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. Majority-Republican legislatures in a number of states have stymied expansions endorsed by their governors, including Florida's Rick Scott (R), Ohio's John Kasich (R), Michigan's Rick Snyder (R), Missouri's Jay Nixon (D) and others.

""This is a big deal because Arizona and Gov. Brewer are very conservative,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization that supports the health care reform law. ""It shows that at least for this governor and this state, practicality and common sense has prevailed over ideology and partisanship,"" he said. ""This is a reflection of what we're going to see over time in many other states across the country.""

But about a dozen Republican governors, including Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, remain opposed to broadening the program, citing opposition to Obama's health care law and the expense of the expansion. The Supreme Court ruling that upheld the law last year gave states the right to opt out of its Medicaid provisions.

Under the law, the federal government will pay the full cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share will gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. Currently, the federal government covers an average of 57 percent of Medicaid costs and the states pay the remainder.

States that refuse the expansion risk losing $8.4 billion in federal money and face $1 billion in new state spending on programs to compensate hospitals that treat people without health insurance, according to an analysis released last week by the Rand Corporation. About 3.4 million people who could have gained health coverage under Obamacare will remain uninsured next year because of states that won't expand the program, Avalere Health estimated.

The uninsured rate in Arizona was 18 percent in 2011, when 1.2 million residents lacked health insurance, according to census data compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Unique factors affecting Arizona's Medicaid program, called the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System or AHCCCS, played a role in Brewer's decision to set aside her staunch opposition to Obamacare.

In 2011, a federal court allowed Brewer to freeze enrollment of adults without children into Medicaid to resolve a budget crunch, which resulted in more than 140,000 fewer people on the program, according to Brewer. Accepting Obamacare's federally financed expansion enables Arizona to reopen Medicaid without having to pay about half the cost. This is why Brewer consistently refers to her Medicaid plan as a ""restoration"" of the program.

Moreover, Arizona expanded Medicaid to cover all adults below the poverty line based on a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2000, which Brewer has cited as justification for participating in the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.

In 1982, Arizona became the last state to join Medicaid, a program President Lyndon Johnson enacted in 1965. Arizona pioneered the use of private health insurance companies to administer the program, an approach since copied by nearly every state.

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But with the troubled rollout of the health care law, the administration has offered Mr. Issa his richest target yet. And he is running with it.

“This was President Obama’s signature legislative achievement,” Mr. Issa, Republican of California, said in a statement announcing his latest hearing on the topic, scheduled for Wednesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which will feature four administration officials. “His administration had hundreds of millions of dollars and total control to complete the project.”

But the investigation, even at this early stage, has turned into a nasty public relations war that will be on full display at Wednesday’s hearing, where Todd Park, the administration’s chief technology officer, will testify under subpoena. The subpoena demand by Mr. Issa has evoked protests from the White House — and many in the technology field — who argued that Mr. Park should be left to do his work fixing the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/06/white-house-sidesteps-on-plans-to-keep-promise-obamacare/,2013-11-06 00:00:00,[],White House sidesteps on legislative efforts formalize ObamaCare pledge,"The White House on Tuesday refused to state its position on legislative proposals aimed at formalizing President Obama's promise that people who like their existing coverage should be allowed to keep it under the new health care law.

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced bills permitting insurers to reinstate plans that fall short of the coverage requirement under ObamaCare after insurance companies began sending out millions of cancellation letters, often citing the new health care law as the reason.

House Republicans intend to vote as early as next week on Upton's legislation. Senate Democrats spoke dismissively of the proposals, signaling they have no intention of permitting a vote on the issue that marks the latest challenge confronting supporters of the law.

Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned under the law, while Landrieu's proposal goes one step further by requiring it.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney refused repeatedly to state a position on the proposals, saying he hadn't ""reviewed or seen an examination internally"" on any of them.

Shifting the focus away from what Obama has said repeatedly, Carney said, ""The world back to which many critics want us to go, is a world in which insurers have that power to say that, you know, your relative, who has a pre-existing condition either has no chance of getting coverage or is going to be charged so much that he or she can't afford it.""

Obama pledged in mid-2009: ""If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period"" and ""If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats had voted unanimously against similar proposals in the past and were having ""foxhole conversions.""

""I think what will be really interesting to see in the Senate is the number of Democrats in very red states who are up in '14 and what they start demanding ... in terms of adjustments to this law,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was preparing to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a fresh interrogation on the law, this time from senators with growing concerns about the insurance cancellation notices and the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website.

Sebelius was due to face questions Wednesday from the Senate Finance Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., was a chief author of the 2010 law and remains a vocal defender. Yet in a measure of its troubled rollout, even he has concerns about the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website and the potential security risks it poses for consumers' private information.

""I want it all to work, and security is one factor, one component. It has to be secure,"" Baucus told reporters Tuesday.

At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on Tuesday, Marilyn Tavenner, who runs the agency most directly involved in implementing the health care law, said that nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted at federal and state marketplaces in the law's first month of operation. She said technicians are making improvements that have already made the website faster.

She encouraged consumers to log onto the site and check it out, and said the administration had estimated that enrollments will total 800,000 by the end of November.

At the same time, she repeatedly refused to tell inquiring Republicans how many enrollments have taken place to date, saying that information would be made available at mid-month.

The Honorable Darrell E. Issa

Chairman

Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Yesterday, you went on national television and made extremely serious allegations against U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, essentially accusing them of lying to the American people about the Healthcare.gov website. You then used these alleged falsehoods to justify your threat to subpoena Mr. Park to force him to appear before the Committee next week to answer your allegations. Based on information obtained by the Committee a full week ago, however, it appears that your attacks against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are unfounded and that your statements yesterday either misunderstood or mischaracterized the information the Committee obtained. In either case, I believe it is important to correct the public record, and I request that you apologize to these officials for the unsubstantiated accusations against them.

Unfounded Accusations Against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney

Yesterday, you launched a public attack against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney, accusing them of intentionally making false statements about the number of users that were anticipated for the Healthcare.gov website.

You issued a press release with the highly inflammatory and misleading headline, “ACA Testing Bulletin: HealthCare.gov Could Only Handle 1,100 Users Day Before Launch.”[1] As evidence for your claim, you released a single document prepared by Quality Software Services, Inc. that “lists the testing status and results for various parts of the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM).” You quoted from this document the following statement about a “stress test” conducted on only one testing environment:

Ran performance testing overnight in IMP1B environment. Working with CGI to tune the FFM environment to be able to handle maximum load. Currently we are able to reach 1100 users before response time gets too high. CGI is making changes to configuration.[2]

Based on this text, you jumped to the conclusion that the day before the website launch, the full system was able to handle only 1,100 users, and your allegation was repeated by multiple press outlets.[3] You then argued that this document contradicts previous statements by Mr. Park and Mr. Carney. For example, you cited a statement made by Mr. Park on October 6, 2013, in which he explained that officials planned for HealthCare.gov to draw approximately 60,000 simultaneous users.

After issuing your press release, you went on national television and accused Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people. During an interview with Fox News, you made the following accusations:

Jay Carney is paid to say things that aren’t so. But in this case, Todd Park and other people who knew the facts, who had to know the facts. And the facts were from documents we received from lead contractors that they slowed down to an unacceptable level at 1,100 users. Well, in fact, Todd Park was telling us that at 60,000 was the target, and at 250,000 they just couldn’t handle it. The truth was their goal wasn’t, according to documents, wasn’t even 60,000. Their goal was 10,000. They reached 1,100.[4]



You then used these alleged falsehoods to demand that Mr. Park appear before the Committee at a hearing next Wednesday to answer your accusations. During the same Fox interview, you attempted to justify your demand by stating:

We’re going to have Todd Park and a number of other political appointees who were part of this pattern of interference and false statements related to this site. And we are going to try to get to the bottom of why politics went ahead of best practices and good technology. Something the American people expect, that didn’t happen in this case. And it’s the tip of iceberg, that we’re worried about, is if they are willing to put politics into a website, what will they put into your health care?[5]

You also sent a letter to Mr. Park warning that you would issue a subpoena compelling his presence if he does not submit to your demand voluntarily.[6] Your letter completely ignored a previous offer for Mr. Park to brief the Committee in the next several weeks and testify in early December so he would not be pulled away from his current work on improving the Healthcare.gov website during this critical time.[7]

Information Obtained by the Committee Contradicts Accusations

Based on information obtained by the Committee, it appears that you fundamentally misunderstood or mischaracterized the document you released to the press yesterday and that your accusations against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are wholly unfounded. You appear to be conflating the results of a much smaller testing environment with final production testing of the system at full capacity. As the document you released states, the 1,100 user figure was conducted for the “IMP1B environment,” a testing environment that was only a sample size rather than the full FFM production environment.

The estimates for the full FFM website environment were considerably higher. We know this from the transcribed interview of Henry Chao, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which Committee staff conducted on November 1, 2013. During his interview, Mr. Chao explained—in response to detailed questioning from your staff—that officials estimated that up to 58,000 virtual users could get through the full FFM production website application, which is almost precisely the figure cited by Mr. Park.

For example, your staff had this exchange with Mr. Chao:

Q: On July 19th, 2 days after the committee’s hearing in which you testified, you provided a briefing for the committee. Do you recall this?

A: Yes.

Q: At the briefing, you told committee staff that the system was designed to handle 50,000 concurrent users. Is it accurate that the system was designed to handle 50,000 concurrent users?

A: For the FFM, it is. I’m not trying to—

Q: When you say “FFM,” you mean?

A: The marketplace, the online application.[8]

Mr. Chao also addressed how the results of “stress tests” were used to extrapolate to the full FFM production system:

Q: Prior to October 1st, did CMS conduct any stress tests for HealthCare.gov?

A: Yes. “Stress test” is actually sometimes used synonymously with “performance testing.” Because in performance testing, you introduce number of virtual users, right? Two hundred, 500, 1,000. You know, you’re trying to introduce as many as you can handle in the performance testing environment to see where the breakpoint is. And then, once you achieve that breakpoint, then you extrapolate, you know, from that how many concurrent users, how many concurrent sessions. Because you don’t have a performance testing environment that equals 100 percent the production environment.[9]



Finally, your staff asked repeatedly how many users were expected to get through the full FFM production environment based on the testing conducted:

Q: So how many concurrent users—what’s the maximum number of concurrent users that the system could handle in a test prior to the October 1st launch?

A: The extrapolated figure that we came up with—because in the last remaining weeks, we threw some additional resources of capacity. The test was somewhere around—it was somewhere between 48,000 and 58,000, what we call, virtual users. They’re not real live people in there. They’re accounts that are set up, you know, doing different things in the system. …

Q: And you said that 48,000 to 58,000 virtual users could get through the allocation

A: Inside the FFM application, the online application for enrollment.[10]

Conclusion

This is not the first time you have accused a White House official of being a “paid liar,” a practice that several of your Republican colleagues have condemned.[11] Given that your staff participated in Mr. Chao’s transcribed interview last week—before you issued your press release and conducted your television interview—it is unclear why you did not disclose the information Mr. Chao provided, but instead chose to accuse Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people.

It is evident that the testing conducted for Healthcare.gov was inadequate, particularly considering the very high demand experienced in the first days after the website became operational, and I believe Congress can play a key role in conducting responsible oversight to ensure that millions of Americans obtain the health insurance coverage they deserve. But it is reckless and highly irresponsible to make unsubstantiated public allegations by taking information out of context, especially when the Committee has information in its possession that directly contradicts these unfounded allegations.

Rather than rush to issue a subpoena to Mr. Park based on these unsubstantiated allegations, which could impair efforts to improve the website, I propose that we accept the offer to receive a briefing from Mr. Park this month and that we schedule an additional hearing in December to obtain his full testimony. I sincerely hope that we can proceed in a thoughtful and bipartisan manner as we continue to review this issue.

Sincerely,

Elijah E. Cummings

Desperation fuels arrogance as, barely 200 days into the 1,462 days of his second term, his pantry of excuses for failure is bare, his domestic agenda is nonexistent and his foreign policy of empty rhetorical deadlines and red lines is floundering. And at last week’s news conference he offered inconvenience as a justification for illegality.

Explaining his decision to unilaterally rewrite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), he said: “I didn’t simply choose to” ignore the statutory requirement for beginning in 2014 the employer mandate to provide employees with health care. No, “this was in consultation with businesses.”

He continued: “In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law. . . . It looks like there may be some better ways to do this, let’s make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we’re not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so.”

Serving as props in the scripted charade of White House news conferences, journalists did not ask the pertinent question: “Where does the Constitution confer upon presidents the ‘executive authority’ to ignore the separation of powers by revising laws?” The question could have elicited an Obama rarity: brevity. Because there is no such authority.

Obama’s explanation began with an irrelevancy. He consulted with businesses before disregarding his constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That duty does not lapse when a president decides Washington’s “political environment” is not “normal.”

When was it “normal”? The 1850s? The 1950s? Washington has been the nation’s capital for 213 years; Obama has been here less than nine. Even if he understood “normal” political environments here, the Constitution is not suspended when a president decides the “environment” is abnormal.

Neither does the Constitution confer on presidents the power to rewrite laws if they decide the change is a “tweak” not involving the law’s “essence.” Anyway, the employer mandate is essential to the ACA.

Twenty-three days before his news conference, the House voted 264 to 161, with 35 Democrats in the majority, for the rule of law — for, that is, the Authority for Mandate Delay Act. It would have done lawfully what Obama did by ukase. He threatened to veto this use of legislation to alter a law. The White House called it “unnecessary,” presumably because he has an uncircumscribed “executive authority” to alter laws.

In a 1977 interview with Richard Nixon, David Frost asked: “Would you say that there are certain situations . . . where the president can decide that it’s in the best interests of the nation . . . and do something illegal?”

Nixon: “Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Frost: “By definition.”

Nixon: “Exactly, exactly.”

Nixon’s claim, although constitutionally grotesque, was less so than the claim implicit in Obama’s actions regarding the ACA. Nixon’s claim was confined to matters of national security or (he said to Frost) “a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude.” Obama’s audacity is more spacious; it encompasses a right to disregard any portion of any law pertaining to any subject at any time when the political “environment” is difficult.

Obama should be embarrassed that, by ignoring the legal requirement concerning the employer mandate, he has validated critics who say the ACA cannot be implemented as written. What does not embarrass him is his complicity in effectively rewriting the ACA for the financial advantage of self-dealing members of Congress and their staffs.

The ACA says members of Congress (annual salaries: $174,000) and their staffs (thousands making more than $100,000) must participate in the law’s insurance exchanges. It does not say that when this change goes into effect, the current federal subsidy for this affluent cohort — up to 75 percent of the premium’s cost, perhaps $10,000 for families — should be unchanged.

When Congress awakened to what it enacted, it panicked: This could cause a flight of talent, making Congress less wonderful. So Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management, which has no power to do this, to authorize for the political class special subsidies unavailable for less privileged and less affluent citizens.

If the president does it, it’s legal? “Exactly, exactly.”

“This fix won’t solve every problem for every person,” Obama said, saying he would consider legislative action to go further. But he appeared to rule out the sort of legislation that House Republicans are pushing, which would allow insurance companies to continue selling new policies, indefinitely, that would not comply with the law’s new consumer standards.

“I will not accept” legislation that would “drag us back to a broken system,” Obama said.

The move comes amid rising outrage over the cancellation notices, which insurers have sent out to customers nationwide who do not have health plans through an employer. Many of these plans do not comply with the Affordable Care Act, which was supposed to require health plans sold next year to offer consumers a new basic set of benefits.

Obama conceded that the problems with the rollout of Obamacare have hurt his standing with Americans, saying he has to “win back some credibility” on the issue.

“We fumbled the rollout on this healthcare law,” he said.

But he said that he was unaware that the federal online marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- was riddled with technological flaws before it went live on Oct. 1. “I was not informed directly that the website was not working the way it was supposed to,” he said.

The president said the website would be working better by Nov. 30, the administration’s self-imposed deadline to fix it, but added, “It is not possible for me to guarantee that 100% of the people 100% of the time will have a perfectly seamless and smooth experience.”

Obama said he understood why consumers who received cancellation notices from insurers were upset. “It’s scary,” he said. But he also noted that the existing market for individual insurance was flawed. “If you received one of the letters, I encourage you to take a look at the marketplace,” he said.

The president also took a far more sober tone than he had in the past about the difficulties involved in buying insurance. “Buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes,” he said, noting the complexities of comparing insurance plans. In the months preceding the rollout of the new law, Obama repeatedly compared the process to using websites such as Amazon or Kayak.

White House officials said Thursday that new plans sold next year would still have to offer the new benefits, which include hospitalizations, mental health services and maternity coverage.

But the officials said insurers would be free to offer their customers the option to remain on their current plans rather than switching to the new plans, which in some cases are more expensive.

If insurers offer this option, however, they would be required to notify consumers which benefits their current plans are missing. Insurers would also have to alert their customers that other options might be avaliable on the new marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.

It is unclear how many insurers would opt to extend current plans. Industry officials have said that doing that would be burdensome.

The White House move, which officials characterized as a “transition,” would not allow health insurers to sell current plans to new customers next year. House Republicans have been pushing for this, which most health experts believe would effectively destroy the new marketplaces created by the health law.

The proposal from Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) would allow health insurers to continue offering health plans next year that do not include new consumer protections and basic benefits required by the health law.

Most people who have these plans now are very healthy, because insurers have been able to deny coverage to consumers who are sick or have been ill in the past. That means that only sicker consumers, who have not been able to get coverage in the past, would likely select health plans offered on the marketplaces created by the health law.

Insurance premiums in turn would spike, making coverage increasingly unaffordable for the sickest people, while healthy people would be able to hold onto their existing health plans.

The president was under intense pressure from Democrats on Capitol Hill to find a fix. Democratic unity crumbled as lawmakers were pounded by their constituents over the rocky rollout of Obamacare, especially as many of them begin tough re-election battles.

House Democrats have increasingly threatened to support a Republican plan due for a vote Friday that would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that don’t meet new standards in the healthcare law. Democratic senators have offered their own legislation.

One day after House Democrats aired their grievances to White House staff behind closed doors, administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, will return to Capitol Hill to brief both House and Senate Democrats on the president’s plan.

Meanwhile, Republicans, whose earlier efforts to undercut the law failed to advance in the Senate, are again aggressively pressing the issue. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the administration’s proposed fix won’t work. “I’m highly skeptical they can do this administratively,” he said. “The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this plan once and for all.”

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) praised the president for “coming forward with a fix.” She said the vote on Upton’s bill would be the 46th attempt by the Republican leadership “repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act and to put insurance companies back in charge of America’s healthcare.”

“This Republican initiative would undermine healthcare reform laws by causing premiums in the marketplace to spike,” she said.

The president’s announcement got a cool reception from the insurance industry.“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,” said Karen Ignagni, head of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s Washington-based lobbying arm. “Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace .… Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace.”

http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/news/economy/obamacare-enrollment/index.html,2013-10-01 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],Obamacare enrollment: How do I sign up?,"It's E-day for Obamacare.

People can now enroll in health care coverage in the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges -- the centerpiece of Obama's landmark legislation. Coverage begins in 2014, but folks must sign up by Dec. 15 if they want coverage to begin Jan. 1.

But despite the run up to the Oct 1 launch date, Americans remain largely in the dark about the exchanges. Six in 10 people are not aware of the exchanges, according to a new survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that promotes better access to and quality of health care. Knowledge is even scanter among the uninsured -- who would most benefit from the exchanges. More than two-thirds of the uninsured are unaware of the exchanges.

While the enrollment process will vary a bit depending on the state, here's a general guideline to how to sign up for a policy on the exchange.

All Americans can start at healthcare.gov, the federal online Obamacare portal. You'll be asked to enter your state.

If you live in a state that's running its own exchange, you will be directed there or you can just go directly to your state's exchange website. Those in the states where the federal government is running the exchange will apply through the federal portal.

Share your story: Are you planning to sign up for Obamacare this week?

You must then set up an account and provide information, such as your name, address, age, number of people in your family, household income, employer and whether you have access to insurance elsewhere. You'll also have to say whether you are a smoker, since insurance carriers can charge tobacco users more.

You can also apply for a federal subsidy, which may require you to provide pay stubs and certain tax forms if the income you enter doesn't match Internal Revenue Service records. Enrollees should learn instantly whether they qualify for the subsidy, which they can apply to insurance coverage right away. You'll also find out whether you are eligible for Medicaid, and whether you can enroll your children in the government health program for kids, known as CHIP.

Then comes the enrollment process. Applicants can learn about the various insurance policies available in their area, including deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, doctor networks and benefits packages. Plans can be sorted by premiums and various other criteria and can be compared side by side.

You can then enroll and opt to set up premium payments online or call the carrier's customer service department for additional payment options.

(Some technical glitches in a few places may prevent residents in certain states from completing the enrollment process online in the first few weeks, but they can register and look at the options and rates available to them.)

There are a variety of ways to get your questions answered.

Applicants can use a live chat feature on the federal portal or call the help line at 800-318-2596 to get assistance with enrollment. States are also staffing call centers to assist residents with enrollment. Applications can also be mailed in.

Obamacare: Your 12 biggest questions answered

Those who need more hand-holding can go to a variety of groups for in-person help, mostly non-profits or health centers funded by the federal government. Experts, including ""navigators"" and certified application counselors, will be on hand to answer questions and walk people through the application process.

To find this assistance, go to localhelp.healthcare.gov on the federal portal and type in your zip code. You can also go to getcoveredamerica.org or text ""covered"" to 877877 to get a list from Enroll America, a non-profit aimed at boosting participation in Obamacare.

In Florida, which has one of the highest shares of uninsured Americans, navigators will sit with enrollees and guide them through the process, said Lean Barber-Heinz, interim executive director of Florida CHAIN, a consumer health care advocacy group. Florida CHAIN, for instance, is holding an enrollment fair on Saturday, Oct. 5 at a St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, where navigators will be on hand to help people both with the technology and with understanding the choices they have.

""The marketplace is really designed for people to be able to navigate it themselves,"" she said, of the federal portal. ""But the help will be available.""

Enrollees can also go to independent, licensed insurance agents and brokers to review their options. The agents and brokers are not allowed to push one insurer's products, but can walk consumers through all the different policies, their deductibles and benefits.

Though enrollment is now open, people don't have to sign up right away. You can pick a policy as late as March 31, but if you wait until the last minute, your coverage won't begin until May."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Threatened by the Armageddon Caucus,"Are you ready for the Big Magilla of American politics? This fall, every important domestic issue could crash into every other: health-care reform, autopilot budget cuts, a government shutdown, even a default on the national debt.

If I were betting, I’d wager that we will somehow avoid a total meltdown. House Speaker John Boehner seems desperate to get around his party’s Armageddon Caucus.

But after three years of congressional dysfunction brought on by the rise of a radicalized brand of conservatism, it’s time to call the core questions:

Will our ability to govern ourselves be held perpetually hostage to an ideology that casts government as little more than dead weight in American life? And will a small minority in Congress be allowed to grind decision-making to a halt?

Congress is supposed to be the venue in which we Americans work our way past divisions that are inevitable in a large and diverse democracy. Yet for some time, Republican congressional leaders have given the most right-wing members of the House and Senate a veto power that impedes compromise, and thus governing itself.

On the few occasions when the far-right veto was lifted, Congress got things done, courtesy of a middle-ground majority that included most Democrats and the more moderately conservative Republicans. That’s how Congress passed the modest tax increases on the well-off that have helped reduce the deficit, as well as the Violence Against Women Act and assistance for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

All these actions had something in common: They were premised on the belief that government can take practical steps to make American life better.

This idea is dismissed by those ready to shut down the government or to use the debt ceiling as a way of forcing the repeal or delay of the Affordable Care Act and passing more draconian spending reductions. It needs to be made very clear that these radical Republicans are operating well outside their party’s own constructive traditions.

Before their 2010 election victory, Republicans had never been willing to use the threat of default to achieve their goals. The GOP tried a government shutdown back in the mid-1990s, but it was a political disaster. Experienced Republicans are trying to steer their party away from the brink, the very place where politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and a group of fourscore or so House members want it to go.

Particularly instructive is the effort to repeal health-care reform. The very fact that everyone now accepts the term “Obamacare” to refer to a measure designed to get health insurance to many more Americans is a sign of how stupidly partisan we have become. We never described Medicare as “Johnsoncare.” We didn’t label Social Security “FDRsecurity.”

Tying the whole thing to Obama disguises the fact that most of the major provisions of the law he fought for had their origins among conservatives and Republicans.

The health-care exchanges to facilitate the purchase of private insurance were based on a Heritage Foundation proposal, first brought to fruition in Massachusetts by a Republican governor named Mitt Romney. Subsidizing private premiums was always a Republican alternative to extending Medicare to cover everyone, the remedy preferred by many liberals.

Conservatives even once favored the individual mandate to buy insurance, as MSNBC columnist Tim Noah pointed out. “Many states now require passengers in automobiles to wear seatbelts for their own protection,” the Heritage Foundation’s Stuart Butler said back in 1989. “Many others require anybody driving a car to have liability insurance.” Since all of us will use health care at some point, Butler argued reasonably, it makes sense to have us all in the insurance pool.

But that was then. The right wing’s recent rejection of a significant government role in ending the scandal of “a health-care system that does not even come close to being comprehensive and fails to reach far too many” — the words were spoken 24 years ago by the late Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican — tells us why Congress no longer works.

The GOP has gone from endorsing market-based government solutions to problems the private sector can’t solve — i.e, Obamacare — to believing that no solution involving expanded government can possibly be good for the country.

Ask yourself: If conservatives still believed in what both left and right once saw as a normal approach to government, would they speak so cavalierly about shutting it down or risking its credit? This is what’s at stake in the Big Magilla.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/28/republicans-contraception-measure-_n_4010383.html,2013-09-28 00:00:00,"['Senior National Editor', 'Senior Politics Reporter']",House Republicans Target Contraception In Last-Minute Spending Bill,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans included a so-called ""conscience clause"" in the government funding bill in a plan they approved early Sunday.

The House voted 231-192 on a bill that would delay much of the 2010 health care overhaul for a year. It would also repeal a tax on medical devices that helps finance the health care law.

The measure would allow employers and insurers to opt out of providing health care services that they find morally or religiously objectionable. The addition reignites the debate over a portion of the health care reform law that requires most insurers to cover women's preventative health care, including contraception. CNN reports that the provision would allow them to opt out of coverage for the next year.

A House Republican leadership aide confirmed to HuffPost that the provision was added into the one-year delay of Obamacare during a House Rules Committee meeting on Saturday evening.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens called the move ""desperate, misguided, and extreme"" in a statement. ""The country wants Congress to focus on jobs and the economy, not on pushing an extreme agenda against birth control,"" said Laguens.

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) didn't know Republicans had added the provision into the bill, even as the House was already debating the rule for bringing it up.

""They did?"" Becerra asked, during a Saturday night interview with The Huffington Post. ""What part of their social agenda will they not stick into a budget bill?""

Becerra called it ""absurd"" that an abortion-related provision found its way into the bill at the last minute. ""We're less than three days from watching [Republicans] lead to a government shutdown. Now they want to reignite the war on women?"" he asked. ""It makes for theater, and that's what it is. If it weren't so serious, it would be hard not to laugh.""

The one-year delay passed by the House early Sunday faces almost certain failure in the Senate, which has objected to Republicans' attempt to use the government funding bill to delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

""Once again House Republicans have found a way to mount an ideological attack on women's health as the clock ticks down on a crisis they created,"" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement Saturday night. ""This is part of the right-wing playbook that's going nowhere in the Senate. The truly unconscionable thing is that Republicans would try to rob women of access to health care while holding our economy hostage.""

The first vote was to amend the Senate continuing resolution, or CR, with the repeal of the medical device tax.

That passed by a vote of 248 to 174.

17 Democrats defected from the party line:

Ron Barber (AZ-02)

John Barrow (GA-12)

Cheri Bustos (IL-17)

John Delaney (MD-06)

Tammy Duckworth (IL-08)

Bill Owens (NY-21)

Scott Peters (CA-52)

Nick Rahall (WV-03)

Brad Schneider (IL-10)

Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09)

In the next vote, the House voted to amend the Senate's CR with a one-year delay in implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act like the health care marketplaces and the individual mandate.

That passed by a vote of 231 to 192.

Two Republicans defected from party line: Chris Gibson (NY-19) and Richard Hanna (NY-22).

Two Democrats defected from party line: Jim Matheson (UT-04) and Mike McIntyre (NC-07).

Keep in mind that both Matheson and McIntyre are on the DCCC's Front Line, so the $$$s they collect by fundraising off this vote will go to the two Democrats who voted with GOP to shut down the government.

Many members of the DCCC Front Line, all of whom face tight races, voted against both of these measures. John Tierney (MA-06) and Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01) come to mind as examples of some of the better names on the Front Line. So those who voted for them have no excuses.

And honestly, the Democratic Party would be better off by cutting funds from party deadwood and making actual efforts to win blue seats held by Republicans like those of Pete King and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. However, Steve Israel's friendship with King and DWS's friendship with Ileana are perpetual roadblocks.

In addition, the House also unanimously voted to continue appropriations for military pay in the event of a government shutdown."

A growing number of Republicans are scoffing at Louisiana Sen. David Vitter’s push to stop federal contributions that will help pay for health coverage for lawmakers and their staff under the new Obamacare exchanges. Vitter’s crusade has effectively put his GOP colleagues in the unenviable position of hurting themselves and their staff financially or siding with another political attack on a law the party universally despises. The latest pushback is another sign of how the long-running GOP fight to repeal Obamacare has suddenly degenerated into an internal Republican battle, prompting widespread concerns among party elders. “One of our strengths in this fight—even though we had minority numbers in both the House and the Senate when the law passed—was that no Republicans voted for it in the Senate,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of his party’s leadership. “Somehow, some of our members seem to think there’s forward progress in figuring out ways to divide us on something we’re totally united on. That can’t be a good idea.”

The dissension rampant in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives has spilled over to the Senate Republicans, where Sen. David Vitter's bizarre anti-Obamacare campaign is starting to piss off his Republican colleagues Again, has anyone ever accused David Vitter of having good ideas? Senate Republicans are probably just pissed the Vitter is making them look like House Republicans, because there's nothing that creates more disdain in a senator than the House.

Vitter isn't doing much to bring fellow Republicans to his side, either. When fellow Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins and Saxby Chambliss raise the issue that Vitter's plan would take affordable health insurance away from congressional staff, and that that wasn't particularly fair, Vitter staffer Luke Bolar, (who would also lose his insurance) responded: “Lotta Americans getting screwed under Obamacare and won’t get a taxpayer subsidy.” So, basically, ""fuck all my coworkers."" That'll win friends and influence people.

Stand with Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in denouncing Republicans who would completely shut down the government just to destroy Obamacare.

Fox Corrects CBS News Obamacare Insurance Plan Loss ""Horror Story""","She also noted that the fact that so many are losing their health care plans is “directly at odds with repeated assurances by the president.” Many, including Dianne Barrette, a 56-year-old Florida resident, were recently informed that their current health care plans were not comprehensive enough to meet coverage requirements set by the ACA. Barrette was recently informed that her new plan will cost 10 times what she presently pays per month.

CBS' Jan Crawford took that information from Ms. Barrette and repeated it at face value with no investigation or followup. Poor, poor Ms, Barrette her insurance costs are skyrocketing by 10 times their original cost.



Well you will never believe who poked giant holes through this 'report': Fox News' Greta Van Sustern.



Greta teed up the interview using the same setup as Crawford’s piece, that Barrette is “finding out she will have to pay 10 times as much for health insurance” because “she is losing her current plan to Obamacare.” “I have a copy of your Florida Blue insurance and it’s about $54 a month,” Greta continued, “and now I understand that under Obamacare, it’s going to go up, at least they said that the policy they would offer you under Florida Blue, would be $591; is that correct?” Actually, the plan BCBSFL was only one of many plans Dianne has to choose from, 10 of which are cheaper than that $591, and based on her income, she’d only pay around $209 a month, but Greta did cut right to the chase about the quality of her old plan. “Your $54 a month policy is a pretty, you know, bare bones policy, “Greta said. “Why do you want to keep that one, except for the price? Maybe you can get something better with a subsidy?”

Ms. Barrette goes on to say that this 'insurance' is perfect for what she needs: a doctor visit copay and prescription copay, and maybe some outpatient services. It turns out that she actually had that reversed and the insurance company paid a $50 'copay' towards a doctor visit, and $15 for prescriptions, and she herself was responsible for all the rest of the costs. The interviewee acknowledged no hospital stays were covered in response to Greta's question.

Now this is exactly the type of junk insurance Obamacare is meant to do away with, and it is not surprising that people don't know what their insurance covers. But a reporter with a major news outlet should have done some reporting and learned that. So it should be of great embarassment to CBS to be shown up that way by Fox filling in missing facts in their story.

What is funny though is that a subsequent interview that was to take place on Fox News with Ms. Barrette, was cancelled, after Greta poked holes in the story.



Following her chat with Van Susteren, Barrette got word from a network producer that her appointment to appear this morning on Fox News was cancelled, she tells the Erik Wemple Blog.

The article, essentially, says what a lot of people here at dailykos have been saying for a while, that once people start signing up for and receiving health insurance under Obamacare it will become increasingly difficult for Republicans to be able to kill it off.

The article, written by a Meghan Foley, states what the rest of us suspected, but most Americans have not necessarily been exposed to...a more objective assessment of Obamacare from a long term view and how the entire politics of the situation changes once those millions and millions of people who sign up start receiving benefits.

This could just be an “outlier” article, so to speak, from someone tired of regurgitating the Republicans' talking points day after day, and who sees the situation as fluid. But, my guess is that even the lazy national news media (which usually finds it easier to just “go with the flow” rather than actually engage in real journalism) will soon become tired of the same old anti-Obamacare rhetoric and Republican talking points and will start looking for a new “angle.”

The headline says it all: “For GOP, it's Time to Stop Criticizing Obamacare.”

Unless healthcare.gov or the Obama administration hand them a new reason to continue the negative onslaught (it will be a great relief to finally see the “drip,” “drip,” “drip” phase of negative Obamacare news be finally over with), the fact that this article appeared at all, least of all on a very mainstream outlet such as yahoo.com gives me hope that, perhaps, we're beginning to turn a corner regarding Obamacare (and the president's poll numbers, too (?)).

Can it be said that Obamacare is now turning a corner due to this one article? No. But, hopefully, this is an indicator.

It sure would be good to start the new year with a fresh media narrative regarding Affordable Care Act."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/uninsured-americans-are-about-as-skeptical-of-health-care-law-as-the-insured-poll-finds.html,2013-12-19 00:00:00,"['Abgoodnough', 'Allison Kopicki']",Uninsured Skeptical of Health Care Law in Poll,"WASHINGTON — Americans who lack medical coverage disapprove of President Obama’s health care law at roughly the same rate as the insured, even though most say they struggle to pay for basic care, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.

Fifty-three percent of the uninsured disapprove of the law, the poll found, compared with 51 percent of those who have health coverage. A third of the uninsured say the law will help them personally, but about the same number think it will hurt them, with cost a leading concern.

The widespread skepticism, even among people who are supposed to benefit from the law, underscores the political challenge facing the Obama administration as it tries to persuade millions of Americans to enroll in coverage through new online marketplaces, a crucial element of making the new law financially viable for insurers.

There are several reasons the uninsured appear to be as wary of the law as the insured, including opposition to the requirement that most people have insurance. Still, nearly six in 10 uninsured said having insurance would make their own health better. And 56 percent said they were more likely than not to get insurance by March 31, the deadline to enroll in coverage or face a tax penalty under the law. Thirty-five percent said they were more likely to pay the penalty."

Sarah Palin urged Americans to light up Capitol Hill switchboards to urge senators to live up to their campaign promises and support Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their effort to defund Obamacare.

“Remember, we elected these senators precisely for moments like this. If they can’t do anything with the power we’ve given them through their elected office, then perhaps it’s time for them to retire and let someone else have a go,” Palin said. “Opposition to Obamacare carried us to victory in 2010. And 2014 is just around the corner.”

On Saturday, Palin wrote an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News backing Lee and Cruz. In her Facebook post on Monday, the day the Obamacare fight started in the Senate, Palin said it was even more important for Americans living in red states–like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina–represented by Democrats to “politely” let their senators know there will be consequences at the ballot box if they vote procedurally to shut down debate in the Senate:

Please call your senators and politely ask them to stand with Senator Cruz. This is especially important if your senator is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state in 2014. That would be Senators Mark Begich (D-AK), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Kay Hagan (D-NC).

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is attempting to insert an amendment to that bill that funds Obamacare before sending the bill back to the House. On Monday, Cruz asked that there be a 60-vote threshold for amendments on the House bill being taken up in the Senate.

President defends health care law in Massachusetts%2C which has similar plan

Republicans criticize health care website and note that people are losing policies

Obama says Massachusetts also faced early problems but surmounted them

President Obama promoted his embattled health care law Wednesday by arguing that a similar plan in Massachusetts surmounted its early problems.

""Health care reform in this state was a success,"" Obama said during a speech at Boston's Faneuil Hall, the same place where then-Gov. Mitt Romney signed the Massachusetts plan into law in 2006.

""That doesn't mean it was perfect right away,"" Obama added. ""There were early problems to solve.""

With the rollout of Obamacare under fire from Republicans and some consumers, Obama said his plan will provide quality, affordable health care when it is fully operational.

Officials are ""working overtime"" to fix a website that has prevented many people from signing up, Obama said.

He also said that people who have had their insurance policies canceled are being offered better plans with more coverage as demanded by the Affordable Care Act.

""You're going to get a better deal,"" Obama said.

Obama also stressed that the Massachusetts law had bipartisan political support, a dig at Republicans who have consistently opposed the Obama plan.

Republicans said Obamacare has already been undermined by a malfunctioning website and people who have had policies canceled because of new regulations.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Obama had promised people they could keep their existing insurance, and they now feel betrayed.

""A website can be fixed,"" McConnell said. ""But the pain this law is causing — higher premiums and canceled coverage — that's what's really important. And that's what Democrats need to work with us to address by starting over fresh with true, bipartisan health reform.""

Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, said health care policy should be a responsibility of the states and that Obama has misread the lessons of the Massachusetts experience.

In a Facebook post, Romney said: ""Health reform is best crafted by states with bipartisan support and input from its employers, as we did, without raising taxes, and by carefully phasing it in to avoid the type of disruptions we are seeing nationally.""

Obama spoke just hours after congressional testimony by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who apologized for the poor website but also argued that the plan will work in the long run.

In his Boston speech, Obama said people who have had their insurance canceled had ""cut-rate"" policies that did not provide adequate coverage when people got sick.

The Affordable Care Act requires certain types of coverage and ends discrimination that has led to higher costs and cancellations for women and people with pre-existing medical conditions, the president said.

Some people will face higher costs, Obama said: ""To help pay for the law, the wealthiest Americans, families who make more than $250,000 a year, have got to pay a little bit more. The most expensive employer health insurance plans no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks.""

He said, ""Some folks aren't happy about that, but it's the right thing to do.""

Obama also decried what he called the politics surrounding Obamacare, saying some Republicans who are attacking it didn't want to overhaul health care in the first place.

""We are just going to keep on working at it,"" Obama said. ""We're going to grind it out, just like you did here in Massachusetts."""

Commissioner William White told The Washington Post on Saturday that he was called into Mayor Vincent Gray’s office the prior day and told the Democratic mayor “wants to go in a different direction.”

The president said Thursday that the millions of insurance plans scheduled to be canceled next year to comply with ObamaCare regulations could be extended for a year, after he told Americans prior to the law’s passage that they could keep their existing plans.

However, White and other insurance commissioners across the country have questioned the president’s proposed solution because it could create a mess in the marketplace.

Some of the top reasons for the commissioners’ objections are: policy prices are already locked in to comply with changes in ObamaCare; an extension could conflict with state-level laws to comply with the law and younger Americans needed to join the federal exchange to keep down costs will wait to enroll.

White told the newspaper that the deputy mayor who asked him to leave didn’t say the request was about his remarks.

City officials have not commented on the situation, saying they cannot discuss personnel issues. However, a city official suggested to The Post, on the condition anonymity, that White posted the statement on the city’s website before getting it approved.

The District and 16 states run their own health-care exchange, compared to the 36 states that have instead chosen to let residents shop and purchase insurance on the federal exchange.

“The action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate,” White said Thursday in a statement.

He also agrees with a National Association of Insurance Commissioners statement that said Obama’s order “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”"

USA TODAY

A Reagan appointee takes Obama to task ... for kowtowing to conservatives

%27Plan B%27 morning-after pill would be sold without an Rx%2C regardless of age

Federal judge overturns HHS ruling that limited sales to women 17 and older

WASHINGTON — Conventional politics flew out the window Friday in a federal judge's scathing attack on the Obama administration for banning the sale of over-the-counter contraceptives to young girls.

Usually, when a conservative court takes President Obama to task, you can bet it's for being too liberal. But in this case, federal District Court Judge Edward Korman — appointed to the Eastern District of New York by Ronald Reagan — castigated the administration for kowtowing to conservatives.

Korman ordered that ""morning-after"" contraceptives be sold nationwide without a prescription regardless of age, within 30 days. (The pill, popularly known as ""Plan B,"" typically works up to 72 hours after intercourse.) That overturns a decision made by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in 2011 that limited over-the-counter sales to women 17 and older.

Sebelius had overruled her own Food and Drug Administration, which has consistently ruled that the drugs are safe, citing the need to protect young girls from unwanted pregnancies. She was backed by Obama himself, the father of two young girls, who said it was only ""common sense"" that the drug not be available ""alongside bubble gum or batteries.""

""Common sense"" weren't the words that came to Korman's mind in his blistering, 59-page ruling. He called Sebelius' decision ""obviously political."" He said she forced the FDA to ""ride roughshod"" over its own policies. He said her reasons were ""so unpersuasive as to call into question her good faith.""

Korman's frustration stems in part from the duration of the case. He has been dealing with it for a decade, since the White House under President George W. Bush interfered with FDA decision-making. As a result, a drug considered safe by health and science advocates has been denied to many preteens and younger teens — in a country with declining but still higher teen pregnancy rates than any other developed nation.

So we have Korman, the Republican appointee, ordering the morning-after pill made available without a prescription to young girls — over the protestations of the Obama administration. And now we await the administration's response — on a day when politics as usual was anything but."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/06/27/Five-Facts-media-Arent-Reporting-on-Texas-Abortion-Filibuster,2013-06-27 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Five Facts The Media Aren't Telling You About the Texas Abortion Filibuster,"In the wake of Sandy Hook, to justify openly pressuring Congress to restrict our Second Amendment gun rights, the national media frequently pointed to polls showing majority public support for laws that would broaden the scope of background checks. When this law failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, the media bellyached for weeks about the filibuster and the GOP “obstructionism” that thwarts the will of the people.

This is not a new kind of media attack against the political right. Ever since Obama assumed the presidency, under the guise of reporting, the media have attacked our “do nothing” congress as dysfunctional and incapable of accomplishing anything. According to the media, a legislative body “doing nothing” is a huge problem. As the media push to see millions of Democrats legalized through immigration reform, look for this media narrative to explode at the GOP Congress.

But in reality, we all know that this is wild hypocrisy and that our media see some obstructionists who thwart the will of the people as a lot more equal than others.

Take for instance, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who is now a full-fledged national Media Dahling after her 11-hour filibuster managed to block the Texas Senate from passing laws that would have outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and made abortion clinics safer.

As I write this, Davis is being hailed all across the national news as a courageous, principled, instant superstar. ABC News, CBS News, The Washington Post… all hailed her obstructionism. Left-wing cable news outlets — CNN and MSNBC — were just as gushing; as were the morning news shows.

Anyone familiar with our media knows what the Media Narrative is here — all about gender politics, “reproductive rights,” and any other buzzword that can be utilized to place Wendy Davis astride a white horse, and her political opponents grunting away in that Neanderthal cave known as Texas.

Naturally, though, most of the national media are ignoring any pertinent facts inconvenient to their agenda. Here are five of them:

1. The Texas Bill will Make Abortion Safer: After the horrors discovered at the clinic of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell (which the media all-but ignored), many of which were only possible due to the local government’s politically motivated lack of oversight towards abortion clinics, Texas decided to act to make abortion safer. One of the primary objectives of the bill Davis filibustered is to ensure that women who seek a legal abortion are properly cared for.

This is what is in the bill Davis obstructed, and what some in media are cynically and dishonestly portraying as a move to force abortion clinics to close:

In truth, clinics would close only if they failed to meet new safety standards that have been drawn in response to the horror stories in Philadelphia and Houston. The new rules, as summarized by the Texas Alliance for Life, would have “increase[d] abortion facility safety standards to the level of ambulatory surgical centers to shut down Gosnell-like abortion providers in Texas,” “require[d] the 18,000 RU-486 abortions performed each year be done according to FDA safety standards,” and “require[d] physicians who perform abortions to be qualified to treat life-threatening complications after botched abortions and have privileges at a local hospital.”

2. The American People Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of the American people who, by 48% to 44%, favor what’s in the Texas bill: a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. A full 80% want abortion banned after the second trimester.

3. A Majority of American Women Back the Ban: Davis also obstructed the will of American women, who support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks at a higher percentage than men, 50% to 44%.

4. A Huge Majority of Texans Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of Texans; almost two-thirds (62%) of whom favor this ban on abortion after 20 weeks.

5. Late-term Abortion Ban Is More Popular with Women than ObamaCare: Yep.

—

We could add a number 6. Abortion is especially horrific after just a few weeks. Here is a fact the media never-ever report on, what the act of abortion really is:

At six weeks, the baby’s brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system are all pretty well formed — in outline at least. By the two-month mark, sensory organs begin to develop and bone replaces cartilage. …

At each of these stages, had the bill been passed, it would have remained legal in Texas to kill the child. The law that Wendy Davis and her fellow “pro-science” acolytes so bravely stood against would have rendered it illegal to kill the child after this point. And when I say kill, I mean kill. I mean break bones, rip apart limbs, crush skulls, drain fluids, still a beating heart, annihilate a brain that is capable of dreaming, and crush a nervous system. I mean: Kill.

Other than winning Barack Obama elections, nothing brings out our media’s bias, dishonesty, and hypocrisy like the issue of abortion.

He Has Been With The Los Angeles Times Since', 'Covering Technology News Before Joining The Opinion Section.']","Obamacare glitch may cost young smokers, spare older ones","This post has been updated, as indicated below.

The insurance reforms in the 2010 federal healthcare law (a.k.a. Obamacare) are expected to raise the price of coverage for younger, healthier Americans in order to make it more affordable for older, sicker ones. A computer glitch threatens to make that shift even more pronounced, albeit just for younger people who smoke.

Advertisement

The Obama administration confirmed Tuesday that a glitch in its software for evaluating insurance plans will prevent insurers from imposing as big a gap as they may have wanted between the premiums for younger and older smokers. In short, it means either older smokers will be charged less than insurers might have planned or young smokers will be charged more.

The glitch is (supposedly) temporary, and applies only to the market for individual insurance policies. And it may not affect some of the states running their own insurance exchanges, although it apparently will affect California. That’s because this state’s exchange, Covered California, is relying on the feds’ computers to check whether the premiums proposed by insurers comply with the law.

[Updated, 5:30 p.m. July 9: As it turns out, California’s reliance on the federal government’s computer system isn’t germane because Covered California previously decided not to allow insurers to charge smokers higher premiums, regardless of their age. It’s one of at least four states to bar the surcharges. That’s a win for smokers, whose risks will be spread across all those who shop at the exchange.]

To dive deeply into the weeds, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows insurers to vary their premiums in only four ways: They can charge more for family coverage than individual plans, and assess different premiums in different regions of a state. They can vary their premiums by age, but the highest age-based premiums can be no more than three times the lowest ones. And they can charge smokers up to 50% more than nonsmokers.

Advertisement

The law doesn’t require insurers to apply the same differential for smokers across the board. Insurers had been expected to apply a much higher differential to older smokers’ policies than younger smokers’ coverage, mainly because the latter tend to be a lot healthier than the former. As a result, the premiums for older smokers could be as much as 4.5 times what younger smokers pay.

These rules will be enforced by the federal government in at least the 33 states where Washington will be operating the local insurance exchange, along with any other state that is relying on Washington to evaluate insurers’ compliance. But the computer system the Department of Health and Human Services is using ran into some, err, computational issues that caused it to reject some proposed premiums that don’t actually violate the law.

Advertisement

As a result, next year insurers won’t be able to impose tobacco surcharges that push older smokers’ premiums more than three times higher than those paid by younger smokers.

“In 2015 and beyond, the system will expand to allow issuers to increase this ratio, if they choose to do so,” said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. “This is a temporary circumstance that in no way impacts our ability to open the [exchanges] on Oct. 1, when millions of Americans will be able to purchase quality, affordable insurance for the first time.”

Advertisement

Some analysts speculated that insurers would impose smaller-than-anticipated surcharges on older smokers to keep rates low for young smokers -- a relatively healthy group that insurers are afraid will be deterred by the cost of coverage. Without young people on board to balance out the risks posed by older consumers, insurers could be stuck with spiraling medical expenses.

Others, however, predicted that insurers would react by imposing higher surcharges than planned on younger smokers, raising the premium surcharges on older smokers as well.

Advertisement

What they will actually do, however, remains to be seen. No matter how small a surcharge they impose on young smokers, their premiums are still going to be higher than the ones for bare-bones policies available today. They’re also going to be considerably more expensive than the tax penalty imposed for not obtaining coverage, at least in 2014.

Ryan readies the new GOP budget, House Republicans are debating whether to apply the party’s proposed Medicare changes a year earlier than planned, when Americans who are now 56 reach retirement age.

No decision has been made, and Ryan declined to address the internal debate Wednesday. The party’s earlier promise to keep Medicare unchanged for those 55 and older has bumped up against its vow to balance the budget in 10 years.

The Medicare overhaul for the next generation of seniors will be a centerpiece of Ryan’s budget -- and fodder for Democrats’ criticism. Some Republicans indicated the party was more inclined to stick to its original plan rather than impose the new system sooner.

“Our goal is to get a down payment on this problem for America,” said Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman who was his party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee. “We need to prepare for the retirement of the baby boom of this country, to save these programs for not just the current retirees but for the next wave of retirees and the ones after that.”

Ryan’s budget, to be unveiled next week, is expected to be similar to those of past years, an austere blueprint that aims to dramatically reduce government outlays to stem the nation’s rising deficits and resulting debt. A conservative from the supply-side school of economics, Ryan is also expected to propose lowering tax rates for individuals and corporations to stimulate the economy.

Though the White House will almost certainly reject the blueprint, it will provide the opening salvo as Congress and the White House head toward the next pressure point in the budget battles. This summer, Washington will need to raise the debt ceiling again, reigniting President Obama’s calls for a grand bipartisan agreement on new taxes and spending cuts.

Ryan has spent the last several weeks in talks with rank-and-file Republicans who have different views on the best time to start the Medicare changes, which would provide a voucher-like payment that future seniors could apply toward the costs of private insurance or to enroll in traditional Medicare.

Some lawmakers feel compelled to stick with the original promise, which many of them campaigned on leading up to their reelection last fall, and not start the changes until those who are now under 55 become Medicare-eligible, at 65.

Advertisement

Others, though, say the more important pledge is to begin reforming Medicare to help improve the fiscal outlook, and they should pick up where they left off last year by applying the changes to those who are now 56 – arguing that another year has passed.

“Work in progress,” Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Wednesday.

Advertisement

Changing the start date comes with political risks, and Democrats have been happy to pounce on the proposed shift as a retreat on a Republican campaign promise.

At the same time, the initial budget savings from changing the age threshold are modest. Experts say the greater Medicare savings could come in future years, as the voucher-style program shifts the growing healthcare costs away from the government.

Advertisement

House Republicans are more unified on the goal of bringing budgets into balance in 10 years.

“I wouldn’t expect big surprises from us next week,” Ryan said. “We’re making some additional modest changes to get to balance.”

Advertisement

Ryan had nearly closed the deficit hole in his past budget efforts, and did not have far to go.

His task was made easier by the new revenue coming from the New Year’s tax hikes, as well as the sequester cuts now slicing across the budget.

Advertisement

The savings from the new healthcare law also have figured into the improved budget outlook, Ryan said Wednesday.

Obamacare remains a political albatross for Democrats, but a government shutdown has proven to be more toxic to voters.

2. The plan of using a government shutdown to spark a national discussion on Obamacare fell flat.

3. While the White House and some in the media view the government

shutdown through the lens of the Tea Party, the intransigent factions of Republicans and Democrats are equal in size.

4. Women are following the government shutdown more closely than men, and that should be concerning for Republicans.

We entered the government shutdown certain of one thing:

there will be no shortage of blame to go around. Above 50 percent in January,

President Obama’s job approval now registers in the low-to-mid 40’s, and voters

are increasingly pessimistic about the direction of the country

The shutdowntoxic to voters, but how much of an albatross can Obamacare be for Democrats when they handily won the 2012 elections? It's true, more people disapprove of the law, but the polling also consistently shows that 1) people don't understand the law, and 2) people support individual components of the law. That's why Republicans haven't been able to capitulate on the supposed opposition to it, it's why people don't want to see the law defunded, and certainly not via government shutdown, and why support for the law isas people start paying more attention to it.No shit.Somehow, the fact that Democrats want Democrats to hold firm means something to these guys. Not sure why. Fact is, the government shutdown is being viewed through the lens of the Tea Partythey are responsible for it. It's true, the terrorist gets more attention than his victims.Memo to GOP pollsters at Resurgent Republic: that ""rebranding"" thing was soooo January 2013.Obama hasn't seen 50 percent approval since February , so the fact that he was above 50 percent at the time is irrelevant to how the shutdown is playing. If you look at a more narrow slice of time, as in the last week, the president has actually seen his numbers go up in the most recent NBC/WSJ, Rasmussen (ha!), and Fox (ha ha!) polls and has been mostly stable according to everyone else.

Now that they've surveyed the state of public opinion (as well as Republicans can, being that they are Republican), they now get down to giving some advice. Try not to cringe too much.



Public opinion remains stacked against Obamacare, and this is problematic for Senate Democrats in red states, so conservatives should look to 2014 and highlight Obamacare’s policy and implementation woes along the way.

The reasonableness of President Obama has been tarnished in the shutdown.

The president strikes a harsh chord when his message to Congress and the American people is a barrage about not negotiating rather than leading a divided government

Let’s remember, not long ago voters believed Mitt Romney, not President Obama, was better able to bridge the partisan divide

Habitually labeling Republicans as arsonists and hostage takers reminds voters of the president’s own weakness in this area.

While this is not your 90’s shutdown, it is not an envious position for Republicans either

If Republicans can put the shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror, they can move to a more favorable playing field, connecting with a majority of Independents who want the government to stop spending money it doesn’t have.

In reality, November 2014 can't get here soon enough. Even in those Red states like North Carolina Louisiana , and even Arkansas . Heck, Republicans actually need to start worrying about their own Red states of Georgia and Kentucky No evidence, other than the fervent wishes of conservative pollsters, apparently.He sounds a principled, strong chord. You say ""tomato"", I say ""good luck with that, buddy.""And Mitt Romney won!This'll certainly be a problem for Obama's 2016 reelection bid, given how it made him lose in 2012.It's worse than your 90s shutdown.That's the biggest fucking ""if"" I have ever seen. Before they can put any shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror they have to capitulate to Obama and the Democrats by providing a clean continuing budget resolution and a clean raising of the debt limit. And if they do that, the party's fringy base will explode, littering that ""favorable playing field"" with the debris of a once-vibrant national party.

But let's say they do that, and the GOP ""connects"" with those independents ... so what? Romney won Independents in 2012 by a 50-45 margin. ""Independent"" includes ""teabaggers and other assorted conservatives too embarrassed to say they are Republicans"". The big question is whether the GOP can connect with moderates, who were 41 percent of the 2012 electorate and went to Obama by a whopping 56-41 margin."

(CNN) —

With a possible government shutdown in five days, House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday signaled a shift in Republican tactics with the focus now on negotiating a compromise on raising the federal debt ceiling next month instead of a short-term spending plan now.

He and other GOP leaders called on President Barack Obama to negotiate an agreement with them to increase how much the government can borrow to pay its bills in exchange for concessions they seek such as delaying the implementation of Obamacare.

However, Obama later made clear that he rejected any political bartering on the debt ceiling.

“I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America,” he said.

It is one of two potential showdowns embroiling Congress as deadlines loom to fund the government before the end of the current fiscal year on Monday, as well as increasing the debt ceiling by October 17.

The Democratic-led Senate is considering a spending plan sent over by the Republican-led House that makes continued government funding contingent on eliminating all money for Obamacare.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says his caucus will restore the funding for the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of Obama’s first term that was passed by Democrats and upheld by the Supreme Court.

The spending measure would then go back to the House with time running out to act before a shutdown begins on Tuesday.

Fed up over Beltway shutdown battle

GOP battle line moving to debt ceiling

At a news conference after meeting with his GOP caucus, Boehner indicated the House might further revise the Senate’s version of the spending plan, but he also told reporters that he didn’t expect a government shutdown to happen.

Instead, he and other House GOP leaders focused on the debt ceiling, with Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia citing a Bloomberg poll Thursday that showed a strong majority support a compromise on the debt ceiling instead of simply increasing it without spending cuts or other steps.

“They don’t want a government shutdown, but they are tired of the debt and they want to make sure that this president sits down and negotiates with us a resolution to this problem,” Cantor said. “So we call on the president now to sit down with us, Harry Reid to sit down with us, and let’s solve the problem. This plan of more debt and no reform is absolutely unacceptable.”

Cantor confirmed that a House proposal to raise the debt ceiling would include a one-year delay in the full implementation of Obamacare, as well as other provisions from measures passed by House Republicans but ignored by the Senate such as building the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada.

To Obama, such an offer amounts to trying to “blackmail a president into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with the budget,” he said in a speech in Maryland on Obamacare.

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters a one-year delay in implementing Obamacare’s individual mandate for people to obtain health insurance would undermine a key provision of the program that prohibits the denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions.

“The fact is you have to make the system work,” Carney said, adding people with pre-existing conditions won’t be denied insurance under Obamacare “because of the expansion of the number of people who will be covered and participate in these marketplaces provided by the Affordable Care Act through the individual mandate.”

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said Thursday that focusing on the debt ceiling was where House Republicans “wanted to wage this fight all along.”

“They didn’t want to get bogged down in the government shutdown fight, but a conservative revolt within the House Republican ranks forced them to get there,” King said.

Conservative backlash

However, some conservative House Republicans emerging from a meeting Thursday with Boehner said they won’t simply accept the Senate’s version of the spending plan needed to avoid a shutdown. They also expressed reservations about the proposal outlined by Boehner and Cantor for raising the debt ceiling.

Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama said the GOP leadership’s plan on the debt ceiling would extend it until after next year’s congressional election and include provisions sought by Republicans, but he complained it didn’t cut spending enough to satisfy him. Brooks also said the debt ceiling issue should be part of the election debate next year.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said this week the debt ceiling must be raised by October 17, or the government may not have enough money to pay all of its bills.

Analysts warn of severe economic impact in that case. A similar bout of congressional brinksmanship over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.

Obama cited that potential harm to a still sluggish recovery on Thursday, saying the world looked to America for economic leadership and stability.

“You don’t mess with that,” he said to cheers in Maryland.

However, King said the president previously negotiated on the need to increase how much the federal government can borrow to meet its obligations, such as in the 2011 showdown that led to deep spending cuts sought by Republicans.

“The Republicans think that is safer ground politically. The question is, can they actually get anything from the president?” King said.

Noting Obama has previously accused Republicans of having an unreasonable “my way or the highway” stance, he said the GOP can now accuse the president of doing the same thing by refusing to negotiate on the debt ceiling.

Senate spending plan

In the Senate, tea party conservatives led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas reversed themselves on Wednesday by joining colleagues from both parties in a 100-0 procedural vote to take up the House spending plan expected to be revised to fund Obamacare.

Cruz supported the move after he spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government money for the health care reforms.

The rare unanimous vote on a procedural step signaled that Senate Democrats would be able to amend the plan to restore the Obamacare funding.

On Thursday, Reid made clear that if the House then made further changes to the revised spending proposal sent back by the Senate, it would cause at least a short-term government shutdown because of the time it would take the Senate to reconsider the measure.

Cruz had led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block Senate consideration of the spending legislation.

However, he came under strong criticism from fellow Republicans including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other influential veterans such as Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee for that strategy, which called for GOP senators to filibuster the House measure that – in its original form – would defund programs under the Affordable Care Act.

The Obamacare question

Corker told CNN on Wednesday that a better idea would be to get the bill back to the House as soon as possible so the Republican majority there can offer a compromise.

“House members are already talking about how they might respond if the defunding component ends up being stripped out,” Corker said, adding he hoped that the Senate would “give the House some time to respond in a thoughtful way.”

With Obamacare markets for the uninsured set to open on October 1, which also begins the new fiscal year, GOP opponents consider this their last best chance to undermine or amend the health care reforms.

What happens in a government shutdown

GOP infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding Obamacare escalated this week as McConnell publicly dismissed Cruz’s more confrontational strategy.

Cruz’s GOP critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House.

They believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown – or preventing an increase in the debt ceiling next month – will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the Republican brand.

By David Morgan and Lewis Krauskopf

Dec 2 (Reuters) - A surge of visitors clogged the U.S. government's revamped healthcare insurance shopping website on Monday, signaling that President Barack Obama's administration has a way to go in fixing the portal that showcases his signature domestic policy.

Facing its first big test since officials proclaimed over the weekend that they had met their deadline to make HealthCare.gov run smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users, the site performed markedly better than it did during its disastrous launch two months ago - but was still short of the crisply running insurance marketplace Obama once touted.

By 12 p.m. ET (1700 GMT), the website had logged 375,000 visitors, the White House said, nearly half the 800,000 daily users the refurbished site is supposed to be able to handle.

In states such as New jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, the rush of traffic led to the deployment of a new feature on the site - a waiting page that said there were ""a lot of visitors right now,"" and put people in line to be serviced, usually within minutes or even seconds.

That was viewed as significant progress for a website that has become the face of perhaps one of the biggest crises of Obama's administration, one that has undermined the Democratic president's promotion of an activist government and threatened to become a drag on Democrats in next year's elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.

But HealthCare.gov's hiccups on Monday fueled questions about whether it will be able to enroll several million uninsured and under-insured Americans in private insurance programs by the end of March - a major goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

More immediately, the website will be pushed further by waves of visitors seeking to sign up for insurance by Dec. 23, the deadline to get coverage that begins Jan. 1.

For all of the efforts by tech specialists to improve the site, officials still are scrambling to repair and install functions on the ""back end"" of the Obamacare system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers. That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin.

""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.""

The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention efforts to nail down functions for handling insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage under Obamacare.

Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014.

At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website.

Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system.

""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said.

ENCOURAGING NUMBERS

For the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since Oct. 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll.

Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people chose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site.

The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York.

Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.

That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators.

Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment.

Shortly after 8 p.m., Cruz announced he would begin reading ""bedtime stories"" to his two young daughters . . . Then he read the Dr. Seuss classic, ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" in its entirety, noting that it was one of his favorite children's books.

This is an odd choice of a book for Senator Cruz to read in that its message actually supports the position of the Democrats that the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare) should be allowed to go into effect as scheduled.

In the story Green Eggs and Ham, the narrator starts by telling the reader how he does not like Green Eggs and Ham under any circumstance. A lot of the book contains lists of circumstances under which the narrator would not eat Green Eggs and Ham. For example:



I do not like them

in a house.

I do not like them

with a mouse.

I do not like them

here or there.

I do not like them

anywhere.

I do not like green eggs and ham.

I do not like them, Sam-I-am.

Then the narrator, after much urging by Sam-I-Am, eats the green eggs and ham to prove Sam-I-Am wrong. However, much to the narrator's surprise, he actually likes Green Eggs and Ham.



Say!

I like green eggs and ham!

I do!! I like them, Sam-I-am!

And I would eat them in a boat!

And I would eat them with a goat...

And I will eat them in the rain.

And in the dark. And on a train.

And in a car. And in a tree.

They are so good so good you see!

The narrator then goes on to actually thank Sam-I-Am for encouraging him to try the Green Eggs and Ham.



I do so like

green eggs and ham!

Thank you!

Thank you,

Sam-I-am

Senator Cruz-Obamacare is like Green Eggs and Ham. Like the narrator in the story, some people have come to the conclusion (after hearing a lot of right wing propaganda) that they won't like Obamacare even though they have never tried it. A lot of their opposition is based on their fear of trying something different from what they are used to. However, like the narrator in the story, once the American people try Obamacare, I think that they will like it. And like the narrator in the story who thanks Sam-I-Am for forcing him to try the green eggs and ham, I think that the American People will ultimately thank President Obama and the Democrats for Obamacare."

Renee Ellmers (R-NC), for pinning Sebelius down on the question of why Obamacare requires men to buy maternity coverage. Sebelius tried to squirm away–as she had done with many other questioners, but Ellmers was on her “A” game.

Ellmers’s performance was particularly commendable because she is lower in the congressional pecking order and therefore had to wait until the end, with less time to spare. She even found time, using a pointed yes-or-no question, to puncture Democrats’ favorite dodge–namely, that helped Republicans improve Medicare Part D, even though they had opposed it. (Unlike Obamacare, Medicare Part D is voluntary, as Sebelius had to admit.)

Next, Ellmers turned to the fact that Obamacare makes consumers pay more for insurance they do not need (much like being forced to buy a fancy car with all of the options, when a basic new car or used car would have been fine).

The ensuing exchange should be studied by Republicans for future reference. This is how it’s done:"

Now they've launched a new campaign of lies, aiming their pocketbook at Obamacare, or, more accurately, at those who stand to benefit from its reforms. You know, small, ""special-interest"" groups like, say: women (and the people who love them), young people between the ages of 19 and 26 , as well as others (and their affected families) who can't get coverage at work, or lose coverage when they lose their job, or can't get coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Does that sound to you like just about all of us at one point in our lives? Yeah, me too.

The Koch brothers' campaign is merely part of a larger, truly unprecedented Republican strategy to sabotage the entire health care law passed in 2009 by a Democratic House and Senate and signed by President Obama.

The Republicans need the law to fail because its success will only further cement the reality that government regulations can and do bring tangible benefits to people. In other words, the law's success will translate into further defeats for their party and for their extreme anti-government ideology. This has been the Republican thinking on health care reform for 20 years. Will the Koch/Republican campaign succeed? Not if we can help it.

These thoughts were on my mind as I had a conversation with a physician I know, an obstetrician-gynecologist. The physician mentioned a patient who asked if the implementation of Obamacare would alter her relationship with her doctor or the practice in general. The patient was quite concerned, unsurprisingly, as change can be unsettling—especially change relating to one's health care.

The physician put the patient at ease, explaining that the patient-doctor relationship would not change, that she'd be able to continue seeing her current doctor. On the other hand, the Koch brothers' ad includes ""Julie"" asking: ""If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know our family is going to get the care they need?"" Of course, there's nothing in the health care legislation that reduces a patient's ability to choose his or her own doctor.

For the rest of the conversation, please follow me beyond the fold."

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Tuesday that she and several of her Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are considering suing President Barack Obama for allowing plans canceled under the Affordable Care Act to be extended through 2014.

According to Politico, Bachmann, speaking at an event sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, accused the president of violating the constitutional separation of powers by changing the health care law through administrative means, rather than consulting Congress.

""That's the essence of lawlessness and now it's our time to defend our prerogative,"" she said.

When asked about the lawsuit by MinnPost, Bachmann's office said a lawsuit was not imminent, but was under discussion.

""She and some of her colleagues have had discussions about the best recourse to put a stop to his unconstitutional actions,"" a spokesman said in a statement.

Last week, facing backlash over plan cancellations under the health care law, Obama asked insurers to let individuals whose plans had been cancelled to renew their plans another year.

""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

The White House later offered legal justification for Obama's fix to the Washington Post's Greg Sargent.

“The Supreme Court held more than 25 years ago that agencies charged with administering statues have inherent authority to exercise discretion to ensure that their statutes are enforced in a manner that achieves statutory goals and are consistent with other administrative policies,"" a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said. ""Agencies may exercise this discretion in appropriate circumstances, including when implementing new or different regulatory regimes, and to ensure that transitional periods do not result in undue hardship.”"

This morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act while cute was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.

When asked about the Affordable Care Act the women above were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. The two women interviewed are probative.

If these women understood that Obamacare forced insurance companies to use at least 80 percent of their premiums to pay for health care cost, prevent insurance companies from rescinding their policies when they most needed it most, provide breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other health screenings as part of every policy, prevent lifetime caps that likely prevent most medical bankruptcies, and ensure that everybody have skin in the health care domain who can afford it, would they think differently? Would they think differently when they realize that pre-Obamacare the wild wild west of medical insurance was more about profits than health outcomes? When the morality of America’s health care system pre and post Obamacare is examined, many of those opposing will be ashamed of their opposing stance.

The interview went well and just talking to them gives me hope that when the truth is spoken and respect is acquired, people can agree on real truths.

For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits.

We have also been told that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy.

As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:

The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.

Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.

But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.

The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%.

Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end.

The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:

Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.

Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.

The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.

The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.

Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details.

While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.

The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

President Obama addresses supporters at Planned Parenthood conference

Obama tells crowd he will fight attempts to restrict abortion rights and other services for women

Also says he will defend Planned Parenthood against proposed funding cuts

President Obama told Planned Parenthood on Friday he will fight various efforts to restrict women's access to abortion, contraceptives and other services.

""When it comes to a women's health, no politician should get to decide what's best for you,"" Obama told delegates at a Planned Parenthood national conference in Washington. ""The only person who should get to make decisions about your health is you.""

Obama also reassured the group he would block efforts by congressional Republicans to shut off their funding, saying that many women see Planned Parenthood as their primary source of health care.

""Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere,"" Obama said. ""It's not going anywhere today, it's not going anywhere tomorrow.""

Some congressional Republicans say Planned Parenthood should not receive federal funding because it promotes abortion.

Obama did not use the word ""abortion"" during his remarks, but said the ""right to choose"" has long been upheld by courts.

Women voters provided heavy support to Obama in both of his election victories, and the president spent most of his speech defending women's rights, particularly in the area of health care.

Citing efforts in some states to restrict access to certain services, including abortion, Obama said it looks like some lawmakers want to turn back the clock to the 1950s.

Women's autonomy is one of the concepts behind the new health care law, Obama said, and he urged Planned Parenthood delegates to spread the word about how the new law works."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/20/Harry-Reid-s-Obamacare-Act-What-s-Good-for-Thee-is-Not-Good-for-Me,2013-09-20 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],Harry Reid's Obamacare Act: 'What's Good for Thee is Not Good for Me',"On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) indicated on the floor of the Senate he was “open to having a vote” on Senator David Vitter’s (R-LA) amendment to eliminate the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress, according to a Breitbart source on Capitol Hill. Today, however, he and his Democratic colleagues are singing a different tune, and the lyrics come straight from that timeless phrase used by hypocrites throughout American history: “What’s good for thee is not good for me.”

In early September, Reid defended the exemption to Obamacare granted to members of Congress and their staffers by the Office of Personnel and Management on August 7. As Heritage’s The Foundry pointed out, “there is no statutory authority, either in Obamacare or in Title V of the U.S Code, for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to make government insurance contributions on behalf of federal employees to any plan other than an FEHBP plan.”

But when Vitter introduced his No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment on September 12, Reid was forced to make a decision on whether it should be brought to a vote. As Majority Leader of the Senate, Reid exercises power by determining what bills will come to a vote in committees and before the full Senate.

Reid has indicated from the outset that he opposes Vitter’s amendment, but he has attempted to maintain the public fiction that the amendment would receive the same treatment as any amendment proposed by any member of the Senate.

Despite significant evidence to the contrary, Reid continues to insist that the Congressional exemption authorized by the Office of Personnel Management is contained within the law. But on Tuesday, Vitter called the Congressional Obamacare exemption “flat out against the law,” and that exposure of Reid’s blatant hypocrisy may have been too much for the Majority Leader to take.

When Senate Democrats subsequently prevented Vitter’s amendment from coming to a vote, Vitter took to the floor of the Senate and delivered a statement that called Reid out on his hypocrisy. “After freaking out last Thursday with threats and bribery, this week Harry Reid said he’s fine with an up-or-down vote on my No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment. I guess that was just a weak attempt at disguising his fear about losing his special exemption,” he said.

According to a statement issued by his office on Thursday, “Vitter’s amendment would reverse and clarify the decision by the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) on Obamacare. The legislation will require that all Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, and all political appointees in the Administration must purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange without the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies. Congressional staff would be prohibited from receiving any contribution greater than what they would receive if they were not employed by a congressional office.”

Tea party stalwart Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the Vitter amendment, along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY), Dean Heller (R-V), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK)."

This Thanksgiving, she and her family sat down to explore their options in the new insurance marketplace. After about 45 minutes online, they selected a midlevel, or silver, plan that would cost the family about $30 a month, after tax-credit subsidies based on income.

“We were shocked,” Ms. He said. “I actually called a few places to verify that.” [...]

At 61 years old, Bruce Kleinschmidt, a lawyer who is mostly retired, has no illusions about whether he needs health insurance. He has a chronic sinus condition that has required three operations, including one last year, and has had a few serious accidents over the years, including a fall that required back surgery. Doctors also recently diagnosed a heart condition. [...]

“I have been declined before,” he said.

The coverage available through the state high-risk pools for people like him, Mr. Kleinschmidt said, typically have “extraordinarily high premiums with really high deductibles.” On the state’s new online exchange, he was able to select a plan from a well-known insurer that came with a deductible of only $1,000.

“It’s a godsend,” he said. [...]

Tasha Huebner, 45, had long wanted to leave Chicago, but one of the biggest roadblocks was the fear of losing her health insurance. Ms. Huebner learned that she had breast cancer five years ago and, given her costly medical history, knew the chances of a new insurer accepting her were slim.

So when she finally sold her house and moved to Silverton, Ore., this year, she did so knowing that the new health care law would soon make it much easier for people like her to get coverage. Under the law, insurers cannot turn away people with existing medical conditions, nor charge them more for coverage. [...]

So she turned to the new exchange after it opened on Oct. 1. Oregon’s online marketplace has not worked properly, but Ms. Huebner figured out that a midlevel plan would cost her about $300 a month — within her budget. If she qualifies for subsidies — which is uncertain, given her unpredictable income —her bill may drop to about $150, she said. She applied through the mail and is awaiting approval.

Ms. Huebner said she is in good health and is training for two half-marathons. But she needs annual mammograms and checkups with an oncologist, and she lives with the knowledge that her cancer could return.

“I’m young,” she said. “The chances are that it will come back.”

For that reason, she said, being able to afford health insurance is “just a huge, huge relief.”"

Her remarks bolster Rep. Sean Duffy’s (R-WI) claim that the mainstream press may be both ill-prepared and unwilling to critically question the Obama administration on its signature healthcare legislation.

Appearing on Mitchell Reports, Duffy and Mitchell got into a contested debate about whether a one-year delay of the individual mandate, which Republicans want as part of a short-term resolution to fund the government, was negotiable and whether the mainstream media has properly questioned the administration on Obamacare.

At one point during the exchange, Duffy said:

And why won’t he join us in ObamaCare? Why wasn’t Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for ObamaCare? Or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan that they’re in and they don’t-

Mitchell then responded, “So do you.”

Instantly, Duffy replied that he did not have a “gold-plated” plan because he had to be on Obamacare:

No I’m not, I’m in ObamaCare. I’m in ObamaCare, Andrea. All members of Congress are, and my family. The President should join us in ObamaCare, and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should all be treated equally under the law? Why should members of Congress be in ObamaCare and not the President? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair?

Duffy continued to ask Mitchell if she could “defend why the President shouldn’t be in ObamaCare like members of Congress and their staffs?”

“I think the media should start doing its job,” Duffy said.

Mitchell, visibly annoyed, then semi-sardonically responded, “Thanks for your advice. Thank you, Congressman.”

Earlier in the interview, Mitchell insisted Duffy’s demands were “non-negotiable” before Duffy said Obama is essentially saying, “I get my gold-plated health care plan but I want members of Congress and the rest of America to be in ObamaCare.”

He then pointed out that a big issue many Americans have with the media is that the it does not ask the question, “Why are you treating families different than big businesses?”

“You need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask Secretary Sebelius, ‘Hey, why won’t you treat these two equally?'” Duffy said. “And she can’t answer it. I mean, that’s how pathetic I think news reporting has become, when we won’t ask tough questions to the administration.”

Duffy kept pressing Mitchell and asked her if she and her colleagues have asked Obama and those in his administration, “Why do you want your own health care and you won’t join us in ObamaCare?”

After Mitchell surmised what she thought Sebelius’s response would be to such a question, Duffy pointed out Mitchell could not point out how Sebelius has answered the question because members of the mainstream press have not posed it to her."

http://news.yahoo.com/not-fast-obamas-health-care-law-changing-222047704--politics.html,,[],Not so fast: Obama's health care law is changing,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just when you thought you had the president's health care law figured out, it's changing.

Some questions and answers about what's afoot and who's affected:

Q: What's the nub of the change, and why is President Barack Obama changing course at this late date?

A: The president is letting insurance companies offer people another year of coverage under their existing plans even if those plans don't meet the requirements set out in his health care overhaul law. He's doing so because of mounting frustration — even anger — over the millions of cancellation notices that have been going out to Americans whose plans don't measure up to the law's coverage standards.

Q: Problem solved?

A: Not so fast. Obama's so-called fix doesn't force insurance companies to do anything. It just gives them the option of extending old plans for existing customers in the individual market, and only if state insurance commissioners also give their OK.

Q: Sounds like a no-brainer. Why wouldn't insurance companies let people re-up?

A: The companies aren't happy about being thrown a curve ball after they've already firmed up 2014 rates and plans. It will take a while to see how many of them agree to reinstate old plans for another year — and at what price.

Q: What's the early word?

A: Most companies and state insurance commissioners say they need time to study the changes before making a commitment. Aetna Inc., the nation's third largest health insurer, said it plans to extend some of its canceled policies. Washington state's insurance commissioner said he won't allow insurance companies there to extend the old policies. He said people can get better coverage on the new health care exchange.

Q: Why not force insurance companies to extend those old policies, not just give them that option?

A: That's a more radical step. Some Democrats want that to happen but it almost certainly would require legislation from Congress — not just a presidential decision — and Republicans would object to such a stiff new requirement on the insurance industry. More steps may be required, though, to restore coverage for people losing it.

Story continues

Q: The changes mainly affect the 5 percent of people who get their own insurance policies through the individual market. What's the big deal?

A: In a country of more than 300 million people, 5 percent is a big number. Roughly 14 million people buy their own policies, and many of those plans are not just junk insurance, contrary to what White House officials suggest. Already, more than 4 million people have gotten cancellation notices. And some small businesses are losing coverage for their workers too.

Plus, if the government can't get its HealthCare.gov website running better by Dec. 15, some people who got cancellations run the risk of having a break in coverage. The health care law was supposed to reduce the number of uninsured people, not increase it.

Q: So people who successfully make the switch to the new insurance marketplaces can rest easy?

A: Not really. If lots of healthy people who get cheaper insurance through the individual market end up keeping that coverage instead of switching to the more robust plans offered through ""Obamacare,"" that could weaken the financial footing of plans offered by the insurance marketplaces.

Q: How so?

A: People with current plans are a known risk to insurers. At some point, they all had to pass the stiff medical screening that the law forbids starting next year. Insurers were counting on premiums from those with current individual plans to help balance out the cost of care for people who have been shut out of the system, and who represent a potentially high risk. To the extent that healthier people stay out of the new insurance pool being created under the law, that would raise costs.

Q: What would happen then?

A: You guessed it: higher rates, potentially. Premiums for 2014 are set; where the increases would show up is in premiums for 2015. In a letter to state insurance commissioners Thursday, the Obama administration referred to the risk of ""unanticipated changes in premium revenue."" It promised to provide assistance through other provisions of the health care law.

Q: I get my insurance through my job. Sounds like I don't need to worry.

A: The vast majority of people with employer-based plans shouldn't be affected by the changes announced by Obama.

Q: The health care law was signed into law in 2010. Why is this issue coming up at the last minute?

A: The Obama administration miscalculated — big time — how many people would lose coverage in the transition to the new health insurance marketplace. It specified that people who had plans before the law took effect could hang on to those plans. But it didn't anticipate the big wave of cancellations among people who had plans that changed after the law took effect or who bought new plans after the law kicked in.

Q: The president says ""this fix"" won't solve every problem and that doing more will require working with Congress. What else needs to be done? And is there any hope of Obama and the Congress agreeing on changes?

A: Before Washington became so politically polarized, major legislation was usually followed within a year or two by a ""technical corrections"" bill that addressed inevitable unintended consequences and shortcomings. A bill as massive as the Affordable Care Act has many such issues, which the administration has tried to address through regulations, ""guidance"" and other administrative steps. For example, the White House last summer delayed the law's employer coverage requirement by one year to allow more time to work out regulatory issues.

Obama seems to be yearning for a return to earlier days, but Republicans are so adamant in opposing the health care law that it seems far from likely.

This, apparently, is Mr. Weatherford's definition of The Golden Rule

In the morning speech explaining his resistance to expanding health coverage for the poor, Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, told the House and Senate, meeting in a joint session on the Legislature’s opening day, about his family’s circumstances when he was 15 and his brother, Peter, age 2, died of cancer after surgeries and a year’s worth of treatment had drained the family’s savings. His father, who was self-employed, and his mother, who home-schooled the family’s nine children, faced a “mountain of medical bills,” Weatherford, 33, said. The family was uninsured. “It was the safety net that picked my family up,” Weatherford said. “I will continue to believe in – and fight for – a strong safety net for Florida.” Hours after his speech, when asked to expand on his story, Weatherford told reporters that his family didn’t receive Medicaid.

Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford is a rising star in conservative political circles. Yesterday, the 33-year-old Republican appeared to burnish those credentials, receiving a standing ovation after delivering a passionate speech decrying Gov. Rick Scott's decision to take advantage of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. The Palm Beach Post reports Weatherford initially said he didn't know precisely who paid for the care, but later in the day a staffer soon told The Palm Beach Post that the cost had been written off by medical professionals as charity care. That story supported the premise of Weatherford's argument: Instead of expanding money pits like Medicaid, Florida should fight for the safety net that helped his family when it was in need.

As you'll see below the fold, the only problem with the story is that it wasn't true."

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","Despite gov't assurances, some could see insurance costs soar under ObamaCare","While the administration maintains that ObamaCare will make health insurance more affordable for Americans, experts say that won’t be the case across the board – and some people could see their rates soar.

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius released an overview of premiums and plan choices, saying “For millions of Americans, these new options will finally make health insurance work within their budgets.”

The administration also said premiums would generally be lower than what congressional budget experts had estimated during debate on the legislation.

But former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin said Thursday, “unfortunately you can go all through that HHS report and not be able to answer the most important question: will my insurance rates go up in 2014?""

""They cherry picked the data in order to highlight the fact that people of low income will benefit under the law,"" adds Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a New York-based think tank. ""But people of middle income will not. And they didn’t really talk about that.""

The new law requires the addition of what it calls essential benefits -- a list of things that must be covered and which make insurance more expensive than it is now.

""This report is intended to send the message, 'hey everybody wins, this is a great thing, please show up,""says Holtz-Eakin.

""That's not the reality. The reality is much messier. There's going to be some people who do better. There are going to be a lot of people who do much, much worse.""

The Manhattan Institute analyzed rates around the country and found that for people of medium income, costs will soar -- up by as much as 99 percent for men, and up about 55 percent for women.

""Even if the average American gets some subsidy, a partial subsidy,"" says Roy, who authored the study,""that partial subsidy won't be enough to overcome the dramatic increase in the cost of insurance, the underlying cost of insurance ObamaCare imposes on the market.""

But insurance premiums are only one part of the puzzle. Most plans also have very high deductibles.

""Do you have a large deductible?"" asks Holtz-Eakin. ""How much do you have to pay before the insurance starts picking up the cost?""

Analysts expect deductibles to be in the $5,000 to $6,000 range for the lowest level of coverage, the bronze plan.

Dan Mendelson, CEO and founder at Avalere Health in Washington,says,""So, if you're in a bronze plan, the premiums are going to be relatively low, you know, as HHS said, in some cases people won't pay premiums at all.

“But there are going to be very high out of pocket costs and deductibles in some cases are going to be over $5,500.""

That means a person with a plan at that level might only pay $100 dollars a month in premiums, as the administration has said.

But depending on medical events, the deductible could add almost $500 dollars a month more, without even counting the co-pays"

Insurers say Obama%27s %27fix%27 has put them in a bind

Some people hope to keep old policies%3B others say they%27re better off%2C won%27t go back

Battle over whether consumers can keep canceled policies will be fought in the states

Cathy Pedersen is in what amounts to health insurance limbo.

When President Obama announced a rule change last week to his Affordable Care Act that potentially would allow hundreds of thousands of Americans to keep their old insurance plans, Pedersen saw a glimmer of hope that the inexpensive, high-deductible plan she's been purchasing for nearly 20 years wouldn't be canceled after all.

Soon after Obama announced the rule change, Pederson of Gilbert, Ariz., made a quick call to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona to see if she could get back her old plan, which did not meet ACA minimum requirements.

She was told by a customer service representative that the insurer was still consulting with Arizona's insurance commission on whether it will make her 2013 plan available again after it expires Dec. 31.

""I cannot afford to pay $200 more per month,"" said Pedersen, 54, who added that the cheapest alternative policy she's found with the newly established federal government exchange would more than double the $186 monthly premium she paid in 2013. ""We're more than halfway into November, and my insurance broker is telling me it takes up to 45 days to get on a plan. I just feel like this situation did not have to happen.""

In addition to Obama's proposed administrative fix, the GOP-led House approved legislation Friday — which has little chance of becoming law — that would allow insurers to continue offering health care plans to new and existing customers through next year, even if the plans do not meet the minimum benefit requirements.

The true battle of whether Americans such as Pedersen will be able keep their policies next year will largely be fought on the state level in the days ahead. Many who received cancellation notices and have shopped for new coverage must calculate whether they are better off sticking with what they have or trying to get back on their old plans.

The health insurance market is regulated by states, and insurance commissioners who have spoken out on Obama's proposed fix have been split on whether they will make any changes to accommodate the president's rule change.

Obama met with executives from 15 leading insurance companies Friday and encouraged them to support his administrative fix, which is meant to address the problem of mass cancellations of policies despite his oft-repeated promise that Americans would be able to keep their insurance policies if they liked them.

Industry analysts say Obama is putting insurers in a bind and it may not be practical for insurers to rescind cancellations. Under the law, to have coverage take effect by Jan. 1, the consumers must make their coverage elections by Dec. 15.

Insurers are essentially being given a month to reprogram their computer systems for policies, rates and eligibility; mail notices to the policyholders that describe just what the differences are between the grandfathered policies and the ACA compliant plans; request and receive the consumers' decisions; then enter those decisions back into their systems, said Robert Laszewski, an analyst with Health Policy and Strategy Associates

""They (the White House) appear to be throwing this hot potato into the hands of the insurance industry, who will now be on the hot seat to agree to do the impossible or take the heat for failing to do so,"" Laszewski said

Kathleen Forster, 64, a retired interior designer in Grosse Point, Mich., who received a cancellation notice in the mail several weeks ago, said she holds no hope that her provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, will rescind the cancellation notice it sent her and her husband several weeks ago.

""Why would they?"" Forster said. ""They jumped through all these hoops to come up with something new. Now they are going to rescind that? To make President Obama look good?""

The Forsters ended up buying a new policy from Blue Cross that meets the ACA requirements. Their premium ticked up from $762 per month to $820; their deductible shot up from $1,000 to $12,000.

Others who received cancellation notices say they won't go back to the individual insurance market.

Ginger Culbertson, 61, a self-employed marriage and family therapist in Greenville, S.C., said it took her nearly a month and a half — with the help of a private insurance broker — to navigate her way through HealthCare.Gov.

As frustrating as the process was, she made the switch. Under her current policy, she pays a $783 monthly premium and has a $5,000 deductible. She cut her premium by more than half, and her deductible will be $3,500. She also qualified for a tax credit.

""I'll be way better off than I am right now,"" she said.

Rocco Racano of Marlboro, N.J., said the option to keep his former policy wasn't appealing.

He previously had a policy from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey for adults ages 60-65 that covered him and his wife. It cost $1,020 a month. It had a $40 co-pay and a $2,500 family deductible. And it had an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,500.

The Newark-based insurance company canceled the policy, set to expire next June.

Racano said a gold plan offered by Horizon in the health exchange had a $908-a-month premium and a $3,000 deductible. His household income is low enough that he could receive a subsidy of about $500 a month.

Still, Racano said he isn't sure how it will play out. He couldn't get on the government's health care website and had to apply by mail instead. He hasn't received a response.

Jason Cannon, 33, a writer from Birmingham, Ala., said he and his family lost the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama plan that cost him $307 per month and had a $1,200 premium. His plan did not meet the ACA minimum benefit requirement.

He has since found a similar plan with UnitedHealthCare that will cost him $330 per month. Cannon took particular umbrage with the ACA requirement that plans cover maternity care — something his old plan did not include.

""If I choose to bet on myself (on a plan with a lower premium/higher deductible), I should be allowed,"" Cannon wrote in an e-mail. ""I know my medical history, my income level and have assigned a risk value based on that. The government essentially took none of that into account, forced me to bet on getting or being sick (and possibly becoming pregnant). That inflated my premium for a newer policy with a higher level of coverage I don't necessarily need.""

Cannon said his wife called Blue Cross Blue Shield on Thursday after Obama announced his fix to see if their 2013 policy would be available. But ultimately, Cannon said he didn't think his family will go back to the old plan.

""I would argue this is no fix at all,"" Cannon said. ""If I were an insurer, why would I go back to all the customers whom I have notified were losing their policy and tell them, 'No, you can stay. But we'll send you another letter in a year.'""

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/whats-come-obamacare-6C10553860,2013-07-10 08:48:20+00:00,"['Maggie Fox', 'Senior Writer']",What’s to come with Obamacare,"The Obama administration is still taking a political beating for its one-year delay of one major part of health reform – the requirement that all employers with more than 50 full-time workers provide health insurance for them.



That provision was going to go into effect in January. But it’s not the biggest provision, and the White House says the most important reforms are still on track.

The biggest, by far, is the opening of the health insurance exchanges – the online marketplaces where people can buy insurance if they don’t already get it from an employer, or from a public plan such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military.

Other changes yet to come: the requirement that most Americans get health insurance somewhere or pay a fine and new rules that prevent insurers from turning patients away just because they’ve been sick before and from putting lifetime caps on how much patients can run up in medical expenses. Also still to come are limits on the minimum coverage that can be provided, wider eligibility for Medicaid in some states, the formation of so-called accountable care organizations, rules meant to force hospitals to provide better care and, in 2018, a tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans.

Here’s a rundown:

Exchanges. The exchanges are on track to start enrolling people on Oct. 1, the administration says, and to start paying for people’s health care on Jan. 1.

The Kaiser Family Foundation says about 18 percent of Americans under the age of 65 don’t have health insurance. The exchanges are one way that the 2010 Affordable Care Act aims to fix this. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 26 million people will buy health insurance on the exchanges by 2022.

Expect a big advertising campaign this summer. “We have a very long way to go on public awareness and education on what is going to be available,” says Caroline Pearson, a vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health in Washington, D.C. “We are going to see a big push from state and federal governments and private groups to educate people.”

According to Kaiser, 79 percent of the general public and 87 percent of people who don’t have health insurance know little or nothing about the exchanges. Groups like Enroll America are planning to send volunteers door to door, while the Obama administration is looking to celebrities, local government officials, non-profit organizations and even public libraries to help spread the message.

Jay Angoff, who helped construct health reform at the Health and Human Services department before returning to private law firm Mehri & Skalet, says the health insurance companies are almost certain to start weighing in, too. After all, it will be private companies that will be providing the insurance – the so-called public option never got off the ground.

“They have been able to persuade people to buy lousy insurance at high rates,” Angoff told NBC News. “I am confident in the insurance companies’ ability to market to people. The main targets will be the healthy young adults who can pay premiums without filing too many claims. They’ll be needed to help provide a pool of cash to pay for the sick people who will sign up – and they’ll be the hardest sell because they know they don’t need the insurance as badly as others.

Individual mandate. This is a provision the insurance companies demanded, so they can be certain to have a big pool of paying customers. Just about everyone will be required to have health insurance starting Jan. 1.

Most Americans already do – through an employer, or via Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare for military families. People without will have to pay a small fine – as low as $95 the first year – if they don’t go either to Medicaid or the exchanges for insurance, or if they choose to skip whatever their employers offer. “The penalties the first year are very low and may not be enough to sway people,” Pearson says.

The federal government will help pay the premiums for anyone making up to about $46,000 for an individual, as much as $94,000 for a family of four.

Some people may fall through the cracks. About half of the states have declined to expand Medicaid to make more people eligible, and the federal government had counted on that Medicaid expansion. So in those states, people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for the exchanges may have the uncomfortable choice of paying the full premium on an exchange, or breaking the law and perhaps paying a fine.

People who make too little to file for income tax are off the hook – tax returns are where people will be reporting their coverage or lack thereof.

Medicaid expansion. The original 2010 Affordable Care Act required all states to make Medicaid – the state-federal health insurance plan for the poor – more widely available. The federal government was going to pick up the full cost for several years. But the Supreme Court ruled that was unconstitutional in 2012. Now just 26 states say they’ll expand Medicaid, according to the Advisory Board Company.

So people who live in a state expanding Medicaid will start qualifying in January, while those in one of the states that is not will be left with the status quo. The CBO projects that 12 million people will become newly eligible for Medicaid in the states that choose to expand their offerings by 2022.



There may be a “woodwork effect” as well, says Pearson. All the publicity surrounding the Medicaid expansion may make people who were already eligible aware of the program, and they may sign up for the first time.

Guaranteed issue. This is just a jargony way of saying health insurance companies cannot turn you away any more because you have had a pre-existing condition. This is one of the provisions that has worried insurance companies, because they fear an influx of new customers who have not been insured and who have expensive conditions – and a pent-up demand for medical care. That starts with new insurance plans issued Jan 1. Companies can no longer stop covering people once they reach a lifetime limit, either. This provision removes one of the things people hated most about health insurance – they’d get cut off just as they were the sickest and needed it most.

Community rating. Another piece of jargon meaning the insurance companies can only charge a certain amount more for older people, and they cannot charge women higher premiums than men any more. They can charge smokers more, however. This provision also starts with new policies issued after Jan. 1.

Essential benefits. This kicks in on Jan. 1, also. It’s a list of conditions that health insurance must cover, from birth control to mental health care and dental care for children. Any insurance company offering a product on the exchanges has to cover this list.

Insurers and other experts say this list of provisions is what will make health insurance more expensive on the exchanges. “I think there definitely will be sticker shock,” Person says. “The premiums will be significant and for people (who currently buy individual insurance) they are going to be higher than what they are today.” It may take a while for people to appreciate that they are getting value for their money, Pearson says.

Wellness programs. Starting in 2014, employers can expand their wellness programs, offering discounts on premiums, cash rewards, gym memberships and other incentives for those who lose weight, take part in diabetes control programs, or similar plans to improve their health.

Hospital incentives. Starting in 2015, the administration hopes to encourage hospitals to drop some bad habits by lowering what it pays them for treating Medicare patients. Hospitals will get paid less when patients who get some infections, bedsores and other conditions while they are in the hospital. This starts with a 1 percent cut in 2015, and grows over the years.

Cadillac tax. You don’t have to worry about this until 2018. It’s a tax on some of the most generous health insurance plans and is meant to discourage unnecessary and expensive tests and doctor visits that are helping drive up health spending. “That one is certainly a big deal for unionized workers,” Pearson says.

“It’s a time bomb in the law,” says Adam Solander with Epstein Becker Green, a Washington, D.C., legal and consulting firm. Employers who offer health insurance plans worth more than $10,200 a year will have to pay a 40 percent federal tax on that. “Employers will have to figure out ways to make their coverage cheaper,” Solander says. “Hopefully, it will lower the cost of coverage.”

Expect confusion. The bottom line – expect some confusion and some bumps in the road over the next few years. Insurance companies don’t yet know if the exchanges are worth the effort, so companies may hop in and out of the market, and they may change the premiums they charge in different states. Big group insurers that mostly offer company-paid health insurance may not dip their toes into the exchanges immediately.

“The hope is the large insurers will see this is a profitable market and jump in over the next year or two,“ says Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington & Lee University in Virginia.

In smaller states without many choices, insurers may continue to hang back. “I think it is fair to say in many states there are not going to be that many insurers in the exchanges,” Jost says.

“One way or another, Congress will have to revisit it in toto,” said Justice Antonin Scalia.

Agreeing, Justice Anthony Kennedy said it would be an “extreme proposition” to allow the various insurance regulations to stand after the mandate was struck down.

Meanwhile, the court’s liberal justices argued for restraint. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the court should do a “salvage job,” not undertake a “wrecking operation.” But she looked to be out-voted.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they shared the view of Scalia and Kennedy that the law should stand or fall in total. Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, they would have a majority to strike down the entire statute as unconstitutional.

An Obama administration lawyer, urging caution, said it would be “extraordinary” for the court to throw out the entire law. About 2.5 million young people under age 26 are on their parents’ insurance now because of the new law. If it were struck down entirely, “2.5 million of them would be thrown off the insurance rolls,” said Edwin Kneedler.

The administration indicated it was prepared to accept a ruling that some of the insurance reforms should fall if the mandate were struck down. For example, insurers would not be required to sell coverage to people with preexisting conditions. But Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general, said the court should go no further.

But the court’s conservatives said the law was passed as a package and must fall as a package.

The justices are scheduled to meet Wednesday afternoon to debate the law’s Medicaid expansion.

Your dream of Obamacare repeal hasn't arrived.

Sorry, guys. Your dream of Obamacare repeal hasn't arrived.

As Joan wrote earlier , House Republicans have scheduled a 1PM ET vote on their ""fix"" for health plan cancellations. But even though Republicans claim their bill will achieve a policy goal shared by both congressional Democrats and the White House—allowing people to keep their current health care plans if they want to keep them—it's not going to attract many votes from the Democratic side of the aisle, and the fundamental reason for that is simple: The Republican plan is nothing but Obamacare repeal with a different name, and no matter what Ted Cruz tells himself, Democrats are never going to embrace Obamacare repeal.

Not only would it be political malfeasance for Democrats to run away from Obamacare after spending three years supporting it, running away from the notion that all Americans deserve affordable, quality health insurance would be immoral. That's not to say they won't support changes and adjustments to Obamacare, but the House GOP plan isn't a simple tweak: By allowing insurers to sign up new customers to grandfathered plans, it would create an entirely new health insurance marketplace designed to compete with Obamacare, a marketplace without regulations or protections.

Yes, unregulated plans would probably be cheaper, at least initially, but they'd also be junk, and the costs of the good plans on the exchanges would skyrocket. Moreover, the House GOP plan would keep the mandate in place, so people would be forced to choose between exchange plans (which would be much more expensive than they are now) or junk insurance. It's not hard to see why most House Democrats have figured out it would be insane to vote for this, especially given the fact they are offering an alternative plan that actually would achieve the goal Republicans claim to be pursuing: Allowing existing consumers of health plans to continue their plans if they want.

Unlike the Republican plan, which leaves it up to insurers to decide whether they want to let consumers continue their plan, the House Democratic plan would let consumers make the decision. And it would do it without taking a wrecking a ball to Obamacare. For all the drama and speculation, at the end of the day, what we're going to see is nothing has really changed: Republicans are still fundamentally opposed to Obamacare, both in principle and practice, and Democrats support it."

According to a CNN report, though young people are now required to purchase insurance under Obamacare or pay a fine, “many low-income younger Americans won’t get any subsidy at all” because, as the Obama administration claims, the “cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected.”

In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45,960 threshold–or four times the poverty level of $11,490 for an individual–would qualify for ‘an upfront tax subsidy.'”

According to CNN, “subsidies are based on a formula set by law, applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level–or $11,490 to $45,960.” And to calculate the subsidies, “the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual’s region, and the difference is their subsidy.”

And though insurance companies are required to “knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays,” the subsidy is “zero” if the baseline plan insurance plans are cheap enough. That means many low-income younger Americans who are forced to buy insurance are discovering, to the surprise of many, that they will have to do so without the subsidies they were promised, as CNN noted:"

And the site's not expected to be perfect by the end of November, the top Obama administration technology officer said.

The Obama administration was expected to release long-awaited figures later on Wednesday showing just how many people managed to sign up in October.

""I believe that CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will have an announcement later today,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told a briefing.

""The functionality and shortcomings of Healthcare.gov are the result of bad management decisions made by policy officials within the Administration; they did this to themselves,"" said Karen Evans, former administrator for information technology at the Office of Management and Budget.

""And if they are now surprised, it is because their own policy officials failed to inform them of the decisions they had made and the consequences associated with those decisions,"" Evans said in written testimony prepared for the committee. Evans is now a consultant for KE&T Partners, LLC.

""I am going to give it a grade. This was an F,"" committee chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, told the federal technology officers called in for the hearing. ""Every one of you should have been close enough to know something was wrong.""

The administration has agreed over and over that the site is unacceptably flawed. Asked whether it would be working as promised on November 30, White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park said not to expect a flawless performance. ""The goal that has been laid out is not for the site to be perfect by Nov. 30,"" Park told the committee. It should, however, work smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users.

""That's the goal and we are working very hard to get there,"" Park said. He said the site can now handle 20,000 to 25,000 users at any one time.

The committee grilled top government technology officers but also posted testimony critical of the government.

Richard Spires, former chief information officer at the Department of Homeland Security, called the troubled rollout an embarrassment. ""The troubled launch of HealthCare.gov pains me – as someone who has great passion for wanting to make government IT more effective, this public spectacle once again casts federal IT in a very negative light,"" said Spires, who left the federal government in July and who is now a private consultant.



""As a federal IT community we appear unempowered, and worse, incompetent,"" Spires said in testimony prepared for the hearing.

After a tussle with the White House over whether he had time to come, the committee subpoenaed Park. ""I recognize that Mr. Park is busy trying to get this site operational. But it is time for Congress to look over shoulder of admin to ask what went wrong,"" Issa said at the hearing.



But Steve VanRoekel, a former Microsoft executive who is chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget, noted that even private companies struggle to get technology right.

""Microsoft is still patching Windows XP, 12 years after I helped launch it in 2001 – continuous improvement is the nature of these efforts,"" VanRoekel said.

""As you can imagine, connecting multiple, legacy IT systems across multiple agencies of the Federal Government is a complex task, however, this in no way excuses the problems encountered in launching HealthCare.gov. We are taking this unacceptable situation seriously and working hard to correct course.""

Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer at CMS, which runs the site; Health and Human Services deputy assistant secretary Frank Baitman; and David Powner of the Government Accountability Office, were all testifying.

The Obama administration also pushed back on Wednesday against a report in the Washington Post quoting an unnamed official as saying the website is unlikely to be working smoothly for “the vast majority of users” by the end of November, as promised by the Health and Human Services Department.



“The insurance exchange is balking when more than 20,000 to 30,000 people attempt to use it at the same time - about half its intended capacity, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal information,” the Post reported.

""The challenges we are addressing today are a snapshot of November 12, not November 30,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement. “We are making progress, including fixes to reduce error rates and get the site moving faster.""



People who don't have health insurance have until March 31 to enroll.

HHS has started sending out emails to invite 275,000 people who failed to enroll at the new health insurance website to try again.



The HealthCare.gov website is now working well enough so that people who started to create accounts and then gave up should be able to finish, says CMS spokesperson Julie Bataille.



“While working to improve our system, we have been conducting an analysis to identify people who tried and failed to create accounts,” Bataille told reporters in a telephone briefing Tuesday. “We have been messaging them to let them know they can now try again.”



HealthCare.gov, the centerpiece of health reform efforts under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, fell apart as soon as it went live on Oct. 1. It was supposed to be a seamless, online system to allow people to comparison shop for health insurance policies, contrasting prices, and checking right away to see if they qualified for a generous federal government subsidy to buy a plan.

It has to take in details of a person’s income and employment, connect with state insurance regulators and various insurance companies, as well as the Internal Revenue Service to check income, the Department of Homeland Security to check for legal residency, and various other government departments.



Several different approved government contractors put together parts of the system and when it went online, the parts didn’t work together. The result: Hardly anyone managed to sign up, critics said “I told you so” and Congress launched several investigations.



President Barack Obama has promised to fix it and appointed his new chief economic adviser, a management expert named Jeff Zients, to lead the repair effort.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/05/obama-tweaks-message-about-keeping-health-plans-under-obamacare/,2013-11-05 00:00:00,[],Obama tweaks message about keeping health plans under ObamaCare,"As thousands of consumers receive health insurance cancellation notices, President Obama is continuing to fine tune his promise that Americans who like their health plans would be able to keep them under his signature health care law.

The president told about 200 of his campaign supporters and health care activists Monday that the administration had promised Americans they could keep their current coverage -- as long as their plans hadn’t changed since ObamaCare was signed into law.

""If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the law's passed,"" Obama said. ""So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act you are grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we're saying is they have got to change it to a higher standard. They've got to make it better.""

Obama said his health care law is making the insurance market better for everyone, even though millions of Americans who buy individual plans have been receiving cancellation notices. He said the notices ""can be scary for people,"" but added they were often getting ""a very bad deal.""

""The bottom line is -- is that we are making the insurance market better for everybody and that's right thing to do,"" he said.

The president also acknowledged that technical problems with the health care website to shop for insurance are making it tougher for people to find other plans. He said he's ""not happy about it,"" but promised, ""We're going to smooth this thing out.""

At least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear, The Associated Press reported. In a speech at Boston's Faneuil Hall this past week, Obama said the problem is limited to fewer than 5 percent of Americans ""who've got cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident.""

In the Republican-controlled House, officials say a vote is likely as early as next week on a bill to let insurers continue selling any individual policies that were in effect on Jan. 1, 2013, even if they provide coverage deemed insufficient under Obamacare.

The measure, drafted by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and backed by roughly 100 fellow Republicans, would remain in effect throughout 2014, after which the issue would presumably be reviewed.

""Despite the president's repeated promise of 'if you like your plan, you can keep it,' many Americans are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on January 1,"" Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement when he announced his legislation last week.

""This legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to keep their current coverage if they so choose.""

While Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced legislation during the day to go one step further by requiring it.

Aides told The Associated Press that under her measure, insurance companies would be obliged to continue offering existing paying customers continued coverage under any plans in effect at the end of 2013. No new consumers could enroll.

""A promise was made that if you like your health plan, you can keep it - and I will do everything I can to see that the promise is kept,"" said Landrieu, who is gearing up for what is expected to be a challenging re-election campaign next year.

The White House declined comment on the two bills.

Both measures are designed to cut through a complicated system in which some plans for individuals that fall short of coverage standards are allowed to continue under Obamacare, while others are not.

Washington (CNN) - News that the Obama administration met critical repair goals for HealthCare.gov brought almost no applause from Capitol Hill Sunday, with just a few members of Congress responding to the website progress report at all.

Of those who responded, most either indicated that they expect more issues or that they saw the website as the beginning of Obamacare's problems.

""Based on past performance, it would be prudent to wait before determining that the website truly is fixed,"" wrote Doug Heye, deputy chief of staff for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.

As in news conferences and statements in the past two weeks, Heye and other Republicans focused less on the website and more on problems they see with the Affordable Care Act itself.

""Millions of Americans being informed that the health care plans they liked are being canceled - despite the President's repeated assurances otherwise - and being forced to pay higher premiums, deductibles, or both, are a much greater priority than a broken website,"" the Cantor aide told CNN.

House Speaker John Boehner's office gave a similar statement to CNN Sunday.

""This isn't just about a broken website, it's about a fundamentally-flawed law,"" wrote Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

""Website is least of Obamacare's problems,"" echoed Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Twitter.

""You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the first impression here was terrible,"" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, said on ABC's “This Week.” ""And I think it's going to be an unfolding disaster for the president.""

Democrats offered mixed reactions.

""We're getting to a point where, yes, there are a few problems we're working through now, but we can see the end of the era,"" said Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, on ABC's ""This Week"". Ellison said Obamacare will lead to a time ""where people will be able to get sick and get care and not worry about being dropped ... or going bankrupt.""

""The administration has hit some big benchmarks,"" praised Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, on NBC's “Meet the Press.” But he added that problems may continue. ""This is going to take some time before (the website) is up and kicking in full gear ... We should be working together to fix it every day."""

Mr. Stone owns the Atlas Cafe in the city’s Mission District, and the new law directed him to provide his 21 employees with one hour of paid time off for every 30 hours worked, up to nine days a year. “Basically, it’s just going to make it more expensive to operate your business,” Mr. Stone told NPR at the time. “Small business is going to have to pass that cost onto their customers.”

Six years later, Mr. Stone admits to having been a little alarmist about paid sick leave. “As a small restaurant business, it’s really hard to make money, and when they add another requirement, it makes you nervous,” Mr. Stone said in a recent interview. “But all and all, I actually think it’s a good thing.”

This spring, paid sick leave came up for vigorous debate in cities around the country. Portland, Ore., passed a law in March, and New York followed suit last week when the City Council overrode a veto by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In Philadelphia, sick-leave legislation died after Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed it. In each case, the same concerns about the bill — that it is unnecessary and intrusive, and especially expensive and burdensome for small businesses — have surfaced.

At a contentious six-hour New York City Council meeting in March, representatives of at least a dozen trade associations testified against the bill. Jay Peltz, representing independent grocers, called it “a de facto annual $800 million tax increase.” Those arguments appeared to carry the day in the half-dozen states that have passed laws this year prohibiting cities and towns from enacting their own sick-leave laws. But in San Francisco, the District of Columbia and the state of Connecticut, places that have had such laws in force for more than a year (Seattle adopted one in September), it can be difficult to find small-business owners who say they have been hampered by the law’s obligations — though some object in principle."

In an undated memo to employees, UPS (UPS) said it will discontinue coverage for all working spouses who are eligible for insurance with their own employer. That applies to about 15,000 spouses covered by UPS today.

The internal document was obtained by Kaiser Health News. UPS told the nonprofit news agency that the policy applies only to non-union U.S. workers. It hasn't responded to questions from CNNMoney.

In the memo, UPS said it's willing to take care of its own, but it won't bear a burden that other companies can take on.

""We believe your spouse should be covered by their own employer -- just as UPS has a responsibility to offer coverage to you, our employee,"" the memo states.

Spouses of UPS employees who don't work -- or who are not offered coverage by their own employer -- will get to stay on the UPS plan.

Most of the company's workers, such as delivery workers and truck drivers, are unionized through the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and receive insurance under a different plan.

UPS blamed the move on several aspects of Obamacare, including mandatory coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and new government fees.

""We are making these changes to offset cost increases due to the [Affordable Care Act],"" the memo states.

In the memo, UPS said its health care costs usually increase about 7% a year, but that it expects those costs to climb by 11.25% in 2014 due to Obamacare.

The company also said that 35% of companies intend to make the same changes to their plans, but didn't cite specific market data.

A recent survey by consulting firm Towers Watson found that next year, 18% of employers will require that workers' spouses buy insurance from their own employer before turning to the surveyed company for insurance.

UPS's move is the latest example of the corporate response to Obamacare, although the law won't begin to kick in until Jan. 1.

Employers are worried that premiums will rise. And they'll also be required to pay a fee for every person on their plans, starting at $63 a head next year.

The federal Department of Health and Human Services has said the fee would help with the transition as the American health care system accepts many new sick, previously uninsured people."

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

States enforce this law, with their own laws and policies added in, differently in every state. But the general principle is there. Up until now the usual consequence has been things like this: Medicaid puts a lien on the house of someone in a nursing facility who has run out of money, and after they die, the heirs find they have to buy the house back from the state if they want it.

We haven't had lots of people younger than 65 on Medicaid, because in most states simply earning less than the Federal Poverty Level did not qualify one for Medicaid.

And we haven't had many people with lots of assets on Medicaid, because in most places you have to have less than around $2400 to your name before Medicaid will cover you. You can keep your house and your car, but Medicaid reserves the right to put liens on them and take them when you die.

But now we have the Affordable Care Act, and its expectation that everyone in the lower tier of income will end up in the Medicaid system. To accomplish this, they have dropped the asset test. So now we will have lots of people ages 55-64, who have assets but not a lot of income right now, for whatever reason, on Medicaid.

The kicker of it is, if you make the right amount to qualify for a subsidized health insurance plan, your costs are going to be shared and subsidized by the government. But if you go on Medicaid, you owe the entire amount that Medicaid spends on you from the day you turn 55.

And that amount is not just what is spent on your doctor visits and your treatments, whatever they may be. No, there is also something called a ""capitation charge."" For each enrollee, a base cost is assigned to the entity that administers the program. How much will that charge be? It varies by state, and as far as I can tell by other variables as well, but it could be hundreds of dollars per month, or more. (If you have specific information on this, please do share it!)

How will this play out? No one knows, as far as I can tell. But it is easy to see how this could become a real problem. If someone is low income and goes on Medicaid, will Medicaid put a lien on their house? If they need to sell their house and move, will they then lose all their equity in paying off the lien? Will people get hit with bills and liens for many thousands of dollars, even if they were healthy and hardly ever went to the doctor?

Why is it that Medicaid is pretty much cost free to use up to age 54 if you qualify, and suddenly becomes a collateral loan at age 55, for which a state agency will do its best to collect payment in full for every cost assigned? It seems clear that the Estate Recovery law did not anticipate the current circumstance with the ACA, and that putting the two laws together makes for a terribly unfair situation for some. What can we do to remedy this situation?

The fact that practically no one is talking about this makes me uneasy. (It has been mentioned a few times, for instance the comments section of the diary here.) At the very least what we are getting set up to do is implement an arbitrary, capricious, and regressive tax, that will only be paid by older, low income people. And we are putting this in motion at a time when there are lots of other difficulties to be worked out. I would like to make sure that we are not forgetting those who will find themselves stuck between their need for health coverage and the implications of the Medicaid Estate Recovery laws and programs.

Update: this diary is the first of a series on Medicaid and Estate Recovery. The next ones are Estate Recovery: It's Worse Than You Thought and Medicaid is Welfare - It's Right To Expect Repayment."

USA TODAY

President Obama's extraordinary mea culpa news conference Thursday was about more than making a fix in a provision of the Affordable Care Act.

It was about turning around a downward slide that could threaten the future of his presidency.

For more than three years, congressional Republicans have flailed at the Affordable Care Act with limited success. Now, in the space of six weeks, the administration's own missteps — the botched roll-out of the federal exchange website and the broken promises over consumers being able to keep insurance plans they like — have significantly eroded confidence in Obama's signature legislative achievement and Democratic unity behind it.

What's more, with a string of apologies and some uncomfortable admissions, Obama Thursday fueled questions about his administration's competence and his own leadership, the most fundamental of presidential characteristics.

""There have been times where I thought we got, you know, slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved, all right? It's on us,"" he said at one point. At another: ""I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months."" And one more: ""We fumbled the roll-out on this health care law.""

He said he would delay for a year provisions in the health care law that required insurance companies to end policies that didn't have minimum coverage standards. But the insurance industry warned that step could raise premiums for everyone and state insurance commissioners questioned whether it was even feasible at this late date.

And the revolt on Capitol Hill didn't seem to abate. House Republicans plan to vote Friday on a bill the White House opposes that would allow Americans to keep existing health care plans through 2014. Some Senate Democrats said they hoped to continue with plans for a similar measure.

""What's happened in recent weeks is, I think, a dagger aimed at the heart of Obama's presidency,"" says presidential scholar William Galston of the Brookings Institution, a veteran of the Clinton White House. ""I say that not only because of the centrality of health care reform to the administration's agenda and to his legacy but also because it has posed a direct challenge to his standing as president in the eyes of the American people.""

Obama's approval-disapproval rating was at 42%-52% in the daily Gallup Poll Thursday, in the neighborhood of George W. Bush at this point in his second term and well below the standing of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. For the first time in his presidency, a majority of Americans said Obama was not a strong and decisive leader.

Approval of the Affordable Care Act also may be dropping fast. Just a few weeks ago, 44% approved of the law, 47% disapproved. Now just 40% approve and 55% disapprove, the worst in at least a year.

Surely only dire circumstances could have convinced the candidate once known as ""no-drama Obama"" to announce a policy change and then field questions for almost an hour in the White House press room. Not a person given to public introspection or apology, his tone was contrite and even confessional at times.

To be sure, presidents have recovered from serious setbacks before. Reagan faced tough hearings over the Iran-contra scandal but finished his second term with a tax code overhaul and breakthrough agreements with the Soviet Union. Clinton survived impeachment. A booming economy and a falling jobless rate could do a lot to restore Obama's reputation.

If things go as the White House hopes, the HealthCare.gov website will be operating well by the end of this month. By the end of next March, when the sign-up period is scheduled to end, many of those consumers now concerned about losing their current plans will be persuaded that they're better off with a new one.

At the moment, however, the Obamacare landscape is sufficiently rocky that when a reporter asked about about stalled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, it seemed to be almost a relief.

“Boy, the food at this place is really terrible,” says one.

“Yeah, I know,” says the other. “And such small portions.”

Last week, the administration announced it was delaying by a year the implementation of one of Obamacare’s provisions, the requirement that large employers provide health insurance. You’d think the opposition party, which has spent four years denouncing the health-care reforms, would be delighted by the reprieve. But on Wednesday, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing to condemn the administration — for incomplete enforcement of the law they hate.

“This committee intends to get an explanation,” proclaimed Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing. “This committee has serious questions about how and why this alarming decision was made and the effect that delaying this key provision will have on other provisions of the law.”

It was kind of the chairman to show such thoughtful concern for a law he wants repealed. And if Brady saw the delay as “alarming,” others were apoplectic. “Boy, I’ll tell you,” Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.) said, beginning his remarks. “I hate to see a dictatorship come into this country, but it sure looks like that’s what’s happening with health care.”

“We see this as definitely something that leans toward socialism,” proclaimed Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).

President Obama was called a dictator and a socialist for passing Obamacare. Now he’s a dictator and a socialist for postponing it? “The irony of objecting to the delay of a program you’ve been trying to stop is no doubt lost on this room,” observed Rep. Jim McDermott (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee.

It’s a safe bet that Republicans aren’t really concerned about the delay, which the administration said last week that it had granted at the request of employers and which was applauded by business groups. Rather, Republicans used the delay as a chance to make the case, yet again, that the entire health-care law should be ditched. They are planning to vote soon on repealing the law — for the 38th time, give or take.

“This law is literally just unraveling before our eyes,” judged Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice-presidential candidate. “I don’t know how you can conclude that this is not a total fiasco.” In an extended cobbler’s metaphor, he said Democrats wrote the law “on Christmas Eve and shoehorned that into law, which is what we have today, and so we see all these shoes dropping.”

Chairman Brady revealed his motives when he used his opening statement to cite polling on the law’s unpopularity. “Clearly, the rollout of Obamacare is in disarray,” he exulted.

This unqualified opposition is counterproductive for House Republicans. On health care, as on immigration, their approach amounts to a search-and-destroy mission. They could work with Democrats to remove problematic pieces in the health-care law, and they could compromise with Democrats on legislation that would secure the borders. But instead they are devoted to shutting down both.

Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) made the point when he asked the four witnesses called by the Republicans whether Obamacare should be fixed or repealed. The replies:

“Repealing and replacing.”

“Repealing and replacing.”

“Repeal and replace.”

“Repeal it.”

“The major obstacle that the Affordable Care Act faces today is there’s so much opposition for political reasons alone to see that this thing fail, and not whether this is going to help small businesses or help Americans throughout the country,” Kind said. “And that’s the real tragedy with these type of hearings.”

Replied Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) “Do we want to repeal this? You bet your life. Caught red-handed.” Roskam rejected the idea “that somehow a desire to see something fail is somehow unjust.”

But Republicans don’t have much of a viable alternative. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor touted a bill this spring to help people with preexisting health problems get insurance, but conservative opposition forced him to pull the bill from the floor.

In the case of the “employer mandate,” even a number of liberals agree that it’s a bad policy. Republicans could probably find support for repealing that provision, if they weren’t hellbent on repealing the whole law.

But it’s so much more cathartic to call a hearing, assume a posture of umbrage, and use words such as “calamity” and “fiscal time bomb,” and “socialism” and “dictatorship.”

And he admitted it’s a mess.



The latest fix, Obama says, is an update on Healthcare.gov telling people how they can buy insurance ""the old-fashioned way — offline.""

“So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in,” Obama said.

His administration has been tight-lipped on just what the problems are with the website, which was originally billed as something resembling Travelocity for health insurance — a place online where people could go to compare one plan to another and get a price.

But experts point out that HealthCare.gov was never that simple. While most in the industry are confident that Obama can keep his promise to eventually fix the site, they say there are multiple places where things may have gone wrong.

“Buying a health plan is a lot more complicated than buying a flight,"" says Brandon Cruz, president of GoHealth, a private health insurance marketplace. “When you’re buying a health plan, you need to know all the doctors in the network, what you deductible will be, what your co-insurance will be. And the terminology is so foreign.”

Customizing is complicated

Not only that, but an airline seat is a fairly generic commodity. Health insurance is personal, says Caroline Pearson, a vice president at consulting firm Avalere Health. “What’s available for purchase and the price they are going to offer to you for is completely customized on an individual basis,” she says.



“So in order to give people an accurate shopping experience with accurate pricing, you had to enter a lot of personal information about where you live, your income, the size of your family, and then the government has to verify that data. There’s been a lot of up-front electronic verification, which seems to be where a lot of the website snafus occurred.”

The consensus: the federal website has tried to offer too much, too fast, to too many people.

The federal government is running websites for 36 states that didn’t want to do their own, or couldn't manage it right away. Each state has its own insurance regulations, and each has its own list of providers offering plans — from 16 different insurance companies in New York, to just one for people in some counties in West Virginia.

Before you can even begin to shop, the website has to know what county you live in. And it needs to check your income to make sure you shouldn’t be on Medicaid instead, and to check to see if you qualify for a federal subsidy and if so, how much it would be.

Oh, and it has to check with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure you really are a legal resident — all this while you’re staring at the screen, waiting.

States let users window-shop

Pearson says some of the 15 states offering their own websites — Kentucky is an example — have sped up things for users by letting them window-shop first. ""Many of the state websites, though not all, elected to simplify the process and allow you to shop without creating a login and submitting all your personal information,” she says.



At first, the Obama administration blamed the website hangups on a crush of new users. That's no surprise as the White House says nearly 20 million people have visited the site so far and 500,000 have started the application process.

But Obama has now admitted it was worse than this and says he has “the best and the brightest” working to fix it.



Cruz says there are lots of places where the site could be hanging up. “I don’t think the code was bug-free when the time came to launch,” he says. “If the code’s not written properly, you can have bottlenecks.”

Databases — and there are lots of them on the federal website — are one big potential blockage. “If everyone’s trying to access the database at the same time, it locks up,” Cruz says.

They’re usually designed to freeze while someone is putting information in, so that the next person to access it has the most up-to-date information. To use the Travelocity analogy, think about choosing your seat on a flight. You’d want to be sure someone didn’t snatch the seat you wanted at the same time you were on there.



It's not as simple as adding servers

Simply adding servers — a computer or system of computers that increases capacity — won’t help if there’s a bottleneck that keeps people from even reaching the server, Cruz points out.



Many experts have said the government did not test the system thoroughly enough before launch. And having literally millions of people jump onto a new website on the very first day is a recipe for a mess, says Chet Wisniewski, senior security adviser for IT security firm Sophos Inc.

“When you think about Twitter, only a few thousand people knew about it, then tens of thousands of people. And after a year, when everybody was using it, Twitter started to break,” Wisniewski says.

The Pew Research Center reports that 14 percent of adults report having visited an exchange, and another 23 percent say they intend to.

Cruz and Pearson think the problems are fixable. So does Tom Scully, who was administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), from 2001 to 2004 and who now is a healthcare expert at law firm Alston & Bird.

Although much criticism has focused on a Canadian firm, CGI Group, that did some of the work for the federal government, Scully says the administration probably should have contracted out even more of the work. CMS was never equipped to do the work in-house, he says.

“They are just slow-moving, bureaucratic, lovely people,” Scully said. ""It's just not a core competency of CMS.""

The agency likely feared it would be impossible for a company outside the federal government to get the cooperation it would need with the internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and other federal departments, Scully says.

Will the phones be just as slow — or slower?

And, by the way, says Pearson, sending people to the phone might not be effective, either.



“People have had a hard time getting through on the phone,"" she says. “There have been really long waits on the call center.”

Avalere staffers have tried, she says. “We have spoken to the call center several times. They haven’t been volunteering to help us enroll,” she said.

Maybe that will be one of the improvements that Obama has promised, she said.

And sending in too many of the “best and the brightest’ might not be the right fix, either, software experts note. They often cite Brook’s Law, which holds that adding people to a project slows it down.

""It's not like a construction project, or an auto assembly line, where more hands on deck mean more results,"" said Bob Sullivan, a technology and consumer expert and author of “The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success. ”With software, adding people at the end of a project to fix things that are broken or unfinished, can actually do more harm than good.""

USA TODAY

Site had a calamitous rollout in October

Team that was brought in to make repairs says site will now serve most users flawlessly

Both Republicans and Democrats turn focus to the underlying law

The White House announced Sunday it has met its goal to make its troubled Healthcare.gov website operate smoothly for most users, fueling hope among Democrats that attention can now turn to successes of the underlying health care law.

""The bottom line is health care.gov on December first is night and day from where it was October first,"" said Jeffrey Zients, the president's appointee to fix the website's problems. ""The site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity at greatly improved performance.""

When the site — which allows people to compare private plan benefits and costs before buying an insurance policy — launched Oct. 1, millions of people were disappointed by slow or frozen pages, an inability to log in, and incorrect or missing information. The White House tapped Zients to lead a team to fix the site.

At the beginning of November, Zients said the site had an ""up time"" of just 43%. As of Nov. 30, the site's up time was 95%.

""We have a much more stable system that's reliably open for business,"" he said in a Sunday conference call with reporters.

The news was met optimistically by Democrats and with trepidation from Republicans Sunday.

Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said on CBS's Face The Nation that the updates were good news, and compared the exchange's previous performance to a store advertising a sale but forgetting to unlock the doors.

""It sounds like the front door has been opened successfully now,"" Menendez said.

But Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the health care law still puts ""downward pressure on employment"" and ""upward pressure on the deficit.""

""I don't know how you fix the many fundamental problems of this program,"" he said.

The Republican governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, said the GOP needs an alternative, market-driven plan for health care.

""We just have to have the courage to stand up and do it, and we're doing it in the states,"" he said.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the backlash is to be expected, but that he's relieved to hear the website is now operating smoothly.

""Clearly by any metric, the website is much better than it was,"" he said on MSNBC. ""Let's hope that this is now the end of the botched website — we can move into a new phase where people are enrolling, where people are seeing the benefits of expanded coverage.""

After hardware updates and bug fixes that continued through the weekend, the federal health exchange site now has the capacity to serve 50,000 people at a time, for a total of 800,000 people a day, according to a report issued Sunday by the Department of Health and Human Services.

That figure is ""conservative,"" Zients said, because it was calculated using an eight-hour day, rather than a 24-hour day.

""We needed to get the team working with the speed and urgency of a high-tech company,"" Zients said. Just as a high-tech company accountable to shareholders would, the team has focused in the past month on daily progress reports to ensure people know what's being done to fix the site. At least 50 bug fixes were made just last night, bringing the number of fixes up to more than 400.

According to the administration, Zients' repair team has so far:

• Made hundreds of software fixes, upgraded hardware and monitored the system to make improvements;

• Stabilized the site at its original intended capacity; and

• Improved overall metrics, which means the site is working well for most users.

A new hardware upgrade made Friday quadrupled the registration capacity, Zients said, and response times are under one second with an error rate below 1%.

Over the holiday weekend, ""Traffic has been significantly higher than a typical weekend,"" Zients said, but the website has handled the workload smoothly.

Julie Bataille, director of the office of communications for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the team continued to work over the weekend on the back-end of the site, to make sure that insurers receive subsidy payments after people buy plans, as well as to make sure the plans receive correct information.

""As we said about five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30% of users being able to enroll,"" Bataille said. That percentage is now up to 80%.

However, Bataille explained that there will always be a significant percentage of people who will need additional help navigating the site, but not necessarily because of technological problems. Some people have complex family situations, and others aren't comfortable using the Internet for purchases in general.

""It's important to remember that there are and will remain a significant number of people for whom online is not their preferred method of enrollment,"" she said. Those people can still enroll with paper applications and over the phone.

Zients explained a new feature of the site: If someone comes to HealthCare.gov and the site is at maximum capacity, the person will be able to leave an e-mail address. When traffic clears and there is space for another visitor, that person will receive an e-mail telling them they can log back in without a wait."

Businesses have complained about some of the provisions

Administration says it%27s listening to businesses

Change does not affect businesses with fewer than 50 employees

WASHINGTON —The Obama administration announced Tuesday it is delaying until 2015 the requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty.

The announcement by the Internal Revenue Service comes after numerous complaints from businesses that the requirements were too complicated and difficult to implement in time.

Business groups, such as the National Retail Federation, praised the delay, while congressional Republicans jumped on the move to reiterate their opposition to the 2010 health care law.

Other key parts of the law, including the health exchanges where individuals can buy insurance, are on schedule. The exchanges will open on Oct. 1, wrote Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, in a White House blog released Tuesday.

The delay also does not change the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to purchase insurance. Some consumers may receive subsidies to help them pay for the insurance depending o their incomes.

Jarrett said the move is a sign the White House is paying attention to the concerns of business.

""As we make these changes, we believe we need to give employers more time to comply with the new rules,"" Jarrett wrote. ""Since employer responsibility payments can only be assessed based on this new reporting, payments won't be collected for 2014.""

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,"" wrote Mark Mazur, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, in an IRS blog.

""We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so,"" Mazur said.

The delay gives the IRS more time to simplify reporting requirements, as well as for businesses to get up to speed with reporting systems. The government still encourages businesses to voluntarily begin reporting in 2014 so they will be ready for 2015.

Business groups had argued for months that the law created an administrative burden for businesses as they tried to update technology and plan to offer health coverage to their employees without knowing how much the coverage would cost.

Businesses with more than 50 employees would have paid a fee of $2,000 per uninsured employees after the first 30 employees. The Congressional Budget Office expected those penalties to bring in $4 billion in 2014.

""We commend the administration's wise move to delay the employer reporting and penalty obligations under the Affordable Care Act,"" said National Retail Federation President Neil Trautwein in a statement. ""This one-year delay will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment.""

This does not affect businesses with fewer than 50 workers, who were already exempt from that rule. Most large businesses already offer coverage to their employees.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the ""White House seems to slowly be admitting what Americans already know ... that Obamacare needs to be repealed.""

House Republicans, who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act 37 times, echoed McConnell.

""The best delay for ObamaCare is a permanent one,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.

Various parts of the law have taken effect since its passage in 2010, including allowing children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' insurance plans and discounts for prescription drugs for Medicare patients. More young Americans have health insurance than before the law, because of that change, and the discounts have saved Medicare recipients billions of dollars.

However, the more complicated parts of the law, such as the exchanges and the individual mandates, are set to take effect Jan. 1, and many of the businesses and groups affected have worried about their ability to meet the deadlines."
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html,2009-09-10 00:00:00,[],Obama’s Health Care Speech to Congress,"Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.

The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:

It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge – not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans – and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.

Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan:

First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.

What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies – because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.

That's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan – more security and stability.

Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.

For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/health/racing-to-inform-millions-unaware-of-new-health-coverage.html,2013-04-24 00:00:00,['Robert Pear'],Racing to Inform Millions Unaware of New Health Coverage,"EAST LANSING, Mich. — President Obama and the Democrats passed the 2010 health care law to make medical insurance available to more than 30 million people who do not have it. But with recent studies showing that as many as three-fourths of those people are unaware of their new options, health care providers are joining community organizers and insurance companies in an ambitious effort to spread the word in the six months remaining before the health plans become available.

Here in Michigan, a small army of doctors and nurses, hospital employees, insurance agents and advocates for low-income people is mobilizing for the next phase of this revolution in domestic social policy: finding people who are eligible for health insurance and getting them enrolled.

It will not be an easy task.

The simmering political debate over Mr. Obama’s health care law — which includes an expansion of Medicaid, the government program for low-income people, and the creation of “exchanges” to market subsidized private insurance — makes the work of these foot soldiers more difficult, but also more important.

Michigan is, in many ways, a microcosm of what is going on around the country as people race toward the start of “open enrollment” on Oct. 1."

Pollak'],Republicans Do Have a Strategy–Even If They Had to Stumble onto It,"Conservatives, and Republicans in general, have been accused of having “no strategy” in the showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats over Obamacare, the government shutdown, and the debt ceiling. It might be argued that the Republicans only adopted their strategy by accident, but they do have one, and it is both necessary and long overdue: win back disenchanted voters by fighting for their interests–hard.

The conventional wisdom in Washington, DC, repeated ad infinitum in the opinion pages and on the weekend news shows, is that Republicans blundered by allowing President Obama to cajole them into a government shutdown. Now, the thinking goes, Democrats have a way to shift the weight of policy failures, scandals, and the Obamacare disaster: they can blame Republicans for causing fiscal and economic chaos–and warn of more.

It is true that the public blames Republicans for causing the shutdown–and well they might. It is also true, however, that the public understands that President Obama has been inflicting as much pain on them as possible in an effort to win a political fight. His refusal to negotiate, and his willingness to use petty tactics such as closing open-air war memorials, have caused his approval ratings to drop to nearly unprecedented levels.

Had Republicans followed the conventional wisdom on Obamacare and waited until 2016 to fight the issue, none of the above would have happened. Meanwhile, millions of Americans would have faced the daunting prospect of losing their health insurance or their jobs to a new, unfamiliar, unwieldy, and ultimately more expensive policy. They would have looked to Washington, only to see no one–at all–fighting to protect them.

Amidst the many competing versions of what a new Republican strategy should look like after 2012, the one common theme was that the party needed to learn how to relate to the concerns of ordinary people. There is nothing more basic, no issue more “kitchen table,” than the cost of health insurance. Symbolic votes against Obamacare may look good on campaign literature, but voters are smart enough to see through those tactics.

Another repeated exhortation was the need to reach out to Latino voters. And yet it has gone virtually unnoticed that the man leading the revolt against Obamacare on Capitol Hill, the man who shifted the GOP out of its torpor, is a Hispanic Republican–easily now the most recognizable Hispanic leader in America. For his trouble, he has been vilified by the wiser heads in his own party, who think appealing to Latinos means amnesty.

The major strategic challenge facing Republicans prior to the shutdown fight was the fact that millions of core GOP voters stayed home in 2012 and looked likely to do so again after the party leadership became consumed by debates over immigration reform. With few swing districts at stake in 2014, and Democrats vulnerable in key Senate races, the task–though many GOP leaders ignored it–was to reach out to the base.

Yes, the shutdown exposed Republicans to possible defection by independent voters. But President Obama, who evidently believes that the shutdowns of the 1990s foretell victory today, has missed one of the key lessons of that battle. President Bill Clinton won largely because he cast himself as a savior–of health care, education, and the environment. President Obama, in contrast, has auditioned for the role of executioner.

And so, ironically, Republicans have been able to cast themselves as the protectors of popular government programs by passing “rifle-shot” bills to fund each of them alone. At the very least, the GOP has prevented the damage from being worse. They do not look mean, as Gingrich did in 1995-6; they merely look irresponsible. And in that category, the president is giving them stiff competition by taking an ill-advised hard-line position.

All year, the Republicans’ clear–if quiet–legislative strategy has been to use the Full Faith and Credit Act as a backstop against default, strengthening their position in debt ceiling talks with the president. The only immediate political effect of the shutdown was to move that fight forward a week. But the strategic effect was great, and profound: the GOP is now back on course to connect with its missing voters–just in time for 2014."

WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A top White House technology adviser will testify at a congressional hearing on Wednesday about the troubled launch of the website at the heart of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform despite the administration's assertions that he was too busy.

The White House confirmed late on Tuesday that Todd Park, its chief technology officer, would comply with a subpoena to testify at a hearing of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight Committee.

The White House had asked to delay the hearing until December, saying that Park was too busy helping to fix the HealthCare.gov website, which Obama has vowed will be working smoothly for most people by the end of the month.

Technical problems with the website since its Oct. 1 rollout have prevented many Americans from enrolling in the health exchanges set up under the 2010 healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.

""The partisan subpoena issued by House Republicans on Friday was an unfortunate and unnecessary step since we made clear several times that Todd Park is willing to testify,"" said Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

""It wasn't a question of if, it was a question of when,"" Weiss said.

Park was a successful healthcare IT developer before he joined the Obama administration, steering Athenahealth through a blockbuster IPO, and helping start another company, Castlight, which provides data on healthcare costs.

A sought-after speaker at IT conferences, Park is popular within the technology community. More than 1,200 allies signed a petition at lettoddwork.org calling on Darrell Issa, the Republican committee chairman, to postpone Park's testimony.

""No matter what side of the aisle you sit on, Todd is one of the good guys. Let him do his job,"" the petition said.

Park, 40, helped build the original HealthCare.gov website in 2010 when he was chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services. At the time, the website provided information about public and private insurance programs, sorted by zip code.

Also slated to testify are Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer at the White House budget office, Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Frank Baitman, chief information officer for HHS."

Washington (CNN) - It's a playbook on the bruising field of health care politics, complete with ""x's and o's.""

The House Republican strategy memo, entitled ""Because of Obamacare... I lost my insurance,"" offers samples of talking points, social media, videos, digital flyers, op-eds, and a fact sheet for GOP lawmakers doing battle against the president's signature legislative achievement.

Read the playbook (PDF)



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='JimAcostaCNN']

Obtained by CNN, and reported first by Roll Call, the playbook was released late last month. A Republican source who provided the strategy memo to CNN says it will be updated and released to GOP House members Thursday.

""The administration now has a serious competence problem. Healthcare.gov is so much more than a website. The website should have been the easy part,"" the playbook reads.

The disclosure of the memo, produced by the office of House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, comes amid a sustained Republican onslaught against the Affordable Care Act.

President Obama has noted the highly organized opposition to his signature legislative achievement.

“One of the problems we’ve had is one side of Capitol Hill is invested in failure,” Obama said at a Wall Street Journal event with some of the nation's top CEO's Tuesday.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the GOP's ""18 page playbook of partisan attacks is 18 pages longer than their health care plan.""

""In the playbook, there’s not a single word devoted to helping constituents enroll or offering an alternative idea to help Americans gain access to quality, affordable care,"" he added.

A spokesperson for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will continue to back the program.

""While Republicans continue to fixate on sabotaging health reform and root for failure, House Democrats will continue to stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act, work to strengthen the health reform law as implementation continues, and ensure that millions of uninsured Americans get coverage,"" Drew Hammill said in a statement."

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Sunday that the budget blueprint he plans to unveil this week will promote repealing President Obama’s signature health-care law.

“Yes, our budget does promote repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a better system,” Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Past House Republican efforts to repeal the president’s health-care law failed, and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law last year.

Ryan’s budget proposal, which includes controversial proposals for giving states more authority over Medicaid, is sure to encounter stiff resistance from Democrats in Congress who are committed to protecting Obamacare. That push back is likely to complicate Obama’s efforts this week to advance a dialogue he reopened with Republicans last week on reaching a grand bargain on budget cuts and entitlement reform.

On Thursday, Ryan lunched at the White House with Obama and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Ryan said Sunday that only time will tell how effective the president’s recent outreach to him and other congressional Republicans will be.

“The proof will be in the coming weeks as to whether or not it is a real sincere outreach to find common ground,” Ryan said.

The 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate made his comments as he pitched a budget proposal that would wipe out the deficit in 10 years rather than in more than 20, as he proposed last year.

He said the more ambitious timetable would “not really” require much deeper cuts than those outlined previously, because of recent events. They include a rise in tax rates for the very wealthy enacted in January, and budget sequestration that took effect this month.

“We don’t have to do huge things to get the balance because of the new baseline,” he told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace.

Key parts of Ryan’s plan are items he and Mitt Romney campaigned on in the election they lost to Obama in November.

One is turning Medicare from a one-size-fits-all insurance program to one that helps subsidize the purchase of policies “based on who you are — total subsidy for the poor and the sick, less of a subsidy for wealthy seniors.” Another is turning Medicaid, which pays for health care for the very poor, into a block-grant program that would allow states to craft their own programs.

Ryan’s budget calculus includes a $770 billion cut to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Under Obama’s health-care plan, Medicaid would expand rather than contract, bringing in about 20 million more users.

Asked whether his plan was realistic, Ryan averred that parts of it were not.

“Will the president take our premium support program and block-granting Medicaid? My guess is he won’t,” Ryan told Wallace. “We think that’s the best way to make these programs work better. But are there things you can do short of that — that gets you closer to balancing the budget, that delays the debt crisis from hitting this country? Yes, I think there are.”

Ryan said the lunch at the White House was “the first time I’ve ever had a conversation with the president lasting more than, say, two minutes, or televised exchanges. I’ve never really had a conversation with him on these issues before.”

Sounding a conciliatory note, Ryan said: “I think there are things that we can do that don’t offend either party’s philosophy, that doesn’t require someone to surrender their principles.”

Republicans on other Sunday talk shows also expressed hope that Obama’s gestures would lead to substantive negotiations.

“I think he’s genuinely reaching out,” Sen. Tom Coburn ­(R-Okla.) said on NBC News’s “Meet The Press.” “But you know, you’ve got a lot of scabs and sores on people, and it’s going to take awhile for that to heal.”

Sen. Ronald H. Johnson (R-Wis.), one of Obama’s dinner guests, said on ABC News’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that he would “give the president the benefit of the doubt.”

Both Coburn and Johnson were among a group of Republican senators who dined with Obama last week. The president is set to meet with leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill this week as the budget debate heats up.

USATODAY

Sure%2C Republicans have been trying hard to kill the law.

But trying to repeal a law you think will be bad for the country is entirely legitimate.

Republicans are on the right side of the argument in every particular%2C save one.

The Affordable Care Act — aka ObamaCare — is off to a very rocky start, and according to the law's biggest defenders, the blame falls squarely at the feet of Republicans.

It's an odd claim. Republicans did not write the law. They did not support the law. And they are not in charge of implementing it. Yet, it's got to be the GOP's fault, right?

Now it is true that Republicans have been trying very hard to kill the law. The GOP-controlled House has voted 40 times to repeal it. Conservative activists dedicated to repeal have refused to shut up and lie down. Some Republican governors have declined to expand Medicaid. Some Republican senators have leaned on outside groups, such as the NFL, to not help promote the law. And some ambitious Republicans want to use the upcoming budget and debt ceiling negotiations to force Democrats into defunding ObamaCare.

Let's go through each. Trying to repeal a law you didn't vote for and think will be bad for the country is entirely legitimate. Sometimes, it's morally compulsory. One needn't cite the fugitive slave law to demonstrate this fact. In a mid-presidency conversion, Barack Obama decided that he would do whatever he could to nullify the Defense of Marriage Act. In 1989, after a backlash from seniors, Congress repealed a Medicare reform law that didn't work as planned.

Right to fight

There's also something just plain weird about criticizing politicians for trying to get rid of a law that is, has been and continues to be unpopular with Americans. If ObamaCare were wildly popular, the demonization of Republicans as out of touch and radical would have a bit more plausibility.

Also, the fact that activists won't give up may be annoying to supporters of the law, but just talk to any one of them and they'll be the first to tell you that so far they've failed utterly. Similarly, asking the NFL to stay out of a bitter political controversy may be unseemly, but such actions haven't done anything to stop ObamaCare. Indeed, the GOP governors who've declined to sign up for Medicaid expansion aren't obstructing the law; they're exercising their discretion under the law.

In fact, the only person openly defying ObamaCare is Obama himself. His Department of Health and Human Services declared it would delay the implementation of the business mandate, despite the fact nothing in the law empowers it to do so.

And that's just the most egregious part. The administration has been issuing thousands of waivers — including to favored constituencies — exempting various parties (such as congressional staffers) from complying with the law because it turns out ObamaCare can't work as written. That conclusion isn't mine; it's the administration's. That's why, for instance, HHS and the IRS won't bother with verifying whether applicants for insurance subsidies are eligible under the law.

In short, Republicans are on the right side of the argument in every particular, save one: the effort to force the Democrats to defund ObamaCare by threatening a debt crisis or government shutdown. The Democrats will never agree to such a demand, and the resulting crisis would surely be blamed on Republicans.

Pull of entitlements

There is a bizarre irony at work here. Both the right and left are convinced ObamaCare will eventually become popular if implemented. Conservatives fear the ""ratchet effect,"" a term coined by the great libertarian economic historian Robert Higgs. Once government expands, goes the theory, reversing that expansion is nearly impossible. Liberals have their own version. They point out that once Americans get an entitlement — Social Security, Medicare, etc. — they never want to lose it. They hope that if they can just get Americans hooked on the goodies in ObamaCare, they'll overlook all the flaws.

There's a lot of truth here, to be sure. But it's not an iron law either. Sometimes, bad laws get fixed. It happened with Medicare in 1989 and welfare reform in 1995. Many of the boneheaded laws of the early New Deal were scrapped as well.

Republicans should have a little more confidence in their own arguments. If you believe that ObamaCare can't work, you should expect that it won't. Forcing a debt crisis or government shutdown won't kill ObamaCare, but it will give Democrats a lifeline heading into the 2014 elections, which could have the perverse effect of delaying the day Republicans have the political clout to actually succeed in repealing this unworkable and unpopular law.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/25/Two-Cheers-for-Ted,2013-09-25 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Two Cheers for Ted,"The pundits in D.C. jeered as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) began his lengthy speech (a “fauxlibuster,” they joked) on Tuesday. Some cast it as a self-serving gesture, done to impress “dumb” people outside the Beltway who don’t get that defunding Obamacare just isn’t possible. But as the night wore on, it was clear that Cruz’s stand was as passionate and articulate an attack on Obamacare and a defense of liberty as the nation has ever seen.

A few even began to see its wisdom, circulating an essay by David Frum acknowledging that even a defeat served Cruz’s political purposes. Charles Krauthammer, who the day before had traded jokes about Cruz’s Canadian birth, acknowledged on Tuesday that he had executed a brilliant maneuver, if not to defeat Obamacare than to highlight its flaws, and to seize the mantle of leadership of a conservative movement needing inspiration.

What was most impressive about Cruz’s gambit, however, was not the strategy but the substance. In plain language, Cruz laid out the fundamental problems with Obamacare as policy, outlining the cost to working families in higher insurance premiums, dropped health plans, and lost work hours or job opportunities. He also reminded Washington of how the bill was passed, and upheld, in defiance of the people and the Constitution.

A few Democrats eventually wandered down to the Senate floor to debate Cruz, some to try poking holes in his arguments, reminding him that President Barack Obama had won a new mandate from the voters even after passing the Affordable Care Act. Cruz patiently, and deftly, handled their objections, noting that even the unions were turning against the law, and blasting both sides for approving congressional exemptions from it.

It was also difficult not to be moved by Cruz’s passion. No empty gesture could sustain the hours upon hours of explication, analysis, and debate that Cruz tackled on the Senate floor. Agree or disagree with his decision to force the issue into a debate over the budget and the debt ceiling, it is impossible not to be impressed by his sheer will, and by the self-evident sincerity of a man so fluent and ardent in his arguments.

It occurred to me that when I ran for Congress in 2010, and voters would urge me to “do something” if I got to Washington, that this is the type of “something” they meant. They know that a freshman in Congress is barely even worth his or her vote but that a person willing to take risks can change history. And millions went to bed last night knowing someone on Capitol Hill was, finally, keeping watch over their liberty as they slept.

There was one flaw in Cruz’s approach, however. It became clear in the reactions of those who might otherwise have supported his effort but were put off by his attacks on fellow Republicans. Cruz sometimes turned sincere disagreement over tactics into differences in courage and conviction. Despite Cruz’s moderate demeanor, his rhetoric sometimes reflected a political media culture mired in the language of absolutes.

Cruz has withstood intense hostility with uncommon grace, but he should reserve terms like “surrender caucus” and Neville Chamberlain analogies for real enemies if he wants to rally the broader support he deserves. Overall, however, his stand was brilliant. His remarks should be printed separately as a primer on Obamacare, and his tactics should inspire the opposition. He will soon run out of time. But he has turned the tide."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/us/medicaid-expansion-battle-in-michigan-ends-in-passage.html,2013-08-28 00:00:00,['Monica Davey'],Medicaid Expansion Battle in Michigan Ends in Passage,"CHICAGO — The fierce struggle among Republicans over whether to make Medicaid available to more low-income people played out in Michigan on Tuesday as the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, narrowly succeeded in swaying enough conservative senators in the State Legislature to accept the expansion, which was part of President Obama’s health care law.

Mr. Snyder’s preferred bill — one he had lobbied for intensely for months — initially fell short by one vote, but the governor salvaged a deal hours later. The vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 20 to 18, with only 8 Republicans in favor. The Michigan House, which had earlier approved a similar measure, will need to vote on the Senate version before Mr. Snyder can sign the bill.

“The Affordable Care Act has probably been one of the most divisive issues that our country has faced in the last few years, and many people do have strong opinions both for and against,” Mr. Snyder said after the vote. “I just ask that all Michiganders step back and look to say this isn’t about the Affordable Care Act. This is about one element that we control here in Michigan that we can make a difference in here in people’s lives.”

While the authors of the federal health care law intended to expand Medicaid, the federal and state health program for poor people, and at least initially pay for the expansion, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out, setting up a struggle that has played out in the states largely along partisan lines."

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., along with a half-dozen other Republican senators, introduced the ""ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act"" on Tuesday. It would strip a provision in the Affordable Care Act pertaining to so-called ""risk corridors,"" which could allow the government to pay insurance companies to offset financial losses.

Rubio calls it a ""blank check"" for the industry.

""The idea that the federal government should be bailing out insurance companies in order to make ObamaCare work, that's not something a lot of people are aware of,"" Rubio told Fox News. ""And I haven't taken a poll on it, but I guarantee you it would be hugely unpopular.""

The provision has been in the law since passage, but Rubio and other senators raised concern about it after President Obama announced last week that he would allow insurance companies to continue to offer out-of-compliance plans. The announcement was made in response to the millions of people receiving cancellation notices -- but industry representatives raised concern that if they offer the old plans again, premium revenue could go down.

In addition, the federal website for ObamaCare is still experiencing problems, meaning the industry is not receiving as many new customers as it had initially hoped.

In a statement last week, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that the risk corridor program could be used to help insurance companies.

Gary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said in a letter to insurance commissioners that the program ""should help ameliorate unanticipated changes in premium revenue"" and the government is looking at ways to modify the rules ""to provide additional assistance.""

Asked about the program, an administration official told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that they would be providing more information ""very soon"" on risk corridors and how they might be adjusted in light of the recent announcement.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, stressed that the three-year program is only temporary, and said it's not out of the ordinary for new laws.

""There's a lot of uncertainty about what the markets are going to look like,"" he said, noting the payments are designed to help stabilize the market.

Rubio, though, fired off a letter Tuesday to the Congressional Budget Office asking for a cost estimate for the program.

""It is clear that the risk corridors' only purpose over the next 3 years will be to serve exclusively as a taxpayer bailout mechanism for health insurance companies,"" he wrote.

Rubio's bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Mike Lee, R-Utah; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and David Vitter, R-La.

According to Politico, Obama told insurance executives at a meeting last week that the government's assistance to the industry would be limited. Obama plans to meet Wednesday afternoon with insurance commissioners, some of whom have already announced they would not implement the president's plan.

(Susan Walsh/AP)

After decades of the food pyramid, Americans can look to a new model for healthy eating, ‘MyPlate’, the new symbol of proper nutrition from the USDA which was announced Thursday. As Brian Vastag reported:

After devoting decades to designing a pyramid, then honing and refining that design, the nation’s nutrition experts have settled on what they believe is the perfect geometry to represent what we should eat — a plate.

Arriving in the midst of an obesity epidemic, this new at-a-glance guide to healthful eating is meant to remind consumers to limit heavy foods and beef up on the greens.

“MyPlate” promotes fruits and vegetables, which cover half the circle. Grains occupy an additional quarter, as do proteins such as meat, fish and poultry. A glass of milk rests to the side. Desserts have been banished to the desert.

At a media-heavy roll-out Thursday morning at USDA headquarters, the famously foodie first lady presided. With the White House vegetable garden in full leaf, Michelle Obama armed her crusade against the country’s obesity problem with what nutritionists and food lobbyists are already calling a powerful image.

“It’s brilliant in its simplicity,” said Robb MacKie, head of the American Bakers Association, which represents bread makers. “It’s something the average American can look at and get a visual feel for how they can fill up a plate at a meal.”

To avoid upstaging the first lady, the USDA made a select group of academics and food industry representatives sign non-disclosure forms at a private unveiling of the image three weeks ago, several sources said. Still, word leaked, leading to early rave reviews from hard-to-please corners of the foodieverse – and sighs of relief that the food plate’s predecessor, USDA’s confusing MyPyramid, had finally been dismantled.

USDA officials have said the old ‘MyPyramid’ was too complex and did not give people an easy way to compare their meals to the ideal balance recommended. As AP explained:

USDA officials say the pyramid was tired out, overly complex and tried to communicate too many different nutrition facts at once. The new symbol, unveiled Thursday at the department with first lady Michelle Obama in attendance, is simple and gives diners an idea of what should be on their plates when they sit down at the dinner table.

“It’s grabbing the consumers’ attention that we are after this time, not making it so complicated that perhaps it is a turnoff,” said Robert Post of USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. “There is something really inviting about this familiar setting for meal time.”

The department is planning to use social media as one way of grabbing attention, posting advice every day on Twitter, for example. The accompanying website, choosemyplate.gov, will be written on the chart. It will eventually feature interactive tools that help people manage their weight and track exercise.

Post, who has spent two years developing the plate and the website, said the new chart is designed to be “more artistic and attractive” and to serve as a visual cue for diners.

Gone are any references to sugars, fats or oils, and what was once a category called “meat and beans” is now simply “proteins.” Next to the plate is a blue circle for dairy, which could be a glass of milk or a food such as cheese or yogurt.

Even though the plate is divided into four sections, the servings aren’t supposed to be proportional. Every person has different nutritional needs, based on age, health and other factors. The symbol, based on a new set of dietary guidelines released in January, is a general guideline.

‘MyPlate’ has thus far been well received, especially in comparison to the older model. As Jennifer LaRue Huget reported:

A huge improvement over the baffling MyPyramid icon that it replaces, MyPlate is as easy as pie to understand; its designers smartly saved the fine print about how to actually fill the wedge-shaped spots on the plate for the Web site, ChooseMyPlate.gov. MyPlate, like the Food Pyramids before it, is meant to convey the key messages of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in a simple, consumer-friendly fashion.

It’s no fun, finding nothing to be snarky about with this particular use of federal funds. But, really, this plate thing, though not all that original, makes sense. And it probably will prove to have legs. In her remarks at the news conference at which MyPlate was introduced this morning, first lady Michelle Obama pointed out that the icon is “simple enough for children to understand, even at the elementary school level. They can learn to use this tool now and use it for the rest of their lives.”

Obama also said, “This is a quick, simple reminder for all of us to be more mindful of the foods that we’re eating, and as a mom, I can already tell how much this is going to help parents across the country.”

“When mom or dad comes home from a long day of work, we’re already asked to be a chef, a referee, a cleaning crew. So it’s tough to be a nutritionist, too. But we do have time to take a look at our kids’ plates. As long as they’re half full of fruits and vegetables, and paired with lean proteins, whole grains and low-fat dairy, we’re golden. That’s how easy it is.”

So said conservatives of Chief Justice John Roberts when he rescued the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — a.k.a. Obamacare — from being found unconstitutional.

But the manner in which he did this may have made the ACA unworkable, thereby putting it on a path to ultimate extinction.

This plausible judgment comes from professor Thomas A. Lambert of the University of Missouri Law School, writing in Regulation, a quarterly publication of the libertarian Cato Institute.

The crucial decision, he says, was four liberal justices joining Roberts’s opinion declaring that the ACA’s penalty for not complying with the mandate to purchase health insurance is actually a tax on not purchasing it. With this reasoning, the court severely limited the ability of the new health-care regime to cope with its own predictable consequences.

What was supposed to be, constitutionally, the dispositive question turned out not to be. Conservatives said that the mandate — the requirement that people engage in commerce by purchasing health insurance — exceeded Congress’s enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce. Liberals ridiculed this argument, noting that since the judicial revolution wrought during the New Deal, courts have given vast deference to Congress regarding that power. The ridicule stopped when five justices, including Roberts, agreed with the conservative argument.

This did not, however, doom the ACA because Roberts invoked what Lambert calls “a longstanding interpretive canon that calls for the court, if possible, to interpret statutes in a way that preserves their constitutionality.” Roberts did this by ruling that what Congress called a “penalty” for not obeying the mandate was really a tax on noncompliance.

This must, Lambert thinks, have momentous — and deleterious — implications for the functioning of the ACA. The problems arise from the interplay of two ACA provisions — “guaranteed issue” and “community rating.”

The former forbids insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person’s preexisting health condition. The latter, says Lambert, requires insurers to price premiums “solely on the basis of age, smoker status, and geographic area, without charging higher premiums to sick people or those susceptible to sickness.”

The point of the penalty to enforce the mandate was to prevent healthy people — particularly healthy young people — from declining to purchase insurance, or dropping their insurance, which would leave an insured pool of mostly old and infirm people. This would cause the cost of insurance premiums to soar, making it more and more sensible for the healthy to pay the ACA tax, which is much less than the price of insurance.

Roberts noted that a person earning $35,000 a year would pay a $60 monthly tax and someone earning $100,000 would pay $200. But the cost of a qualifying insurance policy is projected to be $400 a month. Clearly, it would be sensible to pay $60 or $200 rather than $400, because if one becomes ill, “guaranteed issue” assures coverage and “community rating” means that one’s illness will not result in higher insurance rates.

So, Lambert says, the ACA’s penalties are too low to prod the healthy to purchase insurance, even given ACA’s subsidies for purchasers. The ACA’s authors probably understood this perverse incentive and assumed that once Congress passed the ACA with penalties low enough to be politically palatable, Congress could increase them.

But Roberts’s decision limits Congress’s latitude by holding that the small size of the penalty is part of the reason it is, for constitutional purposes, a tax. It is not a “financial punishment” because it is not so steep that it effectively prohibits the choice of paying it. And, Roberts noted, “by statute, it can never be more.”As Lambert says, the penalty for refusing to purchase insurance counts as a tax only if it remains so small as to be largely ineffective.

Unable to increase penalties substantially, Congress, in the context of “guaranteed issue” and “community rating,” has only one way to induce healthy people to purchase insurance. This is by the hugely expensive process of increasing premium subsidies enough to make negligible the difference between the cost of insurance to purchasers and the penalty for not purchasing. Republicans will ferociously resist exacerbating the nation’s financial crisis in order to rescue the ACA.

Because the penalties are constitutionally limited by the reasoning whereby Roberts declared them taxes, he may have saved the ACA’s constitutionality by sacrificing its feasibility. So as the president begins his second term, the signature achievement of his first term looks remarkably rickety."

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Caught flat-footed by the challenges of building the financial-management and accounting parts of the U.S. government's new online marketplace for health insurance, officials rushed to hire a familiar contractor without seeking competing bids, according to government procurement documents reviewed by Reuters.

The documents dated in August - less than two months before the opening of online marketplaces established by President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law - showed the agency in charge had only ""recently learned"" that building the financial management functions was ""beyond (its) currently available resources.""

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) documents shed more light on the problems facing the agency as it worked on the marketplaces established by the law commonly called Obamacare and on its revelation this week that at least 30 percent of the marketplace is still being built.

Those problems and others have been revealed by congressional oversight investigators who released emails and outside reports that paint an administration scrambling to meet the technological challenges of the marketplace - and usually failing to do so.

CMS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said on Friday and on Saturday that representatives of the agency were unavailable to comment on the contract or on an estimate of when the financial management part of the marketplace is expected to be finished.

Although the consumer-facing part of the marketplace, the HealthCare.gov website, opened for enrollments on Oct. 1, CMS had a goal of Jan. 1, 2014 for the financial components of the system to be operational.

""The prospect of a delay...even for a few days, would result in severe consequences, financial and other,"" CMS said in a ""justification and approval"" document explaining the lack of competition for the contract.

The contract, valued at nearly $12 million, was awarded on Aug. 9 to Novitas Solutions, according to the documents. Novitas has numerous contracts with CMS, including to administer doctor and hospital claims in the federal Medicare program for elderly Americans.

The problem-plagued HealthCare.gov is being worked on by contractors racing to fix it by the end of November so that people can enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The law aims to provide health care insurance to millions of uninsured people.

OBAMA ASKED FOR FEWER 'NO-BID' CONTRACTS

Federal agencies are normally required to solicit bids for work, so as to get the best deal for taxpayers, but can award a contract to a favored company in emergencies as long as they document the urgency.

A few weeks after taking office in 2009, Obama issued a memorandum to government agency heads ordering them to minimize the use of non-competitive contracts, calling them potentially ""wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse.""

The procurement documents made clear how crucial the financial functions on the healthcare portal are. If payments were not made on time and accurately, CMS said, ""operation of the Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act will certainly be jeopardized.""

Financial management includes such functions as transmitting premium payments to insurers. Building that capability into the Obamacare marketplace ""is already minimally two months overdue,"" according to the August documents.

Just a few weeks before the financial-management contract was awarded, according to emails released last week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CMS officials were becoming increasingly concerned about the status of the federal insurance marketplace, asking for assurance that the lead contractor was not ""going to crash the plane at take-off.""

On Tuesday, CMS's deputy chief information officer, Henry Chao, author of the ""crash"" email, told a congressional panel that 30 to 40 percent of the federal marketplace was still under construction.

Invisible to consumers are what Chao called the ""back office systems."" Those include accounting and payment systems to send premiums to insurers and transfer funds to insurers that attract more than their share of customers with high medical costs.

The no-bid contract awarded to Novitas includes these systems. Novitas is a subsidiary of Diversified Service Options, which is wholly-owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida .

Asked about how Novitas was awarded the contract and the work it is doing, Florida Blue spokesman Mark Wright said a company official told him, ""We're not going to be able to get into this right now.""

Chao told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that CMS and its contractors had focused on building HealthCare.gov so it could launch on Oct. 1, postponing construction of ""the financial management aspects of the system.""

The lead contractor on HealthCare.gov, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's CGI Group Inc, is also involved in building the financial management piece of the marketplace, a company official said.

The construction ""is a bigger problem than people realize,"" said Robert Booz, a vice-president and healthcare specialist at technology consultant Gartner.

""Everyone recognizes it's going to be a problem in January,"" he said, referring to financial management. In the worst case, if financial records are wrong, then people who have signed up for, and paid a monthly premium for, insurance may be told incorrectly that they are not covered.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/13/California-Care-Exchange-Frustrates-Enrollees,2013-12-13 00:00:00,['Robert Wilde'],Obamacare Chaos in California,"The California Obamacare exchange, Covered California, has enrollment snags preventing thousands of customers from obtaining insurance. Many who selected a plan as early as October are now being told by insurance companies that they have no record of their enrollment. Consumers are enduring long waiting periods on the phone, computer errors, and conflicting information from California navigators and insurers.

Meanwhile, the state is still trying to clear a log jam of October and November paper applications that they received by mail.

“The back end is so backed up, and no one can give me an answer,” said Thomas Gallo, who was a strong supporter of Obamacare. Gallo signed up for healthcare for his family on October 2 but did not hear back for weeks. When he followed up on his application, he was told at the end of November that it was lost. “What happens if we don’t get coverage by Jan. 1? There are real problems here,” Gallo said.

Blue Shield of California Chief Executive Paul Markovich admitted, “There are certainly some people who have enrolled or think they have enrolled and haven’t received confirmation. It’s our version of Black Friday right now and that is what we are coping with.”

The target date of January 1 is extremely important for Bret Winton and his wife because they are expecting their first child in early January. Winton is a self-employed consultant living in the Venice, CA. His insurance is being cancelled as a result of Obamacare, along with one million other Californians, because his family plan does not meet the requirements set out by the Affordable Care Act. Winton endured repeated glitches and delays as he struggled with the online exchange. He ultimately selected an Anthem Blue Cross policy, which would provide access to his wife’s doctor and hospital.

Winton called the Covered California exchange and a recording said he would be called back in four hours. He never got the call back. He resorted to a sanctioned chat line that told him he would need to wait 14 days and then he could reapply.

California resident Jim Arenson, a self-employed engineer, also had difficulty with the online exchange. He complained it took him two months to finally receive notice confirming he was covered through Blue Shield. “I was very scared I wouldn’t have health insurance,” said Arenson, who needs additional care after cancer surgery this year. “The exchange and the insurance company were pointing fingers at each other. There could be a lot of people falling through the cracks.”

State Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate health committee, is deeply concerned that time is running out to fix some of these enrollment problems. Now that Obamacare is the law of the land, “The question now is whether we can meet that demand. Everything seems to be bottlenecked until we open more lanes,” Hernandez said."

Lawmakers seek way out of ObamaCare showdown,"Concerned their party is painting itself into a corner, some Republicans are trying to find a way out of the congressional showdown over a House-passed bill that would keep the government open past Sept. 30 only if lawmakers agree to defund ObamaCare.

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on Monday is expected to start the process of setting up a test vote on the House bill.

Reid and his fellow Democrats, naturally, want to strip out the provision defunding the health law. Republicans don't want that. So Tea Party-aligned senators like Ted Cruz have rallied around an only-in-Washington kind of approach -- in order to defend the House bill which they supported, they will try to block Reid from calling it up.

But this raises a perplexing question: Even if Republicans can muster the votes to block the bill, what then?

The approach threatens to end in a stalemate, with the Senate holding on to a bill and neither chamber, then, voting on anything that would keep the government open past Sept. 30. Congress hasn't passed a bona fide budget since 2009, forcing the government to operate on a series of short-term spending bills -- this practice sets up periodic deadlines, and opens the door each time to the risk of a shutdown.

Some Republicans and Democrats are now looking for a resolution, worried about the political blowback from a shutdown.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., suggested Monday that his fellow Republicans set the bar a bit lower, aiming instead to repeal ""some of the really egregious things"" in the law.

Speaking with Fox News, Toomey said the widely unpopular medical device tax -- which medical device companies warn could put them out of business -- is a prime candidate for repeal. Plus, he said lawmakers should continue to push for a delay in the individual mandate, which is expected to require individuals to purchase health insurance starting in 2014.

""I don't think we're gonna be able to completely defund ObamaCare as long as President Obama's in the White House,"" Toomey said.

Toomey's comments speak to the divide in the Republican Party. Many GOP lawmakers want to repeal ObamaCare entirely, warning that it is driving Americans off their current health care plans and, because of quirks in the law, forcing others into part-time work. But many also say that, with Democrats controlling the Senate and White House, defunding it is simply not possible.

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., made a suggestion similar to Toomey's.

""Let's fix it. Let's repair it,"" he said of the law.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on the same show, was skeptical about the GOP push to defund the law. ""We don't have the ability ... to put a total stop and defund ObamaCare. It would be nice if we did. I'd be in the fight,"" he said.

He predicted that Reid would ultimately marshal the votes to strip out the ObamaCare language and send the budget bill back to the House. He predicted the government would not shut down over this ""exercise.""

With time running out to reach an agreement, there appear to be a few possible outcomes.

Cruz and his allies could successfully stall the bill in the Senate, forcing concessions or forcing a shutdown come Oct. 1.

Or, Reid could succeed in calling up the bill, stripping out the ObamaCare language and sending it back to the House. Then House Speaker John Boehner would be forced to decide whether to stick by his party's demands to defund ObamaCare, or call up the clean budget bill, relying on perhaps a majority of Democrats to pass it.

Cruz, in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" also floated an alternative route. He said the House should ""hold its ground,"" and start passing miniature spending bills, ""one department at a time.""

""Fund the military, send it over, and let's see if Harry Reid is willing to shut down the military because he wants to force ObamaCare on the American people,"" he said.

While Republicans debate internally over strategy, Democratic leaders have a largely united message.

Reid said last week that any bill that strips funding from ObamaCare is ""dead.""

President Obama says any push to nix the health care law is ""not going to happen."""

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio: ""Promise after promise from this administration has turned out to be not true.

But my intention in terms of winning back the confidence of the American people is just to work as hard as I can, identify the problems that we've got, make sure that we're fixing them. Whether it's a website, whether it is making sure that folks who got these cancellation notices get help, we're just going to keep on chipping away at this until the job is done.""

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee: ""If the president were sincere in his apology and serious about keeping his promise to the American people, he would work with Congress on bipartisan proposals like the Keep Your Health Plan Act. Implementation of this law has been disastrous, leaving worried Americans without the health care plans they had, skyrocketing premiums, and limited access to doctors. (Friday), as we vote on the Keep Your Health Plan Act, we call on the president to work with Congress, not around us.""

Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.: ""I'm encouraged that the president took action to stop the cancellation of insurance policies that Americans were promised they could retain. I was particularly happy to see the notification provision included. ... I remain willing to work with anyone who wants to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and keep the significant promise that it holds for our country. If this were easy, it would have been done 100 years ago. But for the first time in the history of the country under the Affordable Care Act, middle-class and hard-working families, entrepreneurs and small businesses will have access to affordable, quality health care that's there when they need it most.""

Karen Ignagni, president and CEO, America's Health Insurance Plans: ""Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers. Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace. If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers. Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace."""

The Post also reports that, like everything else surrounding ObamaCare, this announcement is not even close to true.

The faulty $600 million site has been improved over the course of the last two months. Still, though, it can only handle 50,000 users at a time. Moreover, the site still loads slowly and the capacity for 50,000 users hasn’t yet been fully tested.

Earlier this month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration’s goal was to make the site usable for 80% of users — another moving of the goal posts since the White House announced November 30 as a target date.

Other deadline misses include the HealthCare.gov program that allows small businesses to enroll online. This feature, known as SHOP, has been delayed until after the 2014 midterm elections. What hasn’t been postponed, though, are the insurance policy cancellations already plaguing small business owners.

In order to re-insure their employees, business owners will now have to work through a broker or insurance agent. That is if the the increased costs and hassles surrounding ObamaCare don’t result in small business owners deciding that insuring their employees just isn’t worth it. CBS News reported last week that this is already happening.

The Wall Street Journal reports that technical problems will still inhibit HealthCare.gov from verifying users’ identities and the transmission of accurate enrollment data to insurance providers. The fallout of the latter problem won’t be readily apparent until someone who has been told they are insured tries to visit a doctor or emergency room only to discover their insurer has no idea who they are.

Some crucial parts of HealthCare.gov are not even built yet, including the mechanism that pays your insurance carrier the part of your premium covered by the federal government — the infamous subsidy.

Some reports claim that in order for ObamaCare to meet its March 30 enrollment goal of 7-plus million enrollees (this number is necessary to make the system financially viable), somewhere around 54,000 people must sign up daily. Currently, only around 7,000 enrollments are occurring daily.

Granted, this is a big improvement over last month’s enrollment numbers, but two times zero is still zero.

http://news.yahoo.com/support-u-healthcare-law-edges-despite-website-woes-140849492.html,,[],Support for U.S. healthcare law edges up despite website woes,"By Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans appear to be somewhat warmer to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, despite the troubled roll out of the government website that is essential for its success, a poll released on Wednesday found. The Gallup survey showed people ""are slightly more positive now"" that they were shortly before the launch of healthcare.gov, which aims to allow consumers to enroll and shop on their own for a health insurance plan. Still, 45 percent of those polled in mid-October said they generally approve of the law compared to 50 percent who said they disapprove, Gallup said. In August, 41 percent backed the health reform plan while 49 percent did not. The healthcare plan continues to polarize Republicans and Democrats. The nationwide polling firm surveyed more than 1,500 adults between October 18 to October 20, amid the technical problems that have plagued the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplace website, which launched Oct 1. ""This suggests that the poor performance of the health exchange sites may not at this point be negatively affecting Americans' views of the ACA overall,"" Gallup researchers said of the survey, which questioned people just days after the partial government shutdown ended. Gallup's poll also showed a gap in support between younger Americans, whose enrollment is seen as critical to the law's success, and those who are older and qualify for health insurance through the federal government's Medicare program. More than half of 18- to 29-year olds - or 51 percent - backed the health reforms compared to 38 percent of those 65 and older, according to the poll, which has a margin-of-error rate of plus-or minus 3 percentage points. The findings come as the Obama Administration scrambles to fix the website, promising a ""tech surge"" with a team of government and industry experts to fix the problem and offering other options such as telephone enrollment. Republicans in Congress have also begun their own investigations of the website's problems. Conservatives have long opposed the law, also known as ""Obamacare,"" and made its defunding the focus of their political strategy, which led to the federal government shutdown earlier this month. ""The law remains one of the most polarizing issues Gallup has measured, with more than eight in 10 Democrats approving, while more than eight in 10 Republicans disapprove,"" the polling firm said. Later on Wednesday, health insurance industry executives will meet with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and White House officials, the White House said. The Obama administration has also scheduled a briefing with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, some of whom have expressed concern with the program's troubles. Gallup's poll showed the number of Democrats who embrace the measure has grown. In August, 71 percent of those who identified as Democrats said they favored the law compared to 83 percent in October. Slightly more political independents also said they backed it, while Republican numbers were largely unchanged. Despite the increase in support for the health law, Gallup said its other research shows a majority of Americans still want lawmakers to modify it ""in some way - repealing it entirely, scaling it back, or expanding it."" Overall, most polls have shown that a narrow majority of Americans oppose the healthcare law. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll on Tuesday showed 54 percent of people opposed the law while 46 percent favored it. (Reporting by Susan Heavey; editing by Jackie Frank)"

The new HealthCare.Gov website collapsed early Tuesday morning under the weight of 2.8 million users,said Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

""As with any product launch, there will be glitches. We will fix them,"" Tavenner told reporters on a conference call.

“Sorry, Health Insurance Marketplace Live Chat isn’t available right now,” the website advised. “We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try again later, or call your Customer Service Center at 1-800-318-2596.”

President Barack Obama said it crashed under the weight of a flood of users. ""“More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning,” he said, adding:

“There were five times more users than have ever been on medicare.gov at one time. That gives you a sense of how important this is to Americans around the country,"" Obama said in an address aimed mostly at criticizing the federal government shutdown.

That doesn't make the exchanges a failure, however, Obama said. ""A couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new operating system, and within a few days they found a glitch and fixed it,"" he said. “I don’t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads -- or threatening to shut down the company if they didn’t. That’s not we do things in America. We don’t actually root for failure.”

The federal government apologized via Twitter. “We're working to fix these issues as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience,” @HealthCareGov tweeted.

That means people in the 36 states where the federal government is running the health insurance exchanges couldn’t sign up right away on the first day.

Republicans in Congress used the new ammunition to immediately attack the Administration's plans for health reform.

""Today, across the country, Americans are attempting to purchase health insurance on Obamacare exchanges and are being met with crashing websites, missing price information, confusing forms and in some cases, exchanges that had to delay their start date because they aren't ready yet,"" said California Republican Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .

""These 'glitches,' which the President is trying to brush off, reveal how totally unprepared the government is for this launch even with three and a half years to prepare.""

Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican who has been a critic of the ACA, tweeted a picture of her state's malfunctioning site. ""#ObamaCare exchanges open today and #WA State's website isn't even working. Precursor to the complications to come,"" she said.

Tony Jewell of Ventnor, N.J., was disappointed but not surprised.

“I did not log on this morning expecting to sign up for health care today and they didn’t let me down,” said Jewell, who says he quit a full-time job to open his own public relations business, in the expectation that he could buy health insurance on the new exchanges.

“I would have been pleasantly surprised if it had worked,” added Jewell, who tried to log onto the federal exchange website in his home state of New Jersey.

Maryland's site for enrolling people crashed early Tuesday. ""We are currently experiencing a high volume of traffic on MarylandHealthConnection.gov and we want to make the experience as positive for everyone as possible. Please check back later,"" the site advised. California's site also seemed stuck.

The health insurance exchanges are at the heart of the changes being made by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is taking effect in stages. Tuesday is the first day that people who don't have health insurance can begin to sign up, either on the federal exchange, or on state exchanges in the 14 states that are running their own.



But it's a six-month open enrollment period, so people do not have to get signed up the first day. The government and advocacy groups, anticipating problems, have hired thousands of ""navigators"" to help walk people through the process, which even on a good day was expected to take 45 minutes or longer.

Jewell, a Republican who says he is embracing Obamacare reluctantly because there’s nothing better being offered, is confident the health exchanges will eventually work. “As a patient, I assume they will get the program up and running,” he said.

And he knows it can be difficult to launch a new program. Jewell was a spokesman at the Health and Human Services Department under former President George W. Bush.

""I am a Republican who is sympathetic to the program. It would be helpful if it worked for me. I assume it will,” he said. He and his wife have pre-existing health conditions that make it difficult to buy private insurance, but the ACA forces insurers offering new policies to take all comers, regardless of previous health issues.

Jewell was among thousands of Americans who were ready to try the new online marketplace. He doesn’t think it crashed under the weight of demand, however.

“I was trying during the 7 am hour on the East Coast. I can’t believe people were setting their alarms to get up for Obamacare,” Jewell said.

But some states suggested that is what did happen. “We logged 10,000 visitors in the last 3 hours,” Connecticut’s exchange administrators tweeted at @AccessHealthCT. “22 enrollments so far. Make sure your browser is updated if you are having problems!”

Some saw the website crashes as a sign of success. ""This plan that the Radical GOP says is so bad is on the verge of crashing due to such high volume,"" said Mark Nelson of Kingman, Ariz., in a Facebook posting."

Contrast this with the Federal program, and as Krugman notes, imagine how the press coverage would be different were that data showing 100,000/day signing up.

Krugman covers what happened with John Boehner, including his office putting the healthcare exchange on hold for 35 minutes.

But there is more to California. Krugman notes a key statistic:

To work as planned, health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool — that is, it must sign up young, healthy Americans as well as their older, less healthy compatriots. And so far, so good: in October, 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34, slightly above that group’s share of the population. What we have in California, then, is a proof of concept. Yes, Obamacare is workable — in fact, done right, it works just fine.

I would still like to see how much of the problem on Healthcare.gov was a result of DDOS attacks, since there is now some clear evidence that happened, fomented by right-wing web sites.

And we know ALEC is still seeking ways to undermine OBamacare, including pushing state legislation that might strip licenses of insurance companies that participated in the program - although I suspect that any such attempt would create a devastating backlash, including from the insurance companies, for as Krugman notes

one shouldn’t forget that the insurance industry has a big financial stake in the success of Obamacare, and will soon be pitching in with big efforts to sign people up.

California - and red state Kentucky - show that properly administered Obamacare can work, that people want better access to health insurance.

No, we do not all live in states that have chosen to make the process work.

But the kinks in healthcare.gov are being worked out.

More and more people are able to sign up.

And the subsidies are making MEANINGFUL health insurance more affordable than ever.

The question is whether the mainstream media will dig below the surface and the rhetoric to tell the real story.

In the meantime, we have models that show the approach does work.

As Krugman concludes,

Again, Obamacare’s rollout was a disaster. But in California we can see what health reform will look like, beyond the glitches. And it’s going to work."

As a result, it has had more success enrolling people than the disastrous federal exchange. Still, Colorado’s relative “success” reveals a deeper problem with the new health care entitlement. So far, just 226 people have enrolled for private health insurance. At the same time, 25,000 Coloradans will be newly eligible for Medicaid benefits in January.

Since the opening of the exchange in Colorado, 16,000 residents have used the system to enroll in the newly expanded Medicaid program. Another 9,000 adults without children were on waiting lists for the program. These individuals will also gain new Medicaid coverage next year.

Medicaid, a shared federal-state health care entitlement, reimburses health care providers the least amount. Providers typically receive around 18 cents on each dollar billed. Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, pays 23 cents. Private insurers reimburse providers around 38 cents for each dollar billed.

Pushing more Americans into the system through Medicaid not only increases the demand for health care services, but reduces at the margin the funds available to maintain that system. Either those with private insurance will have to bear a larger burden funding the system or the system will contract so that health care services are difficult to receive.

Even if a magical pot of money were found to fund these services, it isn’t clear that having Medicaid coverage actually helps anyone. As my former colleague Nick Gillespie recently pointed out, a respected study out of Oregon found no difference in health outcomes from those on Medicaid and those uninsured.

The problems with ObamaCare and future funding are not just confined to Medicaid, which is the dominant vehicle to provide new health coverage. Some percentage of the 226 Coloradans who have enrolled for private coverage will get federal subsidies to help purchase their insurance. The US Treasury, for the first time, will send premium payments to insurance companies to cover these subsidies. Medicaid and Medicare are already the fastest growing segments of the federal budget. These two programs, as well as the new health insurance subsidies, will likely soon consume all federal revenue.

Math will prove to be the biggest obstacle to ObamaCare."

Inasmuch as Texas is the state with the highest rate of uninsured citizens he refused Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid. For those with pre-existing condition in Texas who were either in the high priced high risk Texas insurance pool or were uninsured because of the cost of these high risk pools, Obamacare comes to the rescue even here in Texas.

My wife has Lupus, a pre-existing condition. As a small business owner I had a group plan with a professional engineering organization. After being extorted with rates that effectively cost us north of $20 thousand a year over a decade ago I migrated to a high deductible catastrophic policy for my daughter and myself, an inexpensive student policy for my daughter while in college, and the Texas High Risk pool for my wife. It was expensive but less than the previous policy. Over the long run it is evident that this would become unsustainable as all these policies increased in value at a much faster rate than inflation.

Then came Obamacare. Obamacare means that effective October 1st, once again my wife, my daughter (while still in college and less than 26 years old), and me will be once again on the same policy at an affordable price. I already checked pricing and they are less expensive, reasonable, and provide much better coverage.

The real reason for this post however is the hypocrisy of the Republican Party in Texas. Republicans run Texas, not because it is a Red State but because it is the state with the worst voter participation. They run all departments. They run all agencies including the high risk pool. Today my wife received the following letter.

Important to note is that the letter correctly echoes the benefits of Obamacare for the millions in Texas and the United States with preexisting conditions. It correctly states that someone with a preexisting condition can no longer be denied coverage. It states forcefully (with an underline) that everyone is guaranteed the same rate given one’s age. It also correctly states that many will qualify for subsidies.

The letter even goes further in promoting Obamacare. It correctly states that there are no more lifetime maximums (in other words insurance companies cannot stop paying up to some maximum; bankruptcies be gone). It correctly states that 100% coverage for preventative care is provided, and all policies now cover doctor visits hospitalization, and prescriptions. In other words charlatans can no longer sell worthless policies. Most importantly, the letter sends Texans to the correct website that will provide them accurate information instead of all the lies and misinformation provided in an orchestrated manner by the Republican Party. The misinformation and lies will directly cause the unnecessary deaths of many, mostly their own constituents and base.

This letter from a Texas agency is the best justification for Obamacare. This Texas government agency placed the wellbeing of Texans over politics.

Fox Corrects CBS News Obamacare Insurance Plan Loss ""Horror Story""","She also noted that the fact that so many are losing their health care plans is “directly at odds with repeated assurances by the president.” Many, including Dianne Barrette, a 56-year-old Florida resident, were recently informed that their current health care plans were not comprehensive enough to meet coverage requirements set by the ACA. Barrette was recently informed that her new plan will cost 10 times what she presently pays per month.

CBS' Jan Crawford took that information from Ms. Barrette and repeated it at face value with no investigation or followup. Poor, poor Ms, Barrette her insurance costs are skyrocketing by 10 times their original cost.



Well you will never believe who poked giant holes through this 'report': Fox News' Greta Van Sustern.



Greta teed up the interview using the same setup as Crawford’s piece, that Barrette is “finding out she will have to pay 10 times as much for health insurance” because “she is losing her current plan to Obamacare.” “I have a copy of your Florida Blue insurance and it’s about $54 a month,” Greta continued, “and now I understand that under Obamacare, it’s going to go up, at least they said that the policy they would offer you under Florida Blue, would be $591; is that correct?” Actually, the plan BCBSFL was only one of many plans Dianne has to choose from, 10 of which are cheaper than that $591, and based on her income, she’d only pay around $209 a month, but Greta did cut right to the chase about the quality of her old plan. “Your $54 a month policy is a pretty, you know, bare bones policy, “Greta said. “Why do you want to keep that one, except for the price? Maybe you can get something better with a subsidy?”

Ms. Barrette goes on to say that this 'insurance' is perfect for what she needs: a doctor visit copay and prescription copay, and maybe some outpatient services. It turns out that she actually had that reversed and the insurance company paid a $50 'copay' towards a doctor visit, and $15 for prescriptions, and she herself was responsible for all the rest of the costs. The interviewee acknowledged no hospital stays were covered in response to Greta's question.

Now this is exactly the type of junk insurance Obamacare is meant to do away with, and it is not surprising that people don't know what their insurance covers. But a reporter with a major news outlet should have done some reporting and learned that. So it should be of great embarassment to CBS to be shown up that way by Fox filling in missing facts in their story.

What is funny though is that a subsequent interview that was to take place on Fox News with Ms. Barrette, was cancelled, after Greta poked holes in the story.



Following her chat with Van Susteren, Barrette got word from a network producer that her appointment to appear this morning on Fox News was cancelled, she tells the Erik Wemple Blog.

http://news.yahoo.com/shutdown-showdown-widened-gop-tea-party-rift-191705968.html,,[],Shutdown showdown widened GOP-tea party rift,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republicans' clear defeat in the budget-debt brawl has widened the rift between the Grand Old Party and the blossoming tea party movement that helped revive it.

Implored by House Speaker John Boehner to unite and ""fight another day"" against President Barack Obama and Democrats, Republicans instead intensified attacks on one another, an ominous sign in advance of more difficult policy fights and the 2014 midterm elections.

The tea party movement spawned by the passage of Obama's health care overhaul three years ago put the GOP back in charge of the House and in hot pursuit of the law's repeal. The effort hit a wall this month in the budget and debt fight, but tea partyers promised to keep up the effort.

Whatever the future of the law, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell vowed he would not permit another government shutdown.

""I think we have now fully acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is,"" McConnell said in an interview with The Hill newspaper.

Tea party Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told ABC News he wouldn't rule out using the tactic again, when the same budget and debt questions come up next year.

""I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,"" Cruz said.

That divide defined the warring Republican factions ahead of the midterm elections, when 35 seats in the Democratic-controlled Senate and all 435 seats in the Republican-dominated House will be on the ballot. In the nearer term, difficult debates over immigration and farm policy loom, along with another round of budget and debt talks.

The animosity only intensified as lawmakers fled Washington this week for a few days' rest.

The Twitterverse crackled with threats, insults and the names of the 27 GOP senators and 87 GOP House members who voted for the leadership's agreement that reopened the government and raised the nation's borrowing limit. Republicans got none of their demands, keeping only the spending cuts they had won in 2011.

Story continues

Within hours, TeaParty.net tweeted a link to the 114 lawmakers, tagging each as a Republican in name only who should be turned out of office: ""Your 2014 #RINO hunting list!""

""We shouldn't have to put up with fake conservatives like Mitch McConnell,"" read a fundraising letter Thursday from the Tea Party Victory Fund Inc.

Another group, the Senate Conservatives Fund, announced it was endorsing McConnell's GOP opponent, Louisville, Ky., businessman Matt Bevin.

""Mitch McConnell has the support of the entire Washington establishment and he will do anything to hold on to power,"" the group, which raised nearly $2 million for tea party candidates in last year's elections, announced. ""But if people in Kentucky and all across the country rise up and demand something better, we're confident Matt Bevin can win this race.""

The same group pivoted to the Mississippi Senate race, where Republican Thad Cochran is weighing whether to seek a seventh term. Cochran voted for the McConnell-Reid deal, so the Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed a primary opponent, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a private attorney the group says ""will fight to stop Obamacare,"" ''is not part of the Washington establishment"" and ""has the courage to stand up to the big spenders in both parties.""

There were more tea party targets: Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee also are seeking re-election.

To her Facebook friends, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin posted: ""We're going to shake things up in 2014. Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky — which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi.""

Opponents of the tea party strategy to make ""Obamacare"" the centerpiece of the budget fight seethed over what they said was an exercise in self destruction. Many clamored for Boehner and McConnell, the nation's highest-ranking Republicans, to impose some discipline, pointing to polls that showed public approval of Congress plummeting to historic lows and that most Americans blamed Republicans for the government shutdown.

A Pew Research Center poll released this week showed public favorability for the Tea Party dropped to its lowest level since driving the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 elections. An AP-Gfk poll showed that 70 percent now hold unfavorable views of the Tea Party.

And yet, House Republican leaders tried again and again to resolve the standoff the tea party's way — by demanding limits on Obamacare in exchange for reopening the government — until they ran of options and accepted the bipartisan deal.

""When your strategy doesn't work, or your tactic doesn't work, you lose credibility in your conference,"" said Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., referring to the tea partyers' tactics. ""Clearly the leadership followed certain members' tactics, certain members' strategies, and they proved not to be all that successful. So I would hope that we learn from the past.""

""I do believe the outside groups have really put us in this position,"" said Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., referring to the Heritage Foundation's political campaign arm and other organizations demanding fealty to their ideology. Those groups ""have worked in conjunction with members of Congress and with Tea Party groups pushing a strategy that was never going to work.""

Tea partyers hold a contrary view. Boehner, they say, solidified his standing as the GOP's leader by holding the line against compromise as long as he did. And the standoff, they add, has increased their movement's clout.

""I think it builds credibility, because I think Democrats did not think that we would press this,"" said Rep. John Fleming, R-La. ""And now they know that we will, and that we might do it again."""

Oh, yes, it has. And is.

Faced with a blizzard of bad PR as a result of a faltering website that had been designed as the main portal for those seeking insurance under the plan, Obama went to Boston to park himself in the place where Republicans and Democrats passed a state health program that served as a model for the national one.

His intent was multi-pronged: By location, he sent the reminder that in places where all parties worked to pass and improve healthcare reform, the program has succeeded. (And, he pointed out, that was accomplished under a Republican governor, Mitt Romney, the man he defeated in 2012). By topic, he accented the popular aspects of healthcare reform, as if to remind people that there was a reason that politicians have tried to pull off insurance reform for decades.

But in trying to re-argue the case for a program passed several years ago — and not sold well in the interim — Obama faces an intractable question: Is anyone listening?

Recent polling shows that views of healthcare reform have frozen in place, and along partisan lines.

According to a survey taken by the Pew Research Center in mid-October, about 4 in 10 Americans approved of the healthcare law and 5 in 10 disapproved.

But among Democrats, 75% approved. Among Republicans, 85% disapproved. And their views have apparently hardened; apart from a slight increase in disapproval among Republicans, hardly any group changed their tune from a September Pew poll.

Republicans have noted time and again that the national plan was passed by Democrats against GOP objections, making it different at the outset from the bipartisan Massachusetts measure. Nonetheless, the president’s remarks Wednesday appeared intended to reach over the squabbling right-left divide to reassure Americans that what was passed wasn’t as life-altering as its opponents have made it out to be and in fact had some popular components.

“A true patients’ bill of rights,” he called it. “No more discrimination against kids with preexisting conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick and need it most. No more lifetime limits or restricted annual limits. Most plans now have to cover free preventive care like mammograms and birth control. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they are 26. All this is in place right now. It is working right now.”

He implored those who are uninsured and want to sign up for coverage, or those whose existing insurance is being replaced, to have patience as the kinks are worked out of the system. He repeatedly said that he was confident those groups would find affordable plans -- once they can gain access to the system, that is.

He also nodded to the blast of criticism from people whose bargain-basement plans have been canceled because they did not comport with the new minimum coverage requirements for health insurance. He called the insurers who had sold those plans “bad apple” insurers. And he altered his often-uttered statement, as the law was proposed and since, that Americans who were happy with their insurance could keep it. Now what you can keep, he said, is “health insurance that works,” as defined by the law.

“If you’re getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace,” he said. “That’s what it’s there for.... You’re going to get a better deal.”

The danger in Obama’s remarks, nearly a full month after the rocky debut of the insurance marketplaces that were supposed to benefit the most needy, is that they came after a considerable chunk of the country has either gone to their partisan corners or thrown their hands up in frustration or disgust. A calm rendering of the facts as he saw them might have at least minimized some of the partisan tension, but Obama did not pass up the opportunity to dig at the other side.

He spoke of governors, including some Republican executives, who have worked to put the healthcare law into place, and chastised those who had worked to block it.

“Some are so locked into politics that they won’t lift a finger to help their own people,” he said, with an edge of bitterness. “If they put as much energy into making it work as they do to attacking the law, Americans would be better off.”

And, he said, anyone defending the broken system that the law was meant to replace “should have to explain themselves ... because I don’t think we should go back to discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. I don’t think we should go back to dropping people because they get sick or they make a mistake on their application.”

Selling the healthcare law has always been a stiff challenge, in some ways giving rise to the same fears that are summoned by discussions about changing Social Security and Medicare. People are always worried that they will lose what they have, imperfect as it is. When putting a plan in place whose most visible beneficiaries are people in the minority — the uninsured and the uninsurable — squawks are predictable.

At this point, however, Obama alone owns Obamacare, for better or worse.

On Monday, the crush of consumers prompted the Obama administration to put thousands of applicants on hold and push back another key enrollment deadline to Tuesday. This unexpected move came despite weeks of computer fixes aimed at improving the troubled HealthCare.gov website.

Even in California and other states where enrollment was running more smoothly, plenty of consumers were experiencing snags.

Anibal Manzano, 56, left a clinic in downtown Los Angeles on Monday without signing up because enrollment counselors were stymied by computer delays with the California enrollment system.

The pet groomer said he has never had insurance and wanted to get coverage for himself and his wife. “I’ll come back next week and see if that works out,” he said.

California officials said some technical headaches were inevitable, but the state website was working well enough to have enabled more than 400,000 people to enroll in private health plans as of Sunday. Nearly 30,000 people were picking out coverage daily, not counting thousands more Medi-Cal enrollees.

“The Affordable Care Act is taking off in California, and that bodes well for the nation,” said Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered California exchange. “It’s exciting to see a state coming together and say: ‘Let’s make the Affordable Care Act work. Let’s put politics aside.’”

Even with the late surge, national enrollment in private health plans remains well short of the administration’s goal of roughly 3 million by year end. Federal officials didn’t release new figures Monday.

President Obama said last week that more than half a million Americans had enrolled so far in December using the federal website. That would bring the total enrollment in health plans to more than 1 million as of Friday, including both federal and state-run exchanges. Nationwide, an additional 800,000 people had been deemed eligible for the law’s expanded version of Medicaid through November.

Strong enrollment is crucial, particularly among young and healthier policyholders, to keep insurance premiums affordable in the government-run marketplaces and to fulfill Obama’s goal of dramatically reducing the number of uninsured nationwide.

“It has been a terrible three months for getting this underway. It’s been a real tragedy,” said Timothy Jost, a health policy expert and law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. “But I think we are turning the corner and things will go a lot more smoothly for the next three months.”

Across the country over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of consumers went online or visited enrollment events to meet a Monday deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.

Applications will be taken through March 31, when the six-month enrollment window closes. Coverage generally takes effect within a few weeks of signing up.

As the deadline approached, federal officials said, the HealthCare.gov site used by residents of 36 states received 1.2 million visits over the weekend and more than 1 million by late afternoon Monday.

By midday Monday, the federal officials activated a queuing system designed to relieve pressure on the site. Julie Bataille, an administration spokeswoman, said that more than 60,000 visitors had submitted their e-mail addresses to be notified when the site was less busy.

Federal officials and their contractors spent weeks retooling HealthCare.gov after a disastrous launch in October.

In light of the bottlenecks, administration officials extended by 24 hours the deadline to sign up for coverage that will become effective Jan. 1. The White House described the postponement as merely a stop-gap to make sure that no one who is online by midnight Monday would be excluded.

“Anticipating high demand, which we indeed saw starting early [Monday] morning, and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones, we have taken steps to make sure that those who tried to enroll today but had delays due to high traffic have a fail-safe,” Bataille said.

Critics of the healthcare law, however, say the latest deadline shift represents another failure by the Obama administration. And many insurers and consumer advocates have bristled at the ever-changing rules that they said sow even more confusion among the public about a complex healthcare overhaul.

“How can anyone make healthcare decisions today knowing that the law may be unilaterally changed again tomorrow?” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said last week.

Several state-run exchanges, such as those in California, New York and Kentucky, have been reporting robust enrollment, while states that rely on the federal site have lagged far behind.

But enrollment counselors in California said the state website was slow or unresponsive Monday, often making an application take up to two hours to finish. Wait times to state call centers stretched beyond an hour in some cases, according to Covered California.

Gil Alcala, a state-certified insurance agent in Covina, said he worried about 25 applicants possibly falling through the cracks because the Covered California website wouldn’t let him input data from their paper applications Monday.

“The website is freezing and then I get an error notification,” Alcala said. “They need to push this deadline back again. This is terrible.”

California officials said they were sticking with the Dec. 23 deadline, but they vowed to help anyone who starts an application Monday to get coverage starting Jan. 1.

“We will help people get across the finish line who have started an application [Monday],” Lee said. “If you have made a good-faith effort to get started, you can finish it [Tuesday].”

Los Angeles resident Jeff Norman, 54, tried to beat the deadline and applied last week for Medicaid coverage. But he said he still hadn’t received confirmation of insurance starting Jan. 1. His current coverage through Anthem Blue Cross is being canceled Dec. 31 because it didn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.

Norman needs regular physical therapy on his aching hip and leg, he said. “If I want to get medical services at the beginning of January,” he said, “I don’t know what will happen.”

On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings.

“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.”

Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”

At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings.

The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record.

When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”

According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday."

It coerces some people to do something they might not want to do, and which, in fact, may not be in their short-term interest to do.

Already, it’s very clear that millions of Americans — and not just Tea Party types — do not accept the legitimacy of the government to overrule individual decisions, even on something like health insurance. This is not the America of 1932 or of 1964. This is an America steeped in distrust of government. It’s an America that is, on both left and right, steeped in the ethos of individual choice. It’s an America steeped in a morality of authenticity, which says that it is right to listen to the individual voice within and immoral to be forced to conform to the external commands from without.

From the very first moment, people have had problems with the idea of mandates. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton among a Democratic primary electorate in 2008 in part because he opposed mandates. When Obamacare was still a bill, members of Congress succumbed to political pressure and lowered the penalties that would be imposed on those who violated the mandates. Then the Supreme Court majority decided the penalties weren’t even penalties; they were just an optional tax.

When disgruntled groups have objected to the employer and other mandates during implementation, the administration has generally loosened, delayed or suspended them. Late last week, the administration granted a “hardship exemption” to people who had their prior coverage canceled and who believe that the mandated Obamacare offerings are unaffordable.

Most telling, the administration hasn’t even made a moral argument for the mandates. It hasn’t even tried to make the case that coercing some people to participate in collective action is necessary for the common good."

In a ruling released Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman directed the FDA to make levonorgestrel-based contraceptives available over the counter, and without a prescription. The ruling overturns a 2011 decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requiring that girls under age 17 obtain a prescription for the Plan B One-Step contraceptive or its equivalents

In his strongly worded ruling, Korman called Sebelius’ decision “politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent.” No serious health risks have been associated with the drug’s use among adults and children, Korman wrote, and even the FDA acknowledged that the drug’s “safety and efficacy in the pediatric population have been established.”

The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which argued that restrictions placed on the drug imposed unreasonable delays for women of all ages. While the drugs are available to women 17 and older without a prescription, the requirements created confusion and pharmacists kept them behind counters so that they were not available outside regular business hours.

“Today science has finally prevailed over politics,” Nancy Northrup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods.”

Korman ordered that the drugs be made available without limits within 30 days.

Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said the government was “reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly.”

Emergency contraception must be taken within five days of unprotected sex to be effective, and it will not work if a woman is already pregnant.

According to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, nearly half of all pregnancies that occur in the U.S. each year are unintended. The average age for first-time sex is 17, and roughly 750,000 pregnancies will occur among 15- to 19-year olds each year.

For the second time in a week, President Barack Obama backtracked on his promise to Americans that they could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare, telling a group of activists on Monday that what he had really meant was that Americans could keep their healthcare plans “if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.”

Speaking at an Organizing for Action health care summit in Washington, D.C., Obama revised a signature mantra of his stump speeches during the Obamacare debate and the 2012 campaign in which he repeatedly said that under Obamacare, “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

In 2009, the President even cut off the possibility of modifiers to that plan. In a speech to the American Medical Association, he stated, “If you like your healthcare plan, you’ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.”

In his Monday speech, however, the promise took on newfound nuance. “Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,” Obama said. “So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act, you’re grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we’re saying is they’ve got to change it to a higher standard.

“They’ve got to make it better, they’ve got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling. That’s part of the promise that we made too. That’s why we went out of our way to make sure that the law allowed for grandfathering.”

In addition to the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website, millions of Americans have been receiving cancellation notices from their health insurance providers since Obamacare went into effect in October. Mainstream media outlets and personalities–from the Washington Post to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd–that were some of Obama’s fiercest defenders the last four years have called him out on this falsehood, even admitting in hindsight that they were skeptical of Obama’s signature claim.

Obama attempted his first rewrite of history last Wednesday in his healthcare speech at Boston’s Fanueil Hall after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was grilled in front of Congress and apologized for Obamacare’s rollout, which she conceded was a “debacle.”

“For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,” Obama said last week in Boston. Obama then said that Americans who were receiving cancellation letters merely had “substandard” insurance plans."

USATODAY

The ongoing trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell is finally getting the attention it deserves, and for good reason.

The 2011 grand jury report on Gosnell, charged with murder in the deaths of a patient and seven babies, is a gruesome and disturbing document. It includes accounts of fully delivered, live babies having their spinal chords severed by scissors. And it describes horribly unsafe and unsanitary conditions at a business that allegedly operated as a pill mill by day and rogue abortion clinic by night.

The report also details a complete breakdown of oversight by multiple agencies, hospitals and professional organizations that allowed the clinic to operate in plain sight for decades. These included the Pennsylvania Departments of Health and State, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the National Abortion Federation and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, all of which were either tasked with regulating the clinic or had obtained information about what was going on inside.

It took a nighttime raid by agents from the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, who had gotten wind of the clinic's pill business, to uncover the house of horrors that the regulators overlooked.

For whatever reason — lack of awareness of the case, faulty judgment — national news organizations were largely ignoring Gosnell's trial, which began March 18, until anti-abortion activists and USA TODAY columnist Kirsten Powers called them out. The combination of alleged mass murder and regulatory failure warrants national coverage. What it doesn't warrant, however, is major changes in national abortion policy.

As the grand jurors predicted in their report, both sides in the abortion wars are using the Gosnell trial to score points.

Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., one of the most steadfast and vociferous abortion opponents in Congress, has already cited the trial to press his case against ""the brutality of abortion and the violence that is commonplace inside the abortion industry."" Other abortion foes have used the case to push for more stringent laws, such as the one recently enacted in Virginia that requires clinics to adopt hospital-style building codes, or ones enacted in Mississippi and Alabama requiring abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital.

On the other side of the debate, abortion rights activists have argued that the Gosnell case was not the product of overly permissive regulations but of overly restrictive ones. They say clients ended up at his ghastly clinic because other options were not available or were too costly.

All these arguments have weaknesses. Many of the new laws are obviously designed to make abortions unavailable by driving up providers' costs. And it doesn't take much more than an Internet search to turn up other Pennsylvania clinics that will provide abortions as late as the 24th week of pregnancy, the legal limit Gosnell is accused of violating.

Aside from the obvious — that regulators should do their jobs, and that criminal doctors should be harshly prosecuted — it's hard to say what else should be concluded from the Gosnell case.

Unless evidence emerges that clinics like his exist in other parts of the country, the case looks like an appalling anomaly.

Just as the murder of an abortion doctor by a fanatic isn't representative of the broad anti-abortion movement, nor are the alleged atrocities at Gosnell's clinic representative of abortion providers more generally.

If Gosnell is convicted, perhaps his story is best seen the way the grand jurors — who held diverse views on the morality of abortion — saw it: as a case of ""disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants."""

Thirty-nine Democrats joined Republicans in a 261-157 vote to approve the legislation, offered by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), which would allow insurers to continue selling individual policies that do not meet new federal standards.

The Democratic defections, which the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had hoped to prevent, highlighted the growing unease among House Democrats over the botched rollout of the program and dissatisfaction with the administration’s proposed fix, announced by the president on Thursday.

Both the Upton bill and the president’s administrative fix were crafted to respond to the number of cancellation notices being sent to customers in the individual insurance market, despite repeated promises by Obama that Americans would be allowed to keep their plans if they wanted.

The GOP-controlled House was always expected to approve the bill, which Republicans described as the first step in a campaign to kill the Affordable Care Act.

“The president repeatedly said that if you liked your healthcare plan you could keep it,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). “We knew this was a promise he could not keep, and now it’s a promise he has broken.”

The vote was seen as a critical test of Democratic unity. The president sought to tamp down a revolt from congressional Democrats by announcing the administrative remedy, which gave insurance companies federal permission to renew policies for one year.

Hill Democrats — many of whom fear that their support for the president’s healthcare law will be used against them by Republicans during the 2014 election — welcomed the president’s move, as well as his acknowledgment during a news conference of the political bind he had put them in.

But many still saw a need to demonstrate they were also responsive to voters’ concerns.

“I’m just sending a message by my vote to my constituents back home that I’m going to take whatever action I can take as a member of Congress to fix the problems that have been created, unfortunately, in the law,” said Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.), who voted in favor of the Upton bill. “It’s me being responsible to the people back home.”

Defections by House Democrats included not just lawmakers like Barber who represent swing or Republican-leaning districts. Bruce Braley, a candidate for an open Senate seat in Iowa next year, also voted for the bill.

It was unlikely that the Senate would pass a similar bill, and Obama has vowed to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.

“It is only a masquerade, a Trojan horse coming in to undermine the Affordable Care Act,” Pelosi said, deriding what she said was the 46th legislative attempt by Republicans to scuttle the law.

House Democrats offered an alternative proposal, similar to legislation sponsored by Mary Landrieu (D-La.) in the Senate, that would allow individuals who had substandard plans to keep them for an additional year.

Dr. Ben Carson splashed onto the national stage with his blistering criticism of ObamaCare last month at the National Prayer breakfast, with President Obama seated just a few feet away. Carson is a heroic surgeon, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery, who performed groundbreaking medical miracles at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is a brilliant and passionate advocate for free market principals, individual responsibility, and the freedoms and liberty embodied in resistance to bloated big government programs like ObamaCare. He also happens to be black. Therefore, he must be stopped, now.

Like Clarence Thomas, Condi Rice, Colin Powell (until he got the message) and Herman Cain before him, Carson will now be the target of the most vile and reprehensible kinds of criticism from black progressives like Touré and his colleague Al Sharpton. A black man who doesn’t blindly support the president and the big government programs that has created a dependency on government that has crippled America’s underclass is susceptible to name calling that, otherwise, would not be tolerated in American political discourse.

On his show, Touré said this of Carson:

Carson is a brilliant medical thinker but he’s got intellectual tumors like a flat tax, which is regressive, and ignorant in the face of wealth inequality where the top 1% own 35% and the bottom 60% own 2.3%. I doubt Jesus would tax them equally. Just as I doubt the GOP would entertain a white non-politician with unserious ideas. But Carson has joined the GOP’s version of affirmative action, where blacks that can speak conservative game get raced to the front of the line because then people get to put a bumper sticker on their car that say, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Carson!’ Which would fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Cain?’ Which fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Allen West!’ Yes, any black friend will do, no matter how far outside the political system they emerge from and no matter how unserious their ideas are. Because it’s all make believe. None of them will ever get a nomination for the Presidency, just as the GOP will never get black votes, because the only thing they care about is winning and not the economic or social needs of black people. But in the meantime, imagine away you guys. At CPAC Carson said, ‘Let’s say you magically put me in the White House.’ But, my brother, no magic is required to accomplish that. As soon as the sequester ends, you could take a White House tour.

Let’s be clear: Touré holds black men up to a different (lower or higher, not sure) standard when they criticize the President. He expects black people to think a certain way and pounces when they step out of line and express a different set of ideas than what Touré believes they should believe, due to their skin color. Because Carson is a black man, he is therefore the beneficiary of affirmitive action, in Touré’s mind, and if he dares to present an opposing view from MSNBC’s Obamadoxy, he is an Uncle Tom and betrayer of his race.

In short, Touré has a special contempt for black men who criticize President Obama. There may be many different interpretations of the definition of racial prejudice and/or racism, but my understanding of racism is that it is the belief that humans are divided into distinct groups based upon their skin color and genetic make-up, and those groups are expected to behave and think in certain ways (inferior or superior) solely based upon their race. Touré’s special loathing of Dr. Carson may not be based upon his race, but it certainly appears to be. And if that doesn’t fall under the description of racism, then I would really appreciate it if Touré could explain the distinction to me, because I’m having trouble seeing it."

Each week offers new cause for alarm: whether a dysfunctional website rife with opportunity for security breaches, health care cancellation notices, or sharp increases in health care premiums, ObamaCare has quickly devolved into a political third rail for the Democratic party.

Out of the ashes of ObamaCare, however, rises a golden opportunity for the Republican party – so long as the GOP’s leadership has the presence of mind to grasp the full implications of this historic moment.

[pullquote]

As President Obama’s approval ratings sink, Republicans have a narrow window of opportunity to begin the process of rebranding themselves as true defenders of the middle class.

And boy, do they need it. Though aligned with most Americans in opposition to ObamaCare, Republicans are sinking deeper and deeper into a hole of their own digging.

No matter how hard they try to align themselves with a majority of Americans, Republicans simply aren’t connecting with the middle class, who view them as a party of “old, rich, white men,” or “the party of ‘no.’” These perceptions are reflected in recent poll numbers, which show GOP approval ratings hovering below 30%.

As someone who manages brands for a living, I can assert with confidence that all successful brands stand for something. It is not enough to merely be against something, no matter how unpopular that “something” is. All durable brands are associated with at least one positive attribute in the minds of consumers - or in this case, voters.

That is certainly not the case for the GOP right now.

Americans want leadership on the issue of health care, and they will reject politicians who delay the hard work of problem-solving.

As such, the GOP’s anti-ObamaCare rhetoric has gone stale. Republicans must abandon their “party of ‘no’” moniker, by sharing their vision of what “no” should be replaced with. In other words, Republicans must explain to voters what they stand for, as well as what they’re against.

A party that controls only one chamber of the legislative branch cannot make public policy. But the House GOP can facilitate the collapse of ObamaCare by aligning Republicans with the interests of hardworking Americans, and forcing Democrats to side with the special interest groups that are poised to profit from them.

In order for this to work, actions taken by the House GOP should be accompanied by simple, straightforward messaging, so that voters can connect with the Republican narrative on a visceral level.

Visceral connections require visceral emotions -- and only two things stoke the ire of Americans as deeply as Congress: trial lawyers and insurance companies. If Republicans leverage this antipathy to their advantage, Democrats will find themselves in the unenviable position of being defenders of both.

The House should pass two bills, recognizing that Frosty the Snowman has better prospects on a Hawaiian vacation than these bills do of ever becoming law. Nonetheless, they will set the stage for Republicans to become day-saving heroes for most voters on the issue of health care.

First, the House should pass a tort reform bill aimed at reducing medical malpractice premiums, for the sole purpose of reducing health care costs. GOP messaging points should target trial lawyers, framing them as special interest groups, explaining how they’ve influenced the architects of ObamaCare and how they plan to profit from it.

Concurrently, Republicans should explain how tort reform would decrease doctors’ costs of doing business, and how those savings would be passed on to hardworking Americans.

A few weeks later, the House should pass another bill permitting interstate competition for health insurance companies.

Doing so would force Democrats to defend ObamaCare’s protection of these quasi monopolies.

GOP messaging should highlight Democrats’ crony capitalism at the expense of free-market competition and individual choice.

ObamaCare is a “teachable moment” in this regard. Americans will always choose freedom and choice over being told what to do, so long as Republicans connect the dots for them.

Will these two bills and messaging points represent all that is needed to repair the GOP’s brand? Absolutely not. There is far more work to be done on that front.

But these initial efforts represent a meaningful first step in the right direction: one that recasts Republicans as defenders of the middle class, rather than merely an unpalatable alternative to the left."
"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-healthcare-glitch-20131025,0,5402697.story",2013-10-25 12:01:11,"['David G. Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",More legal trouble for Affordable Care Act,"WASHINGTON— If computer glitches are not enough of a problem, President Obama’s healthcare law also has a legal glitch that critics say could cause it to unravel in more than half the nation.

The Affordable Care Act proposes to make health insurance affordable to millions of low-income Americans by offering them tax credits to help cover the cost. To receive the credit, the law twice says they must buy insurance “through an exchange established by the state.”

But 36 states have decided against opening exchanges for now. Although the law permits the federal government to open exchanges instead, it does not say tax credits may be given to those who buy insurance through a federally run exchange.

Apparently no one noticed this when the long and complicated bill worked its way through the House and Senate. Last year, however, the Internal Revenue Service tried to remedy it by putting out a regulation that redefined “exchange” to include a “federally facilitated exchange.” This is “consistent with the language, purpose and structure … of the act as a whole,” the Treasury Department said.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

But critics of the law have seized on the glitch. They have filed four lawsuits that urge judges to rule the Obama administration must abide by the strict wording of the law, even if doing so dismantles it in nearly two-thirds of the states. And the Obama administration has no hope of repairing the glitch by legislation as long as the Republicans control the House.

This week, U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman in Washington, a President Clinton appointee, refused the administration’s request to dismiss the suit. Instead, he said the challengers had put forward a substantial claim, and he promised to issue a written ruling.

“This is a problem,” said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. “This case could have legs,” although “it was never the intent of Congress to establish federal exchanges that can’t do anything. They were supposed to have exactly the same powers.”

Michael Carvin, the Washington lawyer leading the challenge, says the wording of the law is what counts. “This is a question of whether you believe in the rule of law. And the language here is as clear as it could possibly be,” he said.

Last year, Carvin went before the Supreme Court to argue that the law’s mandate to buy insurance was unconstitutional. The high court handed down a split decision. By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the government may impose a tax penalty on those who can afford to buy insurance but decline to do so. But in a 7-2 decision, they said states had the option to expand their Medicaid coverage under the law, or to turn down extra federal money.

The states have now split evenly, as 25 of them have opted to take the extra money from Washington and expand their Medicaid coverage, and 25 have refused. As a result, the law’s aim to provide free healthcare for those who are poor will go forward in only half of the nation.

The new suits take aim at the parts of the law that offer subsidies to those who are above the poverty level but still may struggle to pay for insurance. A single person with an income up to $45,960 can qualify for subsidies now, as can a family of four with an income up to $94,200. If the federal government cannot offer these subsidies in the 36 states without exchanges, it cannot enforce the mandate to have insurance, lawyers say.

“My jaw dropped when I first saw this,” said Michael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute and a fierce critic of the law. He and others credit former Justice Department attorney Tom Christina and Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor, with first highlighting the glitch.

“This has the potential to sink Obamacare. It could make the current website problems seem minor by comparison,” Cannon said.

Defenders of the law say the courts are being used as part of the political campaign against the law.

“This is definitely heating up. It is now the major focus of the Republican strategy for undoing the Affordable Care Act,” said Simon Lazarus, a lawyer for the Constitutional Accountability Center. “The lawsuits should be seen as preposterous,” he said, because they ask judges to give the law a “nonsensical” interpretation.

No judge has ruled directly on the claim that the IRS rule put forth by the administration is illegal and contradicted by the words of the law. Indiana Atty. Gen. Greg Zoeller filed one of four lawsuits this month. A federal judge in Oklahoma is considering a similar suit filed by that state’s attorney general. A fourth suit is scheduled to be heard by a judge in Richmond, Va.

If any of the four judges agree with the challengers, they are likely to be asked to put the law on hold until the legal dispute is resolved. And that in turn could quickly send the issue to a U.S. appeals court and then to the Supreme Court.

“They are betting on getting five votes at the Supreme Court,” Lazarus said. “I don’t think it will happen.”

After a series of technical fixes and capacity upgrades, many of which were made over the past week, HealthCare.gov is now working more than 90 percent of the time — a big improvement over October, when the site was operating only about 43 percent of the time and frequently crashed, said Jeffrey Zients, the administration official overseeing the improvements.

“Bottom line, HealthCare.gov on December 1st is night and day from where it was on October 1st,” when the site was launched, Zients said in a teleconference with reporters Sunday morning.

Even with the improved performance, some people are likely to encounter problems on the site. And there is another worry — reports sent to insurance companies about who has enrolled in health plans include errors that could cause problems when people try to use their new insurance plans next year.

Administration officials, in talking to reporters, were careful not to declare a full-fledged victory. In a report issued Sunday, officials with the Department of Health and Human Services said the next few months would require further work to “improve and enhance the website and continue to improve the consumer experience.” Officials have also said repeatedly that consumers might still encounter difficulties and urged them to use the call center and seek help from specially trained personnel.

Still, the announcement is a milestone for the administration, which has struggled to improve the Web site since its botched Oct. 1 launch.

New challenges lie ahead. Most Americans are required to have health insurance starting Jan. 1, and the administration is racing to meet its now-tougher goal of enrolling 7 million uninsured people in health coverage by the end of March.

When the Web site launched, the uninsured, as well as people who were looking for better or cheaper coverage, were supposed to be able to go online to browse plans and rates, apply for subsidies and enroll in health plans. But many have encountered numerous technical difficulties on HealthCare.gov, the main portal for 36 states, as well as on a number of state-run Web sites.

Fixing the federal Web site was a crucial first step for the administration to restore trust in the health program, which has suffered in the polls this fall. It was also critical from a practical standpoint; people buying insurance on the marketplaces have until Dec. 23 to sign up for health plans that take effect on Jan. 1.

It may be hard to assess how well the site has met expectations until it handles a higher volume of visitors as Dec. 23 approaches.

The announcement offered some relief to Democratic lawmakers, who have struggled to defend the administration’s handling of the law.

“This is the equivalent of having a great item that you want to buy in the store but not being able to get through the front door,” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It sounds like the front door has been opened successfully now.”

Republicans said additional flaws in the site would soon emerge.

“When this Web site gets fixed, the problems really start for this administration,” former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Zients, on his call with reporters, said the number of people on the site was higher Saturday than it had been for all but the first days after the exchange launched.

Among those who tried to log on was Sandy Kush, 49, an unemployed medical transcriptionist from Illinois who tried six times in October to use HealthCare.gov, with no success.

She tried again Sunday and, with the help of a call-center representative, was able to enroll in Medicaid — a stopgap measure, she said, until she can find a new job that offers insurance. The whole experience took about an hour and a half but “was pretty smooth,” she said.

Others reported problems getting all the way through the process. Liz Gallops, 33, a North Carolina insurance broker who has tried unsuccessfully to get coverage through the site, said that HealthCare.gov seemed to be working better Sunday but that at one point she got a message stating that the system “cannot finish your application now.”

In the HHS report, ad­ministration officials offered a harsh assessment of the HealthCare.gov project and blamed the problems on hundreds of software bugs and inadequate hardware and infrastructure, as well as poor leadership.

“The system monitoring and response mechanisms were not sufficient for identifying issues or bugs or responding to them in real time,” it said. “Inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams prevented real-time decision making and efficient responses to address the issues with the site.”

But the officials said they had reorganized over the past five weeks and had put one firm in charge of the fixes, held “war room” meetings on critical issues and changed the decision-

making culture so their team is “operating with private-sector velocity and effectiveness.”

Zients said workers made more than 400 bug fixes and upgraded the software used for the enrollment process. The results are additional capacity, a faster response time and much-improved stability on the Web site, he said. About 50 fixes were made Saturday night, Zients said.

“We have a much more stable system that’s reliably open for business,” he said. “HealthCare.gov can now support intended volumes.”

The HHS report concluded that most of the department’s benchmarks for this weekend had been met. The average system response time when a person calls up a page on the Web site is under one second and the rate at which people are encountering error messages is “consistently well below 1 percent,” the report said,

The online system is stable — not crashing — more than 90 percent of the time, officials said. And the report said that the site can handle as many as 50,000 shoppers at the same time and up to 800,000 visits a day.

The report said the administration has yet to meet at least one of its key goals: reducing the site’s average response time to half a second. And government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, cautioned last week that they will not know if they have expanded the site’s carrying capacity to 50,000 users at once until they have that many users online.

Administration officials said they have set up a system to help consumers if they cannot immediately get access to the site during peak demand. If consumers visit the site when it is at capacity, they may leave an e-mail address to receive a notification from the site with a link that allows them to “go to the front of the queue when they come back to the site,” Zients said.

During the daytime Sunday, the site did not attract anywhere near the maximum number of users that HHS officials say HealthCare.gov should now be able to handle. The peak usage per hour came about noon, when 16,259 people were on the site at once, according to a government official with knowledge of the project.

Meanwhile, throughout the day Sunday, the site was meeting the administration’s target of an error rate of less than 1 percent, the official said, but the speed at which pages were loaded was roughly one per second, double the goal of a half-second.

The report did not address the “back-end” parts of the systems that consumers do not see, including the error-filled enrollment reports. Insurers have warned that if the problem is not fixed soon, some people may show up for doctor’s appointments in January only to find that the insurance company has no record of their enrollment.

“Insurers are still receiving enrollment files that are duplicative or include missing or inaccurate information,” Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s main lobbying group, said Sunday. “In some cases they aren’t receiving those enrollment files at all.”

In recent months, consumers having difficulty with the Web site have been turning to agents and brokers for help. But the system does not allow brokers to enter their identity numbers once a person has gotten a subsidy determination, or if the number has been added incorrectly in the past.

Without those identity numbers, brokers cannot get paid by insurers or follow up on behalf of clients if there are problems with insurance claims. Regulators cannot track down brokers if there are mistakes. As of Sunday, brokers had not been informed of any fix to this issue.

Repairing those problems is critical because “we could get a lot of people enrolled very quickly,” said Janet Trautwein, chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters, which represents about 200,000 agents and brokers who together serve about 2 million to 3 million clients.

In addition, when consumers turn for help to a broker, an insurer or a call center, the online system still is balking at the critical step of calculating how much each person can qualify for in federal subsidies. Without that information, these assisters cannot complete the process of enrolling most consumers for health plans.

WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - American consumers' initial experience on the Obamacare website Healthcare.gov has been inadequate and unacceptable, a key administration official overseeing the troubled launch told a congressional panel on Tuesday.

Marilyn Tavenner, director of the agency in charge of setting up the online insurance exchanges, said the administration was determined to repair the glitches, but experts were still diagnosing the problems and have much work ahead.

""The initial consumer experience of Healthcare.gov has not lived up to the expectations of the American people and is not acceptable,"" Tavenner, a former nurse who heads the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in prepared testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee.

""We are committed to fixing these problems as soon as possible,"" she said.

It has been four weeks since the website at the center of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law was switched on, but it has been plagued by error messages, delays and bugs, which information technology experts from both the government and private contractors have been scrambling to fix.

On Sunday, a data center outage prevented Americans from enrolling in the subsidized health insurance provided for under Obama's Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. The site was back up on Monday.

Republicans have seized on the troubled website to further attack Obamacare and question whether administration officials hid problems before the launch. They are expected to press Tavenner on testimony she gave in August, when she said work was on track to roll out a tested website that would make it easy for Americans to enroll for insurance.

Tavenner said in her testimony for Tuesday that an ""initial wave of interest stressed the account service, resulting in many consumers experiencing difficulty signing up, while those who were able to sign up sometimes had problems logging in.""

She also placed some blame on the contractors helping to build and maintain the website, saying a subset of them ""have not met expectations."" She did not name the contractors.

A ""new infusion of talent"" has been brought in and experts are working aggressively to diagnose the parts that are still experiencing problems, Tavenner said. They are continuing to add capacity, and more people are creating accounts, she said.

""We are pleased with these quick improvements, but we know there is still significant, additional work to be done,"" she said.

Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee marks the second congressional hearing to examine the problems with the program's rollout. Last week, contractors who worked on the site told a different panel that the administration launched it after only a minimum of system-wide testing.

Tavenner, 62, was confirmed for her job by the Senate in May. She had been optimistic about the rollout when questioned by lawmakers about it in April and again in August.

She is appearing before Congress one day before her boss, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, testifies to Congress on the same subject.

With Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients saying Healthcare.gov should be fixed by the end of November, experts say the administration could lose the interest of healthy younger adults aged 18-35 for whom the website was seen as a major avenue for enrollment.

On Monday, the White House issued a report promoting the program for young people. Based partly on Census data, it said 46 percent of young adults who live alone in 34 states could get health coverage for $50 a month or less under Obamacare.

Republicans in Congress have introduced a flurry of legislation they say is aimed at protecting the public from the problem-plagued rollout.

Senators Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran have a bill to delay - until six months after the troubled Healthcare.gov is fully functioning - the mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.

Fred Upton, the Republican chair of the House, Energy and Commerce Committee, has also produced a bill allowing insurers to maintain existing health plans in 2014 outside the new online health insurance exchanges - even if they do not meet the benefit standards of Obamacare."

USA TODAY

New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner says he coined the term ""Obamacare.""

When he was in Congress, the Democrat was a frequent guest on cable-TV shows during the height of the 2009 debate over health care. Near the bottom of a New York Timesarticle about Weiner's legislative record, the story of how he went from being a supporter of a single-payer system to a backer of the law advocated by President Obama is told.

Obamacare is ""a term, by the way, that I coined,"" Weiner told The New York Times.

Here's what we know:

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law's formal name, and Obama signed it into law in 2010. It is now widely known as Obamacare, a word that has been used pejoratively by Republicans — but one that Obama himself started embracing during last year's presidential campaign.

Stories by The Washington Post and other media outlets often note Republicans began wide usage of Obamacare during the 2009-10 debate in Congress over the national health care law. The term would often be used in the same breath as ""Hillarycare,"" a reference to the proposals advanced in the 1990s by then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney used the same juxtaposition as early as May 2007 during a campaign speech in Iowa. ""Socialized medicine, Hillary-care, Obama-care, they don't get it,"" Romney said at the time, according to NBC News.

The first known use of Obamacare in print came three years before the legislation passed Congress. A 2011 story in The Atlantic says Jeanne Schulte Scott used the term in March 2007 in an article for the trade journal, Healthcare Financial Management, noting how health care was becoming a key issue in the 2008 presidential campaign.

""We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care,' 'Edwards-care' and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s,"" Scott wrote."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/30/appeals-court-rules-against-nyc-soda-ban/,2013-07-30 00:00:00,[],Appeals court rules against NYC soda ban,"Another court ruling has taken the fizz out of New York City's ban on big, sugary sodas.

A New York appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the city Board of Health exceeded its legal authority and acted unconstitutionally when it tried to put a size limit on soft drinks served in city restaurants.

""The Board of Health overstepped the boundaries of its lawfully delegated authority,"" the court said in its decision.

The state Supreme Court Appellate Division, with its opinion, upheld an earlier ruling that stopped the ban from taking effect in March. The rule would stop many eateries from selling non-diet soda and other sugar-laden beverages in containers bigger than 16 ounces.

The beverage industry and other opponents say the measure is riddled with exceptions, unfair and ineffective.

The city's law department has promised an appeal. ""Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.

In its unanimous opinion, the four-judge panel said Tuesday that the health board was acting too much like a legislature when it created the limit. The judges wrote that while the board had the power to ban ""inherently harmful"" foodstuffs from being served to the public, sweetened beverages didn't fall into that category. They also said the board appeared to have crafted much of the new rules based on political or economic considerations, rather than health concerns.

New York's effort to cap soda portions has drawn national attention, whether from diet companies lauding it as a groundbreaking step in America's war on extra weight or from late-night TV hosts ribbing Bloomberg as a nutrition nanny.

The drinks limit follows other Bloomberg efforts to nudge New Yorkers into better diets. His administration has forced chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus, barred artificial trans fats from restaurant fare and challenged food manufacturers to use less salt.

Koop%2C a pediatric surgeon%2C had a conservative reputation

He is remembered for his 1986 report on AIDS

He also made his mark in the fight against smoking

C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general who brought frank talk about AIDS into U.S. homes, has died at his home in Hanover, N.H., officials at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth said Monday. He was 96.

Koop, a pediatric surgeon with a conservative reputation and a distinctive beard, served from 1982 to 1989 during the Reagan administration and the early months of the administration of George H.W. Bush.

""He was a historic figure,"" who became surgeon general the year the AIDS pandemic began and played a pivotal role in educating Americans about it, says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

""Dr. Koop will be remembered for his colossal contributions to the health and well-being of patients and communities in the U.S. and around the world,"" said a statement released by Chip Souba, dean of the Geisel School of Medicine and Joseph O'Donnell, senior scholar at the C. Everett Koop Institute. ""As one of our country's greatest surgeons general, he effectively promoted health and the prevention of disease, thereby improving millions of lives in our nation and across the globe.""

Koop may best remembered for his official 1986 report on AIDS – a plain-spoken 36-page document that talked about the way AIDS spread (through sex, needles and blood), the ways it did not spread (through casual contact in homes, schools and workplaces) and how people could protect themselves.

The report advocated condom use for the sexually active and sex education for schoolchildren, pleasantly surprising liberals and upsetting many of Koop's former supporters. An eight-page version was mailed to every American household in 1988.

The brochure came in a sealed packet with the warning that ""some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things you are used to discussing openly.""

In interviews and speeches, Koop always stressed that sexual abstinence and monogamy were the best protection against AIDS, but that medical experts had a duty to tell people who did not choose those paths how they could stay healthy.

""My position on AIDS was dictated by scientific integrity and Christian compassion,"" Koop wrote in his 1991 biography, Koop: The Memoirs of America's Family Doctor.

Koop also made his mark in the fight against smoking, with another 1986 report that alerted the public to the dangers of second-hand smoke – setting the stage for today's widespread prohibitions against smoking in public places.

At one point, Koop was the second-most recognized public official in the United States, after President Reagan, says Alexandra Lord, a former Public Health Service historian and author of Condom Nation: The US Government's Sex Education Campaign from World War I to the Internet. He was one of the most high-profile surgeons general, before or since, she says -- though she says people under age 35 or so may not know his name today.

In his time, ""Koop was very effective,"" so much so that he made some subsequent administrations ""very nervous"" about the potential power of the men and women occupying the office, Lord says.

Charles Everett Koop was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 14, 1916. He briefly played football at Dartmouth College, where he acquired his lifelong nickname ""Chick,"" according to a biography posted online by the National Library of Medicine. An early fascination with medicine eventually led him to Cornell University Medical College. In 1945, he became first surgeon in chief at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a position he held until his appointment as surgeon general.

His nomination for that position was opposed by groups who feared he would use the office to promote his anti-abortion views – which he said were developed during a career saving newborns with life-threatening birth defects. But Koop avoided pronouncements on abortion during his tenure.

After he left office, he became one of the first high-profile doctors to establish a presence online. His website, DrKoop.com, was launched in 1997 and was intended to provide reliable health information to the public, he said. But Koop and his backers faced criticism over ties with companies advertising on the site. Like many Internet efforts of the era, it failed, going bankrupt in 2001.

Koop remained active, though, heading his C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. At a news conference in Washington, D.C., in 2010, when he was 94, he spoke from a wheelchair and told reporters that he was ""very, very deaf"" and legally blind, the Washington Post reported.

But he still had the strength to warn that AIDS was becoming a ""forgotten epidemic."" Although 56,000 Americans were still getting infected each year, ""simply put, HIV is no longer on the public's radar screen,"" he said.

At a time when AIDS was new, though, and the nation needed someone to give it the facts straight up, Koop filled the bill, says Woodie Kessel, a former assistant surgeon general who was a longtime friend and a Koop Institute fellow. ""Every time there's a new threat to our well-being, it takes somebody to calm our fears... He worked to address those fears with facts, with science and with great compassion.""

Fauci, who also became friends with Koop and worked with him on his AIDS report, says: ""He was an amazing champion of treating it as a disease, not as a stigma. He understood it was a public health disaster in the making. ... I remember he would say, 'Tony, you do the science, I'll do the education for the public.'""

Surgeon General Regina Benjamin said in a statement that when she took office, in 2010, ""Dr. Koop sat down with me on what would become the first of numerous occasions to offer guidance and support. We often prayed together.""

Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called Koop ""a fearless public servant.""

First, the good news for Mitt Romney Ouch—but not exactly surprising, given that even President Obama admits that the Obamacare rollout hasn't gone smoothly. I'm sure he'd love for those numbers to be higher, but the reality is that until things are turned around, these sorts of approval numbers aren't going to look good—nor should they. That's why the most important thing the administration can do is to make the policy work.

And that brings me to the second key finding in the poll, which has some bad news for Ted Cruz:



Just seven percent of Americans think the Affordable Care Act is working well and should be kept in place as it is. Far more, 48 percent, think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed to make it work better, and another 43 percent think the law needs to be repealed entirely.

So even though Obamacare now is pretty much at its lowest point ever, a clear majority opposes the Ted Cruz position, which is repealing it altogether. Moreover, support for repeal isn't exactly skyrocketing, despite all the problems of the past six weeks: that 43 percent figure is just 4 points higher than the 39 percent who supported repeal in CBS's July survey

It's tempting to look at that 7 percent number as a very bad sign, but even the president doesn't take the position that the law is working perfectly and doesn't need changes. Like most Americans, Obama and the Democratic Party want Obamacare to work. On the other hand, Cruz—and pretty much the entire GOP—want it to fail. For them, it's repeal or bust. Changes to make it work better are off the table. If things get worse between now and November 2014, that position might work out for them, but if the program continues to improve, so will attitudes towards it, and Republicans will find themselves even more out of step with the public."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/12/14/new-yorks-culural-elite-blindisded-by-obamacare,2013-12-14 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],New York's Cultural Elite Blindsided By ObamaCare,"If there is at least one benefit of ObamaCare it is watching those who supported nationalizing the purchase of mandated health insurance get their comeuppance. The New York Times reports that “many in New York’s professional and cultural elite” who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool “to avoid the sky-high rates in New York’s individual insurance market,” are now out in the cold with the rest of us:

[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage.

The anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. “We are Obama’s people,” said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. “I couldn’t sleep because of it,” she said.

Ms. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.

Ms. Meinwald also looked on the state’s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. “It’s like you’re blindfolded and you’re told that you have to buy something,” she said. …

Meinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney.

[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.

According to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way “to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.”

If only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.

Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever, and by Friday, CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.

Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show, and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer, Costello dug in:

Well, I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?

Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer, I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off, even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question, it is still a health-related question, and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly, my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information, but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process, I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.”

Regardless, why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether, not just what qualifies under HIPAA.

But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal.

Well, watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number, your mental and physical condition, and whether or not you are pregnant.

And what is Costello’s response? Does she say, “Oh, I didn’t know that. If you are correct, that is a problem.”

Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:

Basically, Obamacare isn’t complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated: neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure. It’s complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable.

It’s been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device, a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer, but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing. This doesn’t make it unworkable: state exchanges are working, and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in. But it did make a botched rollout much more likely.

So Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems aren’t revealing problems with the idea of social insurance; they’re revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix, when they serve little useful purpose.

So does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing? No. Single-payer wasn’t going to happen — partly because of the insurance lobby’s power, partly because voters wouldn’t have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown. Yes, Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge, but if that’s what it took to cover the uninsured, so be it.

And although the botched rollout is infuriating — count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that, not trying to cover for the botch — the odds remain high that this will work, and make America a much better place."

It coerces some people to do something they might not want to do, and which, in fact, may not be in their short-term interest to do.

Already, it’s very clear that millions of Americans — and not just Tea Party types — do not accept the legitimacy of the government to overrule individual decisions, even on something like health insurance. This is not the America of 1932 or of 1964. This is an America steeped in distrust of government. It’s an America that is, on both left and right, steeped in the ethos of individual choice. It’s an America steeped in a morality of authenticity, which says that it is right to listen to the individual voice within and immoral to be forced to conform to the external commands from without.

From the very first moment, people have had problems with the idea of mandates. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton among a Democratic primary electorate in 2008 in part because he opposed mandates. When Obamacare was still a bill, members of Congress succumbed to political pressure and lowered the penalties that would be imposed on those who violated the mandates. Then the Supreme Court majority decided the penalties weren’t even penalties; they were just an optional tax.

When disgruntled groups have objected to the employer and other mandates during implementation, the administration has generally loosened, delayed or suspended them. Late last week, the administration granted a “hardship exemption” to people who had their prior coverage canceled and who believe that the mandated Obamacare offerings are unaffordable.

Most telling, the administration hasn’t even made a moral argument for the mandates. It hasn’t even tried to make the case that coercing some people to participate in collective action is necessary for the common good."

Shear']","Inside the Race to Rescue a Health Care Site, and Obama","When the problems occur — and they still do — the command center sees them first, in charts that suddenly spike on the television monitors. The data also serves as a reality check in a hypersensitive media environment. Last month, CNN reported that HealthCare.gov had gone down again. A quick look at the screens made it clear that whatever the problem had been, it was fleeting.

Mr. Zients’s metrics, meanwhile, are improving. When the repair effort began, response time — how long it takes a page to load — averaged eight seconds; now it is less than one. The error rate — how often users are unable to click through to the next page — was 6 percent; now it is 0.75 percent. When Mr. Dickerson announced that the day had ended with no major crashes and no one who could not log in, the engineers erupted in applause.

“That’s the job,” he said. “When things break, you have to fix them.”

But even as the White House points to its progress, the administration on Wednesday said troubles with HealthCare.gov had forced it to delay, by one year, an online exchange for small business.

Other people working on the project, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to talk to reporters, say significant challenges remain.

Some of the companies building the system opposed an early decision by the Medicare agency to use database software from a company called MarkLogic, which handles data differently from systems by companies like IBM and Oracle. Some suggest that its unfamiliar nature slowed their work. By mid-November, more than six weeks after the rollout, the MarkLogic database — essentially the website’s virtual filing cabinet and index — continued to perform below expectations, according to one person who works in the command center.

In interviews, MarkLogic’s executives faulted inadequate computing power and instability at the site’s data center, as well as the failure to properly integrate their product, problems repeatedly cited by other website vendors.

But perhaps most important, it remains unclear whether the enrollment data being transmitted to insurers is completely accurate. In a worst-case scenario, insurance executives fear that some people may not actually get enrolled in the plans they think they have chosen, or that some people may receive wrong information about the subsidies for which they are eligible."

Malloy', 'November']",How we got Obamacare to work,"Jay Inslee, a Democrat, is governor of Washington. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, is governor of Kentucky. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, is governor of Connecticut.

In our states — Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut — the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” is working. Tens of thousands of our residents have enrolled in affordable health-care coverage. Many of them could not get insurance before the law was enacted.

People keep asking us why our states have been successful. Here’s a hint: It’s not about our Web sites.

Sure, having functioning Web sites for our health-care exchanges makes the job of meeting the enormous demand for affordable coverage much easier, but each of our state Web sites has had its share of technical glitches. As we have demonstrated on a near-daily basis, Web sites can continually be improved to meet consumers’ needs.

The Affordable Care Act has been successful in our states because our political and community leaders grasped the importance of expanding health-care coverage and have avoided the temptation to use health-care reform as a political football.

In Washington, the legislature authorized Medicaid expansion with overwhelmingly bipartisan votes in the House and Senate this summer because legislators understood that it could help create more than 10,000 jobs, save more than $300 million for the state in the first 18 months, and, most important, provide several hundred thousand uninsured Washingtonians with health coverage.

In Kentucky, two independent studies showed that the Bluegrass State couldn’t afford not to expand Medicaid. Expansion offered huge savings in the state budget and is expected to create 17,000 jobs.

In Connecticut, more than 50 percent of enrollment in the state exchange, Access Health CT, is for private health insurance. The Connecticut exchange has a customer satisfaction level of 96.5 percent, according to a survey of users in October, with more than 82 percent of enrollees either “extremely likely” or “very likely” to recommend the exchange to a colleague or friend.

In our states, elected leaders have decided to put people, not politics, first.

President Obama announced an administrative change last week that would allow insurance companies to continue offering existing plans to those who want to keep them. It is up to state insurance commissioners to determine how and whether this option works for their states, and individual states will come to different conclusions.

What we all agree with completely, though, is the president’s insistence that our country cannot go back to the dark days before health-care reform, when people were regularly dropped from coverage, and those with “bare bones” plans ended up in medical bankruptcy when serious illness struck, many times because their insurance didn’t cover much of anything.

Thanks to health-care reform and the robust exchanges in our states, people are getting better coverage at a better price.

One such person is Brad Camp, a small-business owner in Kingston, Wash., who received a cancellation notice in September from his insurance carrier. He went to the state exchange, the Washington Healthplanfinder, and for close to the same premium his family was paying before got upfront coverage for doctor’s office visits and prescription drug , vision and dental coverage. His family was able to keep the same insurance carrier and doctors and qualified for tax credits to help cover the cost.

Since Howard Stovall opened his sign and graphics business in Lexington, Ky., in 1998, he has paid half the cost of health insurance for his eight employees. With the help of Stovall’s longtime insurance agent and Kentucky’s health exchange, Kynect, Stovall’s employees are saving 5 percent to 40 percent each on new health insurance plans with better benefits. Stovall can afford to provide additional employee benefits, including full disability coverage and part of the cost of vision and dental plans, while still saving the business 50 percent compared with the old plans.

In Connecticut, Anne Masterson was able to reduce her monthly premiums from $965 to $313 for similar coverage, including a $145 tax credit. Masterson is able to use her annual premium savings of $8,000 to pay bills or save for retirement.

These sorts of stories could be happening in every state if politicians would quit rooting for failure and directly undermining implementation of the Affordable Care Act — and, instead, put their constituents first. Health reform is working for the people of Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut because elected leaders on both sides of the aisle came together to do what is right for their residents.

We urge Congress to get out of the way and to support efforts to make health-care reform work for everyone. We urge our fellow governors, most especially those in states that refused to expand Medicaid, to make health-care reform work for their people too."

Boehner on Thursday promised a “big victory” when the chamber votes to defund President Obama’s healthcare law as part of a must-pass bill to keep the government running. But it may be short-lived: The White House has promised a veto.

Republicans in Congress believe the American people are on their side as they head toward Friday’s vote, using the threat of a government shutdown on Oct. 1 to force the president to undo his signature healthcare law. They insist opposition to the Affordable Care Act will force Obama to change course.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a potential presidential candidate, vowed Thursday to use “any procedural means necessary,” including a filibuster, to stop the healthcare law in the Senate.

But the White House made it clear Thursday that the president would veto such a bill, and Senate Democrats appear to have the votes to strip the provision to defund the healthcare law, often called Obamacare, and send the funding bill back to the House for another vote.

“I want to be absolutely crystal clear: Any bill that defunds Obamacare is dead, dead,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday. “It’s a waste of time.”

Even though Boehner joined with his right flank to pursue the strategy, many top Republicans are wary the party will be blamed if the government shuts down once the money runs out Sept. 30.

The last time the government shut down, during the Clinton administration, it was Republicans led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia who suffered much of the blame.

Boehner’s conservative majority insist they will not back down. They see the launch of the new health insurance online marketplaces, which begin Oct. 1, as one of their best chances to stop the law.

“This is the reason I came to Congress,” said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.).

If the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House late next week, as is expected, Boehner may be forced to rely on Democrats to pass it, as many Republicans promise their opposition.

The speaker declined Thursday to say whether he would violate the so-called Hastert Rule, which requires “a majority of the majority” to be on board before a bill is brought up for a vote.

“We’ll have plenty of time next weekend to discuss that,” Boehner said, implying that Congress may need to hold a weekend session to avert the shutdown.

The shutdown fight is the first in a series of budget battles House Republicans are promising this fall, with another one coming in a matter of weeks: If Republicans fail to stop the Affordable Care Act now, Boehner will seek a one-year delay of the health law in exchange for the White House’s request to raise the debt limit to continue paying the nation’s bills. That vote is expected in mid-October.

Using the debt limit as leverage is a risky endeavor for the fragile U.S. economy, and the last time congressional Republicans and the White House fought over the debt limit, in 2011, it led to a rare lowering of the U.S. credit rating.

In the days ahead, the options for Cruz and his conservative Senate allies to push the defunding of the healthcare law may be limited.

Cruz came under fire from House Republicans for not vowing a sufficient fight in the upper chamber – one that would require the senators to seize the floor in a round-the-clock filibuster.

“I expect my Senate colleagues to be up for the battle,” Boehner said Thursday.

But under Senate procedures, the GOP may not be able to prevent Democrats from stripping out the healthcare provision unless Republicans tank the entire bill, which they do not appear ready to do.

The Texas senator said the administration should give ordinary Americans the same one-year delay of the mandate to carry health insurance, which begins Jan. 1, 2014, as it has given to businesses.

“This is about the American people,” Cruz said. “Why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government to deny those same waivers to hard-working Americans?”

Democrats, though, argued that they will not undo the healthcare law, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court, and the Republican strategy risks shuttering the government.

“Republican leadership has been dragged kicking and screaming into a fight that they know is bad for their party and bad for their country, and they should know it’s a fight they will not win,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “And the whole country has been dragged closer to a government shutdown.”

The funding bill, if approved, would keep the government running until Dec. 15.

In fact, Michael Lee, attorney for the Pontiac Education Association, alleged in an Oakland County Circuit lawsuit filed this week that the reason school officials were putting the money into the general fund was to try and deceive Michigan officials as to the status of the state-approved plan to reduce the district’s deficit of $37.7 million. “They have been taking money out of our checks and they haven’t been paying MESSA (Michigan Education Special Services Association),” said Aimee McKeever, president of the PEA. As a result, the insurance carrier canceled coverage effective July 31. [...] The lawsuit names each trustee individually, including Board President Carrol Turpin, Vice President Karen Cain, Secretary Brenda Carter, Treasurer Sherman Williams II and trustees Susan Loveland, Mattie McKinney-Hatchett and S. Barbara Raby. Also named are Paul Bryant, business manager, who, according to the lawsuit, has sole authority to make payments to vendors; and former Superintendent Brian Dougherty, who was charged with running daily operations from Aug. 27, 2012 until May 17, 2013.

The district actually owes MESSA $11 million going back as far as the 2011-2012 school year.

This case will likely be used to defend taking over the Pontiac school system under the control of an emergency manager. It is currently ""under review"" by the state of Michigan. The first thing that should happen is that these corrupt school officials should be sent to jail for their crimes if the allegations are found to be true. What happens all too often is that corruption at the top is then projected on to the teachers who are the innocent victims of poor management, corruption, and malfeasance. They are then victimized again by being portrayed as greedy for wanting health insurance in the first place.

Rather than using this as an excuse to screw teachers over more, we should be using it as a motivation to (a) better fund our schools, (b) start treating teachers with the dignity and respect that they deserve, and (c) pass a single-payer, universal health care law that would solve this issue once and for all.

If one single teacher or one of their family members is harmed or, Goddess forbid, dies because they lack health insurance from this, the people responsible for this heinous act will bear the full responsibility.

It's important to note that this isn't just moving around piles of money that are in the school district's budget. They literally took money the teachers paid out of pocket and applied it to their bottom line. The outcome is that these teachers effectively had their benefits stripped and their pay cut at the same time and they never even knew it was happening. It is theft, pure and simple.

These teachers deserve better. So, so much better."

Companies can avoid many standards in the new law by insuring their own employees, rather than signing up with commercial insurers, because Congress did not want to disrupt self-insurance arrangements that were seen as working well for many large employers.

“The new health care law created powerful incentives for smaller employers to self-insure,” said Deborah J. Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research who has been studying the insurance industry for more than 25 years. “This trend could destabilize small-group insurance markets and erode protections provided by the Affordable Care Act.”

It is not clear how many companies have already self-insured in response to the law or are planning to do so. Federal and state officials do not keep comprehensive statistics on the practice."

Sebelius tried to squirm away–as she had done with many other questioners, but Ellmers was on her “A” game.

Ellmers’s performance was particularly commendable because she is lower in the congressional pecking order and therefore had to wait until the end, with less time to spare. She even found time, using a pointed yes-or-no question, to puncture Democrats’ favorite dodge–namely, that helped Republicans improve Medicare Part D, even though they had opposed it. (Unlike Obamacare, Medicare Part D is voluntary, as Sebelius had to admit.)

Next, Ellmers turned to the fact that Obamacare makes consumers pay more for insurance they do not need (much like being forced to buy a fancy car with all of the options, when a basic new car or used car would have been fine).

The ensuing exchange should be studied by Republicans for future reference. This is how it’s done:"

But, ACA had this sweet little provision that allowed states to set up a single-payer system and now people will see it in action. You know what that means.

As Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) opines, ""The quickest route toward a national health care program will be when individual states go forward and demonstrate that universal and non-profit health care works, and that it is the cost-effective and moral thing to do.”

Obama made that pledge again and again, both in the run-up to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and in the 2012 campaign — but it was false. Republicans determined to roll back Obamacare have pounded away at this broken promise, even as thousands of Americans have been receiving word that insurers are scrapping their current policies.

“I personally believe — even if it takes a change in the law — the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,” Clinton told the online magazine OZY.

The former president — who riled Obama’s re-election team in June 2012 by praising Mitt Romney’s “sterling business record” — came out on balance as strongly in favor of the health care overhaul.

“The big lesson is that we’re better off with this law than without it,” Clinton said.

The botched rollout of insurance marketplaces known as exchanges, exemplified by the failure of the national website HealthCare.gov, resembles the glitches that hurt Medicare Part D when it came off the line under then-President George W. Bush.

“This happened once before: It happened when President Bush put in the Medicare drug program for seniors, which was not as complicated but had exactly the same problem with the rollout,” Clinton said. “It was a disaster.”

“And they fixed it,” he added.



Asked about his comments, the White House said Clinton was still “explainer in chief” and underlined that Obama was looking at ways to help Americans whose health coverage is being canceled.



“We haven't announced any potential fixes or moves that we might be able to make to address this problem,” press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. But Obama is “very interested in trying to address this problem and looks forward to being presented the options that he might be able to pursue.”



Carney did not rule out a legislative fix — but dismissed a proposal from Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow insurers to keep selling plans that don’t meet Obamacare’s standards.



“We see that as throwing the baby out with the bath water,” the spokesman said.



Currently, the law allows people to stay on those plans as long as they have not changed or been issued since the president signed the measure into law. Obama aides say that allowing insurers to enroll new customers into older, substandard plans would amount to rolling back the Affordable Care Act’s new standards for coverage."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) speaks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference in Washington on Thursday. (Charles Dharapak/AP)

After spending years unsuccessfully trying to overturn “Obamacare,” Republicans are now attempting to use President Obama’s landmark health-care law to derail his top second-term initiative — a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

Conservatives in both chambers of Congress are insisting on measures that would expand the denial of public health benefits to the nation’s 11 million illegal immigrants beyond limits set in a comprehensive bill pending in the Senate.

In the House, Republicans are considering proposals that would deny publicly subsidized emergency care to illegal immigrants and force them to purchase private health insurance plans, without access to federal subsidies, as a requirement for earning permanent legal residency.

In the Senate, Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has endorsed an amendment to a comprehensive immigration bill he helped negotiate that would deny health benefits to immigrants for five years after they become legal residents — two years after they would be eligible to become citizens under the legislation.

Some Republicans, eager to capi­tal­ize on public uncertainty about the complexities of the Affordable Care Act, are casting the immigration legislation as a similarly unwieldy law.

The immigration bill “reminds me of a more recent piece of legislation: Obamacare,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said on the Senate floor last week. “It grants broad new powers to the same executive branch that today is mired in scandal for incompetence and abuse of power. Total cost estimates are in the trillions. And rather than fix our current immigration problems, the bill makes many of them worse.”

The insertion of the politics of health-care reform — one of the most polarizing issues in Washington — into the immigration debate threatens to split open the emerging bipartisan coalitions that are crucial to passing a bill.

This month, Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho) blamed a standoff over health-care benefits for his decision to drop out of bipartisan talks with seven colleagues who were negotiating a House alternative to the Senate immigration proposal. That has forced House leaders to proceed with a series of smaller-scale proposals next week in lieu of a sweeping agreement.

“When I joined the group, I was told that the aliens would have to pay for their own health care,” Labrador told Fox News. “Now that has changed. And I can’t agree to all of the exceptions.”

Frustrated Democrats argue that Republicans are picking a fight where one does not exist. In both chambers, Democrats say, they have agreed that illegal immigrants would not be eligible for public benefits — including health-care subsidies and Medicaid — as they embark on a path to permanent legal status, which would take at least 10 years under the Senate plan.

“We have said since Day One . . . that undocumented people will not have access to subsidies in the Affordable Care Act,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last month. “Any thought that we want to do something different than that is simply not true. It is a bottom line. No need to even discuss it.”

Under current law, illegal immigrants and legal residents of fewer than five years are mostly barred from receiving benefits under Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the poor. That restriction does not apply to poor immigrants who show up at hospital emergency rooms, however.

While writing the Affordable Care Act, Congress sidestepped the dicey issue of illegal immigration by excluding immigrants who are in the country illegally from its provisions. That means that those immigrants will not get government subsidies to help them buy private insurance plans, nor can they benefit from the law’s expansion of Medicaid.

At the same time, however, they are exempted from the mandate, taking effect next year, that every person must carry health insurance or face a tax penalty.

Some Republicans think it would be unfair to exclude such immigrants from the insurance mandate. One proposal championed by Labrador, according to people familiar with the private House negotiations, would require illegal immigrants to purchase their own insurance, without access to federal health exchanges, as a prerequisite for citizenship.

Democrats argue that making the immigrants subject to the mandate could impose an insurmountable burden on them because of potentially hefty premiums that would not be offset by federal subsidies available to others. That burden could also discourage people from coming out of the shadows to apply for legal status, said Priscilla Huang, policy director for the nonpartisan Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum.

“If we want them to become citizens and fully integrated into their communities and our country, we should really treat them as such,” Huang said.

Aides said Labrador simply wanted to include language in the House bill that would ensure that illegal immigrants were responsible for paying for their own care.

Other members of the immigration working group resisted out of fear that the language Labrador proposed would have meant that illegal immigrants with unpaid medical bills would not be eligible for permanent legal residency and could be deported, according to Democratic aides.

Jennifer Ng’andu, the director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, said the true motive for some Republicans is unrelated to immigration reform. Rather, she said, it is to perpetuate “ideological warfare” against the Obama health-care law.

In 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) shouted “You lie!” after Obama said, during his State of the Union address, that immigrants in the country illegally would not be eligible for federal health-care subsidies. Since the Affordable Care Act was narrowly approved a year later, the House GOP has voted to repeal it more than 30 times, symbolic gestures that had no chance of consideration in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

As the Obama administration has moved to sign up uninsured Americans by the October deadline, Republicans have sought to paint a picture of widespread confusion and chaos.

In a video message to constituents Friday, Rubio said that “Obamacare is bad for America” and that the health-care program “can never and will never work and may even contribute to bankrupting our country.”

Last week, Rubio announced he would co-sponsor an amendment with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to mandate that illegal immigrants cannot get access to public benefits until five years after they earn green cards signifying permanent legal status.

That would mean that, although such immigrants could be eligible for citizenship after 13 years, they would not be allowed to access the health subsidies for at least 15 years.

“The 13-year-long pathway to citizenship will be hard enough,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). “The restrictions on federal safety-net programs make the pathway even more treacherous.”"

But with the troubled rollout of the health care law, the administration has offered Mr. Issa his richest target yet. And he is running with it.

“This was President Obama’s signature legislative achievement,” Mr. Issa, Republican of California, said in a statement announcing his latest hearing on the topic, scheduled for Wednesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which will feature four administration officials. “His administration had hundreds of millions of dollars and total control to complete the project.”

But the investigation, even at this early stage, has turned into a nasty public relations war that will be on full display at Wednesday’s hearing, where Todd Park, the administration’s chief technology officer, will testify under subpoena. The subpoena demand by Mr. Issa has evoked protests from the White House — and many in the technology field — who argued that Mr. Park should be left to do his work fixing the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/06/NEW-REPORT-Youth-Healthcare-Premiums-to-Skyrocket-145-203,2013-03-06 00:00:00,['Celia Bigelow'],REPORT: Youth Healthcare Premiums to Skyrocket 145%-203%,"If health insurance prices triple, do we still have to call Obamacare the “Affordable Care Act”?

A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase, no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.

Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent, but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.

“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent,” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase, let alone tripling current costs, could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”

The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648, but will increase to $1,872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:

According to the report, young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:

Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating: In other words, price controls. Obamacare mandates that all Americans pay healthcare premiums regardless of anticipated medical expenses. Young Americans must subsidize retirees who use healthcare far more often to level the insurance price disparity between younger and older Americans. Essential Health Benefits: Obamacare mandates certain health servives be covered by health insurance. These include coverage for preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and many more. In short, the more categories you are forced to cover, the more expensive your premium will be. No more affordable catastrophic plans. Taxes and Fees on Plans, Drugs, and Medical Devices: The total cost of new taxes and fees on drug manufacturers, device manufacturers, and health care plans is $165 billion. This will ultimately be passed on to the consumer in higher premiums.

Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7,186 in the next decade.

With a stagnant economy, unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent), and average household expenses on the rise (gas, food, energy, etc), there are very few people that can afford $800-$4,000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums.

Remember when President Obama said, “if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Me too."

You Can Follow Him At', 'Dangainor On Twitter', 'Submit Suggestions There.']",The monstrous abortion trial the media don’t want you to know about,"When the Newtown shooting took the lives of 20 children, the nation was justifiably horrified. Journalists reported round the clock on ways to change public policy to prevent another shooting. But when seven children and a mother died in a Philadelphia abortion clinic dubbed a “house of horrors,” the major media couldn’t have cared less.

It’s a news story that reads more like a Hollywood torture plot – “Saw” or “Hostel” or some other movie so foul that it makes you want to take a shower just having viewed it.

Only this case is real and the media are keeping it real quiet because it betrays the barbarity of the abortion industry in open court, where they can’t hide. It’s all about abortion “doctor” Kermit Gosnell and the purportedly Medieval facility he ran to kill babies – both before they were born and after, claim prosecutors. Eight clinic employees have already pleaded guilty to “various charges.”

[pullquote]

“Gosnell is charged with killing seven babies born alive, along with Karnamaya Mongar a newly-arrived, 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan. Prosecutors say Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers during a 2009 abortion,” according to the Associated Press.

More On This...

ABC has never carried that story. Not once. Neither has NBC. CBS did … back in 2011 when Gosnell was first arrested. The rest of the media landscape is an equal travesty. CNN did one story on it in 2013, even though the trial has been going on for more than three weeks. Fox has covered it more than most of its TV kin, but it has surprisingly not done a lot.

It’s OK, they’ve been too busy with basketball. Yes, ABC, CBS and NBC have spent 41 minutes and 26 seconds telling viewers about the Rutgers basketball scandal. And not a second about baby murder in Philadelphia. Of course, Rutgers Coach Mike Rice did throw basketballs at grown men, deploy “abusive behavior” and, worst of all, use “homophobic slurs.”

Gosnell’s charges seem mild by comparison. He is charged with murdering seven viable, born-alive babies “by plunging scissors into their spinal cords.” Sherry West, who worked for Gosnell, recently testified she saw an 18- to 24-inch-long newborn. “It didn't have eyes or a mouth but it was like screeching, making this noise. It was weird. It sounded like a little alien,” she told the court.

“A former clinic worker who grew up in Mt. Lebanon testified on Thursday that he routinely saw babies born and then killed with scissors in an inner-city Philadelphia clinic that catered to minorities, the poor and women with late-term pregnancies,” reported AP. The worker estimated the number of babies he saw killed at about 100.

Despite all that, print publications haven’t covered the story much either. The local papers, such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, have done a fantastic job covering a story that is so ghastly that its reporters will probably never stop having nightmares. Lexis-Nexis credits the Inquirer with more than 140 stories about the topic, each more gruesome than the last.

But the national papers have largely ignored it. The New York Times, the land of “All the News That's Fit to Print” only found this mass murder story “fit” four times, just once in 2013. The Washington Post has mentioned it three times, but not since April 11 of 2012.

The liberal press has been almost as silent. Lefty Salon had a few AP stories, but only ones that undermined the charges against the doctor. Those include: “Doc disputes ‘killings’ at Philly abortion clinic” and “Med. examiner, lawyer clash at doc’s murder trial.”

The liberal Huffington Post, on which so many journalists rely for their news, was equally dismissive. It’s run a couple wire stories, but those conveniently left out the most heinous aspects of the trial.

Surprisingly, the whacko site Alternet included one condemnation of Gosnell, but it did to hold the line on unlimited abortion. The site ran the text of a speech by Dr. Jennefer Russo of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. While she admitted, “what happened in Philadelphia in the office of Kermit Gosnell is an atrocity,” she still defended abortion as a way to “protect women’s health.” Perhaps she hasn’t been following the trial.

Or maybe she has and the abortion industry doesn’t care what happens as long as it adds to the 50 million aborted babies since Roe v. Wade. That was certainly the impression given by Alisa LaPolt Snow, the lobbyist representing the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates. She testified that how to handle a child born from a botched abortion “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.” Someone needs to teach Planned Parenthood that abortions after a child is born are murder.

Sadly, that story also has received no attention. Journalists are quick to worry about “extreme” ways states are trying to curtail abortion. But clearly, murdering babies is not the news media’s definition of “extreme.”

Twenty conservative leaders including L. Brent Bozell, of the Media Research Center, Tony Perkins, of the Family Research Council, and Jeanne Monahan, of March for Life Education and Defense Fund, have all demanded the media stop censoring this ghoulish trial. In an open letter, they concluded: “This cover-up is a national disgrace.”

The oddest thing about the media blackout is how it defies everything news folks ordinarily do. Journalists aren’t just predictable, they are stunningly so. Give them a Casey Anthony, Amanda Knox, Scott Peterson and more, and they will be reporting it, desperate for the attention and ratings.

That is, unless it makes the Merchants of Death at Planned Parenthood look bad. Then that story will be ignored, no matter how many babies die in the process."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/01/ObamaCare-s-HHS-Contraception-Mandate-Struck-Down,2013-11-01 00:00:00,['Dr. Susan Berry'],ObamaCare's HHS Contraception Mandate Struck Down,"On Friday a federal appeals court struck down ObamaCare’s HHS contraception mandate, deciding that the requirement is an infringement upon religious liberty.

According to The Hill, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of two Catholic brothers, Francis and Philip Gilardi, who own a 400-person produce company based in Ohio. The Gilardis argued that they oppose contraception due to the tenets of their Catholic faith, and challenged ObamaCare’s provision that requires them to provide free contraception to their employees through a health insurance plan.

The brothers claimed that if they chose not to obey the law, they would incur a $14 million fine.

A requirement that companies cover their employees’ contraception, the court ruled, is unduly burdensome for business owners who oppose birth control on religious grounds, though they may not be purchasing contraception directly.

The Obama administration argued that the requirement is necessary to protect women’s right to decide whether and when to have children. It is expected the Supreme Court will ultimately pick up the administration’s appeal and make a final decision on its constitutionality.

“The burden on religious exercise does not occur at the point of contraceptive purchase; instead, it occurs when a company’s owners fill the basket of goods and services that constitute a healthcare plan,” wrote Judge Janice Rogers Brown on behalf of the court. “It is clear the government has failed to demonstrate how such a right – whether described as noninterference, privacy, or autonomy – can extend to the compelled subsidization of a woman’s procreative practices.”

Brown added that denying coverage of contraception would not undermine the Affordable Care Act’s requirements that health insurance provide preventative care. The Gilardis’ employees will still be covered for counseling, screenings, and tests, the judge observed.

“The provision of these services — even without the contraceptive mandate — by and large fulfills the statutory command for insurers to provide gender-specific preventive care,” Brown wrote. “At the very least, the statutory scheme will not go to pieces.”

The two judges on the panel who dissented said the rights of religious people do not extend to the companies they own."

Oregon is ahead of much of the country in implementing the Affordable Care Act. They've already got a preview of the exchange website up, where people can begin to research their options come October's enrollment period. Right now, it's largely limited to the proposed rates insurance companies are offering, but that's where the good news comes in.



""Posting rate comparisons company-by-company is a taste of what is to come,"" says Cheryl Martinis of the Oregon Insurance Division. Judging by the reaction, there's already an impact. Providence Health Plan on Wednesday asked to lower its requested rates by 15 percent. Gary Walker, a Providence spokesman, says the ""primary driver"" was a realization that the plan's cost projections were incorrect. But he conceded a desire to be competitive was part of it. A Family Care Health Plans official on Thursday said the insurer will ask the state for even greater decrease in requested rates. CEO Jeff Heatherington says the company realized its analysts were too pessimistic after seeing online that its proposed premiums were the highest. ""That was my question when I saw the rates was, 'Can we go in and refile these?'"" he said. ""We're going to try to get these to a competitive range.""

The state will be approving rate approvals from all companies in July, so the information available to prospective Oregon shoppers is just a rough preview at the moment. But it's important, because for the first time it's brought real transparency to this market—even between competing insurers."

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish']",Private consultants warned of risks before HealthCare.gov’s Oct. 1 launch,"The Obama administration brought in a private consulting team to independently assess how the federal online health insurance enrollment system was developing, according to a newly disclosed document, and in late March received a clear warning that its Oct. 1 launch was fraught with risks.

The analysis by McKinsey & Co. foreshadowed many of the problems that have dogged HealthCare.gov since its rollout, including the facts that the call-in centers would not work properly if the online system was malfunctioning and that insufficient testing would make it difficult to fix problems after the launch.

The report was provided to The Washington Post by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

This risk assessment, which was encapsulated in a 14-slide presentation, was delivered to senior White House and Department of Health and Human Services officials in four briefings between March 28 and April 8, the committee said.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius; Marilyn Tavenner, then acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); and White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park attended a session about the report on April 4 at HHS headquarters. Obama health policy adviser Jeanne Lambrew and then-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Mark Childress received a briefing April 8 at the White House.

Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), who chairs the panel’s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the presentation suggests that, in the run-up to its fall debut, the enrollment system was more troubled than administration officials have let on.

“Despite assurances from Secretary Sebelius, Marilyn Tavenner and [CMS official] Gary Cohen that all was well and on track with the launch of the Affordable Care Act, we now have documents dating back to April that call into question the assertions made to this committee,” Murphy said.

The CMS said in a statement that the McKinsey assessment was “part of a standard process to identify potential risks and develop mitigating strategies.” It added that “the review was completed six months before the beginning of open enrollment, was in line with industry best practices and was followed by concrete action to address potential risks — as was intended.”

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said “flags were definitely raised throughout the development of the Web site, as would be the case for any IT project this complex. . . . But nobody anticipated the size and scope of the problems we experienced once the site launched.”

Administration officials noted that the assessment was not a technical review of the Web site’s functionality. They said a number of the recommendations were acted upon, including stepping up communication with states and funneling more resources to in-person helpers and the call center.

The document did not predict whether the project’s problematic design stage would hamper its rollout but instead made it clear that programs of this scale are ideally pursued in a more orderly process, with “significant testing and revision” before they launch.

Some of the concerns raised did not come to pass. For example, the report cited the “data hub” — the massive network that connects federal, state and insurer databases — as a vulnerability. Officials say the data hub has been working well since the launch.

In addition, the report warned of long call-center wait times. Wait times were down to two minutes a few days after the launch, and they are now just seconds.

But with many of the project’s shortcomings now glaringly obvious, the report appears prescient in other respects.

One slide notes that the policy and requirements of a program are best defined at the outset, leaving sufficient time for testing and revision. By contrast, McKinsey noted, the federal marketplace’s design was marked by “evolving requirements” that shifted throughout the design phase, leaving scant time to test the system before its launch.

It also warned that the federal government largely depended on contractors to construct the marketplace, and that it lacked an overall “end-to-end operational view” of the system to ensure that its different parts worked well together.

Federal officials asked McKinsey to lay out how the consumer experience was likely to unfold over the first year based on the existing trajectory of the project and to identify things that might go wrong. The firm reviewed more than 200 documents and sources, and interviewed about 40 people across a variety of federal agencies, but did not talk to insurers or study computer code.

McKinsey — which declined to comment Monday, citing client confidentiality — did not assess whether the administration should have delayed the Oct. 1 launch.

Its presentation noted that federal officials were trying to fix the problems stemming from the botched design process. “CMS has been working to mitigate challenges resulting from program characteristics,” it says in bold.

The consulting firm suggested that some of the project’s troubles occurred because there was “no single empowered decision-making authority,” or person in charge, who could make changes or define what constituted success.

One industry source close to the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly, said this lack of an overarching project leader complicated the system’s development because contractors received “absolutely conflicting direction between the various entities within CMS.”

McKinsey suggested some ways to mitigate the risk, including creating a “version 1.0” that was fully tested before the project was finished and assigning a single leader to oversee its implementation. It urged federal officials to set “shared metrics for success” on April 12, more than five months before the rollout.

The administration did not develop metrics to evaluate the site’s performance until late October, The Post reported Sunday."

“Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn’t working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama told supporters in the Rose Garden. But he insisted: “The product, the health insurance, is good. The prices are good. It is a good deal. People don’t just want it; they’re showing up to buy it.”

With the shutdown and debt limit crisis past, Washington’s attention has turned to persistent problems with the website, which processes enrollments for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. But the site — healthcare.gov — has been plagued since it opened Oct. 1 by glitches that threaten to overshadow Obama’s signature domestic accomplishment.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

The president relaunched his campaign to sell the law as Republicans announced plans for hearings on the balky website. A Gallup poll last week found that 7 out of 10 uninsured Americans were “not too familiar” or “not familiar at all” with the online marketplaces.

Administration officials initially claimed the problems were caused by the unexpectedly high volume of visitors to the federal portal, which serves consumers in 36 states. Obama acknowledged that the website needed to work “better, faster, sooner,” but did not explain what went wrong or when it would work properly. He said “some of the best IT talent in the entire country” was part of a “tech surge” to fix it.

Residents in the other states, including California, Connecticut and Kentucky, shop on state-run marketplaces, which have fared better. But even the Covered California website has endured technical glitches. Many consumers in the state have expressed concern about signing up before the exchange fixes its online directory of doctors and hospitals for the health plans. The provider search tool has been offline since Oct. 9 while the state tries to resolve its problems.

Even as the president sought to reassure Americans, a consensus appears to be growing among tech experts that the online marketplace has fundamental flaws that could take months to repair. Their concerns have been heightened by the Obama administration’s refusal to explain the issues in detail.

Administration officials said Monday that they had upgraded the system for authenticating the identity of consumers who set up online accounts to better handle the high volume. They also identified bugs in the application process that caused timeouts, delays and other error messages.

The officials declined to provide additional information, but emphasized that some consumers had successfully enrolled. Nationwide, the administration reported that nearly half a million applications for coverage had been submitted through the state and federal insurance marketplaces.

The troubled rollout of the healthcare law’s website has armed Republican critics with new ammunition and made it difficult for Obama to dismiss their denunciations as politically motivated.

“They’re going to be looking to go after it even harder,” he acknowledged, but he also said, “It’s time for folks to stop rooting for its failure because hard-working, middle-class families are rooting for its success.”

On Capitol Hill, Republicans see a chance to rebound from their shutdown debacle by highlighting the botched rollout.

“Obamacare’s problem is larger than a website failure, and it will take more than a ‘tech surge’ to fix it,” Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the House majority leader, said in a statement. “The website does serve as stark evidence that the federal government is ill-equipped to centrally manage our nation’s healthcare.”

On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans a hearing on “implementation failures” with testimony from federal contractors engaged with the website.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “intended to testify,” but had a conflict, said spokeswoman Joanne Peters. She was scheduled to be in Phoenix, but officials declined to say why.

The committee’s chairman, Fred Upton (R-Mich.), called her decision “wholly unacceptable.” Sebelius is expected to testify at another hearing before the committee next week. “We were told repeatedly that implementation was ‘on track,’ and it is now time for all those responsible to explain what happened,” Upton said in a statement. “As the administration continues to withhold important details and enrollment figures, I hope Secretary Sebelius is ready to give answers and finally live up to the president’s celebrated claims of transparency.”

Many health policy experts say the administration took too long to make key decisions on the website and failed to test it soon enough. But the Obama administration has recently conceded deeper technical problems. Insurance companies have reported that they are not consistently getting accurate data about consumers enrolling in their plans.

Among the major design flaws was the requirement that consumers create an online account before they could compare insurance plans, creating a bottleneck that may have caused long wait times. The Obama administration has changed that feature to allow shoppers on the federal site to “window shop.”

Such design flaws are relatively easy to address, said Bill Curtis, chief scientific officer at CAST, a New York-based firm that analyzes information technology systems. “They will get past that,” he said.

But evidence has emerged of problems in how the system shares information among federal databases to calculate whether consumers qualify for subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums. That has prompted experts to predict it may take weeks or months to get the marketplace to work properly.

“When you slam a big system together like this in too short of time and without adequate testing, this is what you will often see,” Curtis said. “They will solve one problem and it reveals a set of other issues.”

Some experts say the Obama administration may need to use more drastic measures, such as taking the website down for a complete overhaul and extending the deadline to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to enroll, if they want to get coverage starting Jan. 1. The open enrollment period lasts until March 31.

David Gruber, director of healthcare research at Alvarez & Marsal, a consulting firm in New York, said: “Their incremental fixes are unlikely to work and the consumer experience will remain poor. The question is: ‘How often will consumers go back and try it?’ At some point, the well runs dry.”

As problems persist, anxiety is mounting among the law’s supporters and insurers. If only the sickest Americans fight through technical problems to buy a health plan, while younger, healthier Americans stay away, that could drive up future premiums and hamper the viability of the healthcare expansion.

“That could be an unintended consequence of this computer fiasco,” Gruber said.

Over the weekend, the Health and Human Services Department said it had hired “some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.”

The administration also has added staff to call centers to handle phone registrations, but officials would not provide details on the number of centers or whether operators would use the same faulty online system.

The president’s aides tacitly acknowledged the setbacks. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney suggested the administration might be flexible on when people will have to pay the fine for failing to get health insurance.

As he defended the law and the marketplaces, Obama’s pitch had the touch of an infomercial. “The website is still working for a lot of people,” he said.

He told uninsured Americans they could also buy insurance by phone or in person. “Real people” are standing by, he said, “24 hours a day.”

Flanked by consumers, Obama even supplied testimonial evidence. One satisfied customer introduced him and he read letters from others, including a man named John Mier, who wrote, “Yes, the website really stank for the first week.”

“John said that when he saw what they’d be paying, he turned to his wife and told her, ‘We might just pull through. We can afford this,’” Obama said. “And John eventually predicted that ‘the website will work like a champ.’”

The answer appeared to be “no” during Monday’s oral arguments. The justices signaled that they probably will bar any grants of exclusive and profitable patents on human genes that prevent other scientists from testing these pieces of DNA.

But the justices were aware the issue itself was anything but simple, and they sounded wary of going too far and taking away the financial incentives for companies and their scientists to explore new uses for DNA.

“The patent law is filled with uneasy compromises,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. “We do want people to invent. On the other hand, we’re very worried about them tying up … a thing that could be used for further advance.”

Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are carefully monitoring the case because a ruling rejecting the patentability of human genes could curb investment in gene-related research and new drugs.

The case before the court arose when cancer patients and medical researchers sued in 2009 to challenge the patents issued to Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City. Its researchers discovered DNA sequences in two genes that signal a high risk for the development of breast or ovarian cancer.

The company filed for a patent for one gene, called BRCA1 for BReast CAncer1, in 1994, and for another, called BRCA2 for BReast CAncer2, in 1995. Their flagship product, BRACAnalysis, tests for key mutations in both genes.

About 1 million patients have been tested so far. Myriad charges more than $3,000 for each test.

Breyer and other justices insisted that “products of nature” could not be patented, whether it is a plant leaf that has medicinal potential or human DNA. “It’s important to keep products of nature free of restrictions,” he said.

It also is not enough to find a new substance, other justices said. What about “the first person who found a liver?” Justice Elena Kagan asked. Surely, that person could not have been given a patent on livers, with the exclusive right to test or treat them, she said.

At the same time, the justices said inventors should be able to patent a new use for a natural substance.

Though a ruling against Myriad could have a chilling effect on investment in certain biotech and pharmaceutical companies, some industry experts said the immediate fallout may be muted because many of the current patents on genes, first sought in the 1990s, already have lapsed or are expiring soon.

“This is an important juncture for the biotech industry, and this decision will set the tone from a patent standpoint,” said Karen Dow, a La Jolla patent lawyer who represents biotech companies and investors.

“We already have a problem with early-stage investors not wanting to invest in biotech and pharma companies because it takes so long to get a return on their investment. This ruling could have an even more chilling impact on that investment,” Dow said.

The bigger worry, some experts said, would be a broadly written court ruling that casts doubt on patents for other naturally occurring proteins, antibodies and other building blocks used by biotech companies to develop new therapies and tests.

“If the court decides that products of nature aren’t patentable more broadly, how far does it go? It’s possible they are willing to cover more than just genes,” said Lisa Haile, a San Diego patent lawyer for the industry.

Myriad said that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted more than 40,000 patents that were drawn from genetic material and that its patents were “the product of creative, human ingenuity.”

The company said its scientists “applied their inventive faculties to a previously undistinguished mass of genetic matter and created a new chemical entity.”

A lawyer for the breast cancer patients disagreed.

“What exactly did Myriad invent? The answer is nothing,” Christopher Hansen of the American Civil Liberties Union told the justices.

He conceded Myriad deserves credit for having “unlocked the secrets of two human genes,” but it does not deserve an exclusive patent for discovering a natural substance.

But Gregory Castanias, a lawyer for Myriad, said the Utah scientists had indeed invented something new. He cited the example of baseball bat. “A baseball bat doesn’t exist until it’s isolated from a tree. But that’s still a product of human invention,” he said, because the wood has been shaped and cut.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. objected. “A baseball bat is quite different” because it is shaped from a tree.

“Here, what’s involved is snipping,” he said, referring to the gene sequences. “You snip off the top and you snip off the bottom, and there you’ve got it.”

Like Roberts, most of the justices sounded skeptical of Myriad’s argument that “isolated DNA” can be patented. In recent years, the justices have faulted the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for being too willing to grant patents. “The PTO seems very patent happy,” Kagan said Monday.

Scientists who are skeptical of the idea of patenting genes said they were hopeful after the arguments that the justices would overturn the Utah company’s claims.

“I was on pins and needles the whole time,” said Dr. Wayne Grody, director of the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory at the UCLA Medical Center, who was present at the arguments. “But at the end I thought, ‘The justices really get it.’ ... I felt that all of them who spoke weren’t comfortable with the idea of patenting a gene.

“The justices really focused on a gene as a product of nature. They kept making the analogy of finding a medicinal plant in the Amazon. You can’t just pick the plant up and patent it.”

The ACLU and the Public Patent Foundation had argued that giving one company a monopoly over a distinctive gene sequence resulted in patients paying too much for testing, and it prevented them from getting a second opinion from other medical experts.

They had lost in the federal circuit court that oversees patent appeals. The court upheld Myriad’s patents in 2011 and again last year, despite the high court’s warning on the issue in a previous case. The patent judges held that isolating the particular gene that signals a risk of cancer was a “new and useful” invention that can be patented.

Even though Myriad’s patents are due to expire within two years, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the ACLU’s contention that genes cannot be patented.

A decision in the case of Assn. for Molecular Pathology vs. Myriad Genetics can be expected by the end of June.

(CNN) —

The Obama administration finalized rules on Friday that allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.

The mandates give women at nonprofit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge.

The rules, which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April, have undergone only minor changes. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, deputy director for policy and regulations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a call with reporters that the rules were “very similar” to the administration’s original proposal.

One of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations – such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education – that object to contraceptive coverage. This process, officials from HHS said, has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost.

These slight changes, said one HHS representative, came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year. In total, more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule.

Objecting organizations and insurers will have until January 1, 2014, to comply with the new rules. This date was extended from August 1, 2013.

“The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release. “Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.”

Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.

In a news release about the finalized plans, administration officials say these final rules “strike the appropriate” balance.

In February, the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan, offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term, partly because of improvements in women’s health and fewer childbirths.

As part of the new rules, groups that are insured – such as with student health plans at religious colleges – would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.

Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.

Although many religious groups applauded the compromise, not everyone heralded it as a success.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration’s proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom.

“Because the stakes are so high, we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few,” Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the conference, said in a February statement. “We will continue to stand united with brother bishops, religious institutions, and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary.”

Those calls of disapproval continued after Friday’s finalization of the contraceptive plans.

“This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom,” said Anna Higgins, director at the Family Research Council. “Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections.”

Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS, said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules.

“I think there is a much brighter line, simpler line, and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got,” he said.

An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Houses of worship were exempt immediately, and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.

That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths – many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong – covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.

The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.

The finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer.

Instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show “religious values as its purpose” and to “employ persons who share its religious tenets,” the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code’s definition that includes “churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations.”

After an uproar among religious institutions that didn’t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012. These plans are a continuation of those efforts.

The issue of Obama’s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year’s presidential race.

In August 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney released a television ad that attacked the Obama administration.

“President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith,” the ad said. “Mitt Romney believes that is wrong.”

Although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule, a news release that accompanied the ad justified the “war on religion” claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law’s rule on providing contraception.

Shear', 'Jackie Calmes']",Obama Intends to Let Health Care Law Prove Critics Wrong by Succeeding,"GALESBURG, Ill. — President Obama waved aside persistent Republican criticism of his signature health care law last week, saying in a New York Times interview that the overhaul would become vastly more popular once “all the nightmare scenarios” from his adversaries proved wrong.

The president accused Republicans of “all kinds of distortions” about the legislation. He said bluntly that his administration had a simple plan to build support for the law, which continues to be viewed with suspicion by large numbers of Americans. “We’re going to implement it,” he said.

Mr. Obama said he decided to delay a requirement that businesses provide insurance to their employees because of concerns expressed by executives about its administrative burdens. Some companies that already provide insurance had balked at provisions requiring them to show proof. The president said delaying that part of the law for a year would give the Treasury Department and other agencies a chance to make it “a little bit simpler” for companies to comply.

But he rejected criticism that by delaying the provision he had exceeded his constitutional authority."

Instead, the high-powered opiate combined with other prescription drugs left him feeling worse. The 50-year-old from Manteno had heard marijuana could provide relief, but he was hesitant to seek it out given the long line of police officers in his family. He eventually gave pot a try, saying he desperately wanted to spend more time with his children.

""In a matter of days, I started to feel better. I could keep food down,"" Graham said. ""I thought, 'Oh, boy, what am I going to say at Thanksgiving?' But then they noticed that I could eat, so they knew something was up. ... I hadn't been there the three previous years because I wasn't able to get out of bed.""

Graham was one of dozens of supporters on hand Thursday at the University of Chicago Center for Care and Discovery as Gov. Pat Quinn signed the state's medical marijuana bill into law, with Illinois joining 19 other states and the District of Columbia that have legalized cannabis for patient use.

The decision by Illinois leaders to take the plunge on medical marijuana after decades of resistance will unfold amid concerns that stretch from law enforcement officials who fear unused pot will be sold illegally to anti-drug educators who worry about the mixed message the law sends to kids to suburban zoning boards who'd rather pot shops not pop up on Main Street.

There will be plenty of time for such issues to be aired.

The law, which sets up a four-year trial program, doesn't take effect until Jan. 1. After that, state regulators will spend months coming up with rules spelling out who gets to open the 22 marijuana growing operations across Illinois, which businesses get the 60 licenses to sell the finished product and how patients will get medical marijuana cards from doctors. Then a panel of state lawmakers will decide whether the regulations are drawn tightly enough.

By the time that plays out, crops are grown and the pot stores open, it could be fall 2014 before those afflicted with one of 40 or so medical conditions can legally toke up to ease their pain.

But the long lead time is not stopping the legalized marijuana industry from descending on Chicago in three weeks for a ""cannabusiness symposium.""

There'll be how-to panels, tips on dealing with the government and, of course, networking opportunities — more big business than the peace-and-love image the less-successful push to legalize recreational use of marijuana calls to mind.

When those with a medical marijuana card are legally able to get the product, they'll be allowed up to 2.5 ounces every two weeks. That's about enough to fill two small plastic sandwich bags. They'll also be able to buy it baked into brownies, muffins, croutons and trail bars. And they can expect to pay taxes on their pot purchases. In Colorado, patients pay $80 and above for an ounce of medical marijuana, choosing from varieties with names like ""Jack Flash,"" ""Sour Diesel"" and ""LA Kush.""

Illinois restrictions

But unlike Colorado, which has come under fire for lax marijuana regulations even as the state gets ready to legalize recreational pot use next year, drafters of Illinois' law say it will be among the toughest in the nation.

Patients here can't grow their own pot and must have an existing relationship with a prescribing doctor. To qualify, patients must be diagnosed with a serious to chronic illness laid out in the law, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma or HIV. It's likely that patients would have to pay out of pocket for marijuana, as it is not typically covered by insurance companies.

The Illinois Department of Public Health will be in charge of issuing medical marijuana cards to patients and their caregivers, who could purchase and administer pot on behalf of those who are ill. Patients and caregivers would be fingerprinted, undergo background checks and must promise not to sell or give away marijuana. Workers at grow centers and dispensaries will undergo the same vetting.

The state will license 22 growers, one for each State Police district, as well as up to 60 dispensing centers to be spread across the state. Exactly where those growers and sellers could locate will be up to state regulators. Local communities could enforce strict zoning laws, but they could not prevent a grower or dispensary from setting up shop in town.

Growers and dispensaries will be charged a 7 percent ""privilege tax,"" which will be used to enforce the medical marijuana law. Patients will be charged a 1 percent tax for purchasing pot, the same rate that applies to pharmaceuticals. Additionally, growers and dispensaries would be banned from donating to political campaigns.

Marijuana use would be banned in public, in vehicles, around minors and near school grounds. Property owners would have the ability to ban marijuana use on their grounds. Employers would maintain their rights to a drug-free work place, meaning someone with a valid medical marijuana card could be fired for using the drug if their employer prohibits it.

Advocates argue that Illinois' law is drafted tightly enough to prevent intervention from the federal government, which classifies all marijuana use as illegal. But the discrepancy between state and national law is already causing concerns for some military veterans, as federally run veterans hospitals say their doctors won't issue prescriptions for illegal drugs.

Legislators tried to get around that prohibition by providing a loophole in the law that would allow veterans to receive a prescription for pot from someone other than the primary care provider, but advocates say the federal government's stance prevents veterans from having honest conversations about the possible benefits of medical marijuana.

""It presents a pretty big stumbling block for vets,"" said Michael Krawitz, executive director of Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access, a group based near Blacksburg, Va.

Police concerns

Meanwhile, opponents argue that the law will create a public safety hazard on the roads and promote drug use among teens.

The measure was opposed by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, which noted that the law does not ban medical marijuana patients from driving. The group had suggested that blood and urine testing be included in the legislation to allow police to determine whether cardholders were under the influence of marijuana while driving."

The video, debuting on BarackObama.com and promoted through various social media, arrives on the eve of a joint President and First Lady event designed to target mothers of uninsured millennials as they arrive home for their holidays.

In the clip, a mother and father call their son, presumably about to drive home for Christmas dinner, and warn him that they have something “very important” to talk to him about. The son spends the entire drive home fretting about the worst case scenario (“Your father and I are moving in with you!”) and inexplicably expecting arbitrary pop culture references (“I am the one who knocks!“). The “reveal” that the parents want to talk about health insurance is predictable, as is the fact that the son is, above all, relieved. “That’s it?” he asks.

The ad, titled “Get Ready To Have The Talk,” plays like an ’80s anti-drug PSA, urging parents to use the holidays as a stage for an intervention to stop something unhealthy in their children’s lives. The fact that it happens at the dinner itself (though the accompanying Twitter graphic shows the actor playing the son mid-hot chocolate later in the night) instructs parents to directly address the Obama administration’s agenda in the middle of what, for many celebrating the night, is a religious celebration devoid of political meaning.

The targeted advertising appears to be a last-minute attempt to reverse devastating trends in the Affordable Care Act’s and the President’s nosedive in the public opinion polls as the year wanes and HealthCare.gov continues to fail millions. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll released this month shows 57% of young Americans ages 18-29 disapprove of the ACA and 52% would support removing the President from office. The targeting of parents also appears to be a direct reaction to dwindling support for Obamacare among white women.

Apparently, the White House hopes changing mothers’ minds will cause a trickle down effect that reaches the young uninsured. Or, at least, that is what Democrats should hope the White House is doing, because the video demonstrates a prodigious lack of understanding of youth culture today.

It makes sense. Young people today were not the young people of five years ago–the young people who truly believed in President Obama–and to the White House, it seems that all these new young people do is quote Breaking Bad at each other in their plaid onesies. It’s a Hail Mary pass from an administration that was previously unstoppable in reaching out to young Americans, one perhaps that is their only move after HealthCare.gov failed so extraordinarily that Ezra Klein wondered aloud why someone in the administration hasn’t been fired over it.

We’ll have to wait until next week to see just how many parents take this advice, but the outlook doesn’t seem to be so bright if this is the last PR resort."

First the bad news for Obama: The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows the public by 55%-42% disapproves of his performance in office. By 63%-33%, Americans disapprove of his handling of the health law.

Perhaps even more ominously for the president, by 52%-46%, the public now has an unfavorable view of Obama, himself. In the past, even when the public has soured on Obama’s performance in office, a majority has liked him personally. Now, however, by 51%-47% those surveyed say Obama does not “understand the problems of people like you” and by 50%-47%, they do not see him as “honest and trustworthy.”

Across the board, those ratings – and others equally troubling for the White House -- have fallen in the last few weeks as Obama and his aides have struggled with the launch of the healthcare law.

But the counterpoint comes from a newly released National Journal Congressional Connection survey which, like the Post/ABC poll, was taken Thursday through Sunday.

The National Journal poll shows that despite all the problems of the healthcare rollout, fewer than four in 10 Americans support repeal of the law. Even more strikingly, the percentage backing repeal has not grown by a statistically significant amount since the summer.

Repeal has been the steady, repeated demand of congressional Republicans, and the poll shows ample reasons why: Among self-identified Republicans, nearly three out of four respondents supported repeal. But among self-identified independents, a group that is otherwise quite skeptical of the law, only four in 10 back repeal. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose that idea.

Taken together, the two polls reaffirm a key point about the electorate that both parties tend to forget, to their detriment: A large bloc of Americans takes a relatively non-ideological, pragmatic approach to politics and government. They like to see accomplishments, they judge politicians by a relatively straightforward standard of results and they mistrust sudden shifts of course in either direction. That, of course, puts those Americans at odds with the more ideologically oriented voters who form the bedrock supporters of both parties.

For the healthcare law, the poll results suggest the issue will weigh down Obama and Democrats in general so long as the public sees the law as failing to work. But the reverse may also prove true: If the White House can get the law’s problems fixed, they have a chance to recover, so long as Republicans stick strictly to a message of repeal, which their core supporters insist on, but which the wider public rejects.

[For the Record, 1:55 p.m. PST Nov. 19: An earlier version of this post stated that, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, fewer than one in four Americans support repealing the Affordable Care Act. The poll’s actual statistic is fewer than four in 10 Americans.]

He Also Serves As Chairman Of The Department Of Obstetrics Gynecology', ""Reproductive Science At Hackensack University Medical Center In New Jersey. For More Information On Dr. Manny'S Work""]",Is there a hidden scandal lurking in ObamaCare?,"America, we are in trouble – and we better wake up and act.

Just look at the state of affairs in our country today. We are seeing scandal after scandal, with the Benghazi controversy, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, and the freedom of the press being challenged by the Department of Justice.

The word scandal is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “an action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage.” I think the implementation of ObamaCare fulfills that definition.

I remember back in 2010 when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made her infamous remark about the Affordable Care Act, saying “we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it....” Well the bill has been passed, and now we see what’s in it: An utter mess with incomprehensible rules.

If we compare the assertions the president made about ObamaCare when it was first introduced to the current bill as it has been passed today, we find that all the president’s guarantees regarding ObamaCare are not there.

The truth of the matter is that we were not fully informed. For example, President Obama maintained that this bill would lower the cost of health care, especially in regards to insurance premiums. That is simply not true. Many different analyses clearly show that in some markets, insurance premiums can increase as high as 30 to 40 percent. One of the main reasons for this increase can be attributed to all the hidden taxes that this bill contains, which the insurance industry will likely pass on to consumers.

Another false guarantee given by the administration was that individuals would be able to keep their doctors and current level of service through ObamaCare. Again, this is not true. The so-called insurance exchanges being set up in many states by the federal government will most likely create a non-competitive environment, meaning patients who cannot afford other types of insurance will be forced to buy insurance from the government. And if their current doctors are not willing to participate in that single-payer health care system, these patients will ultimately lose the guarantee of keeping their own doctors.

So what does this all mean? It means that if everything goes according to the president’s plan, the health care landscape is going to completely change over the next decade. A potential scenario is that private doctors will be employees of one large health care system. Health standards such as maintaining an ideal weight and eliminating habits like drinking alcohol and soda will be placed on families so that they can qualify for health care. So in other words, your individual freedom will be targeted.

I know many people argue that it’s better if everyone has health insurance and maintains a healthy lifestyle. Yes it is, but I still believe that an individual’s health care should not be dictated by the government. Instead it should be a choice made by the individual and his or her health provider.

Many senior politicians and consultants have found as of late that ObamaCare is a train wreck. And yet, the person in charge of implementing ObamaCare, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, continues to drive the train forward. Rather than work with leaders who are suggesting changes ,she has decided to enlist the help of the private sector in getting donations to help fund ObamaCare.

Many have questioned this move, but one thing Secretary Sebelius knows is how to organize her community of followers. Recently, she has teamed up with Nancy-Ann DeParle, former director of the White House Office of Health Reform, placing her in charge of asking insurance companies to donate $1 million or more to Enroll America, a non-profit organization promoting enrollment in the subsidized insurance markets, according to a report from Politico.

You see, folks, ObamaCare is all about politics and control, and to me, that is a formula for disaster. This is something that should not be taken for granted but rather openly evaluated by the American public."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/21/Facing-Primary-Lindsey-Graham-Now-Supports-Defunding-ObamaCare,2013-09-21 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],"Facing Primary, Lindsey Graham Now Supports Defunding ObamaCare","On Friday, the House voted for a resolution to keep government open but also defund ObamaCare. Within minutes, Nancy Mace, who is opposing Sen. Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, issued a press release attacking Graham for his past criticism of the defunding strategy. In just two hours, Graham tweeted that he supported the House’s efforts to defund the unpopular health care law. Such is the power of primaries.

I support the House-passed bill to Defund Obamacare. #SenateMustAct — Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 20, 2013

As recently as July, Graham said that defunding ObamaCare was “a bridge too far for him.” Primary opponents do tend to focus a politician’s mind.

Graham faces at least three opponents in next year’s primary contest. Normally, multiple challengers give an edge to incumbents, as opposition is split among several challengers. South Carolina, however, uses a run-off system. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two voter-getters face off in a run-off. Multiple challengers increase the odds that Graham falls below 50% and has to face a run-off.

Graham is no doubt a nice man and would make a good GOP Senator from a state like Maine. His representing South Carolina, however, is a wasted opportunity for conservatives. An East Coast John McCain does a disservice to the Palmetto State.

Graham’s tweet in support of the House action indicates he is aware of the challenge before him. Few incumbents are so disliked by the grass-roots, both in South Carolina and across the country. A run-off election, with a single conservative challenger, would ignite national interest and possibly create a wave that washes over Graham.

His tweet in support of defunding ObamaCare was a good start. He now has to follow that up over the coming weeks."

The ultimatum from President Obama's own party is another sign of the unrest within the Democratic caucus about the cancellation notices. The end-of-the-week deadline is significant, because House Republicans are planning to call a vote Friday on a bill that would extend current policies for another year.

It's unclear whether Democrats would go so far as to support that bill if the administration does not offer a Plan B. But one senior Democratic source told Fox News that, at a closed meeting Wednesday, Democrats made clear to the administration that they need a proposed fix before Friday's vote.

The White House has vowed to come up with a solution, but so far has not provided much detail on what such a solution would entail. Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that the president will make an announcement on possible options ""sooner rather than later.""

One senior House Democrat characterized the meeting Wednesday as ""heated."" The source said the session consisted of ""members telling the administration that they screwed it up and now we have to explain it to the public.""

Another source said that it helps for the administration to hear frank talk ""from their friends that they need to get back in front of the problem.""

""No more excuses, just get it done,"" the source said.

The administration is facing a bipartisan wall of criticism about the plan cancellations. President Obama said repeatedly when he was selling the Affordable Care Act to the public that anyone who likes their plan can keep it.

What he didn't explain is that if any of those plans were modified after early 2010, they would be subject to ObamaCare requirements. Many plans have since been canceled because they did not meet the requirements -- customers are being offered new, and presumably better, plans in exchange, but some of them are considerably more expensive.

Bill Clinton fueled the debate on Tuesday when he said in an interview that Obama should find a way to ""honor the commitment"" to let people keep their current health plans.

On the heels of that statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., joined the call to reinstate those policies. Feinstein announced that she's co-sponsoring a bill by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., that would reverse the cancellations by requiring insurance companies to continue to offer all current policies as of Dec. 31, 2013.

There are certainly still divisions among Democrats about the need to address the cancellations. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that the House GOP bill coming up for a vote on Friday is merely an attempt to undermine the health law.

House Speaker John Boehner, though, said Wednesday that both chambers could soon move to pass bills addressing the cancellations.

""We're going to move a bill through the House this week. I'm optimistic that the Senate ... [is] starting to see some momentum over there to move a similar bill,"" he said. ""This is not about politics. These are about real people in our districts that are being harmed by ObamaCare. It's time to fix this law.""

A White House spokesman says President Obama cannot take a position on Kermit Gosnell trial

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said aspects of the trial are %22unsettling%22

WASHINGTON — President Obama is keeping abreast of the ongoing murder trial of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, but the White House is steering clear of delving too deeply into the case.

Gosnell, who is on trial in Philadelphia, has been charged in the murder of a woman during a botched abortion, as well as the murders of seven babies born alive.

""The president does not and cannot take a position on an ongoing trial, so I won't as well,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said on Monday.

Obama is ""aware"" of the case but it would be inappropriate for the president or White House to weigh in on an ongoing legal proceeding, Carney added.

""Certainly, the things that you hear and read about this case are unsettling,"" he added.

The trial is in its fifth week. Former employees have described doing ultrasounds, giving intravenous drugs and helping with abortions, even though they lacked medical training or certification, in unsanitary conditions.

One unlicensed doctor, Stephen Massof, testified that Gosnell taught him to cut the necks of babies after they were born to ensure the babies died. Massof has pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree murder, and seven other former employees of the unlicensed Philadelphia clinic have also been convicted in the case.

Gosnell's defense attorney says no babies were born alive and that the patient died from unexpected complications.

The trial started March 18, but initially received little national media attention. That changed after an opinion column in Thursday's USA TODAY in which contributor Kirsten Powers criticized major media outlets for ignoring the trial."
http://news.yahoo.com/senate-dems-vote-repeal-part-163026133.html,,[],Senate Dems vote to repeal part of health care law,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It isn't every day that more than half the Democrats in the Senate vote to repeal part of President Barack Obama's health care law.

But that's what happened Thursday night when the Senate voted 79-20 to repeal a 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices such as catheters, pacemakers and MRI machines, which was intended to help to finance coverage for the uninsured that starts next year.

The medical device industry, a technology leader that provides lots of well-paying jobs around the country, has been lobbying all-out to repeal the tax. And Republicans were hoping Friday that the vote signals a new willingness by Democrats to defy the president on unpopular provisions of his signature law.

But others pointed out that the vote was nonbinding, amounting to budget guidance. The actual repeal of the tax is far from a done deal, and things might have come out quite differently if senators had to confront spending cuts or tax increases to fill in a 10-year, $30-billion revenue hole that would leave.

Nonetheless, 33 of the chamber's 53 Democrats joined all 45 Republicans in voting for the repeal amendment by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Four out of seven members of the Democratic leadership voted for it. Two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats split their votes for and against.

Republicans said the result exceeded their expectations.

""I would like to see the entire law repealed,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. ""But since the Supreme Court said it's constitutional, and the president was re-elected, I think we are going to see Democrats work in a bipartisan way to repeal portions of the law."" Other targets: a tax on health insurance plans and a Medicare cost control board.

Not so fast, says the White House. ""Last night's purely symbolic vote has no bearing on the future of the Affordable Care Act and its implementation,"" said spokesman Brad Carroll. The administration says the industry will benefit from millions of newly insured customers as a result of the law, and it should contribute in the same way that hospitals, drug companies and health insurance plans are also taking cuts or paying higher taxes.

Story continues

The industry says it has been lumped in the wrong category, because the vast majority of its customers are already covered by insurance and it isn't expecting a windfall from Obama's law. The companies started paying the tax Jan. 1, and they say if it stays on the books that will lead to lay-offs and put a damper on investment. Outside economists expect the industry will be able to pass on most of the tax increase to customers.

The one thing the Senate vote clearly proved is that the industry has lobbying clout, said Robert Laszewski, a consultant to health care companies.

""This was an easy vote for many senators to take in response to a very powerful medical device lobby,"" Laszewski said. ""Let's see what happens when the choice is to undermine the (health care law) or come up with an alternative source of revenue. I don't think these 33 Democratic senators have any intention to start taking the Affordable Care Act apart."""

The massive Care Harbor event returns to town this week, amid the rollout of new and shifting insurance options for millions of Californians under the Obama administration’s overhaul of the healthcare system. Once again, thousands showed up Monday at the Sports Arena to secure appointments for everything from mammograms to teeth cleaning — but with new expectations for the future.

“For many of these folks, we hope it’s the last time they’re in this line,” said Howard A. Kahn, chief executive of the public health plan L.A. Care, which co-sponsors the event.

As they have for several years, dozens of doctors and dentists will be on hand Thursday through Sunday to serve thousands of patients.

Among many of the would-be patients, future insurance coverage was a secondary concern to blurry vision and painful gums.

Los Angeles resident Stanley Lewis, 52, hoped to get a crown; Boyle Heights resident Judy Ramos, 55, wanted to get her teeth fixed and a new pair of glasses. Richard Marcella, a 68-year-old from Lake Los Angeles, was concerned about his hearing and a painful mass that he worried might be cancer.

“You can’t tell someone with a decaying tooth that there’s anything more important in the moment,” L.A. Care’s Kahn said.

Many hoping to see a dentist said they had medical coverage through private or public plans, but no dental insurance.

Some without insurance said they tried to go on the state’s new insurance website to sign up, but couldn’t complete applications because the system wasn’t working.

Others said they didn’t want to attempt to use the system until any glitches are worked out. A few expressed anger at being compelled to enroll in health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act.

“It’s unfair, really,” said Josh Berg, a 21-year-old actor who was signing up for medical and vision appointments. An Orange County native who said his life in Los Angeles was “just getting going,” Berg said he was upset that he would face a fine if he doesn’t buy insurance.

Information on insurance options was available for clinic-goers like Berg. Just beyond tables where patients received wristbands that would get them into the clinic, volunteers distributed information about Medi-Cal, Medicare and Covered California, the state’s healthcare exchange.

Care Harbor’s founder, Don Manelli, said the organization hadn’t set any goals for Obamacare signups, but that he believed “a healthy percentage” of attendees would inquire about coverage. In about two weeks, he added, his team would be able to analyze computer records and determine how many people applied for insurance.

Manelli said sign-ups for clinic appointments were “going beautifully.” He noted that by Sunday evening, hundreds had lined up to get wristbands. People continued arriving throughout the night, eventually forming a line that stretched around two sides of the arena and doubled back on itself.

At 8 a.m. on the dot Monday, the line — estimated at more than 2,000 men, women and children — jolted into motion. People jumped up from folding chairs and milk crates and quietly began to shuffle toward the appointment area.

By 10:40, the line was all but gone. A few minutes later, patients who had hoped to get dental appointments started being turned away.

“We wanted to come early, but I had work,” said Natasha Oiye, 30, of North Hills. “This is so disappointing.”

The need for less-expensive cleanings and fillings won’t disappear with healthcare reform, organizers said. And despite the high hopes many hold for healthcare reform, they added, many people will still need Care Harbor’s medical services.

UC Berkeley researchers have estimated that by 2019, when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, there will be more than 1 million uninsured people in L.A. County.

But if you're trying to score the biggest break on the new Obamacare insurance exchanges, it could make sense to say ""I don't.""

That's because unmarried couples may end up paying less for subsidized insurance than if they were married.

A primary reason are the federal poverty levels, which are used to determine the new subsidies to pay for premiums.

This ""marriage penalty,"" as some conservative critics are calling it, is hardly unique to federal health reform.

""Any [federal benefit] structured based on poverty will have that effect,"" said Gary Claxton, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That includes Medicaid and various benefits administered through the tax code.

To qualify for one of Obamacare's premium tax credits -- as the main health insurance subsidy is known -- your income must be between poverty level and four times that amount for your household size. The higher up that scale you go, the smaller the subsidy.

The marriage penalty results largely from the fact that the combined salaries of couples can push them out of the range of eligibility faster than if they were unmarried and their paychecks were treated separately.

Here's why: The federal poverty level of a two-person household ($15,510) is less than double that of a one-person household ($11,490).

Take a couple who combined make $40,000 and don't have access to employer-sponsored insurance. Both partners are 35, each makes $20,000 and they don't have kids.

They will pay nearly $1,300 less for two silver-level plans in the exchanges after accounting for federal subsidies than if they were married, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's health insurance subsidy calculator.

And that holds true whether they live in New York City, Las Vegas, Louisville, or Lawrence, Kansas.

Related: Some families left out in the cold by Obamacare

Couples, of course, don't usually make the exact same salaries. Say one partner in the couple making $40,000 brings in $29,000, and the other brings in $11,000.

As an unmarried couple they could pay much less for their coverage than if they take a walk down the aisle. The higher earner would pay close to $1,000 less for a silver plan and $625 less for a bronze plan. And the partner making $11,000 would qualify for Medicaid if they live in a state that has expanded eligibility for the program.

As a result, the partner on Medicaid would pay very little for that coverage since there's almost no cost-sharing of expenses involved, Claxton said.

But if they didn't live in a state with expanded Medicaid, the calculation is different.

Say that same unmarried $40,000 couple live in Kansas.

The $29,000 earner would pay $957 less for a silver plan than if she had applied for premium tax credits as part of a married couple.

But here's the rub: The $11,000 earner would not qualify for Medicaid or a subsidy on the exchange.

So, in that instance, if health coverage for both partners is important, they might be better off getting married and applying for subsidized coverage as a couple, even if it costs more."

The North Dakota legislature is currently considering an amendment to an anti-abortion bill that would effectively block a $1.2 million federal grant for a sex education program for teens who are homeless or in foster programs.

Planned Parenthood and North Dakota State University were jointly planning to administer the program, which would have provided counseling and information about abstinence, contraception and sexually transmitted infections. But state Rep. Bette Grande (R-Fargo) proposed to kill the grant to keep Planned Parenthood out of teen sex education in North Dakota, even though the family planning provider does not operate any clinics in the state.

""They're not a part of how we do business in this state,"" Grande said of Planned Parenthood in January after the sex ed program was announced. ""It is an overt abortion industry that we don't want to be a part of.""

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, told reporters on Monday that North Dakota is the first state ever to go after a sex education program that is fully funded by the federal government.

""This is incredibly unusual,"" she said. ""No state has tried to block a comprehensive sex education program like this, ever.""

Arkansas lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill that would prevent public funds from flowing to any entity that provides or refers for abortions, which would effectively end an HIV and STI prevention program that Planned Parenthood administers through a state grant.

And Texas state Sen. Ken Paxton (R-McKinney) proposed a bill in March that would prevent Planned Parenthood from providing sex education materials to Texas students because the family planning provider has an inherent ""conflict of interest.""

Nash told HuffPost that most states have been moving away from abstinence-only education and toward comprehensive sex education programs over the past decade because the U.S. has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the developed world. Research has shown that such programs delay sexual debut, reduce number of partners and increase contraceptive use among teenagers. But since 2011, several conservative-leaning states have been trending in the opposite direction.

""This could be the start of something,"" Nash said. ""For a couple of years, we've been dealing with attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the sense of prohibiting state funds to go to Planned Parenthood for the purposes of providing family planning, but now we're seeing that potentially expand to these sex education programs that give teens the information they need to prevent pregnancy.""

Twenty states currently require abstinence-only education in public schools where sex education is taught, including North Dakota and Arkansas. Texas law stresses abstinence education in public schools, but also includes information about condoms.

Dr. John Santelli, a pediatrician and professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, told reporters in a conference call on Monday that the medical profession and public health communities are united in the belief that comprehensive sex education programs are the best way to combat the country's soaring teen pregnancy rate.

""Unfortunately, this is an area where there's more heat than light sometimes, and political interference is all too common,"" he said. ""We broadly support comprehensive sex education and feel strongly that these programs should be left to health professionals and not politicians."""

Pollak'],Cummings Previews Democrats' Script for Obamacare Hearings,"As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.

Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:

BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option…. Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care…. I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher.

Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-no-excuse-health-care-signup-problems-155553975--politics.html,,[],Obama: 'No excuse' for health care signup problems,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Monday offered ""no excuses"" — and little explanation — for the computer bugs still frustrating Americans who are trying to enroll online for insurance plans at the center of his health care law. But software developers tasked with building the site said they saw signs a year ago that the debut could fail.

One source of the troubles appears to be the testing procedures employed before the rollout three weeks ago. Several developers of the HealthCare.gov website told The Associated Press they were worried for months about the system's readiness and whether the software meant to link key computer systems was being properly put through its paces.

In addition, congressional investigators raised concerns recently that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had taken on the job of testing the computer systems for the new markets during the final weeks before the sign-ups opened Oct. 1. That job is often handled by specialized software companies.

Obama, who emphasized the website's simplicity in the week's leading up to the insurance sign-ups, acknowledged there could now be ""no sugarcoating"" the problems even as he talked up the benefits of the law at a Rose Garden event that had the feel of a pep rally.

""The website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" he said.

He insisted that the problems would be fixed and all Americans seeking insurance would be able to sign up. But it was not clear how quickly that would happen. The administration is beefing up call centers and encouraging more people to enroll over the phone while the website problems persist.

The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The glitches have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior White House officials — including the president — appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the health insurance markets, known as exchanges, opened.

Story continues

Obama stopped short of apologizing for the failures, saying instead that ""nobody is more frustrated than me.""

Even as he spoke, more problems came to light. The administration acknowledged that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable, despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week.

The White House says additional technology experts from both inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the failures.

Administration officials initially blamed heavy website traffic for the frozen computer screens that many people encountered when they first logged on. Since then, they have also acknowledged shortcomings with software and some elements of the system's design, although the administration has yet to fully detail exactly what went wrong with the online system and who was responsible for the problems.

It appears the problems were well-known to some of those designing the system. One developer said that in the weeks leading up to the Oct. 1 launch, he and his colleagues huddled in conference rooms trying to patch deficiencies in computer code.

""It was an extremely tight deadline,"" said the developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was told not to talk to the news media about his work.

A review of internal structural diagrams obtained by the AP also revealed the complexity of the system. Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified, including income and immigration status. The system does that by connecting to other federal computer networks, including ones at the Social Security Administration, IRS, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps.

The schematics from late 2012 show how officials preferred a ""data services hub"" — a traffic cop of sorts for managing information — instead of a setup that would have allowed state exchanges to connect directly to government servers when verifying an applicant's information.

On Sunday, the Department of Health and Human Services said the data hub was working, but the initial consumer experience had not lived up to the public's expectations. ""We are committed to doing better.""

Administration officials have so far refused to say how many people have actually managed to enroll in insurance during the three weeks since the new marketplaces became available. Without enrollment numbers, it's impossible to know whether the program is on track to reach the projections from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated 7 million people would gain coverage during the first year the exchanges were available.

Officials have instead pointed selectively to figures putting the insurance exchanges in a positive light. They say more than 19 million people have logged on to the federal website and nearly 500,000 have filled out applications for insurance through both the federal and state-run sites. The applications must be completed before people can enroll in insurance policies.

An internal memo obtained by the AP showed that the administration had projected nearly a half million people would actually enroll for the insurance markets during the first month.

Uninsured Americans have until about mid-February to sign up for coverage if they are to meet the law's requirement that they be insured by the end of March. If they don't, they will face a penalty.

Officials say that at this point they are not considering extending the enrollment window beyond that time. They also say they are not considering taking the website down for an extended time to address the problems, but instead will do that maintenance during low-traffic overnight hours.

But the White House appeared to open the door to not penalizing those whose efforts to sign up were confounded by the system's problems.

""The law is clear that if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, then you will not be asked to pay a penalty because you haven't purchased affordable health insurance,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

So far, no one within the administration is known to have been fired for the problematic rollout. Some Republicans have focused their ire on Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, though the White House says she continues to have the confidence of the president.

Sebelius is scheduled to testify about the botched rollout before the House Energy and Commerce Committee next week. Representatives from some of the contractors working on the websites were also scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday.

Coined by the health insurance industry, the term “young invincibles” has come to describe 18-to-34-year-olds who go without coverage because they expect to remain healthy. But young invincibles are crucial to making the Affordable Care Act work: The White House is counting on them to buy coverage under the new law, helping to spread the risk and hold down premiums for everybody. Let’s debunk a few myths about who these uninsured young people are and what they want from the health-care system.

1. Young adults are uninformed about the health-care law.

Young adults tend to be about as aware of the health-care law as the rest of the population. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in August found that 33 percent of adults had heard nothing about their state health insurance exchanges. That figure was 43 percent among 18-to-25-year-olds and 41 percent among 26-to-35-year-olds. Separate polling from the Pew Research Center found that young adults were more aware than any other demographic that the health-care law offers subsidies for low-income Americans to purchase insurance. However, they were less aware of the requirement to buy coverage.

Young Americans are especially aware of the provisions that affect their own coverage options, most prominently the option to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26. A Commonwealth Fund poll in March found that 62 percent of young adults knew of that program.

2. They don’t want health insurance.

Young adults do have the highest uninsured rate of any demographic, with about 27 percent of people between 19 and 34 lacking insurance coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Health-care experts say this doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t want insurance, but rather that they are less likely to be offered coverage through their employers. That’s because more young people work part-time or hourly-wage jobs that do not offer health benefits. When offered coverage by their employers, about 80 percent of young adults sign up — about the same rate as older workers.

Millions of young adults have also gained coverage under the health law’s provision that allows them to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that, since this option became available in 2010, more than 3 million young adults have taken advantage of their parents’ insurance plans.

When the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed young adults about health insurance coverage in June, it found that about three in four said it is “very important” to them to have health insurance.

3. They don’t need health insurance.

While young adults tend to have lower health-care costs, without coverage they can incur substantial bills. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 17 percent of women ages 18 to 29, and 13 percent of men, have a chronic condition such as cancer or diabetes. Federal data show that young adults have higher rates of car accidents, which could lead to pricey medical bills. The high cost of maternity care can be another concern for young adults, with the average charges ranging upward of $32,000, according to a study published this year by Truven Health Analytics.

Young adults without insurance report difficulties accessing care and paying their medical bills. A 2011 study from the Commonwealth Fund found that more than half of uninsured young adults reported having a medical problem but not seeking treatment. Among insured young adults, that number was 19 percent. That same survey found that 51 percent of uninsured young adults had difficulty paying medical bills, with 26 percent having been contacted by a collection agency.

4. Young people will face steep premiums in the insurance exchanges.

The health-care law makes radical changes to the market for buying health coverage as an individual. For the first time, it requires insurers to accept all customers regardless of any preexisting health conditions. It also limits the amount that insurers can charge the oldest adults — premiums for elderly customers can’t exceed three times the amount charged to the youngest subscribers.

To make the math work — and to cover the medical bills of older, sicker enrollees — insurers have often had to raise rates for young adults. They have also had to cancel some of the plans they offer younger subscribers, which tend to have lower premiums but less-robust benefit packages. That means that, in the exchanges, young shoppers might see much higher sticker prices and experience what the news media has called “rate shock.”

However, many young adults won’t have to pay the full price. Instead, most will qualify either for Medicaid — the public health program that serves low-income Americans — or for tax subsidies to help buy coverage. The nonprofit Families USA, which supports the health-care law, estimates that about 9.3 million people between 18 and 34 will qualify for a subsidy to purchase health insurance. Between these subsidies and Medicaid, the government estimates that about four in 10 young Americans will pay a monthly premium of less than $100 for a plan under the federal law.

Emily Wright, a 28-year-old student in Tennessee who had previously been without health insurance because of a preexisting condition, found a top-tier plan that cost $244 per month. Because she qualifies for a federal subsidy of $119, she is paying only $125 each month toward that premium. Since Tennessee isn’t expanding Medicaid, she worried that she might not receive financial help: “I was nervous about what I was going to be paying, but it was actually a great deal.”

5. Young people aren’t signing up for Obamacare yet.

While they haven’t made up the majority of the health-care law’s participants so far, young adults do account for some enrollment. In states that have released demographic information, such as Washington and California, young adults were about 20 percent of the first month’s enrollment. In California, the state exchange had 6,924 people between ages 18 and 34 sign up for coverage, accounting for almost 24 percent of all enrollments in October.

Officials at state insurance exchanges say they expected older and sicker consumers to sign up first. They think younger people will sign up later in the open-enrollment period, which runs through March. “Those are pretty solid enrollment numbers for a younger demographic,” said Michael Marchand, a spokesman for Washington state’s Healthplanfinder. “Ideally we’d like to see the number go up in coming months.” White House officials have said they need about 40 percent of the consumers who buy plans on the exchanges to be younger than 35.

Five myths about the Affordable Care Act

Why are we still fighting over Obamacare? Because America was designed for stalemate.

Why Obamacare isn’t settled

Friend us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter."
http://news.yahoo.com/senators-closing-deal-reopen-government-072617244.html,,[],Senators closing in on deal to reopen government,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders are closing in on an agreement to reopen the government and forestall an economy-rattling default on U.S. obligations.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky could seal an agreement on Tuesday, just two days before the Treasury Department says it will run out of borrowing capacity.

The emerging pact would reopen the government through Jan. 15 and permit the Treasury to borrow normally until early to mid-February, easing dual crises that have sapped confidence in the economy and taken a sledgehammer to the GOP's poll numbers.

""The general framework is there"" between Reid and McConnell, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. He said conversations with the House were continuing and he thought it would be midday Tuesday at the earliest before a plan was finalized.

President Barack Obama telephoned McConnell on Monday to talk about the emerging deal, a McConnell aide said. Congressional leaders had been scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House on Monday, but the meeting was postponed to allow more time for negotiations.

On Wall Street, futures were mixed early Tuesday, with investors somewhat optimistic over a potential deal.

Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who was part of the bipartisan group known as the Gang of 12 which labored over the weekend to end the stalemate, said Tuesday he was ""pretty confident"" the Senate leadership and the White House would announce an agreement some time later in the day.

Speaking of the House, Pryor told CNN that ""some Republicans are, quite honestly, they're acting childish about this. They almost want a shutdown. They almost want to see us break the debt ceiling.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., also a part of the Gang of 12, told ""CBS This Morning"" she believes an agreement is near that ""doesn't contain a lot of the partisan pills"" that sank earlier proposals. She said it's urgent that national leaders find solutions to vexing issues so that the country doesn't ""lurch from one financial crisis to another.""

Story continues

Many House conservatives were unhappy about the emerging framework, though it remained to be seen whether they would seek to change it.

""One of the things we want to test is just basic fairness,"" Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, an influential group of House conservatives, said on CNN Tuesday. He was asked how conservatives would respond to the plan taking shape in the Senate. ""One of the things we don't want to see is just another patch,"" he said.

""We're willing to get the government open. We want to get the government open,"" Scalise said. ""Hopefully they get something done that addresses the spending issue.""

The developing plan is a far cry from the assault on ""Obamacare"" that tea party Republicans originally demanded as a condition for a short-term funding bill to keep the government fully operational. It lacks the budget cuts demanded by Republicans in exchange for increasing the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap.

Nor does the framework contain any of a secondary set of House GOP demands, like a one-year delay in the health law's mandate that individuals buy insurance. Instead, it appeared likely to tighten income verification requirements for individuals who qualify for Obamacare subsidies and may repeal a $63 fee that companies must pay for each person they cover under the big health care overhaul beginning in 2014.

Democratic and Republican aides described the outlines of the potential agreement on condition of anonymity because the discussions were ongoing.

But with GOP poll numbers plummeting and the country growing weary of a shutdown entering its third week, Senate Republicans in particular were eager to end the shutdown — and avoid an even greater crisis if the government were to default later this month.

Any legislation backed by both Reid and McConnell can be expected to sail through the Senate, though any individual senators could delay it.

But it's another story in the House, where it wasn't winning a lot of fans among conservatives.

Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, signaled that conservative members of the House were deeply skeptical. He said any bill had to have serious spending cuts for him to vote to raise the debt ceiling and said he thought Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had more flexibility than they had said publicly.

""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Barton said.

Asked whether the emerging package contained any victories for Republicans, Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., a member of the House GOP leadership, said, ""Not that I've seen so far, no.""

McConnell briefed House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Monday on the status of the Senate talks. Both House and Senate GOP leaders scheduled closed-door meetings of their respective memberships for Tuesday.

In addition to approving legislation to fund the government until late this year and avert a possible debt crisis later this week or month, the potential pact would set up broader budget negotiations between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. One goal of those talks would be to ease automatic spending cuts that began in March and could deepen in January, when about $20 billion in further cuts are set to slam the Pentagon.

Democrats were standing against a GOP-backed proposal to suspend a medical device tax that was enacted as part of the health care law.

Democrats also were seeking to preserve the Treasury Department's ability to use extraordinary accounting measures to buy additional time after the government reaches any extended debt ceiling. Such measures have permitted Treasury to avert a default for almost five months since the government officially hit the debt limit in mid-May, but wouldn't buy anywhere near that kind of time next year, experts said.

Some lawmakers are frustrated that defusing the immediate standoff simply sets up another fight next year.

""It's punting because no one, Democrats, Republicans wants to face up — and the American people — to the tough reality that we're in,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ""It's all a temporary fix.""

Just like every commander in chief before him, Obama has his share of critics. And in the Internet age, those critics have been given a bigger voice than ever before.

But what do you when the president writes back? The New York Post reports that fifth-grade schoolteacher Thomas J. Ritter was shocked to receive a handwritten response from Obama that reads in part:

“I believe that health care reform will be the right thing for the country . . . It certainly wasn’t the smart ‘political’ thing! And I hope that in the months to come, you will keep an open mind and evaluate it based not on the political attacks but on what it does or doesn’t do to improve people’s lives. Sincerely, Barack Obama.”

It’s not the first personal letter someone has received from President Obama that made headlines. In 2012, Obama famously wrote to a 10-year-old girl to answer questions about same-sex marriage . And in 2009, the New York Times wrote about how Obama has instructed White House staff to select 10 personal letters a day for him to read in order to help him stay outside of the “bubble” that inoculates so many public figures.

Still, the letter is a strangely personal exchange between the president and Ritter, 49. After all, Ritter’s letter is emotional and contains some questionable assertions.

Ritter wrote:

“This bill has caused such a divisive, dirisive [sic], and toxic environment … The reality is that any citizen that disagrees with your ­administration is targeted and ridiculed. I hesitated to write for fear of some kind of retribution. I watched you make fun of tea baggers and your press secretary make fun of Ms. Palin which was especially beneath the dignity of the White House.”

The abrasive tone of Ritter’s letter makes it all the more unusual that Obama would respond. And in responding, Obama even borrows Ritter’s phrasing of “tea baggers” to describe members of the tea party.

Story continues

In his reply, Obama acknowledges the “toxic political environment” that Ritter writes about in his letter, then continues, “I do have to challenge you, though, on the notion that any citizen that disagrees with me has been ‘targeted and ridiculed’ or that I have ‘made fun’ of tea baggers . . . [I] defend strongly the right of everyone to speak their mind — ­including those who call me ‘socialist’ or worse.”

So, did a personal, handwritten note make an impression on Ritter, helping him get past his political differences with the leader of the free world?

Not exactly.

Ritter is trying to make the best of the situation but only in the most literal sense. He’s put the letter up for auction, asking for minimum bid of $24,000.

“I am selling the letter because I am just so disappointed, and this ObamaCare bill is wrong,” Ritter told the Post. “The president told me what he thought I wanted to hear. The letter is just words on a paper. It doesn’t mean anything to me because Obama doesn’t mean any of it.”"

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama pledged to stamp out the gremlins plaguing his administration’s signature health-care overhaul Monday, saying there was no “sugarcoating” the difficulties faced by Americans hoping to sign up for insurance coverage online.

“Nobody’s madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama said during an appearance Monday at the White House Rose Garden.

There’s “no excuse for the problems,” Obama said. But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers trying to fix the site.

“You can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person,” he said. “So don’t let problems with the website deter you from signing up or signing your family up or showing your friends how to sign up, because it is worth it. It will save you money.”

A standoff with congressional Republicans over government spending and raising the federal borrowing limit – triggered by GOP efforts to defund the program – distracted public attention from the problems of the new health care system, popularly known as Obamacare. But with that standoff over, the GOP has turned its fire back onto the problems faced by the website and onto Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, calling for her to resign.

Sebelius attended Monday’s Rose Garden remarks, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that she was expected to testify at an October 30 hearing on the cause of the problems.

The committee is already scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday, with website and administrative contractors CGI, Serco and Equifax set to testify on their roles in the situation. Sebelius had been invited to this week’s hearing but had a scheduling conflict, her office said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the program on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live,” saying that while HealthCare.gov is struggling, the administration’s health care reform “is not failing.”

“Health insurance provides security that a lot of these families haven’t had in the past,” Carney said.

Have you had trouble signing up? Let us know

In the Rose Garden Monday, Obama said “the essence of the law” – aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million Americans without it – “is working just fine.”

“In some cases, actually, it’s exceeding expectations. The prices are lower than expected, and the choice is greater than we expected,” he said.

“But the problem has been that the website that’s supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,” he continued. “There’s no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People are getting stuck during the application process.”

And in a shot at the law’s critics, he said, “It’s time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hardworking middle class families are rooting for its success.”

But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Indiana, told CNN that his staffers were trying to sign up via HealthCare.gov while Obama was speaking, “and the website didn’t work.”

“This is one of those areas where the president’s not going to be able to hide behind the rhetoric,” said Messer, who supported the failed Republican effort to halt the program.

HealthCare.gov: What works, what doesn’t

Other Republicans kept up their attacks on the health care reforms on Monday, with the office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeting that when a visit to the Obamacare website made a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles seem pleasant, “it’s time for the President to consider delaying this rushed effort.”

A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Monday showed that 56% of respondents consider the website difficulties a harbinger of broader problems with the Affordable Care Act, a constant target of conservative critics who consider it the epitome of big government overreach.

Obama administration officials have highlighted the fact that nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for Obamacare, though the number who purchased coverage remains unknown. Initial difficulties have started to ease for logging on to the website for the new exchanges, some of which are run by states and others by the federal government.

But problems now are occurring further along the process, with insurance industry sources having said they are getting some applications with missing information. The application portion of the website was brought down this weekend for overnight maintenance, as it has been on previous weekends and some weeknights.

“To ensure that we make swift progress, and that the consumer experience continues to improve, our team has called in additional help to solve some of the more complex technical issues we are encountering,” the Health and Human Services department said in a blog post Sunday. “Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.”

Logging in tough for some early registrants

The administration is still not releasing the numbers on how many people have taken the next step of enrolling: choosing a specific health care plan. The administration has said it will do that monthly, so the first tally of enrollment numbers will come in November.

The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects 7 million people to enroll by April 1.

Although March 31 is the deadline for people to get health insurance or face a fine, officials warn that failure to sign up by February 15 could be a problem because of the time needed for the coverage to take effect. Carney told reporters on Monday afternoon that lingering problems in signing people up could result in relief, noting that the law makes clear that “if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, you will not have to pay a penalty for not having affordable health insurance.”

Hope for a smoother ride on HealthCare.gov

He also repeated the President’s assertion that high demand in the first weeks of the new exchanges contributed to the website problems, noting that the larger-than-expected response exposed existing “glitches and kinks.”

Although the administration tally of applications did not break down how many of the applications came through state-run exchanges, a CNN survey of officials with those exchanges found that at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans as of Friday afternoon. Not all of them had made a payment, and not every state responded to the CNN request.

A ConsumerReports.org article last week offered tips for people trying to sign up, but had the following advice for those overwhelmed by the difficulties:

“If all this is too much for you to absorb, follow our previous advice: Stay away from HealthCare.gov for at least another month if you can. Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they’ve made.”

But in a statement issued Monday night, the group said its criticism of the website doesn’t mean it now opposes the Affordable Care Act. Critics of Obamacare are misrepresenting the nonprofit organization’s position, Consumer Reports said.

5 things that have happened since Obamacare launched

As thousands of Americans receive insurance plan cancellation notices, President Obama's oft-repeated statement that anyone who likes their health plan can keep it is now a ripe target. And an Aug. 4, 2009 White House blog that tried to calm rising concerns over the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare -- in the context of today's developments -- makes some spurious claims.

""Opponents of health insurance reform may find the truth a little inconvenient, but as our second president famously said, 'facts are stubborn things,'"" Macon Phillips, then-director of White House digital strategy, wrote at the time.

The blog, part of the White House website's so-called ""reality check,"" is chockfull of ""explainer"" videos from people like Linda Douglass, the communications director for the White House's Health Reform Office. In one, she says one of her jobs ""is to keep track of all the disinformation about health insurance reform.""

She admonishes the media for causing alarm and alerting the public on the possible pitfalls associated with the law. She then throws to a video of Obama speaking at a July 28, 2009 AARP event.

""Here's a guarantee that I've made,"" Obama says in the video. ""If you have insurance that you like, then you will be able to keep that insurance.""

""Nobody is trying to change what works in the system,"" Obama says. ""We are trying to change what doesn't work in the system.""

Douglass then throws to another clip from a speech the president made on June 23, 2009 touting the benefits of the health care law.

""If you like your plan, and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing,"" Obama said. ""You keep your plan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you with good insurance, terrific! We're not going to mess with it.""

In the years since the video warning the public about the media spin on ObamaCare was made, the administration has had a lot of explaining to do. Most recently, they've acknowledged how plans from March 2010 and earlier would be grandfathered in -- but only if the insurance provider has not made significant changes to them.

The president has recently come under fire for promising to make buying insurance as easy as purchasing a plane ticket online or a ""TV on Amazon."" The turbulence that followed the rocky rollout of the Oct. 1 online healthcare exchanges were brushed aside by the White House as ""glitches.""

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified at a House hearing where she personally apologized for the failures associated with the rollout. ""Hold me accountable for the debacle,"" she said. ""I'm responsible.""

She deflected charges that the administration misled the American people about being able to keep their health plans.

When asked by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about why people were getting cancellation notices from their insurance companies and why a change was made allowing certain insurance policies to be ruled ineligible under ObamaCare, Sebelius claimed, ""There was no change."""

She's been on a state-wide tour to both shore up support for the expansion and put added pressure on state lawmakers in her own party

ThinkProgress has the story:



Some Republicans opposed to the expansion have warned of dire political consequences for lawmakers who buck the traditional conservative opposition to Medicaid. In a letter to Republican legislators, the chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Committee wrote of the state senators who voted for expansion, “Their egregious actions will have serious consequences. Their political careers are all but over and their days numbered.” He referred to Brewer as a “rogue governor” in the same statement.

So, when a Republican governor actually does something that's pragmatic and sure to help thousands and thousands of people... that governor's gone ""rogue?"" A conservative mind works in strange ways.

Back at the beginning of the year, Brewer became the third Republican governor to embrace the expansion, stating the fact that it would provide health coverage to fifty-thousand low-income Arizonians.



While promoting the expansion in March, Brewer attested to the dire consequences of failing to expand Medicaid. “The human cost of this tragedy can’t be calculated,” said Brewer, flanked by public health officials, doctors, and advocates for the poor. “Remember, there is no Plan B.”

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) the expansion of Medicaid would cut the state's uninsured rate by almost a third.

I'm about to write something here that never in a million years would I have thought would have even occurred to me. And frankly, it's a little unsettling to have it rattling around in my head.

Props to Governor Brewer.

Washington (CNN) – House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday neither she nor President Barack Obama misled the American people when they said, during the run-up to the passage of Obamacare, that people could keep their health insurance plans.

Pelosi clarified their remarks, saying they only meant people could keep their plans if they had already signed up before Obama signed the bill in 2010.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='gregclarycnn']

""(Obama is) gracious and he's taking responsibility,” Pelosi said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “But that doesn't mean there's anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010, you couldn't keep it.""

The Affordable Care Act allows for people to keep their health plans if they had signed up before the bill was enacted - but not after.

Fact Check: If you liked your health plan, you can keep your health plan

The president repeatedly said during the campaign for health care reform that if people liked their insurance plans they could keep them.

Following many health plan cancellation notices – a million in California alone – Obama told the American people Thursday he’s responsible for not having been clear.

“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked, they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear,” Obama said.

The President offered a short-term fix, allowing people who have had plans canceled to remain on them for an additional year.

On Friday, the House passed a bill, with bipartisan support, allowing people to stay on their plans permanently. It’s unclear whether that bill will have a chance to move forward or if Obama might even veto it if it passed in the Senate.

The fumbling – Obama’s word - rollout of Obamacare may take a toll on Democratic prospects in next year’s midterm elections, even though the party came out on top in opinion polls following a government shutdown last month. That shutdown now seems like a distant memory.

""I don't think you can tell what will happen next year, but I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act,” Pelosi said.

“What's important about it is that the American people get served, not who gets re-elected.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/07/georgia-obamacare_n_4400772.html,2013-12-07 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Top Georgia Democrat Fights To Prove Obamacare Can Overcome Deep South Resistance,"WASHINGTON -- For Democrats like Stacey Abrams, Georgia's House minority leader, advocating for the Affordable Care Act in a strongly conservative state is a daunting task. Her Republican colleagues, who control the state legislature, are staunch opponents of the law, and Gov. Nathan Deal is one of 20 GOP governors who rejected the Medicaid expansion.

That alone would seem like enough for state Rep. Abrams and her Democratic colleagues to tackle, but it doesn't end there. Last month, U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, another Georgia Republican, chaired a congressional oversight hearing in Gainesville during which a handful of cherry-picked witnesses spoke only of being harmed by the health care law.

Georgia is also home to Ralph Hudgens, the Republican state insurance commissioner who drew sharp criticism this week when a camera caught him likening pre-existing conditions to a car wreck in which the driver is at fault. Hudgens also bragged to a crowd of fellow Republicans in August about GOP efforts to destroy the law.

""Let me tell you what we’re doing [about Obamacare]: everything in our power to be an obstructionist,"" Hudgens said.

But despite the litany of obstacles facing Obamacare in her state, Abrams said that Georgians are ""hungry for information"" on what the law means for them and how they can sign up. She has made it her mission to bring that directly to them, by leading events explaining the Affordable Care Act to people across Georgia, many of whom have spent decades waiting for access to health insurance.

""What we have is that people are hungry for information. They desperately want to know what's going on,"" Abrams told The Huffington Post in an interview Thursday. ""They want to know how this impacts them because they realize, whether they're Democrat or Republican, they are going to be held accountable for getting health insurance.""

""But even more importantly, they want it,"" she added. ""A lot of the communities we're speaking to have been denied access to health care either because of cost or because of pre-existing conditions or because they didn't have an option.""

Since August, Abrams and her colleagues have reached out to discuss Obamacare on 40 occasions, from town hall meetings to teleconferences. Unlike most local events with state legislators, Abrams said empty seats are hard to come by at the Obamacare forums, prompting her to extend the activities through January.

""A big part of it is how we frame it. There isn't the hostility to us sharing this information,"" she said, noting that their primary objective is to arm individuals with information about the law, not to discuss its politics.

A typical event consists of legislators translating the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, down to such basics as explaining deductibles and co-pays to individuals who have never had health insurance before. Now that the functionality of Healthcare.gov has improved, Abrams and her team have launched ""Enrollment Saturdays"" for people to come in and access both the technology and the human navigators who can help them sign up on the health care exchange.

States such as Texas and California have adopted similar outreach tactics, underscoring how critical on-the-ground operations are to meeting the law's primary objective of expanding coverage to the uninsured.

Abrams conceded the problems that plagued the Obamacare rollout over the last couple of months, including the website glitches and the news of canceled policies, left people disappointed and ""didn't help matters at all."" She and her colleagues spent a great deal of time in their early events directing constituents to the telephone hotline rather than the website, but added that the struggles haven't dissuaded people from wanting to sign up.

""People get sick and they want to get care,"" she said. ""The challenges with the rollout did not change what for some people has been a 10-, 20- or 30-year wait to actually have access to health care. This is a miracle for them.""

Early data for November has shown a surge in the number of enrollments, although the White House is still lagging behind its target of 7 million by the March 31, 2014, deadline.

As part of ongoing efforts to boost enrollment, the administration gathered state legislators from across the country Wednesday for a briefing on the Obamacare exchanges. Abrams was in attendance and shared her story, which was met with loud applause, according to a senior administration official.

The White House meeting also focused on the law's Medicaid expansion, which Georgia Gov. Deal refused on the grounds that his state can't afford it -- even though his decision will cost Georgia nearly $3 billion in lost funding by 2022. Supporters of the law point out that the federal government will cover the entire cost of the expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share declines until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and future years.

A study released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, titled ""Nobody Wins,"" detailed the impact on states where governors rejected the Medicaid expansion. ""There are no states where the taxpayers would actually gain by not expanding Medicaid,"" Sherry Glied, lead author on the study, told USA Today.

Georgia falls into the category of states whose residents are most in need of the Medicaid expansion. An estimated additional 410,000 would qualify in Georgia, where gaps in coverage abound.

Financial pressures in states where Medicaid wasn't expanded have also put many public hospitals at risk, including as many as 15 facilities in Georgia. Just this year, hospitals in Folkston, Richland and Arlington, three of the state's rural towns, permanently closed their doors.

Abrams hopes such events will put public pressure on Gov. Deal to reverse his decision.

""If we say no to the Medicaid expansion, we are saying yes to shutting down our hospitals,"" she said."

Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) President Terry O’Sullivan said, “if the Affordable Care Act is not fixed, and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have all fought for and stand for, then I believe it needs to be repealed. We don’t want it repealed. We want it fixed, fixed, fixed.”

O’Sullivan added: “We can’t have the unintended consequences for the proud men and women that we represent to be collateral damage in the healthcare fight in this country.”

Big Labor strongly backed Obamacare before its passage. Now unions say the law threatens to destroy union workers’ health insurance plans if changes are not made soon.

Last week, the AFL-CIO passed a strongly-worded resolution blasting Obamacare despite the Obama Administration’s attempts to quell union opposition to aspects of the government healthcare overhaul.

O’Sullivan, borrowing from Vice President Joe Biden’s vulgar words whispered to President Barack Obama upon signing the bill, told the audience, “It’s going to be a big frickin’ deal if our members lose our health insurance!”

Republicans say union members should not be granted special breaks for the Obamacare law they fought to see pass. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) introduced a bill Monday called the Union Bailout Prevention Act to stop the White House from granting unions Obamacare waivers or special taxpayer-funded premium tax subsidies.

“Despite championing ObamaCare’s passage in 2010, union leaders are now awaking to the ugly reality of ObamaCare that most Americans have predicted all along, including higher health care costs,” said Thune. “Now that the full consequences of the Democrats’ law are nearing, these same union leaders are seeking a special backroom deal from the White House.”

Three federal appeals courts have ruled on the issue, with two correctly rejecting that view as without legal foundation. Given the conflicting rulings, it is a good bet the Supreme Court will agree to address this issue in the next term.

Under the Affordable Care Act, employers with more than 50 workers that provide insurance plans must include contraceptives coverage or face fines of up to $100 a day for each employee. The administration’s rule, issued in June, goes to great lengths to respect the concerns of religious institutions while preserving a worker’s right not to conform to the religious beliefs of her employer.

The rule has an exemption for houses of worship and accommodates other nonprofit religious and church-affiliated organizations, like hospitals, universities and charities, that object by letting them avoid paying for contraception for employees. In those cases, insurance companies or third-party administrators would arrange separate no-payment plans for contraceptive services. Quite properly, there is no exemption for owners of private for-profit businesses who simply don’t want to comply with a general law because of their personal views. (The House, in its idiotic push toward a government shutdown, included in its temporary spending measure a provision to let employers opt out of this requirement.)

On Sept. 19, the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation, owned by a devout Mennonite family, asked the Supreme Court to review a July ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that rejected the company’s argument that requiring contraception coverage in employee health plans violates the First Amendment’s free exercise clause and a federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act."

(CNN) —

The Obamacare website is open for business. But the Charlton Memorial Hospital in Folkston, Georgia, is closed.

Because Republicans in half the states have blocked the expansion of Medicaid, funds to public hospitals with large uninsured populations have been slashed. So far, at least five public hospitals have been closed this year and 5,000 hospital employees have been laid off nationwide. The closures are expected to worsen in the coming years.

In Georgia, as many as 15 more rural hospitals may close “within months” and in Tennessee, which is putting off a decision on expanding Medicaid, almost half of the 61 rural hospitals in the state might face “major cuts or closure.” This is a direct — and disastrous — consequence of Republicans’ ideological opposition to Obamacare.

Sally Kohn

When the Affordable Care Act was originally passed, subsidies to hospitals with large uninsured “charity care” populations were cut, figuring that the expansion of Medicaid under the law would replace this funding. But then the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to expand Medicaid or not. Half the states have said they will not extend Medicaid or are putting off deciding. These are states mostly controlled by Republican governors, state legislatures, or both.

There was really no downside to extending Medicaid to cover individuals who earn up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government is covering 100% of the cost of Medicaid for the next two years and 90% afterward. Columnist Josh Barro has pointed out the bind: “(W)hen Republican state officials decline to participate, they will have to explain to both medical providers and potential Medicaid beneficiaries that they turned down free federal money just to spite the President.” And yet the 25 states that have indeed refused Medicaid expansion will soon find they’re not just spiting the President but also their own citizens.

The people who rely on these “essential hospitals” aren’t just low-income folks. Middle-class Americans who live in rural communities will have to travel 40 or 50 miles just to reach the nearest emergency room if these hospitals close their doors.

According to Bloomberg News, Pam Renshaw crashed her four-wheeler in Folkston, Georgia, and suffered painful second- and third-degree burns on nearly half her body. But her local hospital had shut down. It took two hours for her to get to an ambulance center 20 miles away and then on to a hospital in Florida where she could get treatment.

As more of these horror stories emerge and as more hospitals close, even the most diehard Republican voters in these rural communities won’t care about ideological grandstanding. They’ll just want their hospitals open.

On the heels of news of rural hospitals shuttering come reports that health care costs overall are falling and that the cost of Obamacare is expected to be billions of dollars less than expected. Of course, some of the decline in health care cost is certainly the result of a still-sluggish economy. Yet does anyone doubt that if health care costs had risen in the same period to even a fraction of a degree, Republicans would be screaming from the rooftops, blaming Obamacare?

We might not be able to expect fervent anti-Obamacare ideologues to act rationally in the face of facts — but what we can expect is that their constituents will be even more vexed to see that as health care costs nationwide are falling, the hospitals on which they depend are closing.

Desperate to try to blame everything and the weather on the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have tried to pin the cuts in subsidies to hospitals on the dynamics of the law alone.

A spokesperson for Georgia’s Republican Gov. Nathan Deal blamed the Affordable Care Act for cutting subsidies to the hospitals that treat the uninsured while refusing to acknowledge the governor’s power to expand Medicaid at the state level and solve the entire crisis.

You heard that right: Republicans like Deal, constantly railing against the federal government and clamoring for “state’s rights,” are suddenly abdicating state responsibility and blaming the feds for not fixing the problem.

It’s the same hypocritical dynamic at work in more than 30 states that have turned their roles in setting up health insurance exchanges over to the federal government. It seems Republicans want state authority when it comes to pushing their conservative agenda but not when it comes to providing basic health care and access to insurance for their residents.

Not that Republicans at the federal level are any more responsible. Congress refused to pass a law that would have delayed the subsidy cuts for rural hospitals until more states decide whether they’re extending Medicaid.

These acts of ideological intransigence by Republicans at the federal and state levels will not hurt Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, its components are broadly popular with the majority of American people and it will only become more so as it is fully implemented and most people see the quality of their care go up as their costs go down.

No, Republicans are only hurting their constituents — folks in redder parts of red states who rely on rural hospitals for emergency room treatment, oncology visits, maternity wards and other basic care. Purely for ideological reasons, Republicans are creating a health care crisis — in their own states.

But lately the state’s Republican governor has confounded many and angered others by moving decidedly leftward, proposing a Medicaid expansion under Obama’s healthcare overhaul — financed by a new tax — and tempering her tone as Washington debates the combustible issue of immigration reform.

For longtime observers, it is a fitting close to a lengthy political career that has defied easy pigeonholing — if, in fact, the end is near. Contrary to the overwhelming weight of legal opinion and even the counsel of some of her own advisors, Brewer has refused to publicly rule out a run for reelection in 2014, despite Arizona’s voter-passed term-limits law.

(As the next in line, then-Secretary of State Brewer became governor when Democrat Janet Napolitano left office in January 2009 to join Obama’s Cabinet. Brewer won reelection in 2010 and suggests she might be eligible to run again because her first term was less than four years.)

Brewer may be recalibrating as the tea party’s influence wanes and Latinos gain political strength. Or she could have an eye on her legacy as she quietly prepares to leave public life after more than 30 years in office. Either way, her moves have proved Brewer to be a far less predictable politician than the caricature — accidental governor, ditzy ideologue — would have it.

“Where people were kind of chuckling and mumbling about her first year, she walks into a room now and there is genuine regard and applause,” said Jason Rose, a Republican strategist who has never been a part of Brewer’s circle. “That says a lot about her resilience.”

Advertisement

Others are less kind. The conservative world has rung with denunciations since Brewer announced her support for expanding Medicaid, the federal-state healthcare program for the poor and a frequent target of Republicans. A “spectacular flip-flop,” sniped the Wall Street Journal editorial page. “Opportunistic,” tutted National Review.

Brewer declined to be interviewed. But the governor has repeatedly said her decision, dropped as a bombshell in last month’s State of the State address, was grounded in sound fiscal policy.

“I’ve never been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act,” Brewer said at a Yuma press conference, part of a statewide tour to sell her Medicaid plan to a hostile GOP-run Legislature. In fact, Arizona was one of the states that sued to overturn Obama’s healthcare law. Having lost in the Supreme Court, she suggested, it was time to move on.

“Our decision is about whether we will take the action that most benefits Arizona families and businesses,” Brewer said. With $1.6 billion in federal funding, the state could provide health insurance for an additional 240,000 residents and continue insuring 50,000 childless adults, according to the governor’s office. Arizona would pay for its share through new fees on hospitals, which stand to gain from the increased number of insured patients.

Healthcare for the poor, and especially for the mentally ill, has been a career-long interest of Brewer, who has an adult son hospitalized due to mental illness. A Medicare expansion would restore some of the cuts she made — painfully and regretfully, Brewer said — to balance the state budget during the Great Recession.

“I don’t think she’s as far right as people have painted her,” said Earl de Berg, whose Rocky Mountain Poll has surveyed Arizona opinion for more than 40 years. “I think this demonstrates her more moderate conservatism.”

Advertisement

Brewer’s latest move is not the first time she has broken with party orthodoxy or angered keepers of the conservative flame. In 2010, she championed a temporary penny sales-tax increase to avoid sharp cuts in education and other services. Voters approved the measure, but last year rejected an attempt to make the tax hike permanent. (Brewer opposed the extension.)

Many believe a desire to appease conservatives led Brewer to sign Senate Bill 1070, the controversial crackdown on illegal immigration that raised fears of racial profiling and led to another Supreme Court case. Advisors deny that and insist she would have won reelection even if she hadn’t signed the immigration bill, most of which was blocked by the justices.

Advertisement

Regardless, there is no doubt she benefited from her decision, which turned Brewer overnight into a political celebrity and national tea party favorite. She solidified her folk status by wagging a finger at the president during a heated Arizona tarmac exchange, after he challenged her published account of an earlier meeting on immigration.

Those same moves made Brewer a scourge in the Latino community and a favorite target of liberals, who mocked her malapropisms, a disastrous 2010 debate performance — which included a 10-second brain freeze — and some of Brewer’s more alarmist rhetoric, including an assertion, later recanted, that headless border-crime victims were turning up in the Arizona desert.

Advertisement

Since then Brewer’s rhetoric has grown more measured, as passions surrounding illegal immigration have cooled somewhat. The border is more secure. The state economy has picked up. The champion of SB 1070, former state Senate President Russell Pearce, was recalled in November 2011 and lost badly when he tried to regain his seat last year.

“Even the wacko wing of the party is a little sensitive about fighting battles that’ll put the Democrats back in power in 10 years,” said Mike Hellon, a former state GOP chairman.

Advertisement

Last week, Brewer took a helicopter tour of the border and renewed her call for “more boots on the ground.” She has done nothing, however, to undermine a bipartisan effort, including Arizona’s two Republican senators, to negotiate an immigration overhaul more lenient than her enforcement-only approach.

While other Republicans are proceeding with plans to run for governor in 2014, the incumbent is keeping quiet about her intentions and any political motivations. It is not the first time Brewer has kept Arizonans guessing, and probably won’t be the last.

USA TODAY

2012 GOP presidential nominee says Obama%27s assertions threaten %27foundation%27 of 2nd term

Romney said states would have had more flexibility on health care if he were elected president

Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick offered counterpoint to Romney on %27Meet the Press%27

WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney accused President Obama on Sunday of lying to Americans about whether they could keep their health insurance, suggesting the Affordable Care Act is undermining his former rival's second White House term.

In an appearance Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee criticized Obama's repeated assertion while the legislation was being debated in Congress that people would get to keep their health care plan.

""He wasn't telling the truth,"" Romney said. ""I think that fundamental dishonesty really puts in peril the foundation of his whole second term.""

The Obama administration has stressed in recent days that people who lose their health care coverage — because their existing plan does not meet minimum standards under the federal law — will be able to get better insurance coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act.

Romney also rejected comparisons Obama has made between problems with the national law and its dysfunctional website, HealthCare.gov, and the Massachusetts plan and its initial enrollment challenges. If he won the 2012 election, Romney said, he would have given states more flexibility.

""My own plan was to say to each state, you've got a requirement to move to a point where all your people are insured and you cover pre-existing conditions,"" he said on NBC. ""We're going to give you flexbility from the federal government level to help you be able to do so.""

As he did throughout the presidential campaign, current Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick rebuffed Romney's claims in his own interview on Meet the Press. Patrick, a close Obama friend who is not running for re-election next year, said Romney himself had noted that the Massachusetts health law would be a model for the rest of the country.

Patrick said only a ""small number"" of people are receiving cancellation notices about their health insurance. ""If you have the kind of health care that disappears when you need it the most, the Affordable Care Act says that has to end,"" the governor said.

As for HealthCare.gov's myriad technical issues, Patrick described the website as a ""convenience"" that when working will allow consumers to comparison shop among insurance plans. ""That's why it is urgent that the president get it fixed,"" he said.

Sunday's interview was a follow-up to Romney's critique of Obama and the Affordable Care Act that the former Massachusetts governor posted on Facebook last week. That statement was a pre-emptive strike on Obama's speech in Boston, in which the president argued that the Massachusetts law had similar problems before state residents embraced it fully.

The Massachusetts health care law was perceived as an early problem for Romney in his presidential bid last year — something that he would have had to explain lest it became a defining issue in the GOP primary. In a speech in May 2011 at the University of Michigan Medical Center, Romney sought to defuse comparisons between the Massachusetts law and the Affordable Care Act calling the Bay State version ""a state solution to a state problem.""

But those first numbers may mask a different set of numbers

Many states are using Medicaid enrollees in their count toward initial Obamacare applications

The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work.

Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance.

The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.

But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans -- those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance.

Officials announced Thursday that 700,000 people have applied for insurance plans in both the 36 states that are using a federally run health care exchange and the 14 states running their own exchanges.

But don't apply that 700,000 application figure to the 7 million enrollment goal. For starters, there's no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan.

And those 700,000 applications include Medicaid enrollments.

Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance.

As the law was originally envisioned, more than half of the uninsured people in the United States -- 24 million or so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation -- who would be getting insurance through Obamacare would have been getting Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level -- about $27,000 for a family of four -- isn't eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, so Medicaid is effectively their only option.

So it's not necessarily a bad thing if more than half of the people getting insurance under Obamacare so far are getting Medicaid. But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.

Should it be alarming that so many of these 700,000 new applications are people trying to get Medicaid and not private insurance?

Not yet, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

""There's nothing in what we've seen to suggest anything like that,"" he said. ""Whether you're able to be eligible for Medicaid or not is totally dependent on your income.""

But he did admit ""Some of the numbers we've seen, preliminary, early numbers, do seem a little out of whack.""

But he said there's a reason for that.

""In these small handful of states, they're aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid,"" Salo said.

Salo pointed to people who the states already know are on food stamps receiving some other kind of state or locally funded health program.

""You know who they are, you know what their income is, you know they're OK accepting government benefits. If you go after these guys, there should be no surprise that these people are being enrolled.""

Also, in some states, Medicaid coverage starts immediately, meaning there may be more of an incentive to enroll early because you get coverage sooner than on the private market where no matter when you enroll in the first two and a half months coverage still starts on January 1.

In Arkansas they've insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1. But in a novel twist they're doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.

And Oregon has been approved to use food stamps and other metrics as a prequalifier for Medicaid enrollment. So the state sent letters to uninsured welfare recipients that detailed simple steps to enroll in Medicaid -- i.e. just sign a form and mail it back or call a hotline. This has resulted in tens of thousands of enrollees. But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance. It's the one state that elected to fix the glitches in its website before going live.

It may very well be that not enough people -- particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy -- are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.

But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell."

The moon landing was one of the last times the government delivered a big program ahead of schedule.

As it%27s gotten bigger%2C the federal government appears to have gotten less competent.

Obama within the government is a technological embarrassment.

So the Obamacare website doesn't work, and nobody knows when it'll be fixed. Administration officials are pointing toward late November, but they've had more than three years to work on it. In about the same amount of time after John F. Kennedy's ""we choose to go to the moon"" speech, we'd already put people into orbit and brought them safely to earth. It was obviously the signature effort of the Obama administration, but it was a flop. Forget launching to the moon; we can't even launch a website now. What does that tell us?

Well, don't blame Obama too much. It certainly tells us that the government has trouble executing the things it decides to do. But it wasn't always that way. Even for Obama.

The 1960s space program, of course, is a classic example of big government doing something successfully: Promising to put men on the moon within a decade, and doing it. But there are others.

Not far from me is Norris Dam, the very first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority. It was filled in 1936, less than three years after the Tennessee Valley Authority Act passed Congress. Note that it was not less than three years after construction started, but less than three years after the act creating the agency that built it passed Congress. Norris Dam worked, and it's still there today, more than 70 years later.

The Obamacare website -- which took longer to create -- doesn't work, and certainly won't be around in 70 years. And if you think about it, it seems like the moon landing was one of the last times the federal government delivered a big successful program ahead of schedule. I can't think of many others since.

Unlike Norris Dam, the Olmsted Dam and Locks on the Ohio River were authorized by Congress in 1988, but a quarter-century later the project is only half-done. It has also overrun its budget by a factor of four.

Meanwhile, most of the interesting stuff being done in outer space is being done by private companies. (In fact, President Obama's space policy approach, which emphasizes private enterprise, is one of his greatest policy successes.)

As it's gotten bigger the federal government appears to have gotten less competent. Apollo was a success on its own terms, but the big government policies that followed -- the War On Poverty, the War On Drugs, the War On Cancer -- have all been pretty much failures, sometimes disastrous ones.

Even Obama himself is evidence of this problem. His 2012 presidential campaign was famous for its mastery of technology, building up an electronic campaign infrastructure in just a few months that helped him win the election. But, of course, it wasn't a government operation. Obama without the government -- a technological success. Obama within the government -- a technological embarrassment. The difference between success and failure here, as even Obama-haters will have to admit, wasn't Obama. It's more likely that a political campaign has clear goals, and lots of freedom to improvise, while a federal program is much more encumbered by law and bureaucracy.

Whatever the cause, it remains indisputable that the federal government isn't very good at delivering on big projects. The obvious response is to not entrust the federal government with big projects on which it can't deliver. Instead, they should be left to those who can.

Will our political and pundit class draw the obvious lesson here? Stay tuned.

All right, I bring this up because, besides the heroic Wendy Davis, there were two stories in the news last week dealing with teenage sex. And just to be safe, the Vatican issued a denial. (audience groans) Yeah, you'll get over it.

One story was about Plan B. That's the morning after pill that the FDA says is safer than Motrin, and which any American can now buy over the counter, just like milk and ammo. And because it's a birth control pill, it will prevent abortions.

Now the other story was about the vaccine for HPV, which is the STD that leads to cervical cancer, and how that vaccine, since its introduction in 2006, has reduced teenage infections by 56%.

All good news, right? Wrong! No, over in Family Values World, things like Plan B and the HPV vaccine are bad, because they remove God's natural intended punishments for sluts who put out. (shocked audience laughter) It's true.

A) being saddled with a baby you don't want, or

B) stricken with a horrible disease.

You don't think that's how these people think? Then tell me why conservatives always couch their objections to the HPV vaccine in ""parental rights"", but never complain about other state-mandated vaccines their kids have to get. Why not throw a shit fit about the measles vaccine? Or mumps, rubella, whooping cough, chicken pox? Because you don't get those diseases from screwing or yodeling in the canyon. (audience laughter turns into cheering)

They do not want a vaccine for HPV, because that's the good kind of cancer, that makes hussies think twice about going all the way. Ron Paul — a fucking doctor! — said this vaccine, which prevents thousands of cases of a fatal disease, was ""not good medicine"". And Michele Bachmann said it caused mental retardation. Her source? The New England Journal of A Lady Who Stopped Me on the Street and Told Me That. (audience applause)

Yes, Republicans actually think this vaccine encourages girls to have sex, because now there are no consequences. Just the way when I got my first tetanus shot, I couldn't wait to jab rusty nails into my feet! (audience laughter) It was a freebie!

But studies have been done on this, and girls who get the HPV shot become no more sexually active than girls who do not. It's not like they see the needle getting stuck in and go, ""Ooh, that gives me an idea!"" (audience laughter)

They already have the idea. One in three 16-year-olds in America are having intercourse. To deny them access to the vaccine or Plan B as a means of preventing them from doing it, is like not giving them an umbrella so it won't rain. (audience applause)

And Plan B, again, is not an abortion pill. Quite the opposite. It's a dose of hormones that prevents ovulation. You know, ovulation, when a tramp's ovaries release an egg. (audience laughter) So there is no egg for the sperm to fertilize. So ""unborn life"" doesn't enter into it. If you have a problem with it, it's because you and your invisible friend just don't like people having sex.

If Republicans were really pro-life, they'd endorse making Plan B free to women everywhere. Of course, plenty of ministers' daughters are going to be using Plan B too. And good. Why should there be shame if on one night, a curious teenager loses herself in a moment of passion and says, ""OK, you can stick it in, but just for a minute."" Not knowing that a 16-year-old boy couldn't last a minute if he tried! (wild audience laughter and applause)"

Patients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and other premier military hospitals are being sent to private doctors and having surgery and other treatment delayed because of furloughs to medical personnel, according to interviews and internal documents.

""Please show (patients) the utmost understanding and care while we are asking them to accept longer wait times and in some cases, curtailed or limited services,"" Rear Adm. Alton Stocks, hospital commander, told staff in a July 12 message.

A ""colleagues"" memo issued in recent days says inpatient beds are in ""critically short supply"" because of furloughs of civilian staff triggered by federal spending cuts known as sequestration.

The memo encourages ""dispositions/discharges as soon as possible."" Hospital spokesperson Sandy Dean explained this direction, saying, ""We are are encouraging health care providers to be more efficient when handling their paperwork instead of writing discharge orders later in the day ... no patient has been or will be discharged before it is medically appropriate.""

With cases of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems at an all-time high, Dean says civilian caregivers in the hospital's in-patient mental health section are furloughed, reducing beds there from 28 to 22.

Most serious combat wounded and other medical cases are given priority as routine treatments are delayed, officials said.

Military families complain on the National Military Family Association website of waiting longer for medical appointments, immunizations for infants and getting someone to answer the phone at small medical clinics.

Similar cutbacks occurring across military medicine are ""definitely impacting our ability to deliver health care,"" said Maj. Gen. Richard Thomas, commander of 11 Army hospitals in the western United States. Just in the first month of furloughs, 10,000 routine patient appointments in the western Army medical region been delayed because of staffing shortages, Thomas says.

The Pentagon's top medical official, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs, called the cuts illogical and a significant threat.

""We simply cannot continue to sustain the burdens placed on the military medical system if sequester remains the law of the land,"" Woodson says. ""The men and women who have fought tirelessly on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan ... deserve much, much more than this.""

Thomas said that by sending patients to a network of private doctors who contract with the government for services, the Pentagon will spend more money in order to compensate for the automatic spending cuts.

""As we curtail ... we will inevitably refer more care out to the network,"" he says. ""We'll end up spending more money in the long run.""

The automatic cuts, which many in Congress have vowed to keep in place through 2014, led the Pentagon to furlough more than 640,000 civilian workers for 11 days between July 8 and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

For the Army, which has the largest medical system within the military, all but 6,600 of its 44,000 civilian medical workers are being furloughed.

""The impact on morale is huge,"" says Thomas, adding that some caregivers have quit, lured to the Department of Veterans Affairs for jobs. ""VA is parked right outside our installations and they're poaching our players.""

For Erika Townes, a nurse at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center, an out-patient clinic at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., furloughs mean canceling family vacation, cutting groceries and losing $200 per paycheck every two weeks.

""It frustrates me because I make less than $50,000 a year and, not to toot my own horn, but I'm a damn good nurse. ... I put a lot of passion into what I do. So you're going to punish me because you can't fix your own budget?"" says the veteran nurse, a mother of four whose husband is disabled.

At Walter Reed, the primary care facility for troops wounded in Afghanistan, the number of operating rooms has been cut from 23 to 20 Monday through Thursday and to 10 on Friday, when most civilians take their weekly furlough day, according to a memo July 15 from Navy Capt. Philip Perdue, deputy chief of surgery.

""Sorry to be the bearer of bad news; this is being forced on all of us,"" he writes.

The sprawling Walter Reed campus in Bethesda outside Washington is a joint military operation that in 2011 combined the National Naval Medical Center and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

With the spending cuts, 10%-20% of beds are now left vacant in surgery, in-patient mental health, maternal child services and critical care. Surgeons are urged to finish operations by 3 p.m. each day, according to an internal memorandum.

“Sometimes despite your best efforts, you might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to HealthCare.gov, maintenance periods, or other issues with our systems that prevented you from finishing the process on time,"" it continues. ""If this happened to you, don’t worry — we still may be able to help you get covered as soon as Jan. 1.”

During the past two weeks, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration official have reminded reporters that rules for the federal insurance exchange include a ""special enrollment period"" for those who tried but failed to meet the deadline for getting coverage starting on New Year's Day. But they had not spelled out until now how consumers could ask for the special consideration.

The official deadline was Dec. 23, but administration officials have given people an extra 24 hours -– until 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve -- to sign up by quietly changing the computer system's software over the weekend. There is no mention of the extension on the HealthCare.gov site. The difference between the extra 24 hours and the special enrollment period is that anyone who chooses a health plan by the end of Dec. 24 will automatically be assigned for coverage starting Jan. 1. Starting on Dec. 25, requests for Jan. 1 coverage will be considered on a case by case basis.

The information about the special enrollment option came as CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille issued a statement Tuesday saying the federal online health insurance enrollment system received two million visitors Monday, while the government's call centers received more than 250,000 calls from Americans that same day.

The influx of visitors to HealthCare.gov meant more than 129,000 people entered the site's queuing system, Bataille said. Once in the queue, applicants were asked to submit an e-mail so they could be alerted to when demand was less intense.

""All of them received e-mails inviting them back the same day to complete their applications,"" she said.

CMS continued to process applications for insurance Tuesday, Bataille added. ""Volumes remain high but not equal to yesterday, and we have not had to deploy our queuing system,"" she said. ""We are taking thousands of calls at our call centers, which remain open until midnight, and we are seeing thousands of visitors complete enrollment online.""

Consumers who try and fail to enroll by midnight on Christmas Eve should contact a call center for ""individual assistance,"" Bataille said, so that they can participate in ""a robust casework process to address individual inquiries, respond to specific situations and help consumers transition to new coverage.""

She's been on a state-wide tour to both shore up support for the expansion and put added pressure on state lawmakers in her own party

ThinkProgress has the story:



Some Republicans opposed to the expansion have warned of dire political consequences for lawmakers who buck the traditional conservative opposition to Medicaid. In a letter to Republican legislators, the chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Committee wrote of the state senators who voted for expansion, “Their egregious actions will have serious consequences. Their political careers are all but over and their days numbered.” He referred to Brewer as a “rogue governor” in the same statement.

So, when a Republican governor actually does something that's pragmatic and sure to help thousands and thousands of people... that governor's gone ""rogue?"" A conservative mind works in strange ways.

Back at the beginning of the year, Brewer became the third Republican governor to embrace the expansion, stating the fact that it would provide health coverage to fifty-thousand low-income Arizonians.



While promoting the expansion in March, Brewer attested to the dire consequences of failing to expand Medicaid. “The human cost of this tragedy can’t be calculated,” said Brewer, flanked by public health officials, doctors, and advocates for the poor. “Remember, there is no Plan B.”

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) the expansion of Medicaid would cut the state's uninsured rate by almost a third.

I'm about to write something here that never in a million years would I have thought would have even occurred to me. And frankly, it's a little unsettling to have it rattling around in my head.

Props to Governor Brewer.

After threatening to change the rules several times this year, the Democratic majority pulled the trigger on the so-called nuclear option after a series of procedural maneuvers that played out before a packed chamber. It would allow a president’s nominees, except for seats on the Supreme Court, to be confirmed by a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold that had become the norm.

Fifty-two senators voted in favor of the changes, with 48 voting in opposition.

Just three Democrats — red-state Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, as well as veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan — opposed the move.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) argued that the change was needed in the face of unprecedented Republican obstruction of nominees, which prevented the president from fulfilling his constitutional duty to fill vacancies in the courts, as well as in his administration.

More broadly, he argued that the Senate threatened to become “obsolete” if it did not act to end gridlock.

“The gridlock has consequences,” he said in opening the debate. “It’s not only bad for President Obama, bad for this body, the United States Senate, it’s bad for our country.”

Reid acknowledged that neither party’s hands were “clean” in the fight. When Democrats were in the minority nearly two decades ago, they fiercely resisted a Republican attempt to make the same rule change Democrats implemented Thursday.

But times had changed, he argued.

“Can anyone say that the Senate is working now?” he asked. “I don’t think so.”

Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to change the subject from the problematic rollout of Obama’s healthcare law.

“It doesn’t distract people from Obamacare, it reminds them of Obamacare,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, following Reid at the lectern. “It only reinforces the narrative of a party that is willing to do and say just about anything to get its way.”

Republicans also argued that Democrats were “breaking the rules to change the rules,” by using a simple majority vote rather than a two-thirds vote, as Senate rules state. Democrats believe they are on firm footing, however, since the Constitution allows the Senate to make or change its own rules at any time.

The unprecedented action injected unusual drama into the historic Senate chamber. At one point Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), arguably the body’s leading centrist, could be seen pleading with Reid to pull back from his threat.

In the short term, the Democrats’ action paves the way for the confirmation of Obama’s three pending appointments to the important D.C. Circuit court, beginning with Patricia Millett, whose nomination was the vehicle for Thursday’s action. Democrats could also apply the rule change to other executive nominations that have been blocked, like Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.), Obama’s pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

The long-term consequences are less clear. The Democrats’ move amounts to a gamble that Republicans will not regain both the White House and control of the Senate by 2016. If they did, the GOP would likely abide by the same new rules to confirm nominees opposed by Democrats.

Looming more immediately is a possible vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court that would occur during Obama’s final years in office. Democrats’ decision to exempt high court appointments from the rules change might nonetheless give Republicans additional motivation to block whomever he chooses.

Consumer advocates, doctors groups and many health industry leaders remain committed to helping the law succeed. Most believe in its goals of expanding health coverage and restructuring the medical system to improve quality and control costs. Few see any viable alternatives.

But even as President Obama launched another attempt last week to rally Americans behind the law, many of his allies believe his administration is no better prepared for the inevitable challenges of moving millions of people into new health plans than it was for the rollout of the federal HealthCare.gov website.

“The refrain we most often hear is: ‘Where is the administration?’” said M. Ryan Barker, vice president of the Missouri Foundation for Health, which has been working for nearly four years to help smooth implementation of the law in the state. “It is very frustrating.”

Like many of the law’s backers, foundation leaders have decided they and their local partners must take responsibility for educating consumers about their new coverage and responding to questions and complaints because the Obama administration has shown little ability to do it.

Many physician groups, hospitals and insurers have come to the same conclusion.

“I have never seen medical providers more dismissive of a White House,” said one longtime healthcare lobbyist, who asked not to be identified in speaking so frankly about the president’s leadership.

A health industry chief executive who supports the law bemoaned the Obama administration’s lack of preparation for even foreseeable complications, such as the recent cancellations of millions of health insurance plans that don’t meet the law’s new standards. “There just doesn’t seem to be much strategic thinking,” he said.

White House officials acknowledge the disastrous debut of HealthCare.gov has made it difficult to highlight the law’s benefits and respond to criticisms. But they say they are now prepared for a sustained campaign through next year, building on their work with advocates nationwide to enroll people in health coverage.

David Simas, senior advisor to the president on healthcare, said this new sales effort will not only showcase people who are benefiting from the law, but also compare the new protections with the shortcomings of the prior system, which left millions of Americans without health coverage.

Starting in 2014, health plans will be prohibited from turning away sick customers and will have to offer a basic set of benefits, including coverage of prescription drugs, hospitalizations and preventive care.

“Now, we can begin to tell a story,” Simas said. “We just have to execute. Period.... That’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to execute on that day after day after day after day.”

The White House last week publicized some of its efforts to protect the law from more political trouble. The administration is distributing talking points to Democrats and other allies, as well as hosting daily calls with advocates and key lawmakers to coordinate messages and responses to critics, an official said. And a former White House liaison to Capitol Hill who worked to pass the law, Phil Schiliro, will return temporarily to coordinate strategy with congressional Democrats.

Several administration allies in Washington said they are hopeful this campaign may be more successful.

“I don’t want to be Pollyannaish about this, having gone through great difficulties in the past, but I feel better than I’ve felt in months,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a former administration official.

Many advocates and industry leaders who support the Affordable Care Act also believe the law’s benefits will become clearer to Americans as more experience the security of health coverage, especially if they are ill.

“A lot of people are going to be pleasantly surprised by how good the coverage is,” said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the nonprofit California Endowment, which has committed more than $200 million to help implement the law in the state.

Indeed, despite the problems with the launch of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace for consumers in 36 states, there has been strong interest, with hundreds of thousands of people a day viewing the federal site and similar state sites.

But experts acknowledge public appreciation will take time. “We are in the beginning of a very long-term transition in the nation’s healthcare system,” said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, a Washington-based consulting firm.

In the interim, many supporters worry that more bumps in the law’s implementation could further undermine public confidence, especially without a sustained, strategic plan from the Obama administration.

“This is going to be a battle every step of the way,” said one Democratic official involved in the new messaging push who asked not to be identified in order to candidly discuss the work of White House officials. “It’s unclear whether or not they realize that this is not a three-week PR campaign.... There’s a long list of issues, serious issues that are going to come up as part of implementation, where Republicans are going to try to score political points or derail the law. And we have to be ready.”

Many advocates are particularly worried that consumers who are confused or angered about their new insurance could turn their frustrations on the law.

Some patients are likely to find that their doctors cannot verify their coverage because their applications weren’t processed accurately by the troubled enrollment system.

In October and November, before repairs were made to the website, as many as a quarter of insurance sign-ups had errors. The administration said last week that the rate is about 1 in 10. Administration officials say they are contacting consumers and telling them to confirm their enrollment with their insurer.

Advocates worry that other headaches await patients trying to use health insurance for the first time.

Some will discover the doctor they want to see is not in their network, an issue Republicans have already started to cite in their efforts to discredit Obamacare.

Others will find that a preferred prescription drug is not covered by their health plan.

For others, the high deductibles in many plans may come as a shock. Some who have never had insurance may not realize that their monthly premiums will not cover many of their medical expenses.

“A lot of patients are not going to be real happy,” said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians.

Molly Firth, public policy director at Community Health Network of Washington, which provides health coverage to poor Washington state residents, said she and others are concerned that low-income patients may select health plans with low monthly premiums, saddling themselves with high out-of-pocket costs.

More challenges could emerge as insurers decide which plans to offer in 2015 and how much they will cost. Some rates, which will start becoming public over the summer, may increase substantially.

The White House says it is anticipating these and other concerns, but declined to offer many details on how it would address them. Officials said HealthCare.gov had been updated to improve consumer education on such issues as deductibles and prescriptions. The so-called doc shock was the subject of talking points recently sent to lawmakers and allied groups. The White House also plans to assemble state data on the impact of the law to distribute to local officials.

Outside Washington, however, few are waiting for the White House.

“For us, it’s turned from a frustration to a motivation,” said Baker, the Missouri Foundation for Health vice president. “We’ve decided, ‘Let’s just do it.’”

http://news.yahoo.com/clinton-obama-honor-health-care-pledge-155627689--politics.html,,[],Clinton: Obama should honor health care pledge,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Adding pressure to fix the administration's problem-plagued health care program, former President Bill Clinton says President Barack Obama should find a way to let people keep their health coverage, even if it means changing the law.

Clinton says Obama should ""honor the commitment that the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got.""

The former president, a Democrat who has helped Obama promote the 3-year-old health law, becomes the latest in Obama's party to urge the president to live up to a promise he made repeatedly, declaring that the if Americans liked their health care coverage, they would be able to keep it under the new law.

Instead, millions of Americans have started receiving insurance cancellation letters. That, coupled with the troubled launch of the health care law's enrollment website, has prompted Republican critics and frustrated Democrats to seek corrections in the law.

House Republicans have drafted legislation to give consumers the opportunity to keep their coverage. Ten Senate Democrats are pushing for an unspecified extension of the sign-up period and in a private White House meeting last week several pressed Obama to do so. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., has proposed legislation that would require insurance companies to reinstate the canceled policies.

The White House says it is working on changes that would ease the impact of the cancellations for some people. But the fixes under consideration are administrative actions, not congressional changes to the law.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Tuesday reiterated the White House argument that the cancellations apply to only about 5 percent of Americans who obtained health care insurance. He also argued that more than half of those people receiving termination notices would benefit from better insurance at lower prices either through expanded Medicaid or through new health care marketplaces.

For the remainder, Carney said, ""The president has instructed his team to look at a range of options.""

Story continues

The issue facing the administration now is how to ease the impact on people who are losing their plans and don't qualify for subsidies to cover higher premiums. Carney said the White House opposes a House Republican bill, proposed by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow insurers to keep selling insurance that doesn't offer the type of benefits required by the new law.

""Any fix that would essentially open up for insurers the ability to sell new plans that do not meet standards would create more problems than it fixed,"" he said.

Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who advised the Obama administration on the health care law, said the White House has few if any administrative options available.

One solution, he said, would be to offer a ""transitional tax credit"" to those consumers who are losing their insurance and must pay more for new coverage that meets the law's standards.

""I don't know how you do that without Congress's permission, and they're not going to give it to you,"" he said.

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democratic leader in the Senate, on Tuesday said that while the law does face problems, he said some of the changes proposed by Republicans ""are not friendly proposals. They're designed to derail this effort.""

In an interview with CNN, Durbin cautioned that if consumers are permitted to keep policies that don't meet the law's minimum requirements ""it's going to be difficult for the insurance industry to produce a product that really is going to serve our needs and that they can adequately tell us what it costs.""

Asked whether Obama lied to the public when he promised people that they could keep their policies, Durbin said: ""A couple more sentences added would clarify it.""

In his interview with the website www.OZY.com , Clinton overall praised the health care legislation. ""The big lesson is that we're better off with this law than without it.""

Carney noted that Clinton's own efforts to pass health care legislation during his presidency were blocked.

""The goal here is to achieve what President Clinton and presidents both Democratic and Republican sought to achieve in the past,"" he said.

Unfortunately, these qualities are far too prevalent in our political culture today, and are prime reasons why Washington and the politicians that work there are held in such low regard.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the implementation and implosion of ObamaCare.

During the debate over the deeply flawed bill in 2009 and 2010, voters were repeatedly assured by President Obama and his congressional allies that everyone who liked their current health care plan would be able to keep it. “Period.”

[pullquote]

Now, as the new law implodes before our eyes, millions of Americans have received letters of cancellation. With approximately five million people across the country expected to lose their current plan and millions more to follow, when all the smoke clears, it’s clear that the Democrats broke their promise to the American people.

Many other Americans are experiencing fewer medical options as insurers restrict their choice of doctors and hospitals in order to keep costs low.

Some of the country’s top medical facilities are being excluded from the new exchange system, meaning patients who have been getting treatment from doctors they like all of a sudden find themselves out of luck.

For example, in New Hampshire, only 16 of the state’s 26 hospitals are available on the federal exchange, meaning patients must either pay more to keep their current doctor or seek inferior care elsewhere.

Neither is a good option.

New Hampshire is not alone. Across the country, some of the best hospitals are not available on plans on the exchange, leaving patients with difficult choices and unwanted sometimes, life threatening decisions.

Rather than join with Republicans and immediately repeal this catastrophe before it gets any worse, Democrats are stubbornly digging in their heels.

They know that backing away from President Obama’s signature achievement would be a huge embarrassment for the White House, and they’re unwilling to buck their party leadership.

Instead, they’re hiding behind meaningless show votes in Congress, offering half-hearted and meaningless attempts to reinstate cancelled plans or delay implementation of some of the particularly onerous new federal regulations.

All these false efforts will do is add to the increased costs and put things off until after the 2014 elections.

No one is mistaking these transparent moves as profiles in courage.

ObamaCare became the law of the land because every single Democratic Senator fell in line with their party bosses and voted for it. For any sitting member of the Senate to somehow now suggest that they are fighting to protect their constituents from this “trainwreck” is completely hypocritical.

If they were really interested in sparing their constituents from ObamaCare’s harmful impact, they should have stood up when they could have stopped the whole thing from becoming law.

They could have also voted to allow for the protection or “grandfathering” of the older policies.

They did neither.

Adding insult to injury is the fact that politicians in Washington have access to many special perks and privileges unavailable to the general public when attempting to navigate ObamaCare.

Beyond having more top-flight plans to choose from, senators have access to what the New York Times recently described as “concierge-type services” and “in-person support sessions” available only to members of Congress.

Democrats who voted for ObamaCare are therefore not exposed to the same frustrations of a broken website and complicated red tape that millions of everyday people are being forced to work through.

The hypocrisy is stunning. Saddling the rest of the country with complicated rules they didn’t want and don’t need in pursuit of a health care takeover that will hurt patient care, limit options and devastate our economy is no way to run a country.

Not only is President Obama to blame here, so too are every single one of the Democratic senators who forced this fiasco on the American people.

The president is not going to face voters again, but his congressional enablers and supporters will in less than a year. When they do, it’s going to be an unpleasant experience for any incumbent having to explain their deciding vote and continued support for the ongoing disaster of ObamaCare."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/aetna-obamacare_n_3839360.html,2013-08-29 00:00:00,[],Aetna Pulls Out Of Another Obamacare Health Exchange,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc has decided not to sell insurance on New York's individual health insurance exchange, which is being created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, the fifth state where it has reversed course in recent weeks.

The third-largest U.S. health insurer has said it is seeking to limit its exposure to the risks of providing health plans to America's uninsured, but did not give details about its decision to pull out of specific markets.

""We believe it is critical that our plans not only be competitive, but also financially viable, in order to meet the long-term needs of the exchanges in which we choose to participate. On New York, as a result of our analysis, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to withdraw,"" Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.

The New York decision comes as states finalize the roster of health plans that will be offered to millions of uninsured Americans beginning on Oct. 1.

Aetna and its newly acquired Coventry Health unit, a low-cost provider that caters to individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries and provides private Medicare policies, still have applications to sell coverage in 10 states, based on publicly available information.

Michener said the full list of state exchanges where Aetna will participate is still being finalized.

The new online insurance exchanges are the lynchpin of Obama's healthcare reform, representing a massive technology build-out that has run up against multiple delays and political opposition in many states. In their first year, the exchanges aim to provide coverage to 7 million uninsured Americans, many of whom will be eligible for government subsidies.

Aetna's large competitors, such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and WellPoint Inc, have also planned limited entries into the new exchanges while they wait and see whether they operate smoothly and whether enough healthy people sign on to offset the costs of sicker new members.

""We've got this period where the exchange experience, the exchange sentiment, and news headlines are probably not going to be very flattering and that's not going to have a positive impact on turnout,"" said Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley.

""Longer-term, those kinks will get ironed out, more people will get comfortable and in (the next few years) more people will be accessing their health insurance through an exchange of some sort,"" he said.

'RISK-BASED APPROACH'

Aetna signaled last month that it was considering withdrawing some applications because of its purchase of Coventry, which also had filed documents to sell insurance plans on exchanges around the country.

""We have taken a prudent risk-based approach to both our overall exposure and exposure within a given marketplace,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a conference call with analysts at the time.

Since then, it has withdrawn applications in Maryland, Ohio, Georgia, and Connecticut, where it is based. In Maryland, Aetna's decision came after state regulators ordered the company to lower rates dramatically from what it had proposed.

Aetna also has filed applications in Florida, Arizona and Virginia, where the federal government will operate the exchanges, and in Washington, D.C., which is running its own exchange.

Coventry filed applications to sell insurance in Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to those states' insurance departments. Iowa is working with the government on its exchanges while the rest are being run entirely by the federal government.

Coventry withdrew its applications in Georgia and Maryland when Aetna bowed out but it remains in Ohio. It also withdrew earlier this month from Tennessee.

Aetna and Coventry may also have filed plans in other states that have not released any information about participants.

Insurance plans in the 33 states that have defaulted to the federal government exchanges must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and then insurers sign off on them. Earlier this week, HHS delayed the sign-off deadline to mid-September after originally aiming for early next month.

Michener said the company will continue to serve small business and large business customers in New York and will offer products to individual consumers outside of the exchanges.

Only 17,000 or so people in New York currently buy individual insurance, but the exchange is expected to bring in 1 million people during the first three years. The exchange announced insurance participants on Aug. 20. Aetna was not on the list."

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court’s decision Thursday to uphold the Affordable Care Act means that the predictions about how it will affect Americans remain in place.

Obama: Supreme Court ruling on health care a victory for all Americans

The court did rule that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change. The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states. The law threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don’t participate in the expansion. The high court said the government must remove that threat.

Several groups that follow the health care law closely said they were concerned about the high court’s ruling on the Medicaid portion of the law.

Here are some highlights:

The uninsured

The decision leaves in place the so-called individual mandate – the requirement on Americans to have or buy health insurance beginning in 2014 or face a penalty – although many are exempt from that provision.

In 2014, the penalty will be $285 per family or 1% of income, whichever is greater. By 2016, it goes up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income.

Health care exchanges, which are designed to offer cheaper health care plans, remain in place as well.

American Cancer Society CEO John Seffrin said his organization was looking at the ruling on Medicaid, and is “concerned that the decision may limit the expansion of quality coverage to some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens.”

The group Health Care for America Now, which spent tens of millions of dollars on ads supporting the health care plan, said it was “disappointed” and will work to make sure no states “choose to exclude the lowest-income uninsured adults from their Medicaid programs.”

Medicaid Health Plans of America, the trade group representing Medicaid health plans, praised the court “for keeping in place key elements of this historic legislation” and said it remains “committed to a strong partnership with the states and CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to find a way to cover this population in need.”

Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, a physician who staunchly opposed the health care law, told CNN he believes many who would have received Medicaid will now enter the health care exchanges, which offer subsidized plans. That, he argued, could cost taxpayers billions of dollars across the country.

Breaking down the court’s decision

The insured

Because the requirement remains for people to have or buy insurance, the revenue stream designed to help pay for the law remains in place. So insured Americans may be avoiding a spike in premiums that could have resulted if the high court had tossed out the individual mandate but left other requirements on insurers in place.

Young adults

Millions of young adults up to age 26 who have gained health insurance due to the law will be able to keep it. The law requires insurers to cover the children of those they insure up to age 26. About 2.5 million young adults from age 19 to 25 obtained health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Two of the nation’s largest insurers, United Healthcare and Humana, recently announced they would voluntarily maintain some aspects of health care reform, including coverage of adult dependents up to age 26, even if the law was scrapped.

People with pre-existing conditions

Since the law remains in place, the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions remains active.

The law also established that children under the age of 19 could no longer have limited benefits or be denied benefits because they had a pre-existing condition.

Starting in 2014, the law makes it illegal for any health insurance plan to use pre-existing conditions to exclude, limit or set unrealistic rates on coverage.

It also established national high-risk pools that people with such conditions could join sooner to get health insurance. As of April, a total of only about 67,000 people were enrolled in federally-funded pools established by the health care law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

More than 13 million American non-elderly adults have been denied insurance specifically because of their medical conditions, according to the Commonwealth Fund. The Kaiser Family Foundation says 21% of people who apply for health insurance on their own get turned down, are charged a higher price, or offered a plan that excludes coverage for their pre-existing condition.

All taxpayers

No matter what the Supreme Court had decided, it would have been a mixed bag for all Americans when it comes to federal spending. There is heated dispute over what impact the health care law will have on the country over the long term.

The federal government is set to spend more than $1 trillion over the next decade to subsidize coverage and expand eligibility for Medicaid.

It is not immediately clear how the high court’s ruling on the part of the law dealing with the expansion of Medicaid eligibility could affect spending.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law could reduce deficits modestly in the first 10 years and then much more significantly in the second decade.

The CBO said a repeal of the mandate could reduce deficits by $282 billion over 10 years, because the government would be subsidizing insurance for fewer people. But the nation faces costs in various ways for having people who are uninsured. The Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center estimated that without a mandate, 40 million Americans would remain uninsured.

Meanwhile, the Flexible Spending Accounts that millions of Americans use to save money tax-free for medical expenses will be sliced under the law. FSAs often allow people to put aside up to $5,000 pre-tax; as of 2013, they were to face an annual limit of $2,500.

Opinion: Are voters ready to move on?

Small business owners

The rules and benefits small business owners face as a result of the health care law remain in place.

As CNN has chronicled, the law brought a mix of both. The director of the National Federation of Independent Business is one of the plaintiffs who pushed the court to strike down the law. Meanwhile, a group called Small Business Majority fought to protect the law, saying its loss could be a nightmare.

As of 2014, under the law, small firms with more than 50 full-time employees would have to provide coverage or face expensive fines.

All Americans, in lesser known ways

The massive health care law requires doctors to report goodies they get from medical supply companies; demands more breastfeeding rooms; requires all chain restaurants to list calories under every menu item, and includes numerous other provisions, which now remain in place.

Doctors and other health care providers

Health care providers have already begun making changes based on the 2010 law, and in preparation for what will go into effect in 2014. Those plans continue.

In the short term, doctors avoid “chaos” that may have resulted from the law suddenly being dropped or changed, according to Bob Doherty, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the American College of Physicians, who wrote a blog post on the website kevinmd.com this spring.

Medical groups have disagreed over the law.

To remove all doubt: The Take Care Clause of the Constitution absolutely forbids any president from doing exactly what Obama did Thursday.

Obama said he would allow insurance companies to keep offering previously-offered insurance plans that Americans would like to keep. Nobody knows if this means all plans, or only some of them, and how the White House will make such determinations. He says he has “enforcement discretion” to make this change to the Affordable Care Act unilaterally, without consulting Congress.

This is a frightening claim of a sweeping power that is completely inconsistent with the Constitution. A president has “prosecutorial discretion” to prioritize which lawbreakers to prosecute in federal court, but there is no “enforcement discretion” to determine which laws on the books he will enforce.

Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution commands of every president: “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Like every provision in the Constitution, it has a legal meaning–and that meaning is the Supreme Law of the Land, which Congress, the courts, and–yes–each president is bound by his oath of office to follow carefully.

Everyone should know from their high-school government classes that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to make federal laws, and Article II of the Constitution gives the American president the executive power to administer and enforce those laws. Article II then includes the language about how the president must faithfully execute those laws.

Among other things, the Take Care Clause was inserted in the Constitution to abolish the Royal Prerogative that the Framers of the American Constitution knew from their lives as Englishmen. It was the power of the king of England to disregard or effectively suspend Acts of Parliament. The king could not make laws, but he could shelve a law that Parliament had passed.

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act. Every day provides additional proof that Obamacare is a complete train wreck, but it is one regarding which only Congress can change the terms.

This president’s relationship to Congress is reaching toxic levels, due in large part to the regularity of his hyper-partisan rhetoric and ongoing disrespect. He is learning that the campaign tactics that enabled him to win two presidential elections are manifestly counterproductive when applied to the arduous task of governing, especially in a country as large and diverse as America.

It is not clear at this point whether anyone would have standing to sue over this matter in court. If the experts who are saying today that this unilateral move will only make matters worse are correct, someone might suffer an individualized injury that they could litigate.

President Obama should hope that doesn’t happen, because if a federal court can get past the procedural hurtles to reach the merits of the case, it’s an open-and-shut case that this president’s actions are unconstitutional–again.

USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent

Although many young students say they think health insurance is important%2C nearly 80%25 know little about the Affordable Care Act%27s new insurance marketplace.

Students will benefit in many ways from the online marketplace%2C one health-organization official says.

Unlike most college students, Tara Carey chose her own health insurance plan.

Three years ago, Carey's father passed away from a chronic blood disorder after being laid off and losing his health insurance, rendering him temporarily unable to afford chemotherapy treatments. With her mother unemployed and uninsured, the Emory University junior was required by her school to get insured, but opted out of Emory's Student Aetna plan because it didn't offer reasonable coverage.

""The insurance that I have now actually is fine — it has great coverage with low co-pays, but the premium costs too much of my monthly income,"" says Carey, 20. ""When I had the Aetna plan as a freshman and sophomore, the amounts I paid out of pocket were ridiculous. I had to have a minor surgery that cost roughly $4,000, and I had to pay $2,500 — doesn't exactly sound like good coverage for a college student.""

Still working to pay for the procedure, Carey plans to utilize the open enrollment period — Oct. 1 to March 31 — of the health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act to find a plan that better suits her needs.

While she admits she doesn't entirely understand how the marketplace will work, she thinks the impact on college students will depend on their family income.

""Yes, Emory is a wealthy school, but many people have a health plan that doesn't meet their needs, so people need to know,"" Carey says.

Yale senior Christina Chandra, 21, found herself in a similar position when the restaurant where her parents worked closed and they lost their health insurance. As a result, Chandra opted into Yale's default student plan only to find it expensive and lacking coverage for services such as dental care.

Come Oct. 1, Chandra hopes to use the marketplace to find a suitable plan — not only for herself but for her entire family.

""[My parents] feel as though they don't understand the health insurance marketplace at all, so at the moment they are depending on me and the Affordable Care Act to get them a plan at a reasonable rate that will cover essential health services,"" she says.

According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll, around three quarters of those ages 18 to 25 believe it is important for them to personally get insurance and that insurance is worth the cost. However, nearly 80% of those under 30 had heard little to nothing about the marketplace.

One organization trying to change that is Young Invincibles.

Currently in the midst of a nationwide education campaign called Healthy Young America, Young Invincibles has reached more than 1,000 youth-serving organizations and health partners with information about the ACA and new options through the exchanges.

Jennifer Mishory, deputy director at Young Invincibles, says students will be affected by the online marketplace in three significant ways:

Students can enroll in plans without the threat of being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Students who earn less than about $46,000 or families that earn less than $94,000 annually may be able to access free coverage through Medicaid or discounted coverage through monthly tax credits depending on the state and their exact income level. New plans will provide free preventive services, annual checkups, prescriptions and substance use disorder services.

""We need to make sure that young people understand their new options and know where to go to see if they can get monthly tax credits,"" Mishory says. ""We also need to make sure that young people are armed with information about how insurance works so they can make good choices for themselves.""

With national road maps to coverage and health care finder apps, Young Invincibles hopes to ease this process.

However, the option itself for college students to optin has been nothing short of a contentious debate.

The National Center for Public Policy Research's David Hogberg recently found that more than 3.7 million young adults will be at least $500 better off if they forgo insurance and pay the opt-out penalty.

Josh Archambault, a senior fellow in health care at the Pioneer Institute in Massachusetts, says it is important to remember this claim is from an economic standpoint. He says only 1,913 of 6 million residents under 30 are on Massachusetts' Young Adult Plan (YAP) because most remain on their parents' insurance until they turn 26.

""I think college students should visit the federal website to look at the possible costs and options that are available to them, but I think a lot of them will find that it makes more sense for them to remain uninsured, remain on their parents' plan or seek out a more catastrophic plan Archambault says.

After using the Yale health plan freshman year without knowing she could opt out, Yale senior Rachel Kubi has been under her parents' insurance for the past three years and plans to stick with it.

""It just seems easier than researching and purchasing insurance on my own, especially since I can stay on my parents' plan until I'm 26,"" says Kubi, 21. ""After graduation, hopefully my employer will cover insurance, but if not, I would decide between staying on my parents' insurance and using the health insurance marketplace.""

Emory junior Audrey Zeis will also be staying on her parents' plan and thinks others will do the same until they absolutely have to find their own plan.

""It's really hard to get people our age involved with this kind of issue because there's the mentality 'I'm not going to get sick, so I don't need to worry about it,'"" she says.

However, by volunteering in free clinics at local hospitals in Texas — which has the largest uninsured population —Zeis has seen reason for concern firsthand.

""It was really disheartening to see people sit there for seven hours then tell them they couldn't be seen that day, knowing the only reason they came into the free clinic is because it's their only option,"" Zeis says. ""If any of those people had insurance, it'd be so much easier for them to get the basic care they needed.""

Carey echoes this sentiment.

""People think that health disparities are only problems of developing countries across the globe, when in fact, it is a huge problem right here in the U.S.,"" she says. ""That is something I believe Obamacare will change significantly. People just need to be educated about the marketplace and their options — the word needs to spread."""

Mr. Obama’s openness to Medicare changes seemed to be news to many Republicans, even though he first proposed detailed ideas in 2011. Republicans often accuse the president of opposing changes in entitlement spending while focusing on raising taxes, an attack that ignores his proposals but also reflects how little Mr. Obama has talked about them.

Still, the same hurdle to compromise stands: The president and his party will not support even his Medicare proposals unless Republicans agree to raise taxes on the wealthy and some corporations. Without that trade-off, common ground on Medicare will remain unplowed.

“The president has said this to the Republicans: ‘You want to do entitlement reform? I do, too. I can produce entitlement reform and bring Democrats to the table, because I am a Democratic president. And so I’m ready to sit down with you and work out an approach,’ ” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a Democratic leader, said at a recent forum hosted by The Wall Street Journal.

Many Republicans remain distrustful of Mr. Obama. Yet when they speak of altering Medicare, not replacing it, it is clear that they share some concerns about the existing program.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of a health subcommittee, said the structure of the traditional fee-for-service Medicare is “outdated and confusing.”

“Can you imagine a world in which someone has to buy hospital and nursing home coverage from one insurance company, physician office coverage from another insurance company, prescription drug coverage from yet another company, and likely supplemental coverage from a fourth insurance company?” Mr. Brady asked. “This is exactly how the current Medicare benefit is designed.”"

The delay in functionality for the so-called SHOP exchanges represents the latest setback in the Obama administration's efforts to implement the three-year-old Affordable Care Act. The development also comes just days before HealthCare.gov, the online portal for individual and family health coverage in more than 30 states, is supposed to be working better after its troubled first two months.

Small businesses that want to utilize the federally run SHOP exchanges, and the tax credits worth up to half the cost of insurance that are available to some firms, will have to sign up through an insurance agent or broker or directly with a health insurance company, an administration official explained via email. In an attempt to mitigate the failure of the online application and enrollment process that was supposed to be in place, small businesses can submit their applications for tax credits whenever they file their taxes rather than in advance, the official wrote.

“This new delay announcement is a disappointment but not a surprise. Small businesses continue to be low on the priority list during the Obamacare implementation process,"" Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a written statement. ""The continued delays add to uncertainty and contribute to the decision of many owners to take early renewals of their small-group plans.” The National Federation of Independent Business opposed the Affordable Care Act and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, which the Supreme Court ultimately upheld.

The administration previously said online enrollment on the SHOP exchanges would be available by the end of this month, following earlier delays. Prior to Wednesday's announcement that the administration would facilitate enrollment via insurers, agents and brokers, paper applications were the only means small companies could employ to utilize the SHOP exchanges. Maryland also delayed its state-run SHOP exchange, though other states' exchanges are operational. The federal government is operating SHOP exchanges in more than 30 states, and the remainder are being run by states.

""Small businesses will able to enroll directly into a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker, and get can certified for a tax credit after they enroll. We will also offer an improved comparison shopping feature online so small businesses can choose a plan before enrolling in one,"" Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.

Unlike the federal- and state-run health insurance exchanges for individuals and families that limit sign-up to a certain period during the year, the SHOP exchanges are supposed to allow companies to enroll workers at any time. Still, companies with current benefits that expire at the end of the year have until just Dec. 23 to choose a health plan that will be in effect on Jan. 1, the official wrote.

The delay of the SHOP exchanges is partly a byproduct of the administration's scramble to get HealthCare.gov reliably working for individual consumers, Bataille indicated. ""It was important for us to prioritize the functionality that would enable consumers, individually, to shop and enroll online in coverage,"" she said.

Online enrollment won't be possible on the SHOP exchanges until next year for benefits that will be available in 2015, the administration said.

Earlier this year, the administration delayed another key component of the SHOP exchanges. Under health care reform, small business employees were supposed to be able to choose among any of the plans available on the exchanges. For 2014, employers will select the coverage for all workers instead.

(CNN) —

Americans frustrated by attempts to purchase health insurance on www.HealthCare.gov will soon be able to determine their eligibility for tax subsidies and purchase insurance directly from insurance companies and private exchanges, a government spokeswoman announced Tuesday.

Julie Bataille of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees the government’s online insurance exchange, told reporters on a conference call that as of Tuesday morning, the process called “direct enrollment” should be functioning.

“With the fixes that we’ve put in place as of this morning, we do believe that the majority of those high-priority fixes for direct enrollment to work have been addressed,” Bataille said. “We continue to work with issuers and work through some additional issues.”

Customers not eligible for tax subsidies have been able to use direct enrollment since October 1, but the fixes put in place Tuesday expand the process to all customers seeking insurance on the individual market.

Battaille added that she expects insurance companies and other issuers will need to test the government’s technical fixes within their own systems and then begin using the direct-enrollment process “in the coming days.”

Bad news for woman cited as Obamacare success story

If it’s functioning properly, customers should be able to go directly to an insurance company’s website to learn about plan offerings. They would then be referred to Healthcare.gov to determine their eligibility for a federal tax credit and then directed back to the company site to purchase a plan.

Direct enrollment can also be used by private insurance exchanges such as eHealth.com and GetInsured.com. A spokeswoman for GetInsured.com confirmed that the government had alerted her company about the new fixes.

“We’ve entered into agreements with more than 30 of those kinds of entities,” Bataille said, adding that CMS has issued guidance over the past several months to these partners regarding how they can interact with the federal marketplace and the fixes put in place Tuesday should address their problems.

“We believe that they are on track to begin their transactions as soon as possible,” she said. “This is something that obviously they will make a determination about individually as they see how their system is interacting with ours.”

Obamacare enrollments pick up steam but don’t include many young people

Earlier on Tuesday, CMS Deputy Chief Information Officer Henry Chao told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the federal marketplace was just 70% completed, meaning 30% of the marketplace still needed to be developed.

“That 30% represents the payment aspects and the accounting aspects of making payments in the marketplaces, for all marketplaces, not just federally facilitated marketplaces,” Chao said. “And that functionality has to be in place for the January 1 effective date enrollments.”

Bataille confirmed that the unfinished part of the marketplace included the portion responsible for paying out consumers’ tax subsidies directly to insurance companies, but she said that the development of those portions is on track.

“We are on track for this functionality to be available in the time frame that it would be necessary to process those transactions so that people would be able to have their coverage in January,” Bataille said.

Republicans have made so many attempts to repeal “Obamacare” that the scorekeepers have lost count.

“Republicans,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, “voted to repeal it 40 times.”

“Their 38th vote to repeal,” Rep. Sander Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, tallied Wednesday on the House floor.

“Thirty-nine times,” declared Rep. Louise Slaughter (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee.

“The House has tried nearly 40 times,” the White House asserted.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) wasn’t sure. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee’s health subcommittee referred on Wednesday to criticism that “Republicans are trying for the 38th or 39th time to repeal Obamacare.”

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) observed that “my good friend, the chairman, couldn’t even reference exactly how many times they’ve tried to repeal it.”

But let’s not pick on Brady. All the tallies fall well short of the actual number of times Congress has voted to repeal all or part of Obamacare. It has done that — are you sitting down? — 67 times.

According to The Washington Post’s fact checker, Glenn Kessler, there were 37 votes to scale back Obamacare before Wednesday’s two votes in the House. But those 39 don’t include the Senate, where Reid’s office has documented 28 votes, all but a couple in the form of Republican amendments. This might explain the new findings that Congress is holding more votes than ever but passing fewer bills.

Wednesday’s 66th and 67th attempts went much like the previous 65, except for a mid-debate recess so that lawmakers could have their official photograph taken on the House floor.

“This bill is unraveling before us,” exulted Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.) reported that “the train is not coming off the rails; it’s already off the rails.”

On the Democratic side, Rep. John Dingell (Mich.) responded by saying, “Einstein observed that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again with the full expectation that the results are going to be different.” Actually, the quote is probably apocryphal — but Einstein didn’t live to see the 113th Congress.

The proposals on the floor Wednesday were relatively mild: One codified the delay in the law’s employer mandate already announced by the Obama administration, and one extended the delay to the individual mandate. And Republicans weren’t entirely logical or consistent in advancing these proposals. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) accused the Obama administration of ushering in “socialism,” while Brady argued the contradictory position that the White House is “just listening to the voices of business” and ignoring “Joe Six-pack.”

But Republican lawmakers were clear about one thing: The tally of attempts will continue to rise.

“Postponing the two mandates are only the latest steps to repeal Obamacare,” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) said on the floor.

Rep. Luke Messer (Ind.) explained that “each day this law is delayed gives us more time to seek its total repeal.”

The overkill isn’t irrational. As The Post’s Sarah Kliff noted, research shows that people resist regulations more vigorously if they think the requirements will eventually be repealed. “If it’s 37, 38, 39, I don’t care,” Rep. Rich Nugent (R-Fla.) said this week. “If we do it 100 times, sooner or later we’ll get it right.”

And so Republicans continue to tee up the repeal votes — far more than anybody realized.

“Thirty, 40 times we’re talking about repealing it,” protested Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.).

Or was it, as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) posited, “the 38th time”?

“I kind of lost track,” confessed Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.).

It’s okay, Congressman. So did everyone else.

The contractors faced tough questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who voiced frustration with the weeks-long problems surrounding the federal hub. Lawmakers cast doubt on attempts by contractors, who were paid millions, to claim they were not responsible for many of the site's problems. Top contractor CGI Federal revealed it was paid $290 million in taxpayer funds.

But CGI Federal and other contractors repeatedly claimed that overall ""end-to-end"" testing was the responsibility of an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, as was the decision to go live on Oct. 1.

They suggested more time was needed to work out the -- major -- kinks.

Representing contractor QSSI, Andrew Slavitt told the committee that ideally, end-to-end testing should have occurred well before the launch, with enough time to correct flaws.

More On This...

""Months would be nice,"" said Slavitt.

""We would have loved to have months,"" concurred CGI vice president Cheryl Campbell, though she earlier claimed no amount of testing could have flagged all the problems.

Questioned whether there were concerns the site was not ready to go live, she also said: ""It was not our position to tell our client whether they should go live or not go live.""

Slavitt said his firm did share concerns with the agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, adding they were responsible for addressing them.

""We identified errors in code that was provided to us by others,"" he said. ""In this function we reported back the results to CMS and the relevant contractor, who in turn was responsible for fixing coding errors or making any necessary changes.""

He also blamed in part a ""late decision"" to require customers to register before browsing for insurance, which could have helped overwhelm the registration system.

""This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have otherwise occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously,"" he said.

CMS officials, in a conference call later in the day, acknowledged that there should have been more testing, but said there wasn't due to the ""compressed"" timeframe. They also claimed responsibility for the decision to make people fully log on before browsing for insurance.

The hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the first of what is likely to be many on the failures of the main ObamaCare website. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who skipped Thursday's hearing for an event in Phoenix, is expected to testify next Wednesday.

While Sebelius will face tough questioning, lawmakers on Thursday also took issue with much of the contractors' testimony, as they assigned blame to CMS and each other.

Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., questioned their claims that ""unexpected volumes"" of traffic caused much of the trouble.

""I think it's really kind of a lame excuse,"" she said. ""Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas and ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day.""

The witnesses at times downplayed the problems with the site itself, prompting jeers from lawmakers.

""The system is working. People are enrolling,"" Campbell testified, acknowledging the system is still too slow.

Noting that the administration is urging people to use paper applications, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: ""That is a system that has failed.""

Campbell -- who said she still thinks everything will be fixed in time for the Jan. 1 hard launch -- and others acknowledged the system needs to be improved. But all four contractor representatives tried to spread the blame around for the problems to date. Representatives from Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco also spoke.

Campbell said QSSI's tool that allowed consumers to create secure accounts created a ""bottleneck"" in the system.

Slavitt later said QSSI takes ""accountability"" for the problems with that function.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle took aim Thursday at the contractors, even as they implicated administration officials. Lawmakers were indignant as they complained that officials looked them in the eye before Oct. 1 and told them the launch of HealthCare.gov was on track.

""Either these officials were shockingly unaware of what was happening ... or deliberately misleading our committee and the public,"" Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said.

""They said there was nothing wrong, and they expressed nothing but optimism,"" Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said.

Republicans, still committed to repealing Obama's health care law, approached the questioning with a prosecutorial tone, leading New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone to call the whole exercise a ""monkey court.""

An official with the Department of Health and Human Services plans to brief House Republicans on the site on Oct. 30.

Commissioner William White told The Washington Post on Saturday that he was called into Mayor Vincent Gray’s office the prior day and told the Democratic mayor “wants to go in a different direction.”

The president said Thursday that the millions of insurance plans scheduled to be canceled next year to comply with ObamaCare regulations could be extended for a year, after he told Americans prior to the law’s passage that they could keep their existing plans.

However, White and other insurance commissioners across the country have questioned the president’s proposed solution because it could create a mess in the marketplace.

Some of the top reasons for the commissioners’ objections are: policy prices are already locked in to comply with changes in ObamaCare; an extension could conflict with state-level laws to comply with the law and younger Americans needed to join the federal exchange to keep down costs will wait to enroll.

White told the newspaper that the deputy mayor who asked him to leave didn’t say the request was about his remarks.

City officials have not commented on the situation, saying they cannot discuss personnel issues. However, a city official suggested to The Post, on the condition anonymity, that White posted the statement on the city’s website before getting it approved.

The District and 16 states run their own health-care exchange, compared to the 36 states that have instead chosen to let residents shop and purchase insurance on the federal exchange.

“The action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate,” White said Thursday in a statement.

He also agrees with a National Association of Insurance Commissioners statement that said Obama’s order “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”"

Rep. Paul Ryan, seen here telling the crowd why good Jesus-based values demand we cut Food Stamps and meal assistance for seniors yet again because those kids and old people will probably just trade that food for abortions or something. Probably.

The most interesting thing about Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Forum being held this week is that it exists at all. Ralph Reed, for those precious few of you who do not remember recent political history, is a crook . He is a political scammer who worked with Jack Abramoff in a swindle of Native American tribes and conservative Christians alike, a scam that went to the heart of the conservative movement but in which every last person save Abramoff himself has undergone a magical conversion back into respectability based essentially on the same scam as they started out with, which is duping Good Christian People out of their money.

So to have Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Allen West, Ron Johnson, Rick Santorum, Gohmert-Perry-Bachman-Palin-Cain-and-everyone-else-who-is-anyone in far-right conservatism eagerly climb aboard the good ship Ralph Reed for his latest little shindig should tell you all you need to know about the sincerity of the whole movement. He's a lobbyist who got caught in a money laundering scandal, and he was back lobbying and collecting checks in no time flat because, bluntly, all the conservatives currently surrounding him were just fine with that. Just don't get caught again, Ralph, and everyone will go along with the political scammer running a supposed morality-based movement. Everyone involved is exactly that shallow.

All right, so let's do this thing. Here's a brief roundup of the stuff that the very important people saw fit to get up in front of a microphone and preach about to a group of moral scolds led by scammers and crooks—the conservative Mob, dressed up nice and pretty. Below the fold lie the details:

So help me God.""

Congress passes or repeals laws, such as the Affordable Care Act, with the legislative process and votes, authority vested in Congress by a little thing called the Constitution. ""Conservative Republicans are so very fond of telling everyone else how no one loves the Constitution more than they do.""

Well, Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution states:



Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it….

This is how the Affordable Care Act became law. The Congress voted for the ACA in 2010 and President Obama signed the ACA into law two days later. There's even a video to show the signing of the bill into law!

If the teabaggers need a refresher course regarding how a bill becomes a law, the clerk of the house has a nice outline used to educate kids. This educational guide concludes that once a bill becomes law via this legislative process, it is ""enforced by the government.""

Last summer, two days after the House voted again to delay key provisions of ACA, Boehner said Congress ""should not be judged on how many new laws we create"" but on ""how many laws ... we repeal."" Since ACA became law, the House GOP voted ""42 times to defund, repeal or otherwise hobble Obamacare,"" but the measures died in the Senate.

In 2012, another branch of government, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA:



The court’s 5 to 4 ruling was a stunning legal conclusion to a battle that has consumed American politics for two years. Roberts’s compromise offered a dramatic victory for Obama and Democrats’ decades-long effort to enact a health-care law and a bitter defeat for Republicans and tea party activists, who had uniformly opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made repeal of the health-care law a central part of his campaign. “Our mission is clear: if we want to get rid of Obamacare, we are going to have to replace President Obama,” Romney said the day of the court ruling. “That is my mission. That is our work. And I’m asking the American people to join me.” And yet, voters reelected Obama with a decisive victory over Romney.

So, the GOP teabaggers turned to the election process. In the 2012 presidential election, Romney promised to repeal ACA if elected, but the voters chose Obama:Even speaker Boehner stated, after the 2012 election, that ACA is the ""law of the land,"" yet he continues to try to repeal it by unconstitutional means.

Having failed again, the GOP in January of this year plotted out a new ""legislative strategy"" adopted in an agreement called The Williamsburg Accord. After losing in the Congressional lawmaking process, the Courts and with the voters, the teabaggers agree to hold the country hostage with threats of a shutdown :



Republicans have fallen out, often sharply, over which hostages to ransom, with the most conservative ones favoring a government shutdown threat and the more pragmatic wing, oddly, endorsing a debt default threat. They have also struggled to define the terms of their ransom. The Williamsburg Accord initially envisioned forcing Obama to sign spending cuts, or some form of the Paul Ryan budget. During the summer, Republicans flirted with making Obama lock in lower marginal tax rates. Recently, Republicans settled on pressuring him to kill his health-care law. But the general contours of the legislative strike, and the plan of obtaining policy victories without offering any policy concessions, has enjoyed general agreement within the party.

Had we had more time I would have explained to the former Speaker something he surely already knows: The Affordable Care Act was duly enacted by a majority of both houses of Congress, signed into law by the President, and even upheld by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of the United States does not allow a majority of the House of Representatives to repeal the law of the land by de-funding it (and threatening to close the entire government, or default on the nation’s full faith and credit, if the Senate and the President don’t come around).



If that were permissible, no law on the books would be safe. A majority of the House could get rid of unemployment insurance, federal aid to education, Social Security, Medicare, or any other law they didn’t like merely by deciding not to fund them.

So now teabaggers want to repeal ACA by defunding it backed by shutdown. Robert Reich explained to New Gingrich why our constitutional system does not allow repeal by defunding a law . Rather, the constitutional process to repeal a law requires both houses to enact a new bill that repeals the old and then President Obama must sign it:The MSM characterize the teabaggers' conduct as a ""GOP shutdown strategy."" Polling concludes that ""American Voters Reject GOP Shutdown Strategy."" Some GOP members say shutting down the government over Obamacare is a bad strategy

Words matter. The GOP teabaggers' conduct violates the oath of office and the Constitution. Their conduct is unlawful. Not a political strategy that gives them cover as if this were politics as usual.

As Robert Reich stated:



The Republicans who are now running the House of Representatives are pushing a dangerous new constitutional doctrine. They must be stopped. There should be no compromising with fanatics.

Indeed, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called implementing ACA a ""criminal act."" Right. Implementing the law of the land is criminal, trying to repeal or defund the law by unconstitutional means is just permissible political strategy."

“Ultimately, Secretary Sebelius will testify,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, told “Fox News Sunday.”

Sebelius and the entire Obama administration has declined requests to testify on Capitol Hill about the site, which has been plagued by crashes, slow responses and other glitches since it went online Oct. 1.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter directly to Sebelius last week asking her to testify Thursday on the matter.

Sebelius has yet to respond publicly, but reportedly plans to attend a gala the night before in Boston, which has fueled calls for resignation.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he’s “reluctant” to call for an immediate dismissal in such situations, but was critical of Sebelius for so far not agreeing to testify.

“Her refusal to testify and be transparent has undermined her credibility,” he told Fox News, adding her not testifying could lead to her resignation.

House investigators say they want to know whether officials involved in the website “didn’t know or didn’t disclose” problems, after repeatedly saying the site was “on track” to launch.

Though the White House said this weekend that 476,000 people have applied online for health insurance, officials have yet to say how many people have bought a policy.

Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told Fox News that Sebelius’ position appears “unsustainable.”

“She cannot sustain it,” he said. “She’ll have to testify.”

Commerce committee Chairman Fred Upton began focusing on Secretary Sebelius after she went to Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” last week to talk about the website.

“Secretary Sebelius had time for Jon Stewart, and we expect her to have time for Congress,” the Michigan Republican has repeatedly said."
http://news.yahoo.com/whats-whats-nations-health-plan-195549940.html,,[],"What's in, what's out in the nation's health plan","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years ago, candidate Barack Obama stood before Iowa voters and unveiled a plan designed to extend health care to all Americans.

""We can do this,"" he said with confidence. ""The time has come for universal, affordable health care in America.""

Three years ago, President Barack Obama signed into law a plan designed to extend coverage to more than 30 million uninsured people.

""This is what change looks like,"" he exulted.

Not so fast.

Obama's message now boils down to this: Be patient, not yet, adjust your expectations.

A look at how the scope of Obama's health-care plan has narrowed in recent years:

PUBLIC OPTION? Never mind.

Obama once trumpeted the idea of providing a public option in health care, in essence a government-run plan that would be one of many choices for people seeking affordable care. That idea, popular with liberals but opposed by conservatives and many moderates, never made it into the health-care law. In the quest for a workable compromise, Obama deemed it expendable.

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE? Buh-bye.

When the president signed his health-care plan into law, it included a proposal to provide basic long-term care insurance at an affordable cost. Before the program ever got off the ground, though, the administration ditched it last spring for fear it would turn into a financial drain. It could take be years before lawmakers to tackle the issue again.

COVERAGE FOR THE NEEDIEST? Not in every state.

The law envisioned millions of the neediest Americans gaining health insurance by enrolling in Medicaid, with coverage starting in January. But the Supreme Court threw a wrench in that plan last year when it gave states the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion plan. Because of Republican opposition in many states, it looks like nearly 2 in 3 of those who would qualify for new Medicaid coverage may be out of luck because their state lawmakers have not agreed to expand the program.

WHAT ABOUT WORKERS? A longer wait.

Story continues

The law requires companies with 50 or more workers to offer affordable coverage to full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties. Originally, that requirement was supposed to take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. But now the administration is pushing that requirement back a year, citing the complexity of the undertaking. Most medium and large business already offer health insurance. Those most likely to be affected by the delay: low-wage workers at hotels, restaurants and stores.

WHAT'S LEFT? Plenty.

Starting next year individuals will be required to carry health insurance or face fines. People who are uninsured will be able to shop for affordable coverage through online marketplaces. Middle-class people who don't have coverage through their jobs will use the marketplace to apply for tax credits to help pay their premiums. Low-income people will be steered to the Medicaid expansion — if their state participates. Insurance companies will be required to accept people regardless of their medical problems. A number of other changes already have taken effect, including a provision that allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and a ban on lifetime limits on insurance coverage.

After letting his listeners know that Bashir said on his MSNBC show that Palin deserved this “dose of discipline” a Jamaican slave master leveled on his slaves, Levin said Bashir likely had delivered the “most disgraceful rant” yet against Palin.

“Hey tough guy. You like picking on women? You like picking on a mother and a grandmother?” Levin said to Bashir. “You strike me as not tough at all, if you get my drift.”

Levin then blasted the “pathetic little carbon footprint called MSNBC” for being so “offended with Palin” comparing the federal debt to slavery that they would allow such rants. He said the network should be called the “animal channel” or the “comedy channel.”

Levin said Palin was exactly right to compare the federal debt to slavery and nothing was offensive about it, since she was not making a comparison to chattel slavery.

Levin then said “his people,” the “Jewish people,” were slaves, and he did not for one minute think Palin’s comparison was made to “diminish Jewish people or the early days of the nation.”

Levin then called out women’s group like the National Organization for Women (NOW) for “never” coming to the defense of conservative women like Palin.

Levin said these groups never defend conservative women from misogyny, even when it takes a turn towards the vile and filthy, because “they are not feminist groups. They are left-wing groups. They don’t care about women. They care about left-wing women.”

He said groups like NOW would “worship” Palin if she were a left-wing politician."

Peters'],Senators Make Bipartisan Push for Mental Health Care,"WASHINGTON — While the Senate has been consumed with a divisive debate over expanded background checks for gun buyers, lawmakers have been quietly working across party lines on legislation that advocates say could help prevent killers like Adam Lanza, the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., massacre, from slipping through the cracks.

Proponents say the plans, which stand a good chance of being included in any final gun-control bill, would lead to some of the most significant advancements in years in treating mental illness and address a problem that people on both sides of the issue agree is a root cause of gun rampages. Unlike the bitter disagreements that have characterized efforts to limit access to guns, the idea of improving mental health unites Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural, blue state and red state.

“This is a place where people can come together,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, who has worked with some of the Senate’s most conservative Republicans on a piece of mental health legislation. “As we’ve listened to people on all sides of the gun debate, they’ve all talked about the fact that we need to address mental health treatment. And that’s what this does.”

The issue also appeals to members of Congress in another important way: it serves as a political refuge for Republicans and more conservative Democrats who are eager to offer a federal response to the shootings in Connecticut and Aurora, Colo., but have no interest in taking any action that could be seen as infringing on constitutional gun rights."

The budget is slated to be released on April 10, the same day Obama is having yet another charm offensive dinner with Senate Republicans. Because this strategy has been working so well for him.

According to the WSJ,



Such a proposal could include steps that make many Democrats queasy, such as reductions in future Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security payments, but also items resisted by Republicans, such as higher taxes through limits on tax breaks, people close to the White House said. [...] Including entitlement curbs would be notable, as Republicans often have criticized the White House for offering such steps in private negotiations but never fully embracing them as part of an official budget plan.

Well, since Republicans are criticizing him for not fully and officially embracing his desire to cut benefits to the poor and elderly, by all means he has to make the offer. Included in that, reportedly, is the chained CPI for Social Security and an idea from Eric Cantor for restructuring Medicare that would combine Medicare’s coverage for hospitals and doctor services, creating a single deductible that could increase out-of-pocket costs.

But here's just one rub in the plan:



But several liberal allies, some of whom advise White House officials, said Republicans could seize on the White House-endorsed spending cuts and try to implement them into law without any of the tax increases. That would put the White House in the uncomfortable position of opposing spending cuts it formally endorsed in its own budget.

That should be considered a certainty, rather than a possibility. That goes along with the certainty that Republicans are going to use an official White House proposal to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits in 2014 to run against Democrats. Republicans aren't engaging in any of the budget negotiations in good faith. They didn't do so in Obama's first term, and they have no intention to do so now, regardless of the 2012 election.

The Senate has rejected a chained CPI for Social Security, but that vote was non-binding. All those Democratic senators who voted against it need to take their opposition to the White House and tell President Obama that he will not have their votes.

Send an email to President Obama and congressional leadership telling them to strengthen Social Security instead of cutting it.

Fareed speaks with Steven Brill, founder of Court TV and The American Lawyer magazine, and David Goldhill, author of ‘Catastrophic Care: How American Health Care Killed My Father – and How We Can Fix It,’ about the problems with America’s health care system.

How would you change it?

Goldhill: Well, what I'm seeking is a balance, right? What we've done is all the way in this direction, in fact, further than almost any country on Earth, believe it or not, in reducing the amount of skin consumers have in the game.

But the problem isn't just money. The problem is the way the health care sectors compete now…we have a non-functioning price system in health care. Prices are not cost. They never have been. Their prices may make no sense by any normal economic means. It is to remove the consumer from the equation.

Consumers don't exercise power through leverage. They don't have leverage in any market. You don't have leverage in the cell phone market. Or the personal computer market or the home building market. We never have leverage. That's things that people say in health care they don't say in anything else. It's the competition for consumers that drives good behavior. And in health care, everything we've done has been to reduce competition.

So how could, I mean this seems like a point of agreement, where you talk...



Brill: Sure.

…so much about local monopolies, about the lack of competition, that the reason you can have this kind of price-gouging which you described is because you have all these local monopolies.

Brill: That's right. And the first part of the solution is complete transparency as to pricing so that…you have an instance where consumers have a choice, they have some kind of an informed choice. But if I'm right, and you need insurance – and they don't need to have 100 percent of the skin in the game – you need to balance the market out so that the insurers or whoever else is buying on behalf of the patient has some degree of leverage.

More from GPS: Why we need to fix health care

And I do think it is leverage. I think if I walk out of this building today and decide I'm going to buy a new cell phone, the leverage I have is at least knowing, a) that if it's way too expensive for all cell phones, I don't have to buy one, I will live another day…And b) there are lots of people who will sell me different kinds of cell phones at a different price.

I think that that is power and that is leverage. And that is completely missing from the health care economy today.

I think the one point of agreement is we, in the United States, have a kind of almost the worst of all worlds.

Brill: We've tried this really ridiculous experiment where we've left it, you know, completely to market forces, except that what's usual in a market is that there are two sides of the equation, the buyer and the seller. Here, the market forces only work for the seller. And the result is, we've lived in sort of an alternate universe over the last 10 years, where, you know, the rest of the country, the economy hasn't been so good, in case you haven't noticed, for the last half decade.

But the health care economy is just a totally different planet. Everybody is making more and more money. You know, the salaries are ridiculously high. The profit margins keep going up. The salaries of the people who run the drug companies and the hospitals keep going up. And it's all at the expense of the rest of us.

A final word…



Goldhill: Our heart may be in the right place, but we're not just hurting ourselves and our pocketbook. We're genuinely hurting our health. We've unleashed a flood of excess care that is dangerous and unsafe. All health care is not alike, but we treat it all like it's alike."

Advocacy groups had lobbied hard for the Medicaid expansion, and Democrats in the Legislature applauded it.

But it also reflected Mr. Christie’s national ambitions and his continued push to present himself as a different kind of Republican — one who could teach Washington a thing or two about bipartisanship. He talked about how he had “turned Trenton upside down” in his first three years, ending what he described as the tax-and-spend ways of his Democratic predecessors. His proposed budget of $32.9 billion is an increase of about 4 percent over the one approved last year, but he emphasized that the state will spend less than it did in the 2008 fiscal year.

Accepting federal money for Medicaid, he said, would save the state $227 million in the fiscal year that begins in July. Earlier this month, the governor showed his opposition to the health care law when he declined to establish a state-run exchange to allow people to buy health insurance, insisting that the federal government would have to do it.

Under the new law, the federal government pays the full cost of Medicaid expansion for the first three years, and 90 percent of the cost after that. The governor said in his speech that he would end the expansion if, “because of adverse actions by the Obama administration,” it no longer made fiscal sense.

Still, the partial embrace by one of the country’s most prominent Republicans was a boost to the president’s health care program. It came a week after Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a former health care executive, reversed his previous position and joined a number of Republican governors taking federal money to expand Medicaid. The Supreme Court ruled last year that though the law was constitutional, states could choose not to expand their programs."

Some lawmakers want to fill the gap by redefining who can provide healthcare.

They are working on proposals that would allow physician assistants to treat more patients and nurse practitioners to set up independent practices. Pharmacists and optometrists could act as primary care providers, diagnosing and managing some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high-blood pressure.

“We’re going to be mandating that every single person in this state have insurance,” said state Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate Health Committee and leader of the effort to expand professional boundaries. “What good is it if they are going to have a health insurance card but no access to doctors?”

Hernandez’s proposed changes, which would dramatically shake up the medical establishment in California, have set off a turf war with physicians that could contribute to the success or failure of the federal Affordable Care Act in California.

Doctors say giving non-physicians more authority and autonomy could jeopardize patient safety. It could also drive up costs, because those workers, who have less medical education and training, tend to order more tests and prescribe more antibiotics, they said.

“Patient safety should always trump access concerns,” said Dr. Paul Phinney, president of the California Medical Assn.

Such “scope-of-practice” fights are flaring across the country as states brace for an influx of patients into already strained healthcare systems. About 350 laws altering what health professionals may do have been enacted nationwide in the last two years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since Jan. 1, more than 50 additional proposals have been launched in 24 states.

As the nation’s earliest and most aggressive adopter of the healthcare overhaul, California faces more pressure than many states. Diana Dooley, secretary of the state Health and Human Services Agency, said in an interview that expanding some professionals’ roles was among the options policymakers should explore to help meet the expected demand.

At a meeting of healthcare advocates in December, she had offered a more blunt assessment.

“We’re going to have to provide care at lower levels,” she told the group. “I think a lot of people are trained to do work that our licenses don’t allow them to.”

Currently, just 16 of California’s 58 counties have the federal government’s recommended supply of primary care physicians, with the Inland Empire and the San Joaquin Valley facing the worst shortages. In addition, nearly 30% of the state’s doctors are nearing retirement age, the highest percentage in the nation, according to the Assn. of American Medical Colleges.

Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and optometrists agree that they have more training than they are allowed to use.

“We don’t have enough providers,” said Beth Haney, president of the California Assn. for Nurse Practitioners, ""...so we should increase access to the ones that we have.”

Hernandez, who said he would introduce his legislation and hold a hearing on the issue next month, said his own experience as an optometrist shows the need to empower more practitioners. He said he often sees Medicaid patients who come to his La Puente practice because they have failed their vision test at the DMV. Many complain of constant thirst and frequent urination.

“I know it’s diabetes,” he said. But he is not allowed to diagnose or treat it and must refer those patients elsewhere. Many of them may face a months-long wait to see a doctor.

The California Medical Assn. says healthcare professionals should not exceed their training. Phinney, a pediatrician, said physician assistants and other mid-level professionals are best deployed in doctor-led teams. They can perform routine exams and prescribe medications in consultation with physicians on the premises or by teleconference.

Allowing certain health workers to set up independent practices would create voids in the clinics, hospitals and offices where they now work, he said. “It’s more like moving the deck chairs around rather than solving the problem,” Phinney said.

His group proposes a different solution: It wants more funding to expand participation in a loan repayment program for recent medical school graduates. Doctors can now receive up to $105,000 in return for practicing in underserved communities for three years.

Still, it typically takes a decade to train a physician. Health experts say the pool of graduates cannot keep pace.

“We’re not going to produce thousands of additional doctors in any kind of short-term time frame,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento). “It makes sense to look at changes that could relieve the pressure that we’re going to undoubtedly encounter for access to care.”

Administrators of community clinics and public hospitals say nurse practitioners and other non-physician providers already play key roles in caring for patients, a trend they predict will grow as more Californians become insured and enter the healthcare system.

At Kern Medical Center in Kern County, two clinical pharmacists have run the hospital’s diabetes clinic, treating about 500 patients a year, since the specialist physician in charge retired. They are licensed to perform physicals, order lab tests, prescribe medicines and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

“We’re going to have to get a whole lot more creative about how care is provided,” said Paul Hensler, Kern Medical Center’s chief executive.

Updated 6:23 p.m. ET, 12/31/2013

Washington (CNN) - A group of Catholic organizations, in an emergency appeal on Tuesday, asked the Supreme Court to delay the Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups provide contraception and ""abortion-inducing drug"" coverage to their workers.

Archdioceses in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Michigan - along with affiliated groups that include Catholic University - asked Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan to block enforcement of the employer mandates under the Affordable Care Act set to take effect on Wednesday.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The issue has been a major sticking sticking point with religious groups and private for-profit companies that have strong moral objections.

Under final rules negotiated between the administration and a variety of outside groups, churches and houses of worships are exempt from the mandate.

But other non-profit religious-affiliated groups like church-run hospitals and parochial schools must either provide no-cost contraception coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement.

""Tomorrow, applicants (the Catholic organizations] will be forced to choose between onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong,"" according to the court filing from the groups.

""Just as an individual may be held accountable for aiding and abetting a crime he did not personally commit, so too may a Catholic violate the moral law in certain circumstances by cooperating in the commission by others of acts contrary to Catholic beliefs.

""For some, religion provides an essential source of guidance both about what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree to which those who assist others in committing wrongful conduct themselves bear moral culpability,"" the groups said.

There was no indication when Roberts, Kagan or the high court as a whole would rule.

The appeal came after the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville pressed President Barack Obama on the issue.

He asked Obama in a letter that went further than the appeal to Roberts and Kagan to exempt some businesses and religious-affiliated institutions from enforcement of the mandate - through fines - until the Supreme Court rules on the matter.

He pointed to other delays the administration has made in the law, such as putting off until 2015 the requirement for all employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage.

But Kurtz notes that ""an employer who chooses, out of charity and good will, to provide"" health insurance for employees can still face fines if that employer does not want to comply with the contraception requirement.

""In effect, the government seems to be telling employees that they are better off with no employer health plan at all than with a plan that does not cover contraceptives,"" he writes.

The letter represents a major first act by Kurtz, who was elected president of the bishops' conference in November, succeeding Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.

The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations who say their religious liberty is violated by the law.

Among the plaintiffs is Hobby Lobby, Inc. nationwide chain of about 500 arts and crafts stores.

At issue is whether private companies can refuse to do so on the claim it violates their religious beliefs.

The privately held company does not object to funding all forms of contraception – such as condoms and diaphragms – for their roughly 13,000 employees, which Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths.

The Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, said in court filings they object to contraceptives like the morning after pill, which they would say constitutes abortion and violates their faith.

Hobby Lobby calculated that their refusal to provide the coverage could result in a fine of up to $1.3 million daily.

The White House said in November that it believes a requirement on contraceptives is ""lawful and essential to women's health.""

Days after opponents of Obamacare failed to derail it by shutting down the government, a federal court in Washington took up a lawsuit aimed at canceling the premium subsidies the law provides for many low- and moderate-income Americans. It’s the first of two such challenges to reach the federal courts this month, and it illustrates — again — how some of the law’s critics are trying to repeal it by inflicting the maximum possible damage on the public. The courts should reject the challenges.

At issue is the Internal Revenue Service’s decision in May 2012 to make premium subsidies available in all 50 states for individuals with incomes less than four times the federal poverty level, currently $11,490 for a one-person household. In the case heard Monday in Washington, the plaintiffs argue that the IRS exceeded its legal authority because the text of the law calls for subsidies to be provided only “through an exchange established by the state.”

In their view, that means there should be no subsidies available in the more than 30 states where officials decided to let the federal government operate the exchange. It would also mean that employers in those states would not face a mandate to provide coverage, because that requirement is inextricably linked to the availability of subsidies. (The administration announced in August that it would not enforce the employer mandate until 2015.)

The Justice Department argues persuasively that the plaintiffs — four self-employed individuals and three businesses that do not want to buy or provide the required amount of insurance next year — misread the law. Congress clearly intended that the new exchanges help all uninsured Americans, regardless of who runs their state’s version. It also defies credulity to argue that Congress would require some poorer Americans to buy insurance without subsidies simply because their elected officials weren’t able or willing to set up an exchange. Most important, it would be wrong to reverse the IRS’ stance now, long after state officials decided not to operate their own exchanges. At the very least, the stakes should have been clear to the public and their representatives before they made that choice.

A preliminary ruling in the first case is expected as soon as Tuesday. If the courts involved don’t dismiss these challenges soon, millions of Americans could be at risk of receiving subsidies that must later be repaid, or of being denied the aid they need to afford the coverage required by law. Ideally, Congress would clarify the law to remove any doubt about the premium subsidies. But if lawmakers aren’t willing to do so, they should at least be prepared to restore them swiftly if the courts rule the other way."

WASHINGTON -- Contrary to the cliché, there are second acts in politics. They just don’t usually come two months after the first.



On Nov. 30, the Obama administration will have a second chance to showcase its capacity to administer a website and oversee health care reform. Senior officials in the administration are quick to insist that the date is merely a point on a calendar, not a moment when a switch is suddenly flipped and all the problems surrounding Obamacare disappear.



But as a political matter, they also understand the scrutiny that comes after Nov. 30 will be heightened, and the stakes a bit higher. More than one administration official over the course of reporting this article said they fully expect that the first time a consumer encounters an error message on the website on Dec. 1, it will be used as a cudgel by the critics. Senate aides, meanwhile, say it's unclear how long a leash up-for-reelection Democrats would give the president should problems persist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) may not be able to keep legislation reforming the Affordable Care Act off the floor absent major, tangible improvements.

And so, as they enter , White House aides and ideological allies are taking steps to avoid repeating the disastrous first one.

""We are better prepared because the site is a better site,"" said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss post-Nov. 30 plans. ""We have visibility into the site, what’s happening with it, how many consumers are coming. It is vastly improved. It will allow us to adapt our tactics and tools to reach consumers in real time. And now, people all across the country have enrolled and we will continue to make sure their stories are told. It is different when you have lots of people enrolled as opposed to day one, when you had some people trying to enroll and who were stuck.""

On a technological level, the administration is far ahead of where it stood on Oct. 1 -- an important but hardly remarkable feat considering how bad things were two months ago. Medicare spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that as of the end of November, approximately 50,000 users will be able to use HealthCare.gov concurrently, which will be the equivalent of more than 800,000 during a day.

If user interest exceeds those numbers, the administration has set up “a customer-friendly queuing system which would notify you when to come back to the site and sort of be first in line,” Jeff Zients, President Barack Obama’s point man for rebuilding the website, told reporters in a Tuesday roundtable.

The White House also hired a general contractor to set up a command center in Columbia, Md., that functions as a 24/7 monitoring and incident response team. The center, which is staffed by 25 people with different areas of expertise in web technology, will work with the White House to troubleshoot and react to incidents that may occur on healthcare.gov, in real-time.

The better the website works, the logic goes, the easier it will be to manage the politics. But even so, the White House is also making administrative adjustments to HealthCare.gov in order to avoid a repeat the agony of those early October days.

One (perhaps the only) unforeseen benefit of the website's disastrous rollout was that interest didn't wane as much as expected over the course of October. In addition to the stream of consumers looking to buy insurance, people wanted to see what the fuss was about -- like drivers who can't help looking at the car wreck across the freeway. So the administrators of the site got a healthy sense of when traffic peaks (around lunchtime) and when it lulls (the weekend). Looking forward, that data will allow them to help keep the number of visits to the site relatively steady.

Hoping to manage Nov. 30th expectations, the administration has already told private insurers to hold back on advertising the exchanges, worrying that heavy traffic could overwhelm the servers. Allies in the progressive community, meanwhile, say they've been told to wait for word from the administration before sending out sign-up alerts to their email lists.

Already, there has been evidence of some success in micromanaging the traffic flow. According to a 39-page “recess toolkit” put together by the White House for Democrats on the Hill, which was shared by an aide with The Huffington Post, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services was able to invite back, in clusters, nearly 275,000 consumers who had problems during the account creation process in early October. Of those who returned to the site, 92 percent successfully created an account on HealthCare.gov.

Another Democratic Hill aide said the White House is expected to step up its consumer education and outreach in early December, particularly focusing on the 18-to-35-year-old demographic. Next week, for instance, the White House is planning a youth summit to ensure that young leaders understand the benefits of the health care law and help get the word out among their peers. That comes on top of the administration’s ongoing efforts to enlist athletes and celebrities to engage with youth on the law’s benefits.

The White House is also trying to make it easier for Democratic lawmakers to go on offense this time around. In addition to the sending them home for the Thanksgiving recess with a 54-page packet of Affordable Care Act sign-up “success stories,” broken down by all 50 states, administration officials are encouraging Democrats to talk about a new report released by the White House Council of Economic Advisors showing how Obamacare is helping to slow health care costs, in turn helping the economy.

Despite these steps, Democrats in and out of office have a hard time evincing much confidence that the political troubles caused by health care reform will dissipate quickly. Some are hopeful but not yet sold that the administration can successfully manage the next few months after being stunned by the ineptitude they exhibited around the website's launch.

""The website is getting better but it's not fixed,"" said one Democratic lawmaker. ""Don't even get me started on talking points. They should use the time they spend writing useless talking points fixing the website.""

Even the administration acknowledges that success on Dec. 1 means that the website will function for some 80 percent of users. And with 20 percent still in the dark, critical focus will continue -- a scary proposition for many Democrats. One party operative who works on health care reform said that it remains a mystery as to how to respond to accusations that the president misled the public when he pledged that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them.

""If there are good talking points around that, I haven't heard them,"" the operative said.

Several other operatives, when interviewed for this piece, marveled at how the administration ""lost"" traditional media allies during the October rollout.

Winning them back has proven difficult, though the White House is far better prepared for the media wars now than it was on Oct. 1. A Democratic aide familiar with White House strategy said the administration has given assurances that it will have a beefed-up, rapid-response operation to address new attacks or incorrect stories. They certainly have more manpower.



""You have to remember what happened on Oct. 1,"" said the health care reform operative. ""There was a government shutdown. All the people who would have been part of the rapid response team were furloughed. That lasted for 16 days.""

During the early weeks of October, nearly all the White House staffers chiefly responsible for pushing back against bad press and spreading good health care news were off the job. Eric Schultz, a White press official who worked during the shutdown and has health care reform under his portfolio, was so preoccupied with the shutdown that he was seen running the president's remarks to the podium -- a task usually reserved for a junior staffer.

""The shutdown wasn’t the root cause of the problem,"" commented one administration official, ""but it sure as hell didn’t help.""

Consider the fate of William White, the Washington, D.C. Insurance Commissioner, who voiced skepticism about President Obama’s hastily assembled “fix” for the millions losing their insurance policies.

A day after suggesting that the new demands on insurers could destabilize the marketplace and lead to even higher premiums, White was canned.

Telling the truth about ObamaCare is risky.

Remember the manhandling of Congressional Budget Office head Douglas Elmendorf? When the supposedly neutral bean counters undertook the first analysis of ObamaCare ’s fiscal impact, their preliminary findings threatened to undermine the happy talk flowing from the White House. Elmendorf was summoned to a parlay with the president, who doubtless explained how the budget gurus might amend their analysis, as a patriotic duty.

[pullquote]

Not long after, budget chief Peter Orszag issued a further warning to the CBO, saying it should guard against “exaggerating costs and underestimating savings.”

Any surprise that the cost estimates from the CBO have made generous assumption -- underestimating the number of Americans to receive subsidies and who will be added to Medicaid roles? I will guarantee that as this bill takes hold, costs will exceed those projected by the CBO.

Pity the poor insurance companies (if you can.) Hauled into the White House only after the president decided to live up to his promise that Americans could keep their existing insurance, they were effectively thrown under the ObamaCare bus.

Now it’s their problem that millions have lost policies that did not comply with ACA mandates; they will either figure out a way to undo the work of the past three years in just a few weeks or will be battered – ”bad apples indeed!” -- by a defensive White House. Photos of that gathering reveal the president lecturing on the benefits of the temporary do-over, while industry executives glumly take their medicine.

They have seen how this White House functions. Early in ObamaCare ’s sorrowful struggle, insurers like Anthem Blue Cross in California dared whisper the truth – that they were forced to raise rates because of the ACA mandates. The company found itself targeted by the president on a “60 Minutes” segment, and then required to justify its rate-setting by HHS head Kathleen Sibelius, who also demanded the firm explain where the increased revenues would be spent – an unheard-of intrusion.

Sibelius also went after America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a national trade association, demanding that they stop “using scare tactics and misinformation to falsely blame premium increases for 2011” on the ACA. She also threatened “there will be zero tolerance for this type of misinformation…”

Insurers must be scared to death. They’ve seen what can happen when a collaborator – like one-time golden boy Jamie Dimon – turns foe. The president once called JP Morgan CEO Dimon “one of the country’s smartest bankers” – but that was before the former Obama supporter went public in his disdain for what he called the White House’s “constant attack on business.”

Hitting back at Obama’s “fat cat” anti-bank rhetoric, Dimon dismissed as “ridiculous” the government’s investigation into oil price speculators, and charged that the inquiries into the bank’s “London Whale” trade were a “tempest in a teapot.” He should have known better.

Now the bank – one of the few that didn’t need TARP but was required to take it -- is the subject of numerous wide-ranging investigations and has been hit with unprecedented fines and demands for admission of wrong-doing. Lost in the witch-hunt has been the reality that the government’s charges of mortgage misbehavior mainly stem from the activities of Washington Mutual, the largest bank ever to fail in the U.S.

In 2008 Morgan was pressed by regulators to buy the failed thrift, which otherwise could have brought down the country’s bank insurance program at an especially fragile moment. Dimon’s willingness to act earned unusual praise at the time from FDIC head Sheila Bair, who said “Some are coming to Washington for help, others are coming to help.” That was then – before he started sounding off about President Obama’s policies. Bank analyst Dick Bove may have been right when he wrote, “the United States government has made it a priority to break this company.”

You don’t have to be a large corporation – or be located in Washington – to be scared of the Obama administration. The tone set by the White House has percolated down, spreading fear throughout the country. The IRS targeting of conservatives came out of Cincinnati, though it appears to have received the blessing of the White House. Any place where the Obama liberal pro-union agenda meets opposition – such as in Wisconsin – is fair game.

The Wall Street Journal reported recently on a special prosecutor’s assault – including subpoenas and dawn home raids -- on conservative organizations that opposed the recall campaign against labor nemesis Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin. This frightening account – sounding more like what takes place in Beijing than in Madison - should send a chill through every American.

But - the White House is especially quick to chase down those critical of the president’s signature healthcare bill. Even Edie Sundby, the stage-four cancer patient who dared to recount in an op-ed how she lost her insurance, courtesy of the ACA, came under attack. Instead of the stage props usually positioned behind the president as he invokes the wonders of ObamaCare , here was a real person with a real ailment whose prospects were seriously threatened by the new insurance mandates.

No less a personage than White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out a rebuttal to Ms. Sundby’s narrative, referencing a piece that blamed United Healthcare instead of the ACA. As it happens, Ms. Sundby’s take is the correct one; but for ObamaCare , her insurance would be intact.

Pretty small beans to attract the attention of the White House. But, when your signature law is a colossal failure, doesn’t make economic sense and threatens your much ballyhooed “legacy,” silencing the critics becomes a full-time job."
http://news.yahoo.com/canceled-u-health-plans-disruptive-part-reform-cigna-041400229--finance.html,,[],Canceled U.S. health plans are disruptive part of reform: Cigna CEO,"By Caroline Humer (Reuters) - The hundreds of thousands of Americans whose individual insurance policies will be canceled as Obamacare takes full effect next year are experiencing a disruptive element of healthcare reform, the head of health insurer Cigna said on Thursday. In the past week, reports of pending plan cancellations have become a political problem for President Barack Obama, who promised years ago as he was pushing to pass the healthcare law that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them. While that remains true for most people with insurance, a small percentage of the 17 million Americans with individual policies are now getting notice that they will terminate next year because they do not comply with new benefits required by Obamacare. Many insurers are offering new, compliant policies to replace those that are expiring, but they may be significantly more expensive. Nearly half of U.S. consumers with individual health plans are also expected to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance on new state exchanges under Obamacare. ""When you are that individual who has a benefit plan and it's working for you and your family at your current life stage and you are told that you no longer have that choice, that's disruptive and that's the environment that as a country we are going through right now,"" Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview. Cigna had about 232,000 people in individual policies at the end of September, according to company filings. Competitor WellPoint Inc, which operates 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses including the Anthem and Empire brands, has about 1.8 million people in individual plans. Aetna Inc, which bought smaller insurer Coventry earlier this year, has 650,000 members in these plans and will drop about 50,000 members when it exits the California market at the end of this year. In defending the healthcare law on Wednesday, Obama said it was not to blame for the plan cancellations, and that the real fault lies with ""bad apple"" insurers who were allowed to sell cut-rate policies that offered minimal coverage for people when they needed them the most. Cordani declined to comment on Obama's remarks, but noted that individual plans have been subjected to numerous new requirements under the law. States determine the minimum eligible benefits and there are federal requirements, so in some states elements such as the size of the deductible could disqualify an individual plan for 2014. ""It's as simple as that,"" he said. WellPoint and Aetna declined to comment on specifics about policy cancellations or about the president's comments. Cordani said that Cigna has a small individual insurance business and is not significantly impacted by needing to cancel these plans. In addition, it has about 125,000 employer-sponsored plans that will end on January 1, 2014 because they do not comply with the law. These plans typically targeted seasonal or hourly workers, he said, and it was clear from when the health reform law was passed in 2010 that they were going away.

States enforce this law, with their own laws and policies added in, differently in every state. But the general principle is there. Up until now the usual consequence has been things like this: Medicaid puts a lien on the house of someone in a nursing facility who has run out of money, and after they die, the heirs find they have to buy the house back from the state if they want it.

We haven't had lots of people younger than 65 on Medicaid, because in most states simply earning less than the Federal Poverty Level did not qualify one for Medicaid.

And we haven't had many people with lots of assets on Medicaid, because in most places you have to have less than around $2400 to your name before Medicaid will cover you. You can keep your house and your car, but Medicaid reserves the right to put liens on them and take them when you die.

But now we have the Affordable Care Act, and its expectation that everyone in the lower tier of income will end up in the Medicaid system. To accomplish this, they have dropped the asset test. So now we will have lots of people ages 55-64, who have assets but not a lot of income right now, for whatever reason, on Medicaid.

The kicker of it is, if you make the right amount to qualify for a subsidized health insurance plan, your costs are going to be shared and subsidized by the government. But if you go on Medicaid, you owe the entire amount that Medicaid spends on you from the day you turn 55.

And that amount is not just what is spent on your doctor visits and your treatments, whatever they may be. No, there is also something called a ""capitation charge."" For each enrollee, a base cost is assigned to the entity that administers the program. How much will that charge be? It varies by state, and as far as I can tell by other variables as well, but it could be hundreds of dollars per month, or more. (If you have specific information on this, please do share it!)

How will this play out? No one knows, as far as I can tell. But it is easy to see how this could become a real problem. If someone is low income and goes on Medicaid, will Medicaid put a lien on their house? If they need to sell their house and move, will they then lose all their equity in paying off the lien? Will people get hit with bills and liens for many thousands of dollars, even if they were healthy and hardly ever went to the doctor?

Why is it that Medicaid is pretty much cost free to use up to age 54 if you qualify, and suddenly becomes a collateral loan at age 55, for which a state agency will do its best to collect payment in full for every cost assigned? It seems clear that the Estate Recovery law did not anticipate the current circumstance with the ACA, and that putting the two laws together makes for a terribly unfair situation for some. What can we do to remedy this situation?

The fact that practically no one is talking about this makes me uneasy. (It has been mentioned a few times, for instance the comments section of the diary here.) At the very least what we are getting set up to do is implement an arbitrary, capricious, and regressive tax, that will only be paid by older, low income people. And we are putting this in motion at a time when there are lots of other difficulties to be worked out. I would like to make sure that we are not forgetting those who will find themselves stuck between their need for health coverage and the implications of the Medicaid Estate Recovery laws and programs.

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/states-brace-web-barrage-when-health-reform-goes-live-6C10489606,2013-06-30 16:55:00+00:00,['Sharon Begley'],States brace for web barrage when health reform goes live,"NEW YORK -- About 550,000 people in Oregon do not have health insurance, and Aaron Karjala is confident the state's new online insurance exchange will be able to accommodate them when enrollment under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform begins on October 1.

What Karjala, the chief information officer at ""Cover Oregon,"" does worry about, however, is what will happen if the entire population of Oregon -- 3.9 million -- logs on that day ""just to check it out,"" he said. Or if millions of curious souls elsewhere, wondering if Oregon's insurance offerings are better than their states', log on, causing Cover Oregon to crash in a blur of spinning hourglasses and color wheels and an epidemic of frozen screens.

Multiply that by another 49 states and the District of Columbia, all of which will open health insurance exchanges under ""Obamacare"" that same day, and you get some idea of what could go publicly and disastrously wrong.

Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), could fail for many reasons, including participation by too few of the uninsured and a shortage of doctors to treat those who do sign up. But because its core is government-run marketplaces selling health insurance online, the likeliest reason for failure at the opening bell is information technology snafus, say experts who are helping with the rollout.

Although IT is the single most expensive ingredient of the exchanges, with eight-figure contracts to build them, experts expect bugs, errors and crashes. In April, Obama himself predicted ""glitches and bumps"" when the exchanges open for business.

""This is a 1.0 implementation,"" said Dan Maynard, chief executive of Connecture, a software developer that is providing the shopping and enrollment functions for several states' insurance exchanges. ""From an IT perspective, 1.0's come out with a lot of defects. Everyone is waiting for something to go wrong.""

Two states that intended to build their own exchanges, Idaho and New Mexico, announced this spring that because of the tight timeline and daunting challenges they would have the federal government operate their IT systems.

""Nothing like this in IT has ever been done to this complexity or scale, and with a timeline that put it behind schedule almost before the ink was dry,"" said Rick Howard, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner.

WHAT COLOR WAS YOUR VOLVO?

The potential for problems will begin as soon as would-be buyers log onto their state exchange. They'll enter their name, birth date, address and other identifying information. Then comes the first IT handoff: Is this person who she says she is?

To check that, credit bureau Experian will check the answers against its voluminous external databases, which include information from utility companies and banks on people's spending and other history, and generate questions. The customer will be asked which of several addresses he previously lived at, for example, whether his car has one of several proffered license plate numbers, and what color his old Volvo was.

It's similar to the system that verifies identity for accessing personal Social Security information. If someone gets a question wrong, he will be referred to Experian's help desk, and if that fails may be asked to submit documentation to prove he is who he claims to be.

The next step is determining if the customer is eligible for federal subsidies to pay for insurance. She is if she is a citizen and her income, which she will enter, is less than four times the federal poverty level. To verify this, the exchange pings the ""federal data services hub,"" which is being built by Quality Software Services Inc under a $58 million contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

The query arrives at the hub, which does not actually store information, and is routed to online servers at the Internal Revenue Service for income verification and at the Department of Homeland Security for a citizenship check.

The answers must be returned in real time, before the would-be buyer loses patience and logs off. If the reported income doesn't match the IRS's records, the applicant may have to submit pay stubs.

These federal computer systems have never been connected before, so it's anyone's guess how well they'll communicate.

""The challenge for states,"" said Jinnifer Wattum, director of Eligibility and Exchange Solutions at Xerox's government healthcare unit, is that they have to build ""the interfaces needed with the federal data services hub without knowing what this system will look like."" That makes the task akin to making a key for a lock that doesn't exist yet.

CMS's contractors are working to finish the hub, but ""much remains to be accomplished within a relatively short amount of time,"" concluded a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, in June. CMS spokesman Brian Cook said the hub would be ready by September, and that the beta version had been tested for its ability to interact with the exchanges Oregon and Maryland are building.

The federal hub has to verify even more arcane data, such as whether the insurance offered to a buyer through his job is unaffordable, in which case he may qualify for federal subsidies, and whether the buyer is in prison, in which case she is exempt from the mandate to purchase insurance.

If someone's income qualifies him for Medicaid, or his children for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), software has to divert him from the ACA exchange and into those systems. Many of the computers handling Medicaid and CHIP enrollment are, as IT people diplomatically put it, ""legacy systems,"" meaning old, even decades old.

Many are mainframes, lacking the connectivity of cloud computing. They typically process eligibility requests in days, not seconds.

The legacy systems ""rely on daily or weekly batch files to pass information back and forth,"" and often require follow-up phone calls, said Wattum of Xerox, which is working to configure Nevada's exchange so it can interface with the federal hub.

'NO WRONG DOOR'

A ""we'll call you"" message is unacceptable under Obamacare, which has a ""no wrong door"" goal: A buyer must never come to a dead end. If she is diverted to Medicaid, for instance, she must not be required to resubmit information, let alone wait a week for an answer about whether she's now enrolled.

State IT systems must therefore ""be interoperable and integrated with an exchange, Medicaid, and CHIP to allow consumers to easily switch from private insurance to Medicaid and CHIP,"" said an April report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress.

To make all those systems communicate, the state exchanges must either develop entirely new systems or use application programming interfaces (APIs) that work with the legacy systems to exchange data in real time. APIs are programming instructions for accessing Web-based software applications.

GAO's Stan Czerwinski compares the necessary connectivity to adapters that let American electronics work with European outlets.

State officials told the GAO that verifying eligibility, enrolling buyers and interfacing with legacy systems are the most ""onerous"" aspects of developing their exchanges, ""given the age and limited functionality of current state systems.""

A key goal for exchange officials is keeping would-be buyers in the portal so they don't give up and use a state's ACA call center, which could quickly be swamped.

To avoid this, Oregon brought in potential users to test design prototypes, recorded what people did and where they had trouble, and tweaked the consumer interface to make it as user-friendly as possible, said Karjala.

""Even with that, if you have a family of four and you're eligible for a tax credit to offset your premium,"" he said, ""you could be sitting at the computer for a long time.""

What everyone hopes to avoid is a repeat of the early days of the Medicare prescription-drug program in 2006. Some seniors who tried to sign up for a plan were mistakenly enrolled in several, while others had the wrong premium amounts deducted from their Social Security checks.

Another challenge is capacity. Websites regularly crash when too many people try to access them.

""I had no choice but to be extremely conservative"" in estimates of how many simultaneous users Cover Oregon has to be prepared for, Karjala said. ""Building capacity is the only way to avoid the spinning hourglass or the site freezing, so in our performance testing we're seeing what happens if the whole U.S. population came to Cover Oregon to check it out.""

This summer, state exchanges will test their ability to communicate with the federal data hub, whose security frameworks and connectivity protocols are still works in progress. But whether Obamacare 1.0 flies won't be known until the new health plans take effect on January 1. Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates Inc, a consulting firm, said he wouldn't be surprised if some patients showing up at doctors' offices next year with Obamacare policies are told their insurers never heard of them.

Two days from its implementation, little has changed.

Many remain skeptical and confused about the law. Critics are convinced it will curb consumers' choices while plunging the country deeper into debt.

But to millions who can't afford health insurance or were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, the law represents a new hope — both because of its aim to virtually guarantee access to all Americans and the pledge it would rein in spiraling health care costs.

The law, known colloquially by both detractors and supporters as Obamacare, now faces its ultimate test: whether it will work.

Barring an unlikely last-minute derailment in Congress, which may force a federal government shutdown as part of a Republican battle to block the law's implementation, more than 40 million Americans who don't have health insurance will have their first shot at signing up for coverage Tuesday.

Many of them will be doing so for the first time.

""These are our aunts, uncles, grandmas, parents and our neighbors who will now have an opportunity to seek the best health care available, an option they didn't have before,"" said Lee Francis, president and chief executive of Erie Family Health Center, one of the state's largest networks of community heath clinics.

For people who lost their jobs and benefits during the Great Recession, the new coverage offers a chance to regain some security.

""It's a blessing,"" said Debra Douglas, a Far South Side 52-year-old who last year lost her job as a certified nurse's assistant and the health insurance that came with it.

Of the more than 1.6 million uninsured Illinoisans, some 342,000 will be newly eligible for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Nearly 1 million others are expected to qualify for new federal tax credits to help offset the cost of buying private insurance on new health insurance exchanges. State officials expect about 337,000 to sign up in the first year.

Nationwide, the Congressional Budget Office projects that about 7 million will buy coverage for next year through exchanges, online marketplaces where consumers can compare health insurance plans and determine whether they're eligible for federal assistance.

As with many big programs, there have been setbacks.

Late last week, it was made clear that some portions of the system wouldn't be ready. Federal officials said Thursday that small-business and Spanish-language health insurance enrollment services would not begin Tuesday as planned.

That announcement came on the heels of a one-year delay on a mandate that large employers provide coverage to all full-time workers or pay a penalty.

Critics have seized on the stumbles as more proof that the law was ill-conceived, poorly executed and doomed for failure.

State and federal officials acknowledge that the enrollment systems are largely untested — at least with mass audiences. Illinois officials also had warned that a state call center to help guide consumers through the sign-up process might not be ready on time, but said late Saturday that it would.

""This is a very complex operation that we're putting up. We are coming down to the wire on it,"" said Cristal Thomas, one of Gov. Pat Quinn's deputy governors. ""We are sitting here pretty confident that we are launching on Oct. 1. Even if not everything (will have) full functionality, we will have something up and running for people to access.""

But the law itself is no panacea for solving America's problem with the uninsured, who drive up costs for others because they often put off going to the doctor until problems are so severe they must be admitted into the hospital. Those costs then get passed along to taxpayers and people with insurance, who pay higher health care premiums.

Millions of Americans are expected to remain uninsured, including more than 1 million in Illinois, at least in the first year, according to state and federal estimates.

Some of them are expected to knowingly forgo buying coverage and instead pay a less-costly tax penalty. Others, particularly those eligible for free Medicaid coverage, will remain uninsured because they'll remain in the dark about the law or have no immediate health issues that will spur them to sign up.

An estimated 525,000 immigrants living in the state illegally are barred from enrolling.

""It's a big problem,"" said Julie Hamos, director of the Illinois Healthcare and Family Services Department. ""They're going to be the uninsured in our society, and they're still going to be the charity cases in hospitals and clinics. It's very unfortunate because they also need health care.""

Illinois is one of seven states to operate its marketplace in a partnership with the federal government. Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia opted to run their own.

While the Quinn administration sought legislation to authorize setting up its own marketplace, state lawmakers shot down the bill, forcing Illinois into the federal partnership, at least for 2014.

Administration officials say the partnership hamstrung certain efforts, including consumer education and outreach, because federal money that funded those programs came later to Illinois than other states.

""We missed the steps this summer to educate people,"" said Kelly Sullivan, the chief marketing and communications officer for the Get Covered Illinois exchange. Therefore, the state made the decision to delay its advertising and marketing blitz until after the exchanges open and focus on education in the first few weeks.

The effect of the late advertising and marketing effort is apparent in poll after poll showing that a majority of Americans still know little about the law and how they may benefit.

Further adding to the uncertainty is limited information about how much the insurance plans on the exchanges will cost."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/health/racing-to-inform-millions-unaware-of-new-health-coverage.html,2013-04-24 00:00:00,['Robert Pear'],Racing to Inform Millions Unaware of New Health Coverage,"EAST LANSING, Mich. — President Obama and the Democrats passed the 2010 health care law to make medical insurance available to more than 30 million people who do not have it. But with recent studies showing that as many as three-fourths of those people are unaware of their new options, health care providers are joining community organizers and insurance companies in an ambitious effort to spread the word in the six months remaining before the health plans become available.

Here in Michigan, a small army of doctors and nurses, hospital employees, insurance agents and advocates for low-income people is mobilizing for the next phase of this revolution in domestic social policy: finding people who are eligible for health insurance and getting them enrolled.

It will not be an easy task.

The simmering political debate over Mr. Obama’s health care law — which includes an expansion of Medicaid, the government program for low-income people, and the creation of “exchanges” to market subsidized private insurance — makes the work of these foot soldiers more difficult, but also more important.

Michigan is, in many ways, a microcosm of what is going on around the country as people race toward the start of “open enrollment” on Oct. 1."

Bobby Jindal sees the infighting that has seized the GOP in Washington as ""fratricide"" – brother killing brother.

Moderate conservatives have criticized the House Republican strategy of tying the defunding of Obamacare to government spending, the core dispute that has triggered the shutdown.

But Jindal, who last year said Republicans have to ""stop being the stupid party,"" held back.

""I don't even want to engage in Republican fratricide. There are more than enough Republicans fighting each other, going after each other,"" Jindal said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""



The Louisiana governor said it makes sense to repeal and replace Obamacare, but maybe it should be left to Republicans outside the capital. Jindal is chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which is launching a new national program.

""We want to take back the Republican brand from D.C. For too long, we've outsourced it to Washington. We've got 30 Republican governors doing a great job across the state capitals, across the country. The important discussions aren't happening in D.C.,"" said Jindal

New Orleans newspaper The Times-Picayune reported that as of Thursday, only 12 people had signed up for Obamacare in Louisiana state through healthcare.gov. About 20% of the state does not have health insurance. Jindal did not take Obamacare money to expand Medicaid to provide insurance for them.

""The wrong thing to do is to expand the government control,"" said Jindal. ""In my own state, for example, for every uninsured person that would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion, more than one person who would have otherwise had private insurance would then be kicked out or lose that private insurance instead of going to a government-run program. That makes no sense.""

Though Jindal acknowledged some positive aspects of the president's health care law.

""The president was right. There are real problems in health care. I think if you've got a preexisting condition, if you’re trying to buy an individual policy outside the group market, it can be too expensive and may not be available to you,"" he said.

Republicans need to do more than repeat cries to repeal Obamacare, said Jindal

""We need to replace it. I've written extensively on some of the ideas for example, allowing folks to buy insurance across state lines, tax credits and rebates to make it more affordable for those who can’t afford it,"" said Jindal.

Firm also paid doctors to certify clients%27 disability

Committee suggests stronger government presence in disability hearings

Sen. Levin says the problem is fraud%2C not the disability programs themselves

WASHINGTON – A judge, an attorney and a number of doctors pocketed more than $4.5 million by fraudulently ensuring that disability claimants would receive Social Security benefits, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported Monday.

The committee released a report detailing the findings of a two-year investigation into the Huntington, W.Va., Social Security Office of Disability Adjunction and Review.

The investigation found that Eric Conn of the Kentucky-based Conn Law Firm worked in cahoots with an administrative law judge, who had responsibility for ruling on disability claims. The firm received more than $4.5 million from the Social Security Administration in attorney fees for obtaining disability benefits for thousands of claimants whose claims were improperly granted. Conn also compensated doctors up to $650 per case for signing off on medical opinions supporting claimants' disability applications.

The firm declined to comment on the allegations.

The Social Security disability assistance program, which provides more than $200 billion in benefits to nearly 14 million Americans annually, is at risk of running out of funding by 2016, according to the trustees who oversee the program.

""With the clock ticking on the agency's trust fund, some in Congress refuse to acknowledge the disability programs are broken and are in dire need of significant oversight,"" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a doctor and the top Republican on the committee, said in prepared remarks. ""While lawyers, doctors were getting rich by exploiting a broken program, the real victims were the claimants and the American taxpayer.""

The committee recommended that a Social Security Administration professional should represent the government in all disability claims hearings before administrative law judges.

However, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the investigation did not prove the benefits awarded to the claimants were incorrect.

""The point of this hearing is not to attack our disability programs, which play a critical role in the lives of many Americans,"" Levin said, ""but to spotlight the abusive conduct of a group of legal, medical, and judicial professionals exploiting those programs, and recommend measures to prevent similar abuses in the future.""

In 2011, an investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed a previous review that disability decisions made by judges were insufficient 22% of the time nationwide. Judges' decisions were also found to be a result of poor hearing practices and insufficient medical evidence."

Obama made that pledge again and again, both in the run-up to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and in the 2012 campaign — but it was false. Republicans determined to roll back Obamacare have pounded away at this broken promise, even as thousands of Americans have been receiving word that insurers are scrapping their current policies.

“I personally believe — even if it takes a change in the law — the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,” Clinton told the online magazine OZY.



Watch parts 1 and 2 of the exclusive Bill Clinton interview at Ozy.com http://www.ozy.com/c-notes/assessing-the-healthcare-rollout-with-bill-clinton/3639.article



The former president — who riled Obama’s re-election team in June 2012 by praising Mitt Romney’s “sterling business record” — came out on balance as strongly in favor of the health care overhaul.

“The big lesson is that we’re better off with this law than without it,” Clinton said.

The botched rollout of insurance marketplaces known as exchanges, exemplified by the failure of the national website HealthCare.gov, resembles the glitches that hurt Medicare Part D when it came off the line under then-President George W. Bush.

“This happened once before: It happened when President Bush put in the Medicare drug program for seniors, which was not as complicated but had exactly the same problem with the rollout,” Clinton said. “It was a disaster.”

“And they fixed it,” he added.



Asked about his comments, the White House said Clinton was still “explainer in chief” and underlined that Obama was looking at ways to help Americans whose health coverage is being canceled.



“We haven't announced any potential fixes or moves that we might be able to make to address this problem,” press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. But Obama is “very interested in trying to address this problem and looks forward to being presented the options that he might be able to pursue.”



Carney did not rule out a legislative fix — but dismissed a proposal from Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow insurers to keep selling plans that don’t meet Obamacare’s standards.



“We see that as throwing the baby out with the bath water,” the spokesman said.



Currently, the law allows people to stay on those plans as long as they have not changed or been issued since the president signed the measure into law. Obama aides say that allowing insurers to enroll new customers into older, substandard plans would amount to rolling back the Affordable Care Act’s new standards for coverage."

Both the University of Virginia and UPS told their employees recently they are no longer offering spousal coverage to those able to obtain insurance elsewhere; meaning thousands of Americans will no longer be able to choose the benefits they prefer.

UVA said Wednesday this is only one of many “major changes” coming to their health plans as a result of ObamaCare. The university says the changes are necessary because the law is projected to add $7.3 million to the cost of the university’s health plan in 2014 alone.

“The modified plan will provide new options and reward those who participate in wellness programs,” UVA’s Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer Susan Carkeek said in a press release. “But we must make adjustments or face millions of dollars in rising costs, fees and taxes that would be passed along to employees.”

Similarly, UPS partially blamed the new health law for the change, which is estimated to affect roughly 15,000 employee spouses.

The rising cost of health care ""combined with the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, have made it increasingly difficult to continue providing the same level of health care benefits to our employees at an affordable cost,"" UPS said.

The trend has drawn the ire of Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who cite it as a clear example the Obama administration is not following through on its promise that, “if you like your plan, you can keep it.”

“American families who are already grappling with higher health care costs under the law are also coming face-to-face with the stark reality that they will lose the coverage they have and like,” their office said in a statement Wednesday.

The Obama administration would not respond when asked for comment on the UPS’ new policy by Kaiser Health News, but said when Massachusetts implemented a similar health overhaul, employer coverage actually increased.

“The health care law will make health insurance more affordable, strengthen small businesses and make it easier for employers to provide coverage to their workers,” said Joanne Peters, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.

Republican lawmakers say this trend is only one of the concerning effects of ObamaCare, amid reports some companies are citing the law when they reduce employees to part-time hours."

A North Carolina woman featured prominently in a graphic government ad campaign to get people to stop smoking died Monday of cancer.



Terrie Hall died at a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C., federal officials said. She was 53.

""She was a public health hero,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the campaign. ""She may well have saved more lives than most doctors do.""

A former smoker whose voice box was removed years ago, Hall took a leading role in the campaign that showed how smoking-related cancer ravages the body. Officials believe the ""Tips from Former Smokers"" campaign led as many as 100,000 Americans smokers to quit.

Hall's first ad showed her putting on a wig, putting in false teeth and covering a hole in her throat with a scarf. It was the campaign's most popular spot by far, receiving more than 2.8 million views on YouTube.

It was the federal public health agency's largest and starkest anti-smoking push, and its first national advertising effort.

In another ad, the Lexington resident addressed the camera in the buzzing sound of her artificial voice box. She advised smokers to make a video of themselves reading a children's book or singing a lullaby. ""I wish I had. The only voice my grandson's ever heard is this one,"" her electric voice growled.

Hall's oral and throat cancer was caused by the cigarette smoking she began in high school, CDC officials said. This summer, the cancer spread to her brain.

http://live.reuters.com/Event/Politics,,['Reuters Editorial'],U.S. Politics,"In the wake of bruising fights in their own ranks over the ""fiscal cliff"" and aid for victims of superstorm Sandy - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives open a new Congress on Thursday more divided than ever.While their leader, Speaker John Boehner, seems in no danger of losing his position because of the divisions, his ability to speak for his membership in the House appears greatly diminished.That could not come at a worse time for Republicans as they prepare for their next attempt to get more spending cuts out of President Barack Obama. They will try to use the debt ceiling - and Obama's request to raise it - as leverage, as they did in 2011.But if the final days of this Congress were indicative of things to come, Republicans will have a rough time effectively using their majority in the House against Obama, who even Republicans acknowledge is at the top of his game following the Democrat's re-election in November.The fiscal cliff battle to avert steep tax hikes and spending cuts that were due to kick in at the start of this year proved gut-wrenching for Republicans.Obama's demand for a tax hike on the rich challenged a core principle that has guided Republicans for decades: No new taxes. Ever.Yet, late on New Year's night, 85 Republicans in the House did just that, voting to raise income taxes on household income of more than $450,000 a year."

Did you see what happened when everyone was complaining about a website? Single-payer got started in America.

Vermont is using authority granted under the Affordable Care Act to start a single-payer system. Most Americans still don't know what the phrase ""single-payer"" even means. It had little support in Congress in 2009 and Senate ""Democrats"" like Nelson and Lieberman even killed the public option. But, ACA had this sweet little provision that allowed states to set up a single-payer system and now people will see it in action. You know what that means.

As Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) opines, ""The quickest route toward a national health care program will be when individual states go forward and demonstrate that universal and non-profit health care works, and that it is the cost-effective and moral thing to do.”

Oh I know this is hard to swallow. Obama is third-way! He's dismantling the safetynet! A corporatist! He killed the public option!

Whatever else he is, Obama is a President who acts in a thoughtful, deliberate way that the chicken little headlines of the day often miss. As many predicted, ACA is already leading to the kind of transformative progressive change Obama promised. The progressive movement will be responsible for showing the nation how well single-payer works after the Vermont system goes into effect. When public and non-profit insurance becomes the national norm, we'll know where it began."

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']",President Obama’s public self-flogging on the Affordable Care Act,"It’s possible that President Obama felt better after that confessional, hour-plus press conference Thursday.

He had come to publicly flog himself for the disastrous Obamacare website rollout, comparing his role to that of a hapless football team captain: “If I fumble the ball, you know, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So, you know, ultimately I’m the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it.”

He had also come to announce a temporary fix aimed at easing the outrage of many Americans who bought into his demonstrably untrue promise that “if you like your insurance policy you can keep it.”

But it’s hard to imagine that anyone besides his Republican antagonists was comforted by the mea culpa, or the newfound sense of transparency. Disappointed citizens, angry insurance companies, or freaked out Democratic legislators worried about their 2014 prospects probably didn’t feel a whole lot better after the president’s litany of disappointments.

In the course of an hour, he admitted he didn’t know what was going on with the website and that partly may have been due to the “insularity” of the White House. He acknowledged he misled people by promising them they could keep their plans, that it’s not easy to purchase a complicated product like health insurance online, that the federal government is ill-equipped to develop technology systems.

Here are seven issues Obama addressed, taken from a transcript posted by the Washington Post:

1. On why he allowed the Healthcare.gov website to be launched when it was failing internal tests:

“OK. On the website, I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I’m accused of a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.

“So, clearly, we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website. Even a week into it, the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches, as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and we’re still working on them.

“So you know, that doesn’t excuse the fact that they just don’t work, but I think it’s fair to say, no...we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn’t going to work the way it was supposed to, given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website.”

2. On why he told people they could keep their insurance if they liked it:

“With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it, I think, you know, and I’ve said in interviews, that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law but it was insufficient.

3. On what he’s going to do to fix that:

“The other problem that has received a lot of attention concerns Americans who’ve received letters from their insurers that they may be losing the plans they bought in the old individual market, often because they no longer meet the law’s requirements to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs or doctor’s visits....

“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I’m offering an idea that will help do it.

“Already people who have plans that pre-date the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven’t changed. That was already in the law. That’s what’s called a grandfather clause that was included in the law. Today we’re going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect and to people who bought plans since the law took effect....The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014. And Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan.”

4. On why the federal government is so bad at technology systems:

“There aren’t a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options, verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get, communicate with those insurance companies so that they can purchase, make sure that all of it’s verified, right? So there’s just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging.

“And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. You know, this is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board....

“As I said before, our IT systems, how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome, complicated and outdated....On my campaign, I could simply say, who are the best folks out there, let’s get them around a table, let’s figure out what we’re doing and we’re just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals.

“If you’re doing it at the federal government level, you know, you’re going through, you know, 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other and there’s all kinds of law involved. And it makes it more difficult. It’s part of the reason why chronically, federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule.”

5. On underestimating the difficulty of purchasing a complicated product like insurance online:

“What we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. And another mistake that we made, I think, was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and lot of different benefits and plans and -- and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth, and then they’ve also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.

“What we’re doing even as we’re trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler? What can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucrat-ese? Are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need?

Advertisement

“And part of what we’re realizing is that there are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more hand-holding in the application process....

“And you know, buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know, it’s just a much more complicated transaction.”

6. On whether the website problems will be fixed by the end of the month, as promised:

”...On Dec. 1st, Nov. 30th, it will be a lot better, but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems, although I’m sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out.”

Advertisement

7. And, finally--in my view, a bit disingenuously--on why he can’t catch a break:

“Part of this job is, the things that go right, you guys aren’t going to write about. The things that go wrong get prominent attention; that’s how it’s always been. That’s not unique to me as president, and I’m up to the challenge. We’re going to get this done, all right?”

Back in April, federal officials concerned about the potential for major glitches put off until 2015 a provision that would offer small businesses owners a way to allow their employees to choose from among a variety of competing plans in the new online marketplace being overseen by the Obama administration.

Similar to last week's announcement of a one-year delay in the requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers provide coverage or pay a fine, the move to delay the ""employee choice provision"" was cited by opponents as an example that the health law was in trouble.

Still, the decision at the time relieved insurers, who feared there wasn’t enough time left to sort out operational complexities, but proponents lamented a loss of choice for employees.

But now, as new marketplaces prepare to open for enrollment Oct. 1, it appears that most of the states creating their own online marketplaces are going ahead with “employee choice” for small business workers, researchers at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute found in a report Thursday for the Commonwealth Fund.

By doing so, the states hope to make the small business marketplaces -- for firms with 50 or fewer workers -- more attractive to employers and workers, said co-author Sarah Dash.

The ""choice"" option will not be available in the 33 states whose new marketplaces, also known as exchanges, are overseen by the federal government. Small employers will still have the option of shopping for coverage through the marketplace, but workers’ choice of plans will be limited to the one their employer picks.

In the 17 states doing their own marketplaces, 15 intend to offer the choice model, as will the District of Columbia, according to the report. Idaho is not including an employee-choice program because it is using the federal marketplaces’ information technology platform, which will not include it. New Mexico is still considering its options.

Under the state programs moving forward, a business owner could pay a set amount toward coverage for each worker, then let each employee go to the Small Business Health Options Program, known as the SHOP exchange, to select from a variety of plans. Workers could choose to pay the difference if they wanted a more expensive plan, or potentially see all or most of their premium covered if they chose a less costly one.

Insurers raised concerns late last year that the SHOP marketplaces will be very complex – and feared the marketplaces would not be ready to handle those issues this fall. They did not want to be required to participate unless there was a delay.

On Wednesday, Alissa Fox, a senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said it is “news to us” that so many states were moving forward.

“Our strong recommendation for the past three years is that the focus needs to be on getting the individual marketplace up and running and getting the core functions done right,” said Fox. “Any functions not critical to that core mission should be put off so we get it right for consumers.”

Seven states – Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont – will allow workers the widest variety of choices, selecting from across multiple insurers and coverage levels, the report says. Other states will allow workers to choose among plans at a specific level of coverage selected by the employer.

State marketplaces, Dash said, are responsible for ensuring they have the technology available to track the worker choices, a complex challenge. At least two states have slowed their effort: In Washington state, not enough insurance carriers applied, so the state will pilot its employee-choice program in only one region of the state, said Dash.

In Maryland, the small business section of the online marketplace won’t open for enrollment until Jan. 1, 2014, three months behind the opening of the market to individuals. Coverage under the small business program won’t begin until March 1, 2014, according to minutes from the board overseeing the state’s marketplace.

Under the health law, small businesses are not required to offer coverage or use these marketplaces. Workers at firms not offering health insurance would be able to go to a parallel online marketplace for individuals, which is also being set up by the federal government and the states."

Ted Cruz laid out his strategy on Sunday for trying to dismantle ObamaCare in the Senate, amid increasing questions about whether he has the support of fellow chamber Republicans and if he’ll force a government shutdown to win.

Cruz explained to “Fox News Sunday” his procedural strategy, after suggesting Friday that Senate Republicans use a filibuster to block Senate Democrats’ attempt to use their majority to swiftly vote down the House-approved plan -- which is to fund the entire federal government, except ObamaCare, before the Oct. 1 deadline.

“If Senate Republicans stand together, we can stop [Majority Leader] Harry Reid,” said Cruz, the Tea Party-backed senator.

Cruz suggested Senate Republicans take their stand by attempting to block Reid’s effort to exclude GOP input through cloture, which can block debates and amendments with only 50 'yes' votes.

“If the majority is going to run over the minority with a train, then the minority has the ability to stop them.” he said. “A vote for cloture is a vote for ObamaCare.”

Still, Cruz said he doesn’t know if he can get 41 votes should any vote go a 60-vote super majority.

Cruz’s plan is facing criticism from Democrats as well as Republicans, who, based on recent polls, fear they will be blamed for a government shutdown.

Among the congressional Republican leaders opposing Cruz and his plan are Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and New York Rep. Peter King, who voted Friday in favor of the House plan but said Cruz’s efforts will expose him as a “fraud.”

Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill told “Fox News Sunday” that she couldn't believe Republicans were going to “throw a tantrum and throw the entire economic recovery under a bus.”

She also rejected Cruz’s argument that Senate Democrats are using “brute political force,” saying they are simply following the will of voters who last year re-elected Obama and reject Republicans trying to end ObamaCare.

Cruz said he expects the Senate, if it votes down the House plan, would send it back to leaders of the Republican-controlled chamber, with the deadline for a temporary spending bill just eight days away."

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-dems-vote-repeal-part-163026133.html,,[],Senate Dems vote to repeal part of health care law,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It isn't every day that more than half the Democrats in the Senate vote to repeal part of President Barack Obama's health care law.

But that's what happened Thursday night when the Senate voted 79-20 to repeal a 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices such as catheters, pacemakers and MRI machines, which was intended to help to finance coverage for the uninsured that starts next year.

The medical device industry, a technology leader that provides lots of well-paying jobs around the country, has been lobbying all-out to repeal the tax. And Republicans were hoping Friday that the vote signals a new willingness by Democrats to defy the president on unpopular provisions of his signature law.

But others pointed out that the vote was nonbinding, amounting to budget guidance. The actual repeal of the tax is far from a done deal, and things might have come out quite differently if senators had to confront spending cuts or tax increases to fill in a 10-year, $30-billion revenue hole that would leave.

Nonetheless, 33 of the chamber's 53 Democrats joined all 45 Republicans in voting for the repeal amendment by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Four out of seven members of the Democratic leadership voted for it. Two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats split their votes for and against.

Republicans said the result exceeded their expectations.

""I would like to see the entire law repealed,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. ""But since the Supreme Court said it's constitutional, and the president was re-elected, I think we are going to see Democrats work in a bipartisan way to repeal portions of the law."" Other targets: a tax on health insurance plans and a Medicare cost control board.

Not so fast, says the White House. ""Last night's purely symbolic vote has no bearing on the future of the Affordable Care Act and its implementation,"" said spokesman Brad Carroll. The administration says the industry will benefit from millions of newly insured customers as a result of the law, and it should contribute in the same way that hospitals, drug companies and health insurance plans are also taking cuts or paying higher taxes.

Story continues

The industry says it has been lumped in the wrong category, because the vast majority of its customers are already covered by insurance and it isn't expecting a windfall from Obama's law. The companies started paying the tax Jan. 1, and they say if it stays on the books that will lead to lay-offs and put a damper on investment. Outside economists expect the industry will be able to pass on most of the tax increase to customers.

The one thing the Senate vote clearly proved is that the industry has lobbying clout, said Robert Laszewski, a consultant to health care companies.

""This was an easy vote for many senators to take in response to a very powerful medical device lobby,"" Laszewski said. ""Let's see what happens when the choice is to undermine the (health care law) or come up with an alternative source of revenue. I don't think these 33 Democratic senators have any intention to start taking the Affordable Care Act apart."""

(CNN) —

The deal ending the shutdown may not have put a dent in Obamacare, but the battle over implementing the health coverage law is not over.

CNN Fact Check: Obamacare

One venue that Republicans are turning to for leverage, starting next week: oversight hearings, beginning with some tough questions about why the rollout of the website for enrolling in health care exchanges is having so many problems.

“The American people deserve to know what caused this mess,” said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions.”

Obama: Website glitches unacceptable

Upton has already asked officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the problems at a hearing scheduled for next Thursday. He also is asking them to turn over records of their communications with website contractors about the preparations for the site’s launch, and the problems people have had trying to use it.

Logging into Healthcare.gov tough for some early registrants

Additionally, the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, last week wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius demanding information about the rollout problems. Joining him was Sen. Lamar Alexander, ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions.

HHS official: Sebelius not available to testify Thursday

One issue has been the ability to log in to healthcare.gov. A senior administration official told CNN some users, especially those who signed up “early on,” have been having trouble logging in, but the administration is working on a fix. There also was conflicting word on whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch.

Sebelius concedes there have been implementation difficulties.

“I’ll be the first to tell you that the website launch was rockier than we would have liked,” she told an audience in Cincinnati on Wednesday, during her tour to promote Obamacare. But, she told CNN affiliate WLWT, “There are constant improvements under way, so that we are getting people in much more quickly.”

Nevertheless, a couple of Republicans have called on Sebelius to resign.

“Enough is enough,” said Sen. Pat Roberts, who has called for her to step down in spite of being a longtime friend of her family. “Secretary Sebelius has had three and a half years to launch Obamacare, and she has failed.”

Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana tells CNN he is working to collect signatures calling for Sebelius to leave.

White House spokesman Jay Carney pushed back on Tuesday.

“The secretary does have the full confidence of the president,” he told reporters. And when he was asked Thursday who would be held accountable for the problems with the website, Carney replied, “The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work, fixing the problems that need to be fixed.”

He focused instead on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to.

“The result will be millions of Americans who have insurance who did not have it before. That’s the goal. And the goal is not about the website. The goal is that the American people who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past have those options available to them.”

But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, while not naming names, said of the website on MSNBC, “when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge.”

Gibbs: Fire those who botched website

Public attention may have been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges. But with the shutdown ended, part of the emerging Republican message is that the problems with the Obamacare website reflect broader problems with the law overall.

“I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future,” said Fleming. At a minimum, the implementation of the individual mandate, requiring people to get health care, should be delayed, he said.

But a spokeswoman for Sebelius said the online enrollment process is proceeding.

“While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one, it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options,” said spokeswoman Joanne Peters.

How many have signed up for health care? Well, it depends"

Chris Christie became the eighth Republican governor to back expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health care reform law on Tuesday.

Christie, a potential 2016 presidential contender who is up for reelection this year, defied conservative opponents of Obamacare by embracing one of its key components when he announced his plan to the Democratic-controlled state legislature in Trenton. So far, more than a dozen Republican governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas, have declared their opposition to the Medicaid expansion.

""After considerable discussion and research, I have decided to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. While we already have one of the most expansive and generous Medicaid programs in the nation, including the second highest eligibility rate for children, we have an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans who are at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January of 2014,"" Christie said.

Expanding Medicaid in New Jersey would provide new health care coverage to an estimated 291,000 people through 2022, according to an analysis released by the Urban Institute and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in November. New Jersey would spend an additional $1.5 billion and receive $15.4 billion from the federal government to finance the expansion during that time period, the report predicted.

The health care reform law calls for Medicaid coverage to be available to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare last year, it gave states the option to refuse the Medicaid expansion because the program is jointly funded by the federal and state governments.

Other Republican governors, including Florida's Rick Scott and Ohio's John Kasich, also support the Medicaid expansion. Altogether, 25 states and the District of Columbia plan to broaden the program under the health care reform law beginning next year. Most of the new enrollees in states that expand are expected to be adults without children living at home, who were not previously covered by Medicaid.

""These folks are consistently among those who need help the most -- men and women who have suffered trauma in their lives, live with mental illness, rely on New Jersey’s emergency rooms for primary health care, or those citizens who lack insurance or access to treatment in other ways,"" Christie said.

The federal government will pay the full cost of insuring newly eligible people from 2014 through 2016 under the health care reform law expansion. That share declines over several years until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. For other people on Medicaid, such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, the federal government pays states an average of 57 percent of the expenses.

The New Jersey Medicaid expansion actually would save the state $227 million in fiscal year 2014, Christie said. Some governors, like Jay Nixon of Missouri (D), expect to use new federal Medicaid funding to replace spending currently conducted by other state programs. Christie also echoed Kasich and other Republicans by noting his state's residents would pay federal taxes to finance Medicaid expansions in other states and not see benefits themselves if New Jersey doesn't participate.

Christie has opposed the health care reform law and has expressed some hostility to the Medicaid expansion in the past. He likened the Medicaid provisions in the health care reform law to ""extortion"" during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington in July. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, states that defied the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare risked losing all their federal Medicaid dollars. ""I'm really glad that a majority of the Supreme Court still supports the notion, as a former prosecutor, that extortion is still illegal, even when done by the president of the United States,"" Politico reported Christie saying at the time.

Christie also previously indicated that New Jersey's Medicaid program was broad enough. ""Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors, and so I don't think there's a lot more for us to do in New Jersey in that regard,"" Christie said on Fox News Channel in July.

New Jersey currently doesn't provide Medicaid benefits to childless adults, though it does offer less-generous coverage to poor adults with incomes below 23 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $2,643 for a single person this year. New Jersey does offer Medicaid to the parents of poor children and to pregnant women who earn up to 133 percent of poverty.

Christie's Medicaid plan could provoke ire among conservatives who remain opposed to all aspects of Obamacare. Christie also angered some conservatives during the presidential campaign last year when he appeared with Obama and praised his handling of the response to Hurricane Sandy just days before Obama defeated GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie hasn't been invited to next month's Conservative Political Action Conference after being a featured speaker at the event last year.

""I am no fan of the Affordable Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land and I will make all my judgments as governor based on what I believe is best for New Jersey,"" Christie said on Tuesday.

Christie rejected another aspect of Obamacare when he twice vetoed bills passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature last year that would have established a state-run health insurance exchange. The exchanges will be websites where residents can comparison shop for coverage and learn whether they qualify for Medicaid or for tax credits to pay for private health insurance options that are available to people who earn between the poverty level, $11,490 for an individual this year, and four times that amount.

""At least 50 percent of the [prison] population has symptoms of mental health disorders,"" said Brad Brockmann, executive director of the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights at Brown University. ""With Medicaid expansion, we have an incredible opportunity to take care of the very neediest, the very poorest while freeing up huge amounts of money within the states through not having to provide that care in correctional settings.""

The Eighth Amendment guarantees adequate medical care for prisoners -- often an expensive undertaking because many battle addiction and have serious mental health issues. Currently, counties and states pay for that care. But in January, when the Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid coverage to men living below the poverty line, the cost of this care shifts to the feds.

""That's one of the reason why you're seeing a lot of Republican governors support the Medicaid expansion because for them, it's a fiscal windfall,"" said Avik Roy, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. ""They will be able to offload these costs to the federal government that currently they're paying for.""

State and county prisoners who need acute care outside a prison facility can also have that cost reimbursed by Medicaid.

""That's a substantial savings for the county and local system,"" Brockmann said.

Consider the projected savings in California: for the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the Legislative Analyst's Office projects a federal reimbursement of more than $70 million dollars, which is more than double the $21 million in funds it received for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.

But overall, counties stand to see the biggest financial windfall. Currently, counties are responsible for inmate care. However, under Obamacare, counties will have the authority to charge insurance purchased through the state exchange for inmates awaiting trial.

""An individual who's awaiting trial [...] would still be in the community and would be able to retain his or her benefits,"" Brockmann said.

To help shift the cost burden, counties and states across the country are working to make sure inmates entering and exiting their jails are signed up for coverage either through the state exchange or with expanded Medicaid.

""That streamlining of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid makes it much easier for states and localities to offload their health care,"" Roy said.

That means the cost is dispersed to all federal taxpayers -- even those in states who opted out of the Medicaid program.

""If you choose not to expand the Medicaid program, you're saving your state taxpayers a fair amount of money,"" Roy said, ""but that means that the federal expenditures on Medicaid are going to other states.""

So in essence, money from taxpayers in the states who opted out of Medicaid, like Texas, will see it go towards the care of inmates in the states that did opt in, like California.

""That's one of the moral dilemmas of the Medicaid expansion generally,"" Avik said. ""Should taxpayers be required to spend a fair amount of money -- because this is a very expensive program -- on the costs of health care for these inmates?""

But prison advocates predict this could have long term cost savings for prison systems because treatment may reduce recidivism rates or even prevent incarceration in the first place. Brockmann cites a 2004 program in Texas that introduced community treatment and addiction programs. The state saw a 10 percent drop in crime and a savings of $2 billion over 5 years. Brockmann theorizes there is the potential for similar outcome because some people more at risk of incarceration will receive treatment under the new state exchanges and Medicaid guidelines.

Text of the Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund the government for 60-75 days will be released on Tuesday, the conservative source said, before a House vote on Thursday. The move comes abruptly as conservatives are ramping up their final push on House leadership with a big Tea Party rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday calling for Obamacare’s defunding.

House Speaker John Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News the “CR will include defunding ObamaCare,” but would not specify whether or not a certain procedural “trick” the GOP leadership used in a similar situation in 2011 will be employed yet again.

Breitbart News’ source, a high-ranking conservative movement figure close to House conservatives, said that this CR from House leadership will continue to pay for Obamacare’s implementation without cutting from current levels of taxpayer funding for the healthcare law’s rollout, despite claims from Boehner’s office it will “include defunding ObamaCare.” The source said the budget riders that will be attached to the CR can be removed easily by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, allowing him to pass a CR through the Senate funding Obamacare–a procedural move that does not require the House to revisit its CR and makes the Senate version final.

The source added that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is “shopping an idea of passing defund through the House with the CR, but with a mechanism that would allow it to be decoupled in the Senate, defeated, and then the base CR be passed without coming back to the House.”

The source said the conservative movement should “reject and pan” this “trick” from Cantor, which allows House GOP members to claim they voted to defund Obamacare but allows Reid to strip out budget riders defunding Obamacare and pass a Senate CR without them.

In rushing the CR to the floor for a vote, Breitbart News’ source said that House GOP leadership will put votes on whether the U.S. should authorize use of military force in Syria off until next week.

Politico has also confirmed the GOP leadership’s plans, reporting that Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner are “dusting off an old legislative gambit from April 2011 as one way to move ahead this week with a stopgap spending bill for the first months of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.”

“The goal is to give conservatives a vote on defunding health care reform without resulting in a government shutdown,” Politico’s David Rogers wrote. “It’s worked before, but ‘before’ is the operative word.”

“And until Tuesday’s Republican Conference, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) won’t really know if this flash-from-the-past can flash again,” Rogers continued. “Most simply the procedure calls for sending the Senate a stopgap spending bill together with a resolution that would alter the text of the bill once it’s enrolled for presentation to President Barack Obama.”

Red State’s Daniel Horowitz notes that this trick from House GOP leadership could give GOP members political cover to oppose the grassroots and Tea Party movement by allowing them to claim they voted not to pay for Obamacare’s implementation. “Based on what I’m hearing from House sources, the worst suspicions are confirmed,” Horowitz wrote. “Eric Cantor is floating an idea to pass a short-term CR with a defund rider. But just as we predicted, they plan to write a rule that will sever the defund rider from the body of the bill after it passes the House.”

“This will allow the Senate to vote down the defund part separately, and send a clean CR straight to the President’s desk without ever returning to the House,” he explained. “This will ensure that we capitulate while allowing House and Senate Republicans to be shielded from charges of voting to defund Obamacare.”

Rick Manning, the vice president for public policy and communications at Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News such a strategy from leadership to buy political cover will likely fail in the end.

“If Congress ends up funding Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution, House Republicans will own it every bit as much as if they had voted for it in the beginning,” Manning said. “Parliamentary tricks will not save them from this reality.”

Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin said recently that if House Speaker John Boehner allowed a situation like this to happen, Obamacare would forever become known as “BoehnerCare.”

Club for Growth president Chris Chocola denounced the reported plan in a statement Monday afternoon: “Are these news reports from The Onion? Or are they real?” Chocola said. “When members were at home over recess, did they hear their constituents ask for legislative tricks or principled leadership?

“Trying to fool Republicans into voting to fund Obamacare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it,” Chocola declared. “I hope this proposal is nothing more than a bad joke and is quickly discarded. Republicans should simply do what they say they are for by passing a Continuing Resolution that doesn’t fund Obamacare.”"

Contrast this with the Federal program, and as Krugman notes, imagine how the press coverage would be different were that data showing 100,000/day signing up.

Krugman covers what happened with John Boehner, including his office putting the healthcare exchange on hold for 35 minutes.

But there is more to California. Krugman notes a key statistic:

To work as planned, health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool — that is, it must sign up young, healthy Americans as well as their older, less healthy compatriots. And so far, so good: in October, 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34, slightly above that group’s share of the population. What we have in California, then, is a proof of concept. Yes, Obamacare is workable — in fact, done right, it works just fine.

I would still like to see how much of the problem on Healthcare.gov was a result of DDOS attacks, since there is now some clear evidence that happened, fomented by right-wing web sites.

And we know ALEC is still seeking ways to undermine OBamacare, including pushing state legislation that might strip licenses of insurance companies that participated in the program - although I suspect that any such attempt would create a devastating backlash, including from the insurance companies, for as Krugman notes

one shouldn’t forget that the insurance industry has a big financial stake in the success of Obamacare, and will soon be pitching in with big efforts to sign people up.

California - and red state Kentucky - show that properly administered Obamacare can work, that people want better access to health insurance.

No, we do not all live in states that have chosen to make the process work.

But the kinks in healthcare.gov are being worked out.

More and more people are able to sign up.

And the subsidies are making MEANINGFUL health insurance more affordable than ever.

The question is whether the mainstream media will dig below the surface and the rhetoric to tell the real story.

In the meantime, we have models that show the approach does work.

As Krugman concludes,

Again, Obamacare’s rollout was a disaster. But in California we can see what health reform will look like, beyond the glitches. And it’s going to work."
http://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-obamacare-most-trusted-150510482.html,,[],Fox News 'most trusted' source of news on Obamacare: survey,"CNN may call itself ""the most trusted name in news,"" but when it comes to information about President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, more Americans trust Fox News, a new study suggests.



According to a YouGov survey conducted earlier this month, 19 percent of those polled said Fox News was the most trusted source of information on Obamacare. The top-rated cable network came in ahead of ""Friends and Family"" (17 percent), Obama (11 percent) and National Public Radio (10 percent) in YouGov's results.



Just 3 percent said they trust CNN and MSNBC for information on the new health care law, slightly less than trust Republicans in Congress (4 percent) and slightly more than congressional Democrats (2 percent).



Among Republicans, nearly half (45 percent) named Fox News as their most-trusted source of Obamacare news, with ""Friends and Family"" (19 percent) a distant second. By comparison, just 7 percent of Democrats polled said they trust Fox News on Obamacare.



But while Fox News is more trusted on the Affordable Care Act than all other major cable news channels, lawmakers and Obama himself, it is not as well-trusted as local TV news, the poll found.



When asked how much trust they had in each source of news, 45 percent of the respondents said they trusted local cable news ""a lot"" or ""some,"" compared to 33 percent who said ""not too much"" or ""not at all"" — a net rating of 12, compared to Fox News' 4 net rating.



That Obama is among the least trusted is not surprising, given his health care-related campaign promise — that Americans who liked their existing health care insurance plans could keep them — was cast into doubt. (The YouGov poll was conducted prior to Obama's recent public apology about the rollout of Obamacare.)



That Fox News is more trusted than its cable news rivals on Obamacare shouldn't be surprising, either. A Public Policy Polling survey conducted earlier this year found Fox News was the most trusted television news source in the country.



The same poll, though, found Fox was also the least trusted.

But if you had to reduce them to one sentence, it might go like this: “Congress responds to the short-term demands of particular groups, not the long-term needs of the nation as a whole.”

Case in point: the seemingly unstoppable growth of medical benefits for former military personnel under Tricare, the Defense Department’s health program. This mushrooming expense is a major reason that Pentagon health-care spending rose from $19 billion in fiscal 2001 to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2012.

The latter figure represented nearly 10 percent of that year’s defense budget.

President Obama has tried repeatedly to rein in this category of spending, on the very sound theory that resources are finite and that dollars spent on retiree health care cannot be spent equipping and training the active-duty armed forces for war — the Pentagon’s primary mission.

Military health care’s traditional role was to serve active-duty troops and their families, at no out-of-pocket cost. Tricare still does this, except for small prescription co-payments. This makes sense as an incentive to sign up for service and its attendant sacrifices.

Since 2000, however, Congress has repeatedly expanded the access of former military personnel to Tricare. By 2010, the eligible population had increased from 6.8 million a decade earlier to 9.7 million — nearly 85 percent of whom were not active-duty service personnel, according to an excellent May 2012 Armed Forces Journal article by Brittany Gregerson of the Institute for Defense Analyses.

Obama’s reforms have been rebuffed every time, by Democrats and by supposedly fiscally conservative, pro-defense Republicans.

The expansion of Tricare dates to the post-Cold War base closings in the 1990s. Some military hospitals were shut in the process, and retirees who had been allowed to use them on a space-available basis protested that Congress owed them a substitute.

Some even claimed that recruiters had offered them free health care for life when they enlisted and that Congress was welshing on this purported contract.

The courts correctly rejected this legally, and factually, spurious claim — but it fared better in the political sphere.

In 1996, Congress allowed military retirees ages 37 to 64 and their family members to join Tricare for an annual contribution that averaged 27 percent of total health-care costs for a family of three.

That contribution, however, did not increase with inflation. As a result, Tricare’s real cost to working-age beneficiaries dropped 41 percent between 1997 and 2010, Gregerson found. Not surprisingly, working-age retirees and their families began leaving employer-paid plans and signing up for Tricare.

Congress did allow a modest increase in costs for working-age retirees to take effect last year and indexed that cost increase to inflation. But those costs are still far less than what an average civilian would pay for comparable employer-provided health insurance.

Once former military personnel turn 65, they are eligible for Medicare, like everyone else. But in 2002, Congress gave them “Tricare for Life” — essentially, a free Medigap plan. Roughly 2 million people take advantage of this perk, at a projected cost to taxpayers of $9.7 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

On a per capita basis, Tricare for Life is the most expensive Tricare program of the Defense Department, Gregerson writes. Beneficiaries’ utilization rate far exceeds that of the other Tricare programs’ participants — no surprise, since Tricare for Life beneficiaries have zero incentive to conserve.

Obama’s 2013 budget plan would have saved $12.8 billion over five years by gradually increasing the annual enrollment fees of Tricare’s working-age retirees, with discounts for lower-income participants, and then indexing the fees to the rate of national growth in health spending.

The maximum fee would have quadrupled to $2,000 — still far cheaper than most civilian plans. The president also proposed adding an enrollment charge to Tricare for Life.

Congress would have none of it — then or, apparently, now. Neither the recently adopted Senate budget plan for fiscal 2014, drafted by Democrats, nor the supposedly “austere” Ryan budget passed by the Republican House, touched Tricare. Hell hath no fury like a veterans’ lobby scorned, as senators and representatives of both parties know.

So do I! In anticipation of a lot of hate mail, I would note that I respect and honor America’s veterans. They should be well provided for, including reasonable health benefits. But no one — not even a veteran — is entitled to taxpayer support regardless of competing public needs.

In the case of Tricare, this is what the veterans’ lobbies have demanded of Congress, and what Congress has given them.

http://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-delay-parts-health-care-law-230218513.html,,[],House votes to delay parts of health care law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led House voted on Wednesday to delay core provisions of President Barack Obama's health care law, emboldened by the administration's concession that requiring companies to provide coverage for their workers next year may be too complicated.

After a day of heated rhetoric, the House voted largely along party lines, 264-161, to delay by one year the so-called employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act. It voted 251-174 to extend a similar grace period to virtually all Americans who will be required to obtain coverage beginning Jan. 1, the linchpin of the law.

The dual political-show votes marked the 38th time the GOP majority has tried to eliminate, defund or scale back the unpopular law since Republicans took control of the House in January 2011. The House legislation stands no chance in the Democratic-run Senate.

The goal of the health care law is to provide coverage to nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance and lower skyrocketing costs. But in the three years since Obama signed his signature law, the public remains highly skeptical and the administration's abrupt decision earlier this month to delay the employer provision only fueled more doubts.

Republican foes welcomed the deferment as a political gift, not only to assail Obama but to arrange votes that put House Democrats on record ahead of next year's congressional elections. In fact, on the employer mandate, 35 Democrats broke with party leaders and joined Republicans in backing the delay. Twenty-two Democrats supported a postponement of the health care requirement for individuals.

""This administration cannot make its own law work,"" said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, during House debate.

Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said the decision was ""a clear signal that even the administration doesn't believe the country is ready to sustain the painful economic impact this law will have.""

Story continues

Eager to counter the Republican criticism, Obama plans to deliver remarks Thursday focusing on rebates that consumers are already receiving from insurance companies under the health care law.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama will draw attention to the 8.5 million consumers who have received an average consumer rebate of about $100. Carney also highlighted reports that some states are already anticipating lower premiums under the Affordable Care Act.

""Competition and transparency in the marketplaces, plus the hard effort by those committed to making the law work, are leading to affordable, new and better choices for families,"" Carney said.

The House vote delaying the employer requirement codified the administration's decision, but the White House insisted it was unnecessary and issued a tough veto threat. Democrats dismissed the entire GOP effort as just another fruitless attack on a law that has been upheld by the Supreme Court.

""Well, here we go again. Another repeal vote, another political side show,"" said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.

Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""nothing more than a waste of time"" as the health care issue has been settled in Congress, the courts and in last year's presidential election when Obama won a second term.

In a series of unconventional political arguments, Republicans faulted Obama, who taught courses in constitutional law, of selectively enforcing the law. They accused a Democratic president of siding with business while ignoring the needs of average Americans.

""Let's provide the same relief to American families that Obama's promised to big business,"" said Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind.

Republicans also read aloud the complaints of union leaders about the unintended consequences of the law on workers' hours, with companies scaling back work time to avoid providing health coverage. They gleefully cited labor's statement that it voted for Democrats and expected them to address the problem.

The unions — International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and UNITE-HERE — wrote to Democratic leaders last week that the law's requirements have created an incentive for employers to limit workers' hours.

The law created a new definition of full-time workers, those putting in 30 hours or more.

""Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA (Affordable Care Act) are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios,"" the union leaders wrote.

House Democrats argued that the criticisms ignore the immediate advantages of the law, millions of young people who are able to remain on their parents' health care until age 26, preventives services and the millions of Americans who will have access to affordable care.

After each Republican spoke during House debate, Democrats described the specific benefits of the law in the GOP lawmaker's district.

Under the health law, companies with 50 or more workers must provide affordable coverage to their full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties if just one worker ends up getting government-subsidized insurance. Originally, that requirement was supposed to take effect Jan. 1. It will now be delayed to 2015.

The administration said businesses had raised concerns about the complexity of the requirements and pressed for more time for implementation. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 95 percent of employers with 50 or more workers already offer health benefits.

Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, senior administration officials defended the law and the delay.

Treasury Department health policy adviser Mark Iwry told the Ways and Means Committee that the administration's one-year delay of the requirement for larger employers to offer coverage was in keeping with the agency's longstanding legal authority to smooth the implementation of complicated new tax laws.

""On a number of prior occasions across administrations, this authority has been used to postpone the application of new legislation when immediate application would have subjected taxpayers to unreasonable administrative burdens or costs,"" Iwry said.

He cited a number of previous examples, from small business legislation to a tax on aviation fuel.

The inspector general's office that monitors the Internal Revenue Service warned of possible problems for consumers submitting applications for health insurance in October.

Testifying before the House Oversight committee, Alan Duncan of the Treasury's Inspector General office said the rush to be ready for open enrollment Oct. 1 may leave some technology not fully tested.

""The lack of adequate testing could result in significant delays and errors in accepting and processing ... applications for health insurance coverage,"" Duncan testified.

Administration officials said they are highly confident of a successful launch.

The final rule, issued under the new health care law, adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives.

After considering more than 400,000 comments, administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle. The rule, they said, is very similar to their proposal. An exemption is included for churches. But many Catholic hospitals, schools, universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents.

The issue figured prominently in last year’s elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters. At the same time, Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the church’s social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion."

USATODAY

Sure%2C Republicans have been trying hard to kill the law.

But trying to repeal a law you think will be bad for the country is entirely legitimate.

Republicans are on the right side of the argument in every particular%2C save one.

The Affordable Care Act — aka ObamaCare — is off to a very rocky start, and according to the law's biggest defenders, the blame falls squarely at the feet of Republicans.

It's an odd claim. Republicans did not write the law. They did not support the law. And they are not in charge of implementing it. Yet, it's got to be the GOP's fault, right?

Now it is true that Republicans have been trying very hard to kill the law. The GOP-controlled House has voted 40 times to repeal it. Conservative activists dedicated to repeal have refused to shut up and lie down. Some Republican governors have declined to expand Medicaid. Some Republican senators have leaned on outside groups, such as the NFL, to not help promote the law. And some ambitious Republicans want to use the upcoming budget and debt ceiling negotiations to force Democrats into defunding ObamaCare.

Let's go through each. Trying to repeal a law you didn't vote for and think will be bad for the country is entirely legitimate. Sometimes, it's morally compulsory. One needn't cite the fugitive slave law to demonstrate this fact. In a mid-presidency conversion, Barack Obama decided that he would do whatever he could to nullify the Defense of Marriage Act. In 1989, after a backlash from seniors, Congress repealed a Medicare reform law that didn't work as planned.

Right to fight

There's also something just plain weird about criticizing politicians for trying to get rid of a law that is, has been and continues to be unpopular with Americans. If ObamaCare were wildly popular, the demonization of Republicans as out of touch and radical would have a bit more plausibility.

Also, the fact that activists won't give up may be annoying to supporters of the law, but just talk to any one of them and they'll be the first to tell you that so far they've failed utterly. Similarly, asking the NFL to stay out of a bitter political controversy may be unseemly, but such actions haven't done anything to stop ObamaCare. Indeed, the GOP governors who've declined to sign up for Medicaid expansion aren't obstructing the law; they're exercising their discretion under the law.

In fact, the only person openly defying ObamaCare is Obama himself. His Department of Health and Human Services declared it would delay the implementation of the business mandate, despite the fact nothing in the law empowers it to do so.

And that's just the most egregious part. The administration has been issuing thousands of waivers — including to favored constituencies — exempting various parties (such as congressional staffers) from complying with the law because it turns out ObamaCare can't work as written. That conclusion isn't mine; it's the administration's. That's why, for instance, HHS and the IRS won't bother with verifying whether applicants for insurance subsidies are eligible under the law.

In short, Republicans are on the right side of the argument in every particular, save one: the effort to force the Democrats to defund ObamaCare by threatening a debt crisis or government shutdown. The Democrats will never agree to such a demand, and the resulting crisis would surely be blamed on Republicans.

Pull of entitlements

There is a bizarre irony at work here. Both the right and left are convinced ObamaCare will eventually become popular if implemented. Conservatives fear the ""ratchet effect,"" a term coined by the great libertarian economic historian Robert Higgs. Once government expands, goes the theory, reversing that expansion is nearly impossible. Liberals have their own version. They point out that once Americans get an entitlement — Social Security, Medicare, etc. — they never want to lose it. They hope that if they can just get Americans hooked on the goodies in ObamaCare, they'll overlook all the flaws.

There's a lot of truth here, to be sure. But it's not an iron law either. Sometimes, bad laws get fixed. It happened with Medicare in 1989 and welfare reform in 1995. Many of the boneheaded laws of the early New Deal were scrapped as well.

Republicans should have a little more confidence in their own arguments. If you believe that ObamaCare can't work, you should expect that it won't. Forcing a debt crisis or government shutdown won't kill ObamaCare, but it will give Democrats a lifeline heading into the 2014 elections, which could have the perverse effect of delaying the day Republicans have the political clout to actually succeed in repealing this unworkable and unpopular law.

To remove all doubt: The Take Care Clause of the Constitution absolutely forbids any president from doing exactly what Obama did Thursday.

Obama said he would allow insurance companies to keep offering previously-offered insurance plans that Americans would like to keep. Nobody knows if this means all plans, or only some of them, and how the White House will make such determinations. He says he has “enforcement discretion” to make this change to the Affordable Care Act unilaterally, without consulting Congress.

This is a frightening claim of a sweeping power that is completely inconsistent with the Constitution. A president has “prosecutorial discretion” to prioritize which lawbreakers to prosecute in federal court, but there is no “enforcement discretion” to determine which laws on the books he will enforce.

Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution commands of every president: “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Like every provision in the Constitution, it has a legal meaning–and that meaning is the Supreme Law of the Land, which Congress, the courts, and–yes–each president is bound by his oath of office to follow carefully.

Everyone should know from their high-school government classes that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to make federal laws, and Article II of the Constitution gives the American president the executive power to administer and enforce those laws. Article II then includes the language about how the president must faithfully execute those laws.

Among other things, the Take Care Clause was inserted in the Constitution to abolish the Royal Prerogative that the Framers of the American Constitution knew from their lives as Englishmen. It was the power of the king of England to disregard or effectively suspend Acts of Parliament. The king could not make laws, but he could shelve a law that Parliament had passed.

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act. Every day provides additional proof that Obamacare is a complete train wreck, but it is one regarding which only Congress can change the terms.

This president’s relationship to Congress is reaching toxic levels, due in large part to the regularity of his hyper-partisan rhetoric and ongoing disrespect. He is learning that the campaign tactics that enabled him to win two presidential elections are manifestly counterproductive when applied to the arduous task of governing, especially in a country as large and diverse as America.

It is not clear at this point whether anyone would have standing to sue over this matter in court. If the experts who are saying today that this unilateral move will only make matters worse are correct, someone might suffer an individualized injury that they could litigate.

President Obama should hope that doesn’t happen, because if a federal court can get past the procedural hurtles to reach the merits of the case, it’s an open-and-shut case that this president’s actions are unconstitutional–again.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/29/white-house-says-obamacare-signups-passed-1-million-mark/,2013-12-29 00:00:00,[],White House says ObamaCare sign-ups passed 1 million mark,"The Obama administration announced early Sunday that enrollment in the federal healthcare exchange passed the 1 million mark in December as more than 975,000 people signed up between December 1 and the December 24 deadline to ensure coverage beginning on the first of 2014.

Officially, the administration put the total of people now enrolled at more than 1.1 million people now enrolled and boasted that the site was able to support 83,000 concurrent visitors on December 23, the next-to-last day before the sign-up deadline. By contrast, the administration reported only 27,000 sign-ups in October --the website's first, error-prone month -- and 137,000 in November.

The administration has yet to provide a December update on the 14 states running their own exchanges. While California, New York, Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut have performed well, others are still struggling.

The windfall comes at a critical moment for Obama's sweeping health care law, which becomes ""real"" for many Americans on Jan. 1 when coverage through the exchanges and key patient protections kick in.

""As we continue our open enrollment campaign, we experienced a welcome surge in enrollment as millions of Americans seek access to affordable health care coverage,"" Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a blog post.

The fledgling exchanges are still likely to fall short of the government's own targets for 2013. The administration had projected more than 3.3 million overall would be enrolled through federal and state exchanges by the end of the year.

Tavenner said fixes to the website, which underwent a major overhaul to address widespread outages and glitches, contributed to December's figures. But the problems haven't totally disappeared. Thousands of people wound up waiting on hold for telephone help on Christmas Eve for a multitude of reasons, including technical difficulties.

The administration released the figures Sunday while President Barack Obama was vacationing in Hawaii. Although the president has spent most of his time relaxing with friends and family, he stepped into work mode late Friday for an update from aides on his signature domestic policy achievement. The White House said Obama told his team to focus on minimizing disruptions for those switching plans.

For Americans who successfully chose insurance plans by Dec. 24, coverage should start on New Year's Day for those who pay their first month's premium by the due date, which in most cases has been extended until Jan. 10.

But insurers have complained that another set of technical problems, largely hidden from consumers, has resulted in the government passing along inaccurate data on enrollees. The White House says the error rate has been significantly reduced. Yet with a flood of signups that must be processed in just days, it remains unclear whether last-minute enrollees will encounter a seamless experience if they try to use their new benefits come Jan. 1.

The political fallout from the website's calamitous rollout could pale in comparison to the heat that Obama might take if Americans who signed up and paid their premiums arrive at the pharmacy or the emergency room and find there's no record of their coverage. Republican critics, already on the lookout for health-law failures to exploit in the 2014 midterm elections, would be emboldened to argue that shortcomings with the law's implementation have jeopardized Americans' health.

As make-or-break January approaches, officials are also working to prevent gaps in coverage for millions of Americans whose individual policies were canceled this fall because they fell short of the law's requirements. In one of a series of last-minute tweaks, the administration in December said even if those individuals don't sign up for new plans, they won't face the penalty the law imposes on Americans who fail to get insurance by March 31.

A key indicator of whether state-run exchanges are keeping pace with the federal exchange will come next month, when the administration releases full December figures. Overall, the goal is to sign up 7 million Americans before the first-year open enrollment period closes at the end of March.

A few states offering their own updates have posted encouraging totals, including New York, where more than 200,000 have enrolled either through the state exchange or through Medicaid, a government program expanded under Obama's health law to cover more people. In California, a tally released Friday showed nearly 430,000 have enrolled through the exchange so far.

""The basic structure of that law is working despite all the problems --despite the website problems, despite the messaging problems,"" Obama told reporters before departing for Hawaii.

Another major unknown is whether the recent surge in enrollments skewed toward older Americans whose medical needs are expensive to cover, or whether the administration succeeded in recruiting younger and healthier people whose participation is critical to the law's success. Those details for December are expected to be released in mid-January.

Meanwhile, with the website now able to handle higher volumes without crashing or clogging up, the government plans in January to ramp up outreach to consumers to encourage more people to sign up, the administration said.

Friday, the same Chicago Tribune called for ObamaCare to be immediately repealed before it can do any more damage:

Stop digging. Start over.

As Friday dawns, here’s what a health insurance crisis looks like to many millions of Americans: Barely six weeks shy of 2014, they do not know whether they will have medical coverage Jan. 1. Or which hospitals and doctors they might patronize. Or what they may pay to protect themselves and their families against the chance of medical and financial catastrophe. How much, that is, they may pay in order to satisfy the Democratic politicians and federal bureaucrats who are worsening a metastasizing health coverage fiasco. …

We understand why the president and leaders of his party want to rescue whatever they can of Obamacare. On their watch, official Washington has blown the launch of a new entitlement program … under the schedule they alone set in early 2010.

What we don’t understand is their reluctance to give that failure more than lip service. Many of the Americans who heard their president say Thursday that “we fumbled the rollout of this health care law” would have been pleased to hear him add: So we’re admitting it. This law is a bust. We’re starting over.

You can expect the calls to repeal ObamaCare to grow from non-GOP sources in the coming days. The news released Saturday that thousands of doctors have been dropped from Medicare Advantage is a likely tipping point. Destroying health care for the elderly is The Third Rail on steroids. This is Armageddon for Democrats. The only chance they have is to repeal. If they do not, they will be wiped out in 2014 and 2016.

Senate Republicans are pushing renegade Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to wrap up his filibuster-like obstruction of the government funding bill sooner rather than later. Top Republicans want to get the legislation back to the House in time to give Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) an opportunity to attach new healthcare repeal amendments that might have a better chance at achieving GOP policy goals.

But time is not on their side. Money to keep routine government services open runs out Oct. 1, and Cruz has vowed to slow-walk the legislation, using every parliamentary tool at his disposal, in the right flank’s quest to undo the Affordable Care Act.

Wednesday is the first of several procedural votes, a process that could stretch through the weekend as Cruz tries to block Senate Democrats, who have the majority, from stripping the provisions defunding the healthcare law. Boehner would have just hours before facing a government shutdown.

Highlights from Cruz’s speech

“My own view is it would be to the advantage of our colleagues in the House, who are in the majority, to shorten the process,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has distanced himself from Cruz’s strategy. “If the House doesn’t get what we send over there until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot.”

After Republican senators convened for back-to-back closed-door strategy sessions Tuesday, many, if not most, embraced the emerging plan.

“It’d be a good place for us to let House Republicans weigh in on this again,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who said the senators had a “good-hearted” discussion. “Delaying the opportunity for the House to send something back, it seems, plays right into the hands of Senate Democrats.”

Republicans in both the House and Senate believe a do-over in the House could have better results, especially if they attach a healthcare provision that would be difficult for Democrats to oppose.

Among the items Republicans are considering are a repeal of the medical device excise tax, which is a part of the healthcare law some Democrats have opposed, or a delay of the individual mandate that all Americans carry health insurance in 2014.

“It seems to some of us the sooner you get it over to the House, the sooner they can address it,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said.

Cruz, though, has shown few signs of pivoting to the new course, especially as tea party groups urge him to stand firm.

Even as Plan B emerged, it remained a work in progress.

“This is merely a disagreement over tactics, and I think you’re beginning to see how the decisions made on tactics are starting to play out,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, who has also distanced himself from Cruz’s approach. “Sometimes they have unintended consequences.”

Howard Dean (D) chastised Sen.

Dean criticized Cruz's plan for buying health insurance policies across state lines, saying he didn't want Texas' health care system infiltrating Vermont's universal health insurance policy.

“I don’t want the Texas insurance commissioner being the commissioner up here in Vermont,” Dean said. “So these are crazy ideas that are from the far right. He’s a slick spokesman and God help us if he ever does get to be anything more than the senator from Texas.”

Cruz admitted that the Senate's push to defund Obamacare doesn't yet have the support it needs, but the fight isn't over.

""We don't have the votes right now,"" Cruz said. ""This fight is likely to heat up in the month of September.""

Thirty-nine Democrats joined Republicans in a 261-157 vote to approve the legislation, offered by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), which would allow insurers to continue selling individual policies that do not meet new federal standards.

The Democratic defections, which the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had hoped to prevent, highlighted the growing unease among House Democrats over the botched rollout of the program and dissatisfaction with the administration’s proposed fix, announced by the president on Thursday.

Both the Upton bill and the president’s administrative fix were crafted to respond to the number of cancellation notices being sent to customers in the individual insurance market, despite repeated promises by Obama that Americans would be allowed to keep their plans if they wanted.

The GOP-controlled House was always expected to approve the bill, which Republicans described as the first step in a campaign to kill the Affordable Care Act.

“The president repeatedly said that if you liked your healthcare plan you could keep it,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). “We knew this was a promise he could not keep, and now it’s a promise he has broken.”

The vote was seen as a critical test of Democratic unity. The president sought to tamp down a revolt from congressional Democrats by announcing the administrative remedy, which gave insurance companies federal permission to renew policies for one year.

Hill Democrats — many of whom fear that their support for the president’s healthcare law will be used against them by Republicans during the 2014 election — welcomed the president’s move, as well as his acknowledgment during a news conference of the political bind he had put them in.

But many still saw a need to demonstrate they were also responsive to voters’ concerns.

“I’m just sending a message by my vote to my constituents back home that I’m going to take whatever action I can take as a member of Congress to fix the problems that have been created, unfortunately, in the law,” said Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.), who voted in favor of the Upton bill. “It’s me being responsible to the people back home.”

Defections by House Democrats included not just lawmakers like Barber who represent swing or Republican-leaning districts. Bruce Braley, a candidate for an open Senate seat in Iowa next year, also voted for the bill.

It was unlikely that the Senate would pass a similar bill, and Obama has vowed to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.

“It is only a masquerade, a Trojan horse coming in to undermine the Affordable Care Act,” Pelosi said, deriding what she said was the 46th legislative attempt by Republicans to scuttle the law.

House Democrats offered an alternative proposal, similar to legislation sponsored by Mary Landrieu (D-La.) in the Senate, that would allow individuals who had substandard plans to keep them for an additional year.

“Sometimes despite your best efforts, you might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to HealthCare.gov, maintenance periods, or other issues with our systems that prevented you from finishing the process on time,"" it continues. ""If this happened to you, don’t worry — we still may be able to help you get covered as soon as Jan. 1.”

During the past two weeks, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration official have reminded reporters that rules for the federal insurance exchange include a ""special enrollment period"" for those who tried but failed to meet the deadline for getting coverage starting on New Year's Day. But they had not spelled out until now how consumers could ask for the special consideration.

The official deadline was Dec. 23, but administration officials have given people an extra 24 hours -– until 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve -- to sign up by quietly changing the computer system's software over the weekend. There is no mention of the extension on the HealthCare.gov site. The difference between the extra 24 hours and the special enrollment period is that anyone who chooses a health plan by the end of Dec. 24 will automatically be assigned for coverage starting Jan. 1. Starting on Dec. 25, requests for Jan. 1 coverage will be considered on a case by case basis.

The information about the special enrollment option came as CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille issued a statement Tuesday saying the federal online health insurance enrollment system received two million visitors Monday, while the government's call centers received more than 250,000 calls from Americans that same day.

The influx of visitors to HealthCare.gov meant more than 129,000 people entered the site's queuing system, Bataille said. Once in the queue, applicants were asked to submit an e-mail so they could be alerted to when demand was less intense.

""All of them received e-mails inviting them back the same day to complete their applications,"" she said.

CMS continued to process applications for insurance Tuesday, Bataille added. ""Volumes remain high but not equal to yesterday, and we have not had to deploy our queuing system,"" she said. ""We are taking thousands of calls at our call centers, which remain open until midnight, and we are seeing thousands of visitors complete enrollment online.""

Consumers who try and fail to enroll by midnight on Christmas Eve should contact a call center for ""individual assistance,"" Bataille said, so that they can participate in ""a robust casework process to address individual inquiries, respond to specific situations and help consumers transition to new coverage.""

(CNN) —

More than 2 million people have signed up so far for health coverage under Obamacare, officials said Tuesday in trying to put the best face forward before the controversial health care reforms fully kick in with the start of 2014.

The enrollment figure represented a big increase after the botched launch of the system in October, but Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was unable to say how many of the 2.1 million who enrolled have paid their first premium to ensure their policies take effect on Wednesday.

Sebelius and other officials also acknowledged the possibility of more potential problems, warning people to bring proof of coverage with them to their doctor or pharmacy, pay premiums when due and double-check with insurers that they are covered.

CNNMoney: Starting the new year in Obamacare limbo

Under the reforms, Americans will be required to have health coverage or face a fine. Sebelius called the full implementation of reforms under the 2010 Affordable Care Act a new era in health insurance, noting they mean no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions or other discriminatory practices such as charging women more than men.

“Starting tomorrow, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition,” Sebelius said on a conference call with journalists.

The Obamacare enrollment figure is below the target of 3 million originally set by the administration for the end of December, which is halfway through an initial six-month sign-up period under the law intended to help millions of previously uninsured Americans get coverage.

Overall, the administration hopes to enroll 7 million people by March 31 while also expanding eligibilty for Medicaid, the government health care program for the impoverished.

Sebelius said Tuesday that another 3.9 million people were eligible for coverage through expanded Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program, but she was unable to specify how many have become new enrollees.

The botched rollout of the new marketplaces on October 1, when the HealthCare.gov website set up to handle the enrollment failed to work properly, damaged the sign-up process until the system began working better in early December.

Sebelius said the administration was “doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period” for people getting new coverage.

Anticipating possible problems in the enrollment system, Sebelius also advised in her blog post that “if you thought you enrolled in health coverage but aren’t showing up in the system, call your insurance company directly.”

She also said people could contact the Obamacare call center for assistance.

Asked if the website woes in October and November could be due to attacks from outside by Obamacare opponents, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told reporters there were technological problems but no sign of hacking.

The health care reforms championed by President Barack Obama have become the defining issue of his presidency, with Republicans led by tea party conservatives trying to dismantle them while some Democrats appearing leery of campaigning on them in the November congressional elections.

While the Supreme Court ruled the mandate to obtain health coverage was constitutional, further legal challenges are being mounted.

Also on Tuesday, a group of Catholic organizations, in an emergency appeal, asked the Supreme Court to delay the Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups provide contraception and “abortion-inducing drug” coverage to their workers.

Catholic groups ask Supreme Court to delay Obamacare mandate

Archdioceses in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Michigan – along with affiliated groups that include Catholic University – asked Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan to block enforcement of the related employer mandates set to take effect on Wednesday.

The issue has been a major sticking sticking point with religious groups and private for-profit companies that have strong moral objections.

The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations who say their religious liberty is violated by the law.

The White House has been rocked back on their heels not just by the rollout problems of HealthCare.gov (which is now actually working), but also by these Scammy ""Cancellation Letters"". But now the charlatans behind the curtain are finally being revealed.

Donna received the letter canceling her insurance plan on Sept. 16. Her insurance company, LifeWise of Washington, told her that they'd identified a new plan for her. If she did nothing, she'd be covered. A 56-year-old Seattle resident with a 57-year-old husband and 15-year-old daughter, Donna had been looking forward to the savings that the Affordable Care Act had to offer. But that's not what she found. Instead, she'd be paying an additional $300 a month for coverage. The letter made no mention of the health insurance marketplace that would soon open in Washington, where she could shop for competitive plans, and only an oblique reference to financial help that she might qualify for, if she made the effort to call and find out. Otherwise, she'd be automatically rolled over to a new plan -- and, as the letter said, ""If you're happy with this plan, do nothing."" If Donna had done nothing, she would have ended up spending about $1,000 more a month for insurance than she will now that she went to the marketplace, picked the best plan for her family and accessed tax credits at the heart of the health care reform law. ""The info that we were sent by LifeWise was totally bogus. Why the heck did they try to screw us?"" Donna said. ""People who are afraid of the ACA should be much more afraid of the insurance companies who will exploit their fear and end up overcharging them."" Donna is not alone.

No, she's not alone. It's not clear how widespread this practice has been, but some State insurance commissioners are starting to notice. In Kentucky, Insurance Provider Humana was fined $65,000 for sending out misleading letters.

The Kentucky Department of Insurance has fined Humana $65,430 because it offered policyholders an unapproved opportunity to amend their insurance as part of a letter that regulators have called “misleading.” The department investigated letters sent in August to 6,543 individual plan policyholders in Kentucky. The letters said they needed to renew their plans for 2014 within 30 days or choose a more expensive option that complies with the Affordable Care Act. But regulators last month called the letters misleading, arguing they did not make sufficiently clear that policyholders could compare and choose competing plans on the state’s health insurance exchanges, which open on Oct. 1, and for which they could be eligible for federal subsidies.

Let's follow this logically, if the letters were sent in August and required a response within 30 days - it essentially forced the policy holders to choose the worse possible option before the Oct 1st launch of their State Exchange. That is a classic ""High Pressure"" sales tactic. ""Buy NOW or you'll miss out. SALE ENDING SOON"" - when in fact, there was no legitimate reason to push people make a decision in that 30 day window other than to prevent them from shopping on the Exchange. Read the Human Letter. 2,200 people actually did respond within that 30 period, but Kentucy regulators after finding they had been deceived by Humana released them from that agreement and allowed them to go ahead and shop for a better plan on the marketplace. Then they fined Humana for their attempted Scam.

[Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon] Clark gave the example of a single mother with children who was urged to sign up for a Humana plan with a monthly premium of $719.86. That price is higher than any comparable plan for sale on the state's insurance marketplace, Clark said -- not to mention that the mother might have qualified for tax subsidies to help pay for it if she went through the marketplace, as Donna did.

So the next time you hear or read about how ObamaCare has caused someone to lose their inexpensive plan only to be forced to choose a much more expensive one. Don't Believe It. As Adm. Akbar would say: It's. A. Trap! Vyan

8:42 AM PT: To be fair, as VcLib pointed out in the comments not every plan was automatically Grandfathered. There were these restrictions via https://www.healthcare.gov/....

All health plans must:

.End lifetime limits on coverage

.End arbitrary cancellations of health coverage

.Cover adult children up to age 26

.Provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC), a short, easy-to-understand summary of what a plan covers and costs

.Hold insurance companies accountable to spend your premiums on health care, not administrative costs and bonuses Grandfathered plans DON'T have to:

.Cover preventive care for free

.Guarantee your right to appeal

.Protect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care .Be held accountable through Rate Review for excessive premium increases In addition to the above, grandfathered individual health insurance plans (the kind you buy yourself, not the kind you get from an employer) don't have to: .End yearly limits on coverage .Cover you if you have a pre-existing health condition

So if you had a plan that had a lifetime cap, didn't cover your children until they were 26, could be arbitrarily cancelled and didn't spend 80-85% of your premiums on your care - that plan would have to be updated or replaced. If you had a plan like that, and for some reason liked it then you were always going to have to make an adjustment to a plan that doesn't suck anymore. The question is, would you be able to shop for the best possible option or would you stay with the options given by your current provider? These letters show that some providers tried to corral their clients into staying and accepting a much higher rate - blaming the ACA for it - and therefore scaring them away from the Exchange Marketplace. We've been hearing that the reason these plans were more expensive is because they had to cover preventive care (Limbaugh had a field-day with that one last week), but as shown above the Grandfathered Plans Didn't. It's a scam, it's all a scam.

10:13 AM PT: One more issue on Grandfathered Plans via the Comments

Plans could acquire grandfathered status by adding those features to the existing ones, they did not have to already have them in place. Some of the elements, like the ""no lifetime cap"" one, were phased in over time, and therefore explicitly allowed adjustment of benefits in an existing plan. Coverage of children under 26 is not likely to be a feature that many plans had in early 2010, yet clearly insurance plans have added this feature. My current coverage has grandfathered status. It had some of these features, like no lifetime cap, other benefits have been added or modified to comply with the grandfathering requirements.

So, you got that? Grandfathered Plans are not written in unbendable, unbreakable Adamantium, they can and have been amended since 2010. They don't have to meet all the requirements of the ACA, just a few of them and have to have existed since before the law was passed and signed - That's All.

So let's go back and revisit ""If you like your plan, you can keep it"" as being flawed or wrong. It's NOT. Instead of amending the plans to meet minimum grandfather requirements they are being Shutdown By the Insurance Industries Choice, not by ObamaCare.

1:34 PM PT: One final point that puts the LIE to the claim that these plans couldn't meet the Grandfathered requirements is the fact that There's Nothing New Required of Grandfathered Plans This Year.

The Lifting of the Lifetime Spending Cap has been phased in since 2010.

The law restricts and phases out the annual dollar limits that all job-related plans, and individual health insurance plans issued after March 23, 2010, can put on most covered health benefits. Specifically, the law says that none of these plans can set an annual dollar limit lower than:

$750,000: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2010 but before September 23, 2011.

$1.25 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2011 but before September 23, 2012.

$2 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2012 but before January 1, 2014. No annual dollar limits are allowed on most covered benefits beginning January 1, 2014.

It's not like the ACA suddenly requires old insurance plans to do something this year, that they weren't essentially required to do last year - other than PAY peoples claims.

Similarly the ability to keep your children on your family plan isn't new, that was established in 2010.

ffective for Plan or Policy Years Beginning On or After September 23, 2010. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called on leading insurance companies to begin covering young adults voluntarily before the implementation date required by the Affordable Care Act (which is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23rd). Early implementation would avoid gaps in coverage for new college graduates and other young adults and save on insurance company administrative costs of dis-enrolling and re-enrolling them between May 2010 and September 23, 2010. Over 65 companies have responded to this call saying they will voluntarily continue coverage for young adults who graduate or age off their parents' insurance before the implementation deadline.

Lastly the requirement to spend at least 80% of your premiums on care and not administrative costs has already been in effect, that's why people have been getting rebate checks.

A new provision of the Affordable Care Act — called the Medical Loss Ratio, or the “80/20″ provision — could mean some Americans will see a rebate from their health insurance companies tomorrow. The provision is aimed at holding health insurance companies accountable for how they spend the money collected through premiums. It compares the dollars they spend on health care costs vs. other overhead costs — like marketing, salaries and administrative expenses.

Grandfathered plans don't have to cover pre-existing conditions. Grandfathered plans don't have to provide free preventive care services. (High Co-Pays and Deductibles can remain) Grandfathered plans can still limit yearly coverage (in the individual market).

In short, there is no New Special Expensive OBAMACARE Requirement on existing Grandfathered plans other the fact that the lifetime cap has gone from $2 Million to Infinite and they can't arbitrarily CANCEL your insurance between renewal periods. They can only do it at the end of you plan year, which is exactly what they're doing - simply because they can, not because Obamacare put some onerous expensive requirement on them.

Just about everything they were required by the ACA to do this year, they had to do LAST YEAR, and the year before that. Even more than when I first wrote this diary now believe these ""ObamaCare Cancellations"" are a SCAM."

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Story of the year,"The lie of the year, according to Politifact, is “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.” But the story of the year is a nation waking up to just how radical Obamacare is — which is why it required such outright deception to get it passed in the first place.

Obamacare was sold as simply a refinement of the current system, retaining competition among independent insurers but making things more efficient, fair and generous. Free contraceptives for Sandra Fluke. Free mammograms and checkups for you and me. Free (or subsidized) insurance for some 30 million uninsured. And, mirabile dictu, not costing the government a dime.

In fact, Obamacare is a full-scale federal takeover. The keep-your-plan-if-you-like-your-plan ruse was a way of saying to the millions of Americans who had insurance and liked what they had: Don’t worry. You’ll be left unmolested. For you, everything goes on as before.

That was a fraud from the very beginning. The law was designed to throw people off their private plans and into government-run exchanges where they would be made to overpay — forced to purchase government-mandated services they don’t need — as a way to subsidize others. (That’s how you get to the ostensible free lunch.)

It wasn’t until the first cancellation notices went out in late 2013 that the deception began to be understood. And felt. Six million Americans with private insurance have just lost it. And that’s just the beginning. By the Department of Health and Human Services’ own estimates, about 75 million Americans would have plans that their employers would have the right to cancel. And millions of middle-class workers who will migrate to the exchanges and don’t qualify for government subsidies will see their premiums, deductibles and co-pays go up.

It gets worse. The dislocation extends to losing one’s doctor and drug coverage, as insurance companies narrow availability to compensate for the huge costs imposed on them by the extended coverage and “free” services the new law mandates.

But it’s not just individuals seeing their medical care turned upside down. The insurance providers, the backbone of the system, are being utterly transformed. They are rapidly becoming mere extensions of the federal government.

Look what happened just last week. Health and Human Services unilaterally and without warning changed coverage deadlines and guidelines. It asked insurers to start covering people on Jan. 1 even if they signed up as late as the day before and even if they hadn’t paid their premiums. And is “strongly encouraging” them to pay during the transition for doctor visits and medicines not covered in their current plans (if covered in the patient’s previous — canceled — plan).

On what authority does a Cabinet secretary tell private companies to pay for services not in their plans and cover people not on their rolls? Where in Obamacare’s 2,500 pages are such high-handed dictates authorized? Does anyone even ask? The bill itself is simply taken as a kind of blanket warrant for HHS to run, regulate and control the whole insurance system.

Remember the uproar over forcing religious institutions to provide contraception coverage? The president’s “fix” was a new regulation ordering insurers to provide these services for free. Apart from the fact that this transparent ruse does nothing to resolve the underlying issue of conscience — God sees — by what right does the government order private companies to provide free services for anyone?

Three years ago I predicted that Obamacare would turn insurers into the lapdog equivalent of utility companies. I undershot. They are being treated as wholly owned subsidiaries. Take the phrase “strongly encouraging.” Sweet persuasion? In reality, these are offers insurers can’t refuse. Disappoint your federal master and he has the power to kick you off the federal exchanges, where the health insurance business of the future is supposed to be conducted.

Moreover, if adverse selection drives insurers into a financial death spiral — too few healthy young people to offset more costly, sicker, older folks — their only recourse will be a government bailout. Do they really want to get on the wrong side of the White House, their only lifeline when facing insolvency?

In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers.

I don’t care a whit for the insurance companies. They deserve what they get. They collaborated with the White House in concocting this scheme and are now being swallowed by it. But I do care about the citizenry and its access to a functioning, flourishing, choice-driven medical system.

Obamacare posed as a free-market alternative to a British-style single-payer system. Then, during congressional debate, the White House ostentatiously rejected the so-called “public option.” But that’s irrelevant. The whole damn thing is the public option. The federal government now runs the insurance market, dictating deadlines, procedures, rates, risk assessments and coverage requirements. It’s gotten so cocky it’s now telling insurers to cover the claims that, by law, they are not required to.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/25/Two-Cheers-for-Ted,2013-09-25 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Two Cheers for Ted,"The pundits in D.C. jeered as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) began his lengthy speech (a “fauxlibuster,” they joked) on Tuesday. Some cast it as a self-serving gesture, done to impress “dumb” people outside the Beltway who don’t get that defunding Obamacare just isn’t possible. But as the night wore on, it was clear that Cruz’s stand was as passionate and articulate an attack on Obamacare and a defense of liberty as the nation has ever seen.

A few even began to see its wisdom, circulating an essay by David Frum acknowledging that even a defeat served Cruz’s political purposes. Charles Krauthammer, who the day before had traded jokes about Cruz’s Canadian birth, acknowledged on Tuesday that he had executed a brilliant maneuver, if not to defeat Obamacare than to highlight its flaws, and to seize the mantle of leadership of a conservative movement needing inspiration.

What was most impressive about Cruz’s gambit, however, was not the strategy but the substance. In plain language, Cruz laid out the fundamental problems with Obamacare as policy, outlining the cost to working families in higher insurance premiums, dropped health plans, and lost work hours or job opportunities. He also reminded Washington of how the bill was passed, and upheld, in defiance of the people and the Constitution.

A few Democrats eventually wandered down to the Senate floor to debate Cruz, some to try poking holes in his arguments, reminding him that President Barack Obama had won a new mandate from the voters even after passing the Affordable Care Act. Cruz patiently, and deftly, handled their objections, noting that even the unions were turning against the law, and blasting both sides for approving congressional exemptions from it.

It was also difficult not to be moved by Cruz’s passion. No empty gesture could sustain the hours upon hours of explication, analysis, and debate that Cruz tackled on the Senate floor. Agree or disagree with his decision to force the issue into a debate over the budget and the debt ceiling, it is impossible not to be impressed by his sheer will, and by the self-evident sincerity of a man so fluent and ardent in his arguments.

It occurred to me that when I ran for Congress in 2010, and voters would urge me to “do something” if I got to Washington, that this is the type of “something” they meant. They know that a freshman in Congress is barely even worth his or her vote but that a person willing to take risks can change history. And millions went to bed last night knowing someone on Capitol Hill was, finally, keeping watch over their liberty as they slept.

There was one flaw in Cruz’s approach, however. It became clear in the reactions of those who might otherwise have supported his effort but were put off by his attacks on fellow Republicans. Cruz sometimes turned sincere disagreement over tactics into differences in courage and conviction. Despite Cruz’s moderate demeanor, his rhetoric sometimes reflected a political media culture mired in the language of absolutes.

Cruz has withstood intense hostility with uncommon grace, but he should reserve terms like “surrender caucus” and Neville Chamberlain analogies for real enemies if he wants to rally the broader support he deserves. Overall, however, his stand was brilliant. His remarks should be printed separately as a primer on Obamacare, and his tactics should inspire the opposition. He will soon run out of time. But he has turned the tide."

As expected, the bill to continue existing levels of federal spending through Nov. 15 passed, 54-44, along party lines. Before that, the Senate voted, 54-44, to remove the measure that would have eliminated funding for the Affordable Care Act.

The key vote came more than an hour earlier. Twenty-five Senate Republicans joined with the Democratic majority, voting, 79-19, to end a filibuster on the bill. The motion required 60 votes to pass.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had argued that a vote against the motion represented a final opportunity kill the healthcare law. Only 18 of the chamber’s 45 other Republicans joined him.

In a final floor speech before that vote, Cruz all but conceded defeat, acknowledging “Republican division on this issue.” But he insisted that the fight against Obamacare, as the legislation is commonly known, wasn’t over.

Noting that the House will send the bill back, he said, “I very much hope the next time this issue’s before this body in a few days, that all 46 Republicans are united against Obamacare and standing with the American people, that we listen to the American people the way Senate Democrats are not.”

Several of the House’s more conservative members joined Cruz on the Senate floor during the vote. Cruz has met this week with House Republicans to plot strategy ahead of House consideration of the Senate’s version of the spending bill.

The House will be in session this weekend for possible votes on the spending bill. If lawmakers there were to vote simply to approve the Senate version, a government shutdown would be averted with days to spare.

But Republican leadership there is under pressure to add new provisions that would undermine the healthcare law -- perhaps to repeal a tax on medical devices or pass a one-year delay of the requirement that individuals have health insurance -- and might have a chance of being passed in the Senate.

House GOP leaders have not yet indicated how they will respond to the Senate action after earlier strategies unraveled, and no immediate action on the spending measure was scheduled for Friday.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) assembled his leadership team Friday morning to consider alternatives that will be presented to lawmakers on Saturday.

“We’re reviewing our options,” Boehner’s spokesman said.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the House should simply pass the Senate bill.

“They can’t even negotiate with themselves,” she told reporters. “What they say in the morning doesn’t exist in the evening.”

If Congress fails to settle on a plan by midnight Monday, the federal government will see its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

Republicans who lined up against Cruz’s strategy explained that they were simply voting to move forward on a budget measure they supported. “I don’t understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter that I want to see passed,” said Sen. John Cornyn, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican and Cruz’s Texas colleague.

“There are some people across America that are so upset with Obamacare -- and I understand their frustration -- that say we ought to shut down the federal government,” Cornyn said. “It won’t work.”

Furthermore, those Republicans also said acting quickly to return the bill to the House served the cause of undermining the law, because the GOP majority there would have time to attach amendments putting curbs on Obama’s landmark healthcare legislation that might win approval in the Senate.

Cruz, in a more than 21-hour filibuster-like speech, interviews and more floor speeches, had insisted that the vote to move ahead on the bill was tantamount to a vote to sustain the healthcare law. If Republicans were united, he argued, the onus would be on Democrats to choose between the unpopular law and a government shutdown.

In an email sent Friday to supporters, Obama said the economy was being put at risk by “a group of far-right Republicans in Congress.”

“They refuse to pass a budget unless I let them sabotage Obamacare, something they know is not going to happen. Now, we’re left with only four days before a government shutdown,” he wrote. “This is reckless and irresponsible. Republicans are not focused on what’s best for you. They’re playing political games.”

The GOP’s divisions over Cruz’s strategy have largely played out behind closed doors, but they spilled into the open Thursday during a rare intraparty debate on the Senate floor. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Cruz and his conservative ally, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, were more interested in generating publicity for themselves than supporting an effort to quickly send the bill back to the House.

On Friday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the battle is “very dysfunctional.”

“We are dividing the Republican Party,” he said in an interview on CBS’ “This Morning.” “Rather than attacking Democrats and maybe trying to persuade those five or six Democrats who are in states that are leaning Republican, we are now launching attacks against Republicans funded by commercials that Senator Lee and Senator Cruz appear in.”

Health care helpers turn to paper, phones","Volunteers and staffers trying to help people sign up for health insurance on the new federal websites say they’ve turned to 20th-century technology after being frustrated by bottlenecks. They’re signing people up using telephones and paper applications.

Federal IT experts took down the new health insurance market at www.healthcare.gov Monday night and struggled well into Tuesday to get it up and running.

Users were able to create accounts and even got e-mails confirming they had signed in. but were then sent to an online “waiting room”. “We have a lot of visitors on the site right now. Please stay on this page,” it advised.

Dizzy Warren, Community Outreach Manager for Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, says her team is trying to keep people calm. Michigan is one of 36 states that is letting the federal government run its health insurance exchange, so people there have been hitting the online traffic jams.

“At this time we cannot honestly confirm how many people have been enrolled through the state,” Warren told reporters in a telephone briefing Tuesday.

“Some navigators have been able to help people over the telephone,” she added. “We have actually been encouraging them to make appointments with these individuals for some time next week.”

But Warren confirms what the federal government has been saying – a big part of the problem has been that so many people are trying to enroll. “All of our phones are ringing off the hook, even well beyond regular business hours,” she said.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is running the websites, says more people should be able to get through now, after some work to increase both capacity and efficiency of the network. “An extraordinary number of people are coming to check out HealthCare.gov. Traffic on the website and at the call center continues to be high, suggesting a strong interest by consumers in learning about their health coverage options,” CMS said in a statement.

“Our top issue is that too many people are coming to check out plans and find out more about the health care law.”

Jill Hanken, a health attorney at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said volunteers there are also advising people to come back next week or to call. Virginia is another one of the states relying on the federal site.

“We have been taking this opportunity to take a deep breath,” she said. “Our navigators are taking appointments so people can come in next week.”

But even some states running their own exchanges are straining. Maryland navigators said they turned to paper forms to help the most impatient people enroll in health insurance.

More than 174,000 people had visited Maryland’s website as of Sunday, the state said, but only 326 people had actually signed up for health insurance. “We are working around the clock to make the site better. Marylanders can use the system now, and they should also know that we expect the user experience to improve substantially in the days and weeks ahead,” officials there said in a statement.

Kentucky has been having fewer problems. Kentucky opted to run its own exchange. Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, used an executive order to push the plan through.

“I just did it,” Beshear said in an interview this week. “I issued an executive order. It’s just too important for our state.”

Barbara Gordon of Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency, one of the non-profit groups helping people enroll, said the state’s exchange had some problems the first day, but not since. “Statewide, the numbers indicated this morning that over 7,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in health insurance at the exchange,” she said. Kentucky has about 640,000 people without health insurance.

Some states report better progress. New York says 40,000 people have signed up on its state-run site, California says more than 16,000 have signed up and Washington state signed up 9,400 -- most of whom will go onto the state's expanded Medicaid program.

Despite the delays, groups like Hanken’s are still trying to reach out and encourage Virginia’s 1 million uninsured people to sign up for health insurance. “We don’t want to lose anybody, so we’ll make sure the public is aware when we get up to full speed,” Hanken said.

Ron Pollack of the non-profit group Families USA, which has been pushing to help publicize the health insurance exchanges, says he thinks people will keep trying. Anyone who signs up by Dec. 15 can buy a health insurance policy that starts coverage on Jan. 1 and people have until March 31 to get coverage in the 2014 open enrollment period.

“Given how significant health coverage is, especially for people who don’t have it today … I can’t imagine that people are going to give up, given what the stakes are,” Pollack said.

Mark Nelson, an Arizona insurance broker who has been trying to sign up on the federal exchange since it first opened a week ago, says he was finally able to set up an account Tuesday.



“However, the site is extremely unstable and temperamental. It erred out on the final page,” Nelson said via email. “I think I did get the info in so will see what I get back. I believe this is far too complicated and overly secured to simply get a rate.”"

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']",No alternatives to ObamaCare? Republicans rebut White House claim,"President Obama has tried to defend his health care plan lately by criticizing Republicans for trying to roll back ObamaCare without offering any alternatives -- despite the fact that Republicans have offered several.

In a White House news conference a week ago, the president said: ""They used to say, 'well, we're going to replace it with something better.' There's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.""

Moments later, Obama elaborated, saying ""they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I've been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just don't hear about it, because basically they don't have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates.""

The assertion makes some Republicans livid.

""For the president to say that no Republican member of Congress has put up a positive solution, or a solution to the health care challenge, is simply not true,"" said Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., who introduced his own health care bill before ObamaCare was even passed.

His wasn't the only one.

""I think the president has an incredibly short memory,"" said John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. ""He seems to have forgotten his campaign spent millions and millions of dollars attacking the John McCain health plan. In fact, that was their major argument against John McCain.""

After the campaign, that plan was championed in Congress and co-sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Goodman explains the plan ""would grant a refundable tax credit to every American. It would treat us all same, unlike ObamaCare. It would not discourage employers from hiring anyone. It would not push us all into part-time jobs.""

Goodman was referring to criticism that the current health care law will drive employers to push workers into part-time status, due to a provision that requires some employers to offer coverage to workers logging 30 hours or more per week. The White House denies this, with a top economic adviser arguing recently that there is ""no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working.""

One analyst says most Republican plans, including the Price plan, aim to give every American the same tax benefit as those who get tax-free employer-provided health insurance -- but put the power and the money under the individual's control.

Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute said those who pay the piper, call the tune.

""If your boss controls your health care spending, your boss gets to choose your insurance. If the government gets to control your health care spending, then they get to ration care,"" he said. ""If you control your own money, then you get more choice and more control over your health care dollars.""

Price emphasizes that his and other alternatives would let consumers choose what kind of insurance they want, while ObamaCare requires consumers to buy insurance and sets guidelines for what will be offered on the market.

""We ought to be moving in the direction of patient-centered health care,"" Price said. ""Which means patients and families and doctors making medical decisions, not Washington, D.C.""

Republicans are making clear they do indeed have alternatives, including ways to protect those with pre-existing conditions, in spite of the president's comments.

Their problem, analysts say, is they don't have a single national spokesman who can step forward and say ""this is the plan,"" in the same way the president can."

Congress is treated differently under Obamacare%2C but is not exempt

Taxpayers would continue to pay for congressional health benefits after exchanges start

Author of the congressional provision claims %22drafting error%22 in forcing Congress into exchanges

WASHINGTON — Of all the arguments against the Affordable Care Act that congressional Republicans are mustering in the debate over the spending bill, one hits closest to home. Congress, they say, is exempt from the very law that applies to everyone else.

The truth: Members of Congress are treated differently under Obamacare, but they're not exempt. In fact, by forcing them to purchase health insurance through publicly run exchanges, they're impacted more by that key provision than similar employees in private sector — or even in government.

But members of Congress will also be able to purchase their insurance under terms that are more favorable than other employees — in government or in business — who have access to employer-provided health care.

Here's the history: During the 2010 debate over the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed an amendment requiring members of Congress and their staffs to purchase health insurance though state exchanges. Democrats, viewing the amendment as a political stunt, co-opted the idea as their own and inserted it into the bill.

But the provision was silent about who would pay for that insurance, or how those payments would be treated. The exchanges were intended for uninsured people who couldn't get health insurance through their employer or qualify for Medicaid. Those who had access to health benefits meeting minimum coverage levels could still purchase insurance on the exchanges — but without a subsidy and using after-tax income.

Holding members of Congress and their staffs to that standard would have the effect of stripping them of the employer-paid health coverage they currently get, which is the same as any other federal employee. So the Office of Personnel Management issued a proposed rule in August making clear that the government would continue to pay the employer contribution for congressional health benefits at the same rate as if members were still on the federal plan.

Grassley now says that was his intent all along. ""My goal, regardless of how the amendment was worded … was that we need to go into the exchange so that we would have to go through the same red tape as every other citizen,"" he told Roll Call Thursday. But because of what Grassley called a ""drafting error,"" the amendment left out language that would have explicitly given lawmakers the same before-tax employer contribution as any other federal employee gets.

Some of Grassley's Republican colleagues have a different interpretation. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the spending bill that would have required members of Congress to pay the full cost of their health care.

""We're on a timetable, a collision course, where unless we act a horrible policy and illegal Obama administration rule will go into effect,"" Vitter said on the Senate floor Thursday. ""And the rule says for members and any staff who do go to the exchange, they do get to take a big fat taxpayer-funded subsidy with them — a subsidy that's completely unavailable to any other American at that income level going into the exchange.""

To complicate matters, some congressional staffers would not be subject to the special treatment of Congress under Obamacare. The Grassley amendment applies to ""all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a member of Congress, whether in Washington, D.C., or outside Washington, DC.""

The Office of Personnel Management said ""official office"" might not include staffers who work for a committee or leadership office — and left it up to each member of Congress to decide which staffers would be forced out of the federal health plan and into the exchanges.

DelBene is the former head of Microsoft%27s Office division

Kurt DelBene announced his retirement from Microsoft in July

WASHINGTON — Kurt DelBene, former president of the Microsoft Office Division, will replace Jeff Zients as the administration's point person on HealthCare.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday.

""Jeff did an outstanding job working with our team to provide management advice and counsel on the HealthCare.gov project,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a blog post. ""Today, the site is night and day from what it was when it launched on October 1.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama discussed the new appointment during his meeting today with a group of high-tech executives. DelBene will work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

""He starts tomorrow,"" Carney said. He cited the appointee's background and experience: ""He is uniquely suited to this task.""

Zients came in after HealthCare.gov's dismal rollout Oct. 1 to fix the site. He quickly brought in outside technology experts to determine the problems, initiated software and hardware upgrades, and began daily briefings with the press so the public would understand what the government was doing to fix the problem. He promised the site would be operational by Nov. 30, and the government was able to reach that goal.

""Kurt will work closely with me, the White House, and the teams and senior leadership in place at HHS and CMS to see this project through its next important phase as the CMS team continues to build on their initial progress,"" Sebelius wrote. ""He has agreed to serve in this role for at least the first half of next year.""

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., praised the White House for appointing a long-term director of the project.

""Although Colorado's health exchange has not experienced the difficulties of HealthCare.gov, Mr. DelBene's appointment is a good step toward achieving the goal of giving all consumers — regardless of where they live — a functioning marketplace to find and compare health plans,"" Udall said.

Sebelius said several lawmakers, including Udall, had provided advice in the new appointment.

Sebelius said DelBene would provide oversight and advice on everything from technology to marketing, as well as execute the existing plan.

""The President and I believe strongly in having one person, with strong experience and expertise in management and execution, who is thinking 24/7 about HealthCare.gov,"" she wrote. He will continue to work with QSSI, the general contractor for HealthCare.gov.

The government also released statements from technology executives who have worked with DelBene in the past.

""Kurt is a talented and capable executive, with a track record of successfully managing complex large-scale technology projects,"" said Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder. ""Working with Kurt over many years, I know him to be a passionate advocate for using technology to solve difficult problems at scale. I'm certain he'll make an important positive contribution in his new role with HHS.""

DelBene stepped down from Microsoft in July as part of a reorganization announced by CEO Steve Ballmer, who then announced his own retirement in August.

DelBene's wife, Suzan, a Democratic U.S. House member from Washington state, is also a former Microsoft executive."

USA TODAY

Consumers taking a more active role in their care could push premiums down

Medicare Part D experience shows how industry competition influenced premiums

Insurers say they want more customers to balance their pool of insured patients

WASHINGTON — Market forces and an impetus to attract younger, healthier people into the insurance market will help keep health insurance premiums lower as the 2010 health care law takes effect on Jan. 1, industry analysts and insurance officials say.

""If they price too high, young people won't buy insurance, and that's going to hurt the companies,"" said Jay Angoff, who led initial implementation of the law for HHS. ""They need these people to come in. It's an industry problem.""

Starting Jan. 1, most Americans will be required to buy insurance or pay a fine. Insurers may not turn away these customers because of pre-existing conditions, age or gender, so Americans previously unable to buy insurance are likely to sign up by the millions. The changing health environment, say industry figures and analysts, will offer these new customers:

• Consumer-driven health policies that require people to pay more attention to their costs or receive rewards for healthy actions — such as annual health exams, the use of generic medications and programs that correct chronic conditions. These features will help drive down premiums, said Tom Richards, president of individual plans for health insurer Cigna.

""Broadly, we're trying to attract a wide swath of people of all ages and health conditions,"" Richards said. But he does expect premiums to go up in the individual market.

• A general industry push to keep premiums low to attract customers, just as what happened with the implementation of Medicare's Part D prescription drug program, said Jon Kingsdale, who directed Massachusetts' health exchanges when that state started its health care program.

Companies assumed only sick Medicare patients would join the program, so they priced premiums higher to compensate for higher costs, Kingsdale said. But the plans with lower premiums attracted a broader range of patients and eventually captured more of the market.

""If you bet that you'll get sick people so you price high, you will discourage younger people from joining your plan,"" he said. ""If you price more aggressively, thinking you'll attract more enrollees, you'll get healthier people.""

Individual premiums over the past two years in Massachusetts have dropped 12%, said Joel Ario, managing director at Manatt Health Solutions and former director of health insurance exchanges under President Obama.

""I think that's what most people (think) will happen in this market, too,"" he said, referring to the new federal and state exchanges. ""The single risk pool will be more stable than ever because it will be based on the whole pool's experience.""

While the insurance industry wants to keep premiums low, there are parts of the health care law that may drive costs higher, said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. One factor is the requirement that insurers must provide more comprehensive coverage, which means someone will have to pay for the additional services that must be covered by insurance.

That, Zirkelbach said, can drive up premiums for even those consumers who want to buy catastrophic-coverage plans or those with fewer benefits.

""The industry is focused on affordability,"" he said, adding that there is a move toward wellness programs, lowering out-of-pocket costs for those who choose higher-quality and lower-cost providers, and working with hospitals to move away from fee-for-service payment systems.

Insurers know the subsidies included in the law for Americans who make less than 400% of the poverty level — about $92,000 for a family of four — will help offset increased premiums for young people, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group.

To him, the arguments for fewer taxes on insurers or the ability to charge more for those with pre-existing conditions to make up for fewer young people are moot.

Just how much premiums will change depends on the state you live in, Kingsdale said.

Individual premiums decreased when Massachusetts' health care took effect, he said, because the state already had high-priced and insurers were not allowed to turn away the sick and could not charge large premium differences based on age, gender and health.

""Other states will see exactly the opposite happen,"" he said. ""Their premiums tend to be quite low, but they're getting skimpy insurance.""

In Oregon, Ario said, large differences in premium prices have already appeared.

In one case, a 40-year-old non-smoker in Oregon could buy a low-cost or bronze-level plan for $162 a month from one company or the same plan from another for $400 a month, Ario said. Anti-trust laws prevented the insurers from comparing pricing before developing their premiums.

When the companies with the higher rates saw their competitors' lower premiums, he said, they asked the state to allow them to file for reduced premiums.

""The good news is that in most marketplaces, there will be some carriers that will be bold and price competitively to get more market share,"" Ario said."

Smith told NBC News that she ""just instantly burst into tears"" when she was able yesterday to sign up for a $3.19 a month health insurance policy through Obamacare.

Smith described the low-cost of her federally-subsidized plan as ""totally mind-blowing"" and praised the Obamacare call center agent who assisted her sign-up as ""the most loveliest of helpers.""

Previously, the aging Smith had been uninsured. The company for which Smith is a medical transcriptionist does not offer coverage to its employees.

""They took a vote at the company and people wanted more money in their pockets,"" Smith was reported as saying. ""I have had four paycuts in one year.""

Smith's new, highly affordable Obamacare policy will cover her household, including her unemployed husband Eric, age 56.

Republicans who are praying for the failure of Obamacare do not want stories like the one told by JoAnn Smith to get out, but Smith's Obamacare success story bodes well for Democrats running for re-election in 2014.

Smith had been trying to sign up for health insurance for the past two months, but Obamacare's rocky rollout and website glitches had prevented her from doing so successfully.

Smith expressed continued shock that after months of difficulty, Obamacare's sign-up process is now working well enough that her application 'took seconds to complete' according to NBC. Smith now only has to confirm payment with her new insurer:

""I am kind of afraid to call them because I feel like it's a trick. I am afraid I will call and they will say 'JoAnn who?'""

Obamacare backers aim for the law to improve the quality of healthcare for Americans by:

Providing insurance federally through healthcare.gov

Providing insurance through state-based website exchanges

Providing coverage by increasing the availability of Medicaid

Eliminating insurance denials or extra charges based on gender or pre-existing health status

Eliminating junk insurance policies and instead setting national standard for high quality coverage

Those new national standards include requirements that policies always cover prescriptions, hospitalizations, and emergency room care. The standards have led insurers to cancel the junk policies of Americans whose previous insurance did not include these benefits, deemed essential by Obamacare, rather add the benefits to those plans.

Those cancellations combined with rollout glitches led to weeks of bad press for Obamacare. Success stories like that of JoAnn Smith might indicate that many Americans will instead find cheaper coverage through Obamacare, and that the health overhaul's worst days have passed."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/news/economy/obamacare-enrollment/index.html,2013-10-01 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],Obamacare enrollment: How do I sign up?,"It's E-day for Obamacare.

People can now enroll in health care coverage in the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges -- the centerpiece of Obama's landmark legislation. Coverage begins in 2014, but folks must sign up by Dec. 15 if they want coverage to begin Jan. 1.

But despite the run up to the Oct 1 launch date, Americans remain largely in the dark about the exchanges. Six in 10 people are not aware of the exchanges, according to a new survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that promotes better access to and quality of health care. Knowledge is even scanter among the uninsured -- who would most benefit from the exchanges. More than two-thirds of the uninsured are unaware of the exchanges.

While the enrollment process will vary a bit depending on the state, here's a general guideline to how to sign up for a policy on the exchange.

All Americans can start at healthcare.gov, the federal online Obamacare portal. You'll be asked to enter your state.

If you live in a state that's running its own exchange, you will be directed there or you can just go directly to your state's exchange website. Those in the states where the federal government is running the exchange will apply through the federal portal.

Share your story: Are you planning to sign up for Obamacare this week?

You must then set up an account and provide information, such as your name, address, age, number of people in your family, household income, employer and whether you have access to insurance elsewhere. You'll also have to say whether you are a smoker, since insurance carriers can charge tobacco users more.

You can also apply for a federal subsidy, which may require you to provide pay stubs and certain tax forms if the income you enter doesn't match Internal Revenue Service records. Enrollees should learn instantly whether they qualify for the subsidy, which they can apply to insurance coverage right away. You'll also find out whether you are eligible for Medicaid, and whether you can enroll your children in the government health program for kids, known as CHIP.

Then comes the enrollment process. Applicants can learn about the various insurance policies available in their area, including deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, doctor networks and benefits packages. Plans can be sorted by premiums and various other criteria and can be compared side by side.

You can then enroll and opt to set up premium payments online or call the carrier's customer service department for additional payment options.

(Some technical glitches in a few places may prevent residents in certain states from completing the enrollment process online in the first few weeks, but they can register and look at the options and rates available to them.)

There are a variety of ways to get your questions answered.

Applicants can use a live chat feature on the federal portal or call the help line at 800-318-2596 to get assistance with enrollment. States are also staffing call centers to assist residents with enrollment. Applications can also be mailed in.

Obamacare: Your 12 biggest questions answered

Those who need more hand-holding can go to a variety of groups for in-person help, mostly non-profits or health centers funded by the federal government. Experts, including ""navigators"" and certified application counselors, will be on hand to answer questions and walk people through the application process.

To find this assistance, go to localhelp.healthcare.gov on the federal portal and type in your zip code. You can also go to getcoveredamerica.org or text ""covered"" to 877877 to get a list from Enroll America, a non-profit aimed at boosting participation in Obamacare.

In Florida, which has one of the highest shares of uninsured Americans, navigators will sit with enrollees and guide them through the process, said Lean Barber-Heinz, interim executive director of Florida CHAIN, a consumer health care advocacy group. Florida CHAIN, for instance, is holding an enrollment fair on Saturday, Oct. 5 at a St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, where navigators will be on hand to help people both with the technology and with understanding the choices they have.

""The marketplace is really designed for people to be able to navigate it themselves,"" she said, of the federal portal. ""But the help will be available.""

Enrollees can also go to independent, licensed insurance agents and brokers to review their options. The agents and brokers are not allowed to push one insurer's products, but can walk consumers through all the different policies, their deductibles and benefits.

Though enrollment is now open, people don't have to sign up right away. You can pick a policy as late as March 31, but if you wait until the last minute, your coverage won't begin until May."
http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-scramble-to--fix--obama-s-trouble-health-care-law-213354029.html,,[],Democrats scramble to fix Obama's troubled health care law,"Democrats aren’t running through the halls of Congress with their hair on fire yet, but anxiety over the possible blowback from the federal health care law is growing by the day.

Between the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov and the fact that millions of Americans are poised to lose their current health insurance coverage at the end of the year despite a promise from President Barack Obama that they would be able to keep their plans “no matter what,” congressional Democrats are scrambling to cover their hides before next year’s midterm elections.

A handful of Senate Democrats have leapt to support a proposal from Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, who's facing a tough re-election campaign in 2014, that would allow Americans with already existing insurance plans to keep them even if they don’t meet the quality guidelines established by the Affordable Care Act.



House Democrats on Wednesday held a closed-door meeting with White House officials, where some members vented frustration with the administration over the law's handling and demanded a solution by the end of the week.



Republicans, not surprisingly, are working to leverage the Obamacare problems for political gain.

In a speech on the Senate floor last week, Landrieu suggested that she had been misled when she voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

""When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,"" she said. ""A promise was made, and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept.""

It's hard to see how that would be the case, given that millions of Americans at the time who were insured on private plans held policies that did not meet the minimum requirements set by the law. (Many Republicans at the time warned that this would be a consequence.)

So far, Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Dianne Feinstein of California have co-sponsored Landrieu's proposal. Hagan, Merkley and Pryor are up for re-election next year while Feinstein and Manchin are not.



On Wednesday, another lawmaker facing re-election in 2014, Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, introduced his own legislation that would allow Americans facing cancellations to keep their current plan for up to two years.

Story continues

Landrieu and Udall's cause received a kick-start earlier this week when former President Bill Clinton, who has long advocated in favor of the health care law, said he thought the law should be changed to let people keep their current plans.

“I personally believe — even if it takes a change in the law — the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,” Clinton said in an interview with the website Ozy.com.

These new Democratic efforts to “fix” Obamacare, however, could actually prove disastrous for the law.

The Department of Health and Human Services has already struggled to persuade people to sign up for insurance plans through the federal exchanges. Despite Obama’s oft-repeated promise, allowing people to keep their existing plans could suck millions of potential customers out of the exchanges — customers the law relies on to remain sustainable.

Neither the White House nor Senate Democatic Leader Harry Reid have taken a position on the Democratic senators' proposals.

On Wednesday, Reid said he planned to hold a rare Thursday meeting with all Senate Democrats and White House officials to consider the new proposals. Reid declined to comment on anything related to health care during his weekly press conference, saying he would have more details after Thursday’s meeting.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the president is looking into “options.”

“The president has instructed his team to come up with options for him to review,” Carney told reporters on Wednesday. “And you can expect a decision from him and announcement from him sooner rather than later on options that we can take to address the problem that we've been discussing here with regards to those individuals who have had their individual insurance plans cancelled because of the transition to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.""

Senate Republicans appeared positively gleeful about the Demorats’ efforts to change the law.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested he would not support Landrieu’s bill if it came for a vote.

“We think the thing ought to be repealed and replaced entirely. We think it can’t possibly work,” McConnell said. “And I’m somewhat suspicious about red state Democrats who are up in ’14 trying to promote some way out of their political dilemma. If they really want to fix Obamacare, they will join with us, repeal it and start over step by step to deal with the problem, which was the number of people uninsured.”

In the House, Republican Rep. Fred Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has unveiled his own proposal to allow people to stay on their current plans. House Republican leaders have scheduled a vote on the bill for Friday, and it is expected to pass with at least some Democratic support.

Meanwhile, House Republican committee chairmen continue to hammer away at federal officials and private contractors responsible for the law's implementation.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, for instance, hauled in IT specialists working to fix the website for a hearing about their progress.

Under questioning, the panel reported that the federal government had already spent “north of $600 million” on the project as of late September and even more during the repair process.

""The site is getting better week by week,” said Todd Park, the White House’s chief technology officer for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. “Some days are better than others."""
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/05/news/economy/obamacare-exchanges/index.html,2013-09-05 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],Avoiding Obamacare exchanges,"Americans who buy their own health insurance next year won't have to get coverage through their state-based exchange.

Many insurers will offer individual policies outside the Obamacare exchanges in 2014. Consumers can avoid the exchanges by buying plans directly from insurers or through brokers.

But should they?

First, anyone earning less than 400% of the poverty line will be eligible for federal subsidies toward exchange-based plans, so going off the exchange would likely not make sense.

But those who make too much to qualify for subsidies should look both on and off the exchanges for a plan that best fits their needs, experts say.

The off-exchange policies are required to have many of the same Obamacare protections as plans sold on the exchanges, like maternity and mental health benefits, plus insurers can't exclude enrollees because of pre-existing conditions. Only a handful of current individual policies that meet strict guidelines will be grandfathered in.

So why might one want to go off the exchange?

#1: Possible better coverage: Some insurers may opt to offer richer policies or continue grandfathered plans off the exchange to hold onto long-time customers. These policies may have more comprehensive doctors' networks or lower drug co-pays ... with a higher premium to boot, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, an advisory company for insurers. But they could be more attractive to current customers than the exchange policies, which may be more restrictive in order to keep premiums under control.

Share your story: Will you just pay the Obamacare penalty?

But some insurers intend to sell the same plans -- with the same premiums -- both on and off the exchange. Those companies are betting on other advantages to make their plans attractive.

#2: Less paperwork: The off-exchange policies may also attract enrollees who won't want the additional work of going through the exchange, which involves gathering pay stubs or W2 forms, settling up an account and waiting for income and citizenship status to be verified by federal agencies.

""You don't necessarily need to go through the extra steps of applying for an exchange policy if you are not subsidy eligible,"" said Bruce Allen, marketing director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, which is selling policies both on and off the exchange there. ""We can get you enrolled in minutes.""

#3: Less government involvement: Some consumers have also told Blue Cross that they intend to go off the exchange because they don't want anything to do with Obamacare, either because they oppose it politically or they equate it with government assistance programs such as Medicaid.

But shopping off the exchange has its challenges. One thing that will be tougher for consumers opting to buy insurance off the exchange is comparing plans and premiums. The exchanges will have websites where consumers can browse through the various plans being offered. But policies available outside the exchange will be sold primarily through independent agents or insurance companies, which could make it harder for consumers to weigh their options.

""Compared to the exchanges, the off-the-exchange market for consumers will continue to be the Wild West in regards to shopping and comparing benefits and prices,"" said Kevin Lucia, senior research fellow at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms."

GOP talking about killing Obamacare is a liability,"The financial planner told a group of older voting Conservatives that Obamacare was good for their financial well-being. Ironically, a commenter on the post in the same age bracket had the same experience with another group. Now that reality has set in, money managers are advising baby boomers appropriately.

On Monday the New York Times had an excellent article titled “In New Health Law, a Bridge to Medicare.” It details the benefits for those retiring before they qualify for Medicare and the benefits for Americans with pre-existing conditions that had to stay on their jobs lest they would be left without health care. The following paragraphs from the article are prescient.

THE sweeping federal health care law making its major public debut next month was meant for people like Juanita Stonebraker, 63, from Oakland, Md., who retired from her job in a hospital billing office a year and a half ago. She was able to continue her health insurance coverage from the hospital for a time, but when she tried to find an individual policy on her own, none of the insurers she contacted would cover her because she was diabetic. “I didn’t even get to tell them about the heart attack,” said Ms. Stonebraker, who has been without health insurance since July. She is a little over a year away from qualifying for Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. She now worries a recent hospitalization will leave her several thousand dollars in debt. Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, insurers must now offer coverage to people like Ms. Stonebraker, and they will not be able to set the premiums they charge on the basis of someone’s health. Starting Oct. 1, she and millions of other Americans are expected to be able to buy one of the plans available through newly created online state marketplaces, or exchanges, for coverage that begins in 2014. For those with low incomes, subsidies are available to help pay premiums.



Does anyone know anyone over 50 without some pre-existing condition that an insurance company would not have used to deny coverage entirely or red-lined some pre-existing ailment from coverage?

At this point it is unnecessary to attempt to have any type of argument with Obamacare naysayers. This is the time for the enlightened to help relatives, neighbors and friends to navigate their health insurance head winds. One should encourage them to discuss their medical situation and where applicable hold their hands to assist in getting the coverage they need. One should encourage them to get their information from healthcare.gov and not from political radicals maligning the law.

In a state like Texas where more than 25 percent of the population is uninsured, every fourth person you are in contact with is likely uninsured and a fall or accident away from a bankruptcy inducing medical bill. Many of the uninsured are unaware that Obamacare is the law of the land and are unaware of the benefits that will materially make their lives better.

Given that when Americans are provided with the individual benefits of Obamacare they love it, one should personalize the way it is explained with the specific benefits one's relative, neighbor, or friend's need in such a manner that the benefits are stressed and not the politics. This will ultimately prevent that carnal resistance that can cause someone to make decisions against their own interest to save face.

Many part time workers will face employers like Trader Joe’s who may find it more economical to send those employees to state health insurance exchanges. While many corporations will blame Obamacare, over the years corporations have been offloading health care costs. One should explain that as more and more employees go to the exchanges the exchanges become more economical. Moreover not being tethered to the employer’s health care plan allows one to make decisions based on work satisfaction and not the requirement for health care.

Dissuade those opting for paying the penalty instead of premiums by reminding them that the new policies cover screenings at no additional charge. After all, many of the uninsured have been without insurance for many years and in need of physicals and screenings.

As Obamacare becomes more and more real to Americans, they won’t necessarily claim to like it. However, they will not want to give it up for an alternative that does not exist. They won’t leave it for financial insecurity. Henceforth that is the biggest fear of the Republicans that oppose the bill. Americans will see Republicans as a liability to their well-being if they continue to disparage a law they come to see as beneficial."

It may be cold and gloomy outside today but it is warm and sunny in my world. This message is long overdue…it has been weighing heavily on me how much gratitude I owe each and every one of you. The unbelievable outpouring of support from ABC began from the first moment I received my diagnosis. Phone calls, emails, cards, flowers, blankets, care packages, food, pajamas, slippers, help with insurance, medical advice….The list goes on and on…It was truly overwhelming how many of you thought of everything anyone could possibly want or need during a time of medical crisis. It brought so many tears of joy to my eyes and warmed my heart more than you’ll ever know to see what my ABC family did for me and for my entire family. In fact, there have been so many emails, it may take me weeks to get back to each and every one of you!

Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger. I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful. I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well. There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.

My prognosis is good, I got very lucky finding the cancer through our ABC sponsored mammogram and I got lucky choosing an aggressive approach, bilateral mastectomy, because while in surgery last week my surgeon found a second, undetected malignant tumor. No MRI, no mammogram, no sonogram had found it…it was only through the mastectomy that she discovered it. My cancer had spread to my sentinel lymph node, but not beyond, so I will have more treatments ahead of me, but none that will take me out of work. As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work.

Your support and love has made this all an experience that has given me the strength to fight the fear and hopefully help others do the same in the days/weeks/years to come!

With much love,

Some have suggested the penalty could be delayed, given the problems with the Web site might prevent people who otherwise want insurance from obtaining it.

The White House on Wednesday announced it would give Americans six weeks longer than previously thought -- until March 31 -- to enroll before facing a penalty, but also said the change had nothing to do with the Web site problems.

""Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them,"" the letter states. ""Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.""

The letter doesn’t state how long the senators would like to extend open enrollment, only that it should be beyond March 31. One of the signers, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), called for a two-month delay in remarks on Thursday. Separately, another Democratic senator, Joe Manchin (W.Va.), has called for a one-year delay in the individual mandate.

The signatories to the letter are Shaheen and Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Hagan (D-N.C.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).

Begich, Pryor, Landrieu and Hagan are all top GOP targets in red states in 2014, and Bennet is likely to be targeted in 2016. (Shaheen and Mark Udall face reelection in swing states in 2014 but aren't considered among Republicans' top targets.)

Feinstein stands out as a long-time liberal senator from California. Tom Udall is considered largely safe for reelection in New Mexico next year and Heinrich was just elected in 2012 in the same state.

Here's the text of Shaheen's letter:

Dear Secretary Sebelius:

When fully implemented, the Affordable Care Act represents a bold step forward in reforming our nation’s health care system. It has the potential to improve the quality of care we all receive and provides the opportunity for millions of Americans to purchase quality, affordable health insurance.

The newly created federal and state health insurance marketplaces are intended to allow consumers the opportunity to compare health insurance options and find a plan that fits their needs and their budgets. For three years, we have been eagerly waiting for the launch of these marketplaces. However, now that the marketplaces are open, we have become discouraged and frustrated with the problems and interactions that are occurring with the Affordable Care Act’s federally-administered website, healthcare.gov.

As long as these substantial technology glitches persist, we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans. Our constituents are frustrated, and we fear that the longer the website is not functional, opportunities for people to log on, learn about their insurance choices, and enroll will be lost.

Given the existing problems with healthcare.gov and other state-run marketplace websites that depend on the federally-administered website, we urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014. Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them. Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.

The Affordable Care Act has already had a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans; seniors are now paying less for their prescription drugs, critical preventive care services are available for free and important work is being done to improve the quality of care we receive. Americans will now have the opportunity to receive tax credits to purchase quality health insurance, and starting in January 2014, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or drop coverage if someone is sick.

We appreciate your efforts to fully implement this law and look forward to working with you to accomplish that goal. Thank you for considering our requests to extend the open enrollment period if the healthcare.gov substantial technology glitches continue."

Washington (CNN) - News that the Obama administration met critical repair goals for HealthCare.gov brought almost no applause from Capitol Hill Sunday, with just a few members of Congress responding to the website progress report at all.

Of those who responded, most either indicated that they expect more issues or that they saw the website as the beginning of Obamacare's problems.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='LisaDCNN']

""Based on past performance, it would be prudent to wait before determining that the website truly is fixed,"" wrote Doug Heye, deputy chief of staff for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.

As in news conferences and statements in the past two weeks, Heye and other Republicans focused less on the website and more on problems they see with the Affordable Care Act itself.

""Millions of Americans being informed that the health care plans they liked are being canceled - despite the President's repeated assurances otherwise - and being forced to pay higher premiums, deductibles, or both, are a much greater priority than a broken website,"" the Cantor aide told CNN.

House Speaker John Boehner's office gave a similar statement to CNN Sunday.

""This isn't just about a broken website, it's about a fundamentally-flawed law,"" wrote Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

""Website is least of Obamacare's problems,"" echoed Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Twitter.

""You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the first impression here was terrible,"" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, said on ABC's “This Week.” ""And I think it's going to be an unfolding disaster for the president.""

Democrats offered mixed reactions.

""We're getting to a point where, yes, there are a few problems we're working through now, but we can see the end of the era,"" said Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, on ABC's ""This Week"". Ellison said Obamacare will lead to a time ""where people will be able to get sick and get care and not worry about being dropped ... or going bankrupt.""

""The administration has hit some big benchmarks,"" praised Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, on NBC's “Meet the Press.” But he added that problems may continue. ""This is going to take some time before (the website) is up and kicking in full gear ... We should be working together to fix it every day."""

He chose one of the cheapest plans “as a show of support” for the millions of Americans his administration is trying to steer towards the new online exchanges.



All presidents and their immediate families get coverage through the military. As Commander-in-Chief, any president has a personal physician and he and his family get full care at the White House Medical Unit and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.

Obama didn’t wait until the last possible minute, a White House official says. Monday’s the last day to enroll on the federal exchange and on most of the state exchanges as well as Washington, D.C.’s, exchange.

“Over the weekend and in advance of today's deadline, the president enrolled in a health care plan made available by the Affordable Care Act on the D.C. marketplace,” the official said.



Obama, who is on vacation in Hawaii, had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him, a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person, in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities.

“The act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president's health care will continue to be provided by the military,” the official added.

“But he was pleased to participate in a plan as a show of support for these marketplaces which are providing quality, affordable health care options to more than a million people. The president selected a bronze plan.” Bronze plans have the lowest premiums and tend to have higher deductlbles.

Obama doesn’t qualify for a federal subsidy to help pay premiums, both because of his income and because he is already covered.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-administration-pushes-back-over-canceled-health-plans-002343897--sector.html,,[],Obama administration pushes back over canceled health plans,"By David Morgan and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration, under pressure over the botched opening of its healthcare website, scrambled on Tuesday to try to appease hundreds of thousands of people whose coverage is being canceled as insurers prepare for reforms in 2014. President Barack Obama and his top officials are trying to contain the fallout from people angry they have lost their insurance and frustrated with being unable to shop easily for alternatives on the malfunctioning website, HealthCare.gov. Obama had repeatedly promised that under the new signature law, people with insurance would be able to keep their existing plans if they wanted to - a pledge that glossed over details of which policies would be protected from new minimum benefit requirements. ""The president, as awesomely powerful as the office is, can't go back in time,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters when asked whether Obama would use the same words to describe the grandfathering provision. Obama's Chief of Staff Denis McDonough urged a group of insurance executives on Tuesday to tell consumers in cancellation notices that they could qualify for premium tax credits through the new online marketplaces. Some cancellation victims hear only about costly replacement plans from their insurers and not about options available through the marketplaces, including the subsidies. ""He's saying that we all need to do the best we can in getting information that consumers need,"" Carney said. OBAMA TO DALLAS, SEBELIUS ON THE HILL On Wednesday, Obama will visit volunteers in Dallas who are helping people sign up for health insurance - part of a push for senior officials to highlight the program in cities with the highest number of uninsured residents. In Dallas County, more than 670,000 people or 28 percent of the total population do not have insurance, the White House said. Texas has the nation's highest percentage of uninsured people. Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will face tough questions at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Wednesday, both from Republicans who oppose Obamacare as an unwarranted expansion of the federal government, and from Democrats dismayed at how poorly the launch has gone. Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the federal agency responsible for the Obamacare rollout told lawmakers on Tuesday that her staff is working on a plan to get more information to people with canceled plans. ""This is actually a conversation we're having today ... Is there a way we can actively engage to reach out to people who have been canceled?"" Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. In California, officials announced that a major insurer - Blue Shield of California Life and Health Insurance Co - has agreed to allow 115,000 state consumers who had been notified of cancellations to keep their lower-priced policies through the first quarter of next year. SUBPOENAED REPORTS Under Obamacare, it is mandatory for everyone to have health insurance or pay a fine. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million Americans would sign up for insurance in the first year. The administration had expected about 800,000 enrollees in October and November. But the problems reduced that to a trickle. The government will release the month's enrollment figures next week. On Tuesday, a U.S. House of Representatives oversight panel subpoenaed the Obama administration for internal reports on enrollment. Officials are racing to fix the website's problems by the end of November in hopes that people will be able to enroll by December 15. Two hospital operators - Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Holdings Inc - said on Tuesday that HealthCare.gov's technical problems were gradually diminishing. The law calls for new coverage to kick in on January 1, although the ultimate deadline for signing up without penalty is March 31. During a 2-1/2 hour hearing in the Senate on Tuesday, even members of Obama's Democratic party made plain their concerns. ""There's been fear, doubt and a crisis of confidence,"" said Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat. ""What I worry about is that there's such a crisis of confidence that people won't enroll."" Tavenner said the administration plans to start a four-month media campaign in selected markets next month aimed at bringing back uninsured Americans, particularly young adults, who were unable to enroll. The administration also will continue to try to shame state Republican governments which have opted out of expanding Medicaid programs for the poor such as Texas - part of what Obama's visit to the state will highlight on Wednesday. ""These are the folks who do not have the access to healthcare, and if they do, it's too expensive for them in the jobs that they have,"" said Garnet Coleman, a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Expanding Medicaid in Texas would mean about $24 billion in federal revenue to Texas over three years, reducing the costs of ""uncompensated care"" for people who show up at emergency rooms without any insurance - costs currently covered by property taxes, said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, a Democrat, who spoke to reporters on a conference call organized by the White House.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/bloomberg-latest-anti-smoking-push-require-stores-hide-174231138--politics.html,,[],Bloomberg’s latest anti-smoking push would require stores to hide cigarettes,"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is pushing for a new citywide law requiring stores to physically conceal cigarettes and other tobacco products behind counters, curtains or cabinets—anywhere out of public view—as part of a new anti-smoking initiative.

The legislation would also increase penalties on the smuggling and illegal sales of cigarettes as part of an effort that Bloomberg said would help curb the youth smoking rate and promote a healthier New York City.

“New York City has dramatically lowered our smoking rate, but even one new smoker is one too many—especially when it’s a young person,” Bloomberg said at a press conference on Monday. “Young people are targets of marketing and the availability of cigarettes, and this legislation will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking.”

The push comes just days after a judge overturned regulation backed by Bloomberg that would have limited the sales of large sugary drinks in New York City. Among other things, the judge in that case criticized Bloomberg for enacting the so-called “soda ban” by going through the city’s Health Department instead of the New York City Council.

While the city is appealing that decision, Bloomberg signaled a different policy tactic with his latest anti-smoking measure, announcing that he will present the legislation before the City Council later this week. If approved, New York City would be the first city in the nation to ""conceal"" tobacco products, Bloomberg said.

The move is just the latest anti-smoking effort pursued by Bloomberg, an ex-smoker. In 2002, he signed into law legislation that banned smoking in New York City bars and restaurants. In 2011, Bloomberg expanded that regulation to include public parks.

Bloomberg’s latest bill is likely to face heavy opposition from the tobacco industry as well as bodegas and other stores that depend heavily on the sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Story continues

City officials said any store where tobacco products make up more than 50 percent of its inventory would be exempt from the new rules.

The mayor has faced heavy criticism for his efforts to pass sweeping health regulations. At his news conference on Monday, Bloomberg bristled when he was asked about a recent illustration in the New York Daily News that depicted him as a “nanny” mayor—at first calling it a “stupid cartoon.” But Bloomberg, who was clearly irritated by the question, quickly reversed course and called the cartoon a “great badge of honor” because of “how many people are still alive” because of the health regulations he’s pursued as mayor.

“It’s the most wonderful cartoon I have ever seen,” Bloomberg insisted."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/22/fire-departments-volunteers-as-full-timers-under-obamacare-would-drain-budgets/,2013-12-22 00:00:00,[],Fire departments voice concern over role of volunteers under ObamaCare,"The backbone of small-town America's fire safety could be broken if the federal health care overhaul hits too hard.

Fire departments and other emergency squads say they are still waiting to learn from the IRS whether they will have to pay for volunteers’ medical insurance under ObamaCare and that having to cover such costs would really hurt many small-budget operations.

President Obama’s signature health-care law requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for them. However, whether the IRS considers volunteers full-time employees remains unclear, in part because some receive a stipend or other financial incentives.

“At this point, it’s pretty much wait and see,” Michael Berg, president of the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad in Virginia, told The Daily Progress. “We’re an all-volunteer organization. …. There’s a lot of speculation.”

Volunteer groups around the country -- which operate in more rural areas and rely largely on fundraisers and donations to buy fire trucks and other rescue equipment -- have gotten some bipartisan help from Capitol Hill.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta, a Republican, have sponsored legislation to exempt volunteer fire, medical and rescue personnel from full-time status.

“This is just another example of how ObamaCare was not well thought out,” Barletta said. “So, we’re left to try to pave over the potholes. And this is a big one -- possibly affecting fire stations nationwide,” Barletta said Dec. 11 upon introducing the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act.

He also said that classifying volunteers as full-time employees could result in “unbearable financial burdens” for agencies and is “threatening public safety.”

Barletta said he wrote the IRS in November requesting clarifications.

The legislation has support from the National Volunteer Fire Council and the International Association of Fire Chiefs.

“Agencies don’t have the resources to provide health benefits to their volunteers, and individual volunteers have no expectation of receiving such benefits from the agencies they serve,” said NVFC Chairman Philip C. Stittleburg.

The Obama administration this summer delayed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act’s so-called “employer mandate” until 2015. It was supposed to start Jan. 1, 2014, but was delayed to give officials more time to simplify the regulations.

The IRS has yet to give an official ruling. However, Treasury spokeswoman Victoria Esser recently told The Patriot-News of central Pennsylvania that the agency has received comments regarding the proposed regulations issued last December.

“We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer responsibility provision, 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code,” she said. “Pending issuance of the final regulations, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on their likely content.""

ObamaCare defines a full-time employee as somebody working 30 hours or more.

Among the lingering questions is how the IRS would count volunteers’ hours.

“Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone?"" Barletta asks. “Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner? These are all legitimate questions raised since ObamaCare has been forced on Americans.”"

A vegetarian with a Harvard M.B.A., Mrs. Cruz is a managing director at Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street firms that helped set off the populist rage that ushered Mr. Cruz into the Senate in 2012. She works for Goldman in Houston, where she lives with the couple’s two young children, and as her husband’s fame has increased — depending on the audience, he is among the most pilloried or revered members of the Senate — she has maintained a low profile.

“I think it works really well for our family for us both to have careers, and I know what my commitments are to Goldman,” Mrs. Cruz, 41, said in an interview last week in her husband’s Senate office. “I think it’s also really good for our girls to have me at home with them.”

Yet the fallout from her husband’s role in the Congressional fiscal showdown this month did not spare Mrs. Cruz, one half of what she calls “a great team.” And it was the Democrats who seemed to be making her background an issue."

The federal government has been pushing for electronic medical records for a decade, arguing that they will improve health care and bring down costs. That is still a matter of debate. Critics charge that the system is hobbled by poorly designed software and that some hospitals are using electronic medical records to bill more for the same services.

But a new study suggests that electronic medical records may have another, entirely different use: as a Rosetta Stone for our DNA. Researchers are using them to trace links between genes and disease.

It has been 13 years since scientists first published the rough draft of the human genome and yet they are still just beginning to work out how our DNA influences our health. Most insights in recent years have come from so-called genome-wide association studies."

Bush’s “16 words” in his 2003 State of the Union address making the case for military action in Iraq? Sen. John Kerry charged that Bush “hoodwinked the American people.” Sen. Hillary Clinton said Bush “misled” the country. And Sen. Barack Obama accused the White House of “shading intelligence reports to support its case.”

Well, now it seems President Obama has his own 16 words to answer for: “If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan.” (Actually, it was a little more than 16 words if you include what the president said next: “Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.”)

Obama attempted to move the goal posts in his speech in Boston’s Faneuil Hall Wednesday, declaring that if you like your current health plan, “For the vast majority . . . you can keep it.” Sorry, he didn’t say “the vast majority” back in 2009. He said you can keep your plan. Period. No matter what.

Indeed, Obama repeated this promise on at least 24 separate occasions — before and after the law went into effect. It was critical to his case. Without his 16-word pledge that no one would lose his or her health plans, Obamacare might never have become law.

But Obama’s 16 words were untrue. Across the country, Americans are now seeing their health plans discontinued — and experts say the cancellations could eventually reach 16 million. As one woman in California who got a cancellation letter from her insurer told the Los Angeles Times, “All we’ve been hearing the last three years is if you like your policy you can keep it . . . I’m infuriated because I was lied to.”

Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the administration not only knew but fully intended for all these people to lose their existing plans. The Health and Human Services Department specifically wrote regulations to ensure that they would — narrowing a provision in the law “grandfathering” in existing plans so that “40 to 67 percent” of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their policies. That’s because moving millions of customers out of the individual and small group markets and into the exchanges is critical to making the scheme financially viable. Indeed, the survival of Obamacare depends on it.

The individual and small group markets are made up largely of healthy people who don’t use a lot of services. The administration needs at least 2 million healthy people who don’t use a lot of services to join the exchanges in order to subsidize coverage for the poor and the sick. If they don’t join, the risk pool gets worse, prices go up, eventually insurers will flee the exchanges — and the whole thing collapses.

While the individual mandate is supposed to coerce uninsured healthy people without insurance to join the exchanges, the problem is that the penalties are too weak — just $95 in the first year. Why would a healthy person who does not think they need insurance pay $55 a month (or $660 a year) for a $6,000-deductible plan when they could just pay a $95 penalty instead?

So the administration needed some way to force currently insured healthy people into the exchanges. How serendipitous, then, that millions of mostly healthy people are suddenly seeing their health plans cancelled. If they cannot afford the skyrocketing prices to keep similar coverage, they have no choice but to join the exchanges. The result? A massive involuntary transfer of Americans out of private health insurance they were happy with into Obamacare plans.

These folks are the marks the administration has targeted to pay for Obamacare. Or they would be, except for one problem the White House did not anticipate: The Obamacare Web site does not work. So now millions of people who will lose their health coverage on Jan. 1 are unable to sign up for alternative coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.

It was Obama’s objective from the start to destroy the market in order to fund Obamacare. He wants these people to lose coverage so they have no choice but to sign up for the exchanges. Obama all but admitted this in his Boston speech. “If you’re getting one of these [cancellation] letters, just shop around in the new marketplace,” he declared. In other words, don’t worry if the plan you’re happy with is being cancelled, just join Obamacare! That was the plan all along.

All of which suggests that Obama’s 16 words were no accident.

Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) escalated his conflict with fellow Republicans Tuesday when he stepped up his attacks on President Obama’s health-care law, complicating House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill that would avert a government shutdown next week.

Launching a marathon speech modeled on old-fashioned filibusters, Cruz also informed his Senate GOP colleagues that he would try to stretch the debate well into the weekend, according to senators who attended private huddles Tuesday. With Senate passage all but certain, including funds for the health law, senior Republicans had hoped to allow the measure to advance quickly to give House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) more time to respond with a different version of the legislation.

Instead, the freshman senator took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak “until I am no longer able to stand.” His effort to block the legislation had almost no chance of success, as the series of votes advancing it are locked in and most of his fellow Republicans have abandoned him in the effort.

The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans, both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer, just 42 and nine months into office, is carrying the banner for conservatives urging a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president, even if it means shuttering the government.

“A great many Texans, a great many Americans feel they do not have a voice, and so I hope to play some very small role in providing the voice,” Cruz declared.

As Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon speech against Obamacare, modeled on an old-fashioned filibuster, goes late into the night, he takes a moment to read his kids some bedtime stories. (The Washington Post)

But the move angered senior Republicans, who complained that Cruz and the junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then, the party controlled both the House and Senate, a luxury when compared to its tenuous majority in the House today.

“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down, and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody, in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”

Some suggested that this was the latest example of a party adrift, both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip,” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds, while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.

Cruz played a leading role, along with outside conservative groups, in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans relented and on Friday passed a bill exactly as Cruz wanted.

“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs,” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon, rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.

Throughout the afternoon and evening, a half-dozen colleagues joined Cruz on the floor, among them Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), two 2016 presidential aspirants. Cruz could yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit.

In the opening hours, Cruz discussed an unusual mix of subjects, ranging from opposition to the health-care law; the unemployment rate among African American teenagers; how his father, Rafael Cruz, used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show; and the restaurants Denny’s, Benihana and White Castle.

Later in the evening, Cruz read Twitter messages he was receiving from supporters and “bedtime stories” to his two young daughters, who he said were in Texas watching with his wife. He quoted from “King Solomon’s Wise Words” from the Book of Proverbs and read the Dr. Seuss classic, “Green Eggs and Ham,” noting that it was one of his favorite children’s books.

When he yielded briefly to take questions, the other senators would give extended remarks on their opposition to the health-care law and then ask Cruz questions that set up the Texas senator to continue his remarks.

By holding the floor, Cruz and his allies launched what looked to most Americans like a traditional filibuster, fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”

But even if Cruz were physically capable of speaking for more than 24 hours — the longest filibuster in U.S. history is 24 hours, 18 minutes by Sen. Strom Thurmond (S.C.) and other Southern senators opposed to civil rights laws — there are parliamentary procedures in place dictating that Cruz will have to yield the floor by Wednesday afternoon at the latest.

At that point, the Senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural test vote that is near certain to pass with bipartisan support. McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting, in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon, at which several senators said Cruz was encouraged to drop some of his delaying tactics or Boehner would not get the legislation until late Sunday or early Monday.

Cruz told the group that he would use every tool possible to drag out the vote.

“My own view is that it would be to the advantage of our colleagues in the House, who are in the majority, to shorten the process, and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process, I would not object,” McConnell told reporters after the two meetings.

“If the House doesn’t get what we send over there until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot,” McConnell said later. “My own view is the House, having passed a bill that I really like and that I support . . . I hate to put them in a tough spot.”

If Cruz holds firm, Boehner will have just hours to decide his next move. He might try to quickly pass a new version of the funding legislation, with some conservative sweeteners, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) warned that such a move done just hours before Monday’s stroke-of-midnight deadline would guarantee a federal government shutdown. There would simply not be enough time to get through the Senate’s messy parliamentary hurdles to avoid at least a temporary shutdown.

Cruz, who began speaking at 2:41 p.m., was quickly joined by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was the original architect of the strategy to defund Obama’s health-care law or shut down the government. Their filibuster is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee, first elected in 2010, started looking for allies to defund the law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.

Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach, and instead have grown more angry."

Don%27t try to do platinum plan shopping in Indiana

Florida and Arizona have many plans to choose from

Insurers treading carefully during health exchanges%27 first year

Some counties in the U.S. have almost 30 times more choices of health insurance plans than others do, a stark example of the lack of competition in many parts of the country as consumers try to shop for affordable coverage on the new federally run exchanges.

USA TODAY analyzed data from HealthCare.gov, the federal health insurance exchange selling plans for 34 of the states that didn't set up their own exchanges. The analysis clearly shows the impact of insurers' hesitancy to move into states where they aren't already doing business.

Insurance companies are being especially cautious during the first year rollout of the Affordable Care Act and are sticking to states and counties where they already have established networks of doctors and hospitals. That leaves consumers with few choices in many areas and may contribute to the slow sales on the glitch-ridden exchange.

""This is brand new and insurers are really risk averse,"" says Wendell Potter, a former spokesman for Cigna insurance, who is now an author and industry watchdog. ""They don't know how the market will behave, so the for-profit companies in particular are going to be sitting this out. Shareholders have no patience for this kind of uncertainty.""

Competition among health insurers varied widely county by county before the ACA, Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters says. ""That's not something the law is going to change overnight,"" she says.

About 95% of consumers will have a choice of two or more health insurance issuers, ""and often many more,"" says Peters. Last year, just one or two different insurance companies dominated the individual insurance market in most states, the White House said in May. One insurer covered more than 50% of all enrollees in the individual insurance market in 29 states.

State and county competition and coverage:

• Florida and Arizona stand out as hotbeds of competition, falling into a small category of states with several counties boasting 80 to 170 plans. Several insurers have already been selling Medicare Advantage plans in Arizona and Florida, making the states logical places for them to sell aggressively on the exchanges.

• Alabama, Mississippi and Maine have just two to 21 plan choices except for a small area of central Alabama where there are up to 30 available. Doctors tend to avoid smaller markets, which makes it harder for insurers to attract enough physicians to their networks to make plans competitive, Potter says. He worries that the high rate of uninsured residents in rural areas may not ""change a whole lot in the new market.""

But Kevin Lucia, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Health Insurance Reforms, says even though Blue Cross Blue Shield has well over 90% of the market in Alabama, its rates are fairly competitive.

• Wisconsin residents have numerous options in eastern counties and fewer in the more rural western half of the state.

• Some states have no top-level platinum plans except in certain areas, such as Cincinnati, Northern Virginia, Salt Lake City, Chicago and the Peoria-Galesburg region. Alabama — a poor state with poor health rankings — has universal access to a platinum plan, but states such as Indiana and Maine don't have any. Platinum plans, which cover 90% of eligible medical expenses, also have the highest premiums, ranging from $196 to $497 a month for a 27-year-old individual's plan.

• Residents of Northern states tend to have more choices than those in Southern states, with the exception of Maine and New Hampshire. Indiana is evenly divided along those lines, with fewer choices in the southern, more rural region and more in the industrial, northern part of the state.

• Some unusual differences appear. Everyone in North Carolina, for example, has access to at least one platinum plan, but no one does in relatively affluent areas around Dallas-Fort Worth and St. Louis.

While some say too many plan choices could overwhelm consumers, others say having more choice is always better. Even if consumers need help navigating multiple choices, options provide ""more pricing variability and more benefits variability,"" says Bryce Williams, managing director for consulting firm Towers Watson Exchange Solutions, which operates private health insurance exchanges for businesses.

Along with platinum, exchanges also typically offer options in three different metal categories. All prices could be significantly reduced by subsidies and other financial assistance available to people earning up to four times the federal poverty limit, or about $44,000 a year. Before subsidies, a 27-year-old would pay $135 to $335 a month for the least expensive bronze plan, a silver plan would cost that person $185 to $400 and a gold plan would range from $222 to $504, according to USA TODAY's review of HealthCare.gov's pricing.

Prices can vary widely depending on competition, however, which is why states running their own exchanges are trying to find ways to get more insurers to participate. Maryland requires insurers above a certain size to participate in their exchange if they already do business in the state. Colorado, New York and Oregon are trying waiting periods that would keep insurers out for a certain period of time after 2014 if they don't sell plans next year.

Expanding into states where they don't have contracts with doctors and hospitals is costly for insurers, Williams says. When insurance companies don't have established networks of health care providers, they often rent the networks used by other insurers. That means they have to charge prices others negotiated, plus an additional fee that makes the process inefficient and costly, Williams says.

Optima Health, a Virginia Beach-based insurer, is just selling HMO plans on the exchange and only in Virginia. It only has an established network of doctors in the state and wants to see what consumers are buying on the exchange before it expands, spokesman Bobby Pearson says.

""This is going to be a trial year to see what happens,"" Pearson says. ""You may see a broader range of options going forward.""

Optima is participating in all parts of the state except for part of the more urban Northern Virginia. John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has been studying health care reform, says Optima — which had been a Medicaid provider — is helping drive down insurance costs in rural areas of the state by competing aggressively with insurer Anthem.

The paltry selection of plans in some states and counties covered by the federal exchange could lead to sticker shock for many of the working poor who aren't eligible for much or any financial help, but do need insurance. experts say. And it could undermine the idea that the Affordable Care Act will make insurance — affordable.

""We all wanted there to be a competitive dynamic,"" Williams says. ""Whether or not it gets more affordable remains to be seen.""

Depending on the state, ""reform is likely to look quite different,"" Holahan says. ""In some states, it's going to be working and in some states it could be a mess.""

In a conference call with reporters and in a statement issued after the meeting, they said they told the president they would not reach any consensus on what states should do. They said they warned the president that his proposal would amount to “different rules for different policies and might result in higher premiums for consumers without addressing underlying concern of gaps in coverage.”

Jim Donelon, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Louisiana insurance commissioner, said in a statement that members of his organization, which represents state insurance commissioners, “have been working to ensure that plans are compliant with the new rules.”

He added, “These proposed changes are creating a level of uncertainty that we must work together to alleviate.”"

Aside from scrambling to fix the broken HealthCare.gov website, the administration is now trying to deal with the millions of Americans who have received cancellation notices. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president's team is trying to figure out a way to offer relief to some of those policyholders.

The statement comes after former President Clinton, in an interview with the site Ozy.com, said Obama should live up to his promise to Americans that if they like their health plans, they can keep them.

""So I personally believe, even if it takes a change to the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,"" Clinton said.

Asked Tuesday if Obama agreed, Carney said: ""The answer's yes.""

More On This...

Carney referred to Obama's comments to NBC News last week, when the president apologized for the cancellation notices and said the administration was looking at a ""range of options"" to address the issue.

But Carney spoke in additional detail on Tuesday, saying the president's team is specifically trying to help those Americans who have been forced off their plans into more expensive coverage which they might struggle to afford.

""The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options, as he said, to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled and they can't afford a better plan, even though they'd like to have a better plan,"" Carney said.

It's unclear, though, how the administration could go about doing that. Insurance companies are the ones canceling policies -- due to new requirements under the health care overhaul -- and would likely have to be involved in any effort to restore coverage.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman with America's Health Insurance Plans, told FoxNews.com that all the myriad plans to reverse or stop the cancellation notices raise questions about how that would be achieved. He said in many cases, changes to existing policies have already been filed with state regulators and consumers have been notified.

""That's a lot to go back and unwind,"" he said, noting that any modified health plans would have to be reviewed and approved by state regulators.

""That typical process takes many months,"" he said.

The insurance industry generally does not support any delay in the implementation of the ObamaCare insurance mandates, out of concern that a delay would deprive them of much-needed customers at a time when they're dealing with the cost of additional coverage requirements.

But any effort to overhaul the cancellations might require an extended timeframe.

Separately, House Republicans, as well as some Senate Democrats, are planning legislation that would allow people losing their current coverage to keep their plans.

A Senate bill introduced by Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu that would ensure Americans could keep their current health insurance plans was co-sponsored Tuesday by longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

In his interview Tuesday, Clinton defended the health care law as a whole, but explained how the broken promise on health coverage can hurt young people. He relayed the story of a young man who said his individual market plan was canceled and replaced with one whose premiums were twice as high. Though his deductibles and co-pays were lower, that savings is only realized if he gets sick, Clinton explained.

Obama, in explaining the cancellation notices, has clarified that under ObamaCare, policies could be canceled if they had been altered in any way since the passage of the law.

That nuance was not included in the president's initial explanations.

The administration argues that while some are losing their current coverage, those plans will be replaced by better-quality insurance. The flip side is that they could be more expensive."

The enrollment numbers are actually not that terrible. While the media and Republicans are focusing on the roughly 100K that have chosen a plan, fact is that 846,000 have completed their applications, but haven't chosen a plan. Part of that is technical difficulties. Part of that is people doing their due diligence before making an important decision. Part of it is procrastination. Why spend too much time now doing something that won't take effect until January?

If the enrollment numbers remain low in late December and January, then that would certainly be cause for concern. But right now? During Romneycare's first enrollment month, 130 people had signed up—130. But the optics of those numbers aren't great, particularly given previous administration-supplied projections.

On the other hand, the optics of Obama's broken promise that everyone would be able to keep their insurance are brutal. We are in ""Read my lips, no new taxes"" territory. Sure, Obama's claim was supposed to apply only to employer-provided insurance, but he never qualified it as such. So now we're subjected to endless stories about people losing their (crappy substandard) insurance, even though Obama said they wouldn't.

So enter Sen. Mary Landrieu's fix to this issue (see here and here for details). In short, it would allow people to keep their crappy individual insurance policies, but insurance companies would be unable to keep selling them to new customers, and they'd have to let their customers know why the government considers their policies crap and point them to the exchanges for other options. The idea may not be a home run on the policy side, but Democrats don't have the benefit of perfect policy having botched this thing so badly (from original passage to implementation). But even on the policy, it's not terrible.

But on the politics? Woo-boy it's a winner! Remember, some policies are being cancelled because they are substandard. Some are being cancelled because insurance companies are trying to scam their customers into more expensive plans. In both cases, the problem is the insurance companies.

Right now, the blame is being put on Obama and the Democrats. This bill would turn things around and put the pressure exactly where it belongs: on insurance companies and obstructionist Republicans.

Republicans are acting as if these insurance cancellations are the worst thing since Hitler. Well, put them on the spot: Are they really interested in mitigating the law's unintended injustices (whether real or perceived), or do they merely want to undermine its implementation for sabotage purposes?

We know the answer, of course. Landrieu's bill doesn't have a prayer of passing. Republicans will obstruct it every step of the way. But instead of having Obama taking away your insurance, we'll reverse the equation: It'll now be Republicans defending the ability of insurance companies to cancel those policies.

Heading into 2014, that may be the difference between retaining the political high ground, or facing another 2010. Landrieu's gambit is genius.

USATODAY

The ongoing trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell is finally getting the attention it deserves, and for good reason.

The 2011 grand jury report on Gosnell, charged with murder in the deaths of a patient and seven babies, is a gruesome and disturbing document. It includes accounts of fully delivered, live babies having their spinal chords severed by scissors. And it describes horribly unsafe and unsanitary conditions at a business that allegedly operated as a pill mill by day and rogue abortion clinic by night.

The report also details a complete breakdown of oversight by multiple agencies, hospitals and professional organizations that allowed the clinic to operate in plain sight for decades. These included the Pennsylvania Departments of Health and State, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the National Abortion Federation and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, all of which were either tasked with regulating the clinic or had obtained information about what was going on inside.

It took a nighttime raid by agents from the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, who had gotten wind of the clinic's pill business, to uncover the house of horrors that the regulators overlooked.

For whatever reason — lack of awareness of the case, faulty judgment — national news organizations were largely ignoring Gosnell's trial, which began March 18, until anti-abortion activists and USA TODAY columnist Kirsten Powers called them out. The combination of alleged mass murder and regulatory failure warrants national coverage. What it doesn't warrant, however, is major changes in national abortion policy.

As the grand jurors predicted in their report, both sides in the abortion wars are using the Gosnell trial to score points.

Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., one of the most steadfast and vociferous abortion opponents in Congress, has already cited the trial to press his case against ""the brutality of abortion and the violence that is commonplace inside the abortion industry."" Other abortion foes have used the case to push for more stringent laws, such as the one recently enacted in Virginia that requires clinics to adopt hospital-style building codes, or ones enacted in Mississippi and Alabama requiring abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital.

On the other side of the debate, abortion rights activists have argued that the Gosnell case was not the product of overly permissive regulations but of overly restrictive ones. They say clients ended up at his ghastly clinic because other options were not available or were too costly.

All these arguments have weaknesses. Many of the new laws are obviously designed to make abortions unavailable by driving up providers' costs. And it doesn't take much more than an Internet search to turn up other Pennsylvania clinics that will provide abortions as late as the 24th week of pregnancy, the legal limit Gosnell is accused of violating.

Aside from the obvious — that regulators should do their jobs, and that criminal doctors should be harshly prosecuted — it's hard to say what else should be concluded from the Gosnell case.

Unless evidence emerges that clinics like his exist in other parts of the country, the case looks like an appalling anomaly.

Just as the murder of an abortion doctor by a fanatic isn't representative of the broad anti-abortion movement, nor are the alleged atrocities at Gosnell's clinic representative of abortion providers more generally.

If Gosnell is convicted, perhaps his story is best seen the way the grand jurors — who held diverse views on the morality of abortion — saw it: as a case of ""disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants."""

The president accused Republicans of “all kinds of distortions” about the legislation. He said bluntly that his administration had a simple plan to build support for the law, which continues to be viewed with suspicion by large numbers of Americans. “We’re going to implement it,” he said.

Mr. Obama said he decided to delay a requirement that businesses provide insurance to their employees because of concerns expressed by executives about its administrative burdens. Some companies that already provide insurance had balked at provisions requiring them to show proof. The president said delaying that part of the law for a year would give the Treasury Department and other agencies a chance to make it “a little bit simpler” for companies to comply.

But he rejected criticism that by delaying the provision he had exceeded his constitutional authority."

The agency, Covered California, unveiled its portfolio of policy options for smaller businesses Thursday. They include both health maintenance organizations and preferred provider networks and will be available in all parts of the state as of Jan. 1.

Rates in most of the state’s populous counties are expected to be significantly below premiums now charged by insurers for similar plans. Average premiums for a 40-year-old employee are slated to fall 17% in southern Los Angeles County and 13% in the northern part. Rates for younger and older workers are expected to drop proportionally, Covered California said.

An important element of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, these small-business exchange policies will take effect Jan. 1. Insurance companies will continue to offer small-business policies apart from the exchange.

Giving small-business owners new options to help their employees is crucial in California, healthcare advocates argue. According to the California Healthcare Foundation, the state has more than 7 million people under the age of 65 who don’t have health insurance. Statewide, 25% of workers are not insured. That rises to 40% at companies with fewer than 10 people.

“This adds competition to the marketplace,” said Scott Hauge, a San Francisco insurance broker and president of Small Business California, which advocates for half a million employers around the state. “The exchange clearly will be a major competitor.”

Businesses with fewer than 50 employees can take advantage of the buying power of the exchange’s new Small Business Health Options Program. However, they are not required to do so under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Small businesses with fewer than 25 full-time workers that purchase the state-backed coverage could further lower their costs by qualifying for a federal tax credit of as much as 50% of total employer-paid premiums.

Individuals not covered by employer or government programs will be subject to financial penalties if they don’t get insurance.

Participating insurance companies include Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, Sharp Health Plan and Western Health Advantage. Each provider will offer four tiers of benefits dubbed Platinum for the most comprehensive, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Employers will pick the level of coverage they want. Employees would still be free to choose among all the locally available products within that category, even if they are from different insurance companies. Prices and benefits can vary from insurer to insurer, even if they are in the same category.

Not participating in the small-business exchange is Anthem Blue Cross, the largest for-profit health insurer in the state.

California has aggressively prepared to put into place Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act — informally known as Obamacare — since he signed it into law in 2010. Earlier this year, the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown made public its programs for covering individuals.

The latest offering should be a boost for small businesses because it will put them “on par with larger employers in terms of benefits,” said Peter V. Lee, executive director of Covered California.

“Employer-sponsored health coverage,” he said, “has historically played an important role in insuring Californians. Our launch of a full-choice, small-group market is a testament to the state’s commitment to build on the critical role of employer-based coverage.”

Although Covered California gives small employers a range of options to attract and keep employees, it might not be the best deal for all companies, especially those that operate on slim profit margins, said John Arensmeyer, founder and chief executive of Small Business Majority, a national lobbying group based in San Francisco Bay Area.

“They may sit down and do calculations and there may be situations where it’s better for the employees to go to the individual exchange and get subsidies,” Arensmeyer said. But, what’s important, he stressed, is that either way the workers will have health insurance that they couldn’t previously get.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ended his symbolic filibuster Wednesday as Senate rules forced him to stop talking. Senators then voted to push ahead with the bill to fund the government that the Texan and his allies had tried to stall all night long.

Cruz quit at noon to a smattering of Republican applause, ceding the floor at the technical start of a new legislative day after holding forth for more than 21 hours. He could have spoken longer, but had to stop for good at 1 p.m. for a vote to proceed with debate on the spending bill.

The Senate voted unanimously to do so, including Cruz.

Cruz is trying to block the spending bill, already passed by the House last week, even though it contains the provisions he requested to defund President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Money to keep the government open runs out Sept. 30, and Cruz is seeking to block the bill because he doesn't want Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to have the opportunity to amend the measure.

The Texas senator has pointed to the next procedural vote in the process on Friday or Saturday -- to end debate -- as the key one in the fight. After that, Reid would be able to amend the bill with just 51 votes.

But killing the legislation in the Senate would guarantee a government shutdown, and senators on both sides of the aisle would prefer to move the spending portion quickly, in hopes of leaving enough time to work out some sort of deal with the House.

Still, Cruz, aided by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other senators, talked through the night, hoping to stall the process.

Cruz spoke at seemingly infinite length, comparing his desire to defund Obamacare to the battle against the Nazis, the American Revolution, and other moments that he said were similar in that people said some fight couldn't be won.

He resorted to many well-worn talking points against the health care law, and also sprinkled in the sorts of odd references that can crop up when someone talks for so long, reading Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters via C-Span, claiming that his dad invented that dish, and even channeling Darth Vader in response to a line from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

""I will confess that that phrase, a 'rebellion against oppression,' conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire, the empire being the Washington, D.C., establishment,"" Cruz said on Wednesday morning. ""I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forth and say in a deep voice, 'Mike Lee, I am your father.'""

""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" he added, completing the analogy. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment -- the empire -- to listen to the people.""

Cruz's talkathon would have constituted the fourth longest filibuster in modern history, but Democrats have been calling it a ""faux filibuster"" because it had no chance to stop the vote, which was already determined under the chamber's rules.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) emerged shortly after Cruz yielded the floor to commend the Texas senator for holding the floor ""for nearly a day, speaking passionately about an issue that unites every single Republican.""

But McConnell had been noticeably absent from Cruz's talkathon after stating Tuesday that he disagreed with his colleague's approach, which he said would put House Republicans in a ""tough spot.""

The biggest opposition to Cruz's tactics came from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has butted heads with the junior senator all year. In a lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote, McCain dubbed Cruz's marathon a case of ""extended oratory.""

""I can't call it a filibuster because filibusters delay passage of legislation,"" McCain said.

He added that Obamacare was ""a major issue in the [2012] campaign.""

""I campaigned all over America for two months everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said, 'And we have to repeal and replace Obamacare,'"" McCain said. ""Well, the people spoke.

""Now, that doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to repeal and replace Obamacare, but it does mean that elections have consequences,"" he added."

Federal health officials announced Friday afternoon that they'd give people another eight days this year to enroll in an insurance policy and still get covered by Jan. 1. Previously, people had to enroll by Dec. 15 to avoid any break in coverage and have insurance at the start of 2014. The administration, amid lingering problems with the main ObamaCare website, is now pushing that deadline to Dec. 23.

The move comes after the administration announced a more significant delay to the start of next year's ObamaCare enrollment period. That decision was pitched as a way to give consumers and insurance companies more time to study their options, but also conveniently pushes the second round of enrollment past the 2014 midterm elections.

With the administration still offering only modest relief for the current enrollment period, Republicans questioned why the administration was focusing on the second round of enrollment, a year away.

""Another day, another delay, which begs the question, does the president think enrollment will be just as bad next year?"" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in a statement. ""It's stunning to see the president so willing to delay next year's open enrollment period rather than focus on the ongoing chaos and uncertainty that is plaguing implementation today.""

More On This...

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and a Department of Health and Human Services official confirmed the change to the 2014 sign-up on Friday. That decision does not affect those trying to enroll this year. Rather, it affects those who will sign up late next year for 2015 coverage.

The administration will allow consumers to start signing up on Nov. 15, 2014, as opposed to Oct. 15. Enrollment will last until Jan. 15, 2015, instead of Dec. 7.

An HHS official told Fox News the move will give insurers ""the benefit of more time to evaluate their experiences during the 2014 plan year"" and let them take into account late-filing customers when setting their 2015 rates.

The official added: ""This change is good news for consumers, who will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling and an open enrollment period that's a week longer.""

The administration so far has rebuffed calls to delay or extend the current enrollment period beyond March 31, 2014, even as HHS scrambles to repair the flawed HealthCare.gov site and some states struggle with their own exchanges.

But by pushing off next year's enrollment period, the administration conveniently pushes off the possibility of any ObamaCare hiccups until after the midterm elections. Some of the biggest critics of the current rollout have been Democrats up for reelection next year.

Obama recently tried to address some of their concerns by allowing states and insurance companies to re-offer cancelled insurance policies -- a trend which has become a major headache for the administration. Many states, though, are refusing to make any changes to the way they handle those plans.

HHS argued that the delay next year will give consumers more time to educate themselves about the plans, though it would not affect coverage this year.

Obama's one-time ""Secretary of Explainin' Stuff"" doesn't seem to understand the math problem that presents. Or, more likely, the time has come for Team Clinton to put 2016 ahead of its tenuous loyalty to the sitting president.

The interview, given to Ozy.com (which appears to be a news site for millenials), focused on Clinton's reaction to the rollout of Obamacare. Clinton outlined four ways in which the process could have been improved. The last is the one that's generated the most attention.

Clinton tells the story of a young person he met who'd been forced to switch his insurance plan. The new plan cost more, he told Clinton, but the co-pays and deductibles are much lower. (The relevant segment of the video starts at 3:15.)

""So he said, 'In the years I use healthcare, I might actually save money.' But he said, 'You know, we're all young and we're all healthy.' So, I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got.""

President Obama's repeated claims on the campaign trail that Americans could keep their existing health insurance policies has been one of the most strident attacks from Republicans, prompting a (sort of) apology from Obama and a subtle tweak to how the administration talks about the Affordable Care Act. The problem, as the administration has known for at least three years, is that the mandates in the ACA require higher levels of coverage than most Americans choose for themselves. The person with whom Clinton spoke paid less per month because his coverage was much worse. Since one of the goals of Obamacare was to prevent people from suffering economic catastrophe in the event of a serious health problem, many policies that had very high deductibles were rendered invalid.

Story continues

But this young person with whom Clinton spoke represents another important aspect to the ACA: getting ""young"" and ""healthy"" people to contribute more to the pool. From the outset, Obama has focused on the need to get young people signed up primarily because those premiums would help keep costs down for everyone else. Insurers can keep premiums lower across the board and expand coverage if more people who are less likely to get sick are giving monthly checks. The young person that spoke with Clinton is key to making Obamacare work.

RELATED: Bill Clinton May or May Not Have Called Obama an 'Amateur'

So there are three possibilities for why Clinton said what he did.

Possibility 1: Clinton doesn't understand the economics of Obamacare.

There's no reason to think that this is the case. Clinton's star moment in the 2012 race was in his informal role as ""Explainin' Secretary"" at the Democratic convention, when he gave a stemwinder explaining how most of the American economy and, in particular, the ACA was put together. If Clinton doesn't understand the economics above, then he's forgotten a lot in the past year.

Possibility 2: Clinton is going off the reservation.

During the heated 2008 Democratic primaries, Clinton risked doing serious damage to his reputation by dismissing Obama's South Carolina win. It was a very unhelpful moment for the Hillary team, prompting accusations that Clinton was trying to race-bait voters to his wife's benefit. As a Hillary aide told the authors of Game Change, ""It would take 10 Freudians to explain what Bill Clinton did to Hillary in South Carolina.""

RELATED: The Clintons and the Obamas, Together Forever

It doesn't seem to have been that at all. Instead, it was Bill Clinton explainin' stuff, a tendency known in other contexts as ""mansplaining."" Bill Clinton is a proud advocate of mansplaining. He's a smart guy that once ran the United States. He has opinions on things, and can, at times, be indiscreet in how those opinions are shared. This Ozy.com interview could have been exactly that.

Possibility 3: Clinton was trying to distance his wife from an unpopular policy.

Clinton knows better than most how broken promises can tank political careers. In 1992, he defeated George H. W. Bush after the sitting president violated his ""read my lips; no new taxes"" pledge. Everything that happens between now and 2016 will be fodder for Hillary's opponents, so there's political value in distancing her from any perceived misrepresentations by Obama. Clinton won't be running on Obama's record, but it's safe to assume that Obamacare will come up. Clinton just offered Hillary a little cover on a possibly problematic topic.

In other words: Maybe Clinton said what he did because he wants to help his wife's presidential bid. Of the three possibilities, this is obviously the most likely. Perhaps Obama should have tried harder to get Clinton to stick around for a second term as Secretary of State.

The interview video above concludes with Clinton making a joke. ""You know, politics is the only profession,"" he told the interviewer, ""where people are surprised if you know anything."" Perhaps because people expect political considerations to trump a strightforward answer.

These people will neither qualify for their state’s Medicaid program for the poor nor for subsidized coverage on new insurance exchanges that are being established in every state by the health care reform law.

Their plight is a result of the Supreme Court’s decision last year that struck down the reform law’s mandatory expansion of Medicaid and made expansion optional. Every state in the Deep South except Arkansas has rejected expansion, as have Republican-led states elsewhere. These 26 states would rather turn down incredibly generous federal funds that would finance 100 percent of the expansion costs for three years and at least 90 percent thereafter than offer a helping hand to their most vulnerable residents.

As Sabrina Tavernise and Robert Gebeloff reported in The Times on Thursday, two-thirds of the country’s poor, uninsured blacks and single mothers and more than half of the uninsured low-wage workers live in those states. The reform law originally sought to help poor and middle-income people through two parallel mechanisms. One was a mandatory expansion of Medicaid (which in most states cover primarily children and their parents with incomes well below the poverty level) to cover childless adults and to help people with income levels above the poverty line. Those with slightly higher incomes would be eligible for federal subsidies to buy private policies on the new insurance exchanges.

That approach fell apart when 26 states decided not to expand Medicaid, at least for now. There is no provision in the law to provide health insurance subsidies for anyone below the poverty line because those people are supposed to be covered by Medicaid."

(CNN) —

The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work.

Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance.

The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.

But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans – those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance.

Officials announced Thursday that 700,000 people have applied for insurance plans in both the 36 states that are using a federally run health care exchange and the 14 states running their own exchanges.

Obamacare website ‘fixable’ by end of November

But don’t apply that 700,000 application figure to the 7 million enrollment goal. For starters, there’s no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan.

And those 700,000 applications include Medicaid enrollments.

Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance.

As the law was originally envisioned, more than half of the uninsured people in the United States – 24 million or so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation – who would be getting insurance through Obamacare would have been getting Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level – about $27,000 for a family of four – isn’t eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, so Medicaid is effectively their only option.

So it’s not necessarily a bad thing if more than half of the people getting insurance under Obamacare so far are getting Medicaid. But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.

Related: Finger-pointing over Obamacare

Should it be alarming that so many of these 700,000 new applications are people trying to get Medicaid and not private insurance?

Not yet, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

“There’s nothing in what we’ve seen to suggest anything like that,” he said. “Whether you’re able to be eligible for Medicaid or not is totally dependent on your income.”

But he did admit “Some of the numbers we’ve seen, preliminary, early numbers, do seem a little out of whack.”

But he said there’s a reason for that.

“In these small handful of states, they’re aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid,” Salo said.

Salo pointed to people who the states already know are on food stamps receiving some other kind of state or locally funded health program.

“You know who they are, you know what their income is, you know they’re OK accepting government benefits. If you go after these guys, there should be no surprise that these people are being enrolled.”

Also, in some states, Medicaid coverage starts immediately, meaning there may be more of an incentive to enroll early because you get coverage sooner than on the private market where no matter when you enroll in the first two and a half months coverage still starts on January 1.

In Arkansas they’ve insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1. But in a novel twist they’re doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.

Related: Obamacare more than a phone call away

And Oregon has been approved to use food stamps and other metrics as a prequalifier for Medicaid enrollment. So the state sent letters to uninsured welfare recipients that detailed simple steps to enroll in Medicaid – i.e. just sign a form and mail it back or call a hotline. This has resulted in tens of thousands of enrollees. But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance. It’s the one state that elected to fix the glitches in its website before going live.

It may very well be that not enough people – particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy – are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.

But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/24/washington-state-weighs-first-in-nation-abortion-insurance-mandate/,2013-03-24 00:00:00,[],Washington state weighs first-in-the-nation abortion insurance mandate,"In 1970, Washington became the first -- and remains the only -- state in the country to legalize elective abortions by a popular vote.

A generation later, and 40 years removed from the landmark United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that extended abortion access nationwide, Washington is once again poised to stand out.

With 21 states having adopted bans or severe restrictions on insurance companies from paying for abortions, Washington is alone in seriously considering legislation mandating the opposite.

The Reproductive Parity Act, as supporters call it, would require insurers in Washington state who cover maternity care -- which all insurers must do -- to also pay for abortions.

The bill passed the state House earlier this month by a vote of 53-43, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A similar bill in the New York state Assembly has been introduced each session for over a decade but has never received a public hearing.

""This is a core value for Washingtonians,"" said Melanie Smith, a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. ""We should protect it while we still have it and not leave access to basic health care up to an insurance company.""

The proximate cause of Washington state's measure is the federal Affordable Care Act. Thanks to language placed in it to assuage anti-abortion congressional Democrats, insurers selling their plans on the state exchanges taking effect next year will have to segregate the premiums they collect for abortion coverage.

In addition to that built-in disincentive to insuring abortion, the law also invites states to enact stricter rules of their own. Thus far, 16 states have followed suit, barring or restricting insurance companies on their exchanges from covering the procedure. Three of those states are joining the five that have barred or limited all insurers from covering abortions since the early 1980's.

Supporters of Washington state's proposed abortion insurance mandate are careful to stress that it wouldn't lead to a dramatic uptick in abortions or require carriers with a religious bent to cover the procedure. They also note that a pair of federal plans that will be sold on all 50 state exchanges will be barred from covering elective abortions.

""It's not expanding abortion coverage,"" said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody of West Seattle, the bill's primary sponsor. ""It's ensuring the rights of women to get what they're paying for now and to continue their freedom of choice.""

Opponents counter that the measure would require businesses and individuals to pay for abortion coverage they'd rather not have.

""Washington state would be the only state in the country that would force employers to pay for abortion,"" said Peggy O'Ban, spokeswoman for Human Life of Washington.

If passed, she said, it would amount to ""the first conscience coercion act in American history.""

Its passage, however, is not assured.

Proponents of the measure say they have the votes they need in the state Senate, but it's not clear that Senate leaders will allow it to get to the floor. It is scheduled to receive a public hearing in the Senate Health Care Committee on April 1.

Ironically, the man bill supporters will likely blame if it fails to get a Senate vote counts himself as a proud backer of the measure.

Sen. Rodney Tom of Medina, a fiscal conservative and social moderate, and one other like-minded Democrat crossed party lines to caucus with Republicans in December, handing a one-vote majority to the GOP. Seizing power for the first time in nearly a decade, elated Senate Republicans reciprocated by installing Tom as Majority Leader.

Last month, Tom addressed about 250 advocates rallying for the measure's passage on the state Capitol steps.

""I'm down here making sure that my 17-year-old daughter has the kind of protections that we need in Washington state and that all of our kids have those same kinds of protections,"" Tom said to cheers.

Moments later, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat and fellow bill supporter, delivered a not-so-subtle challenge to Tom's political will.

Washington state ""deserves a vote in the state Senate on the Reproductive Parity Act,"" Inslee said. ""We are going to insist that we are not going to let anybody close the door to democracy in this state.""

Another irony: though the bill has proved to be among the most hotly contested of the session, its broader impact if passed may be less than sweeping.

For one thing, most abortions are paid for out-of-pocket. According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 12 percent of abortions nationwide are paid for by private insurers, with 20 percent footed by Medicaid.

For another, because most abortions cost less than a live birth -- the procedure typically runs about $500, though late-term abortions are far more expensive -- insurers may be disinclined to stop covering them.

At present, all major insurers in Washington state cover abortions, and Cody, the bill's sponsor, said she knows of no carrier with plans to change. Insurers new to Washington state on its exchange may be tempted to adopt different policies, she said.

No matter its immediate impact, said Elizabeth Nash, states issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute, the bill's passage would be a watershed event.

""It would be a model for other states to follow,"" she said."

Now they've launched a new campaign of lies, aiming their pocketbook at Obamacare, or, more accurately, at those who stand to benefit from its reforms. You know, small, ""special-interest"" groups like, say: women (and the people who love them), young people between the ages of 19 and 26 , as well as others (and their affected families) who can't get coverage at work, or lose coverage when they lose their job, or can't get coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Does that sound to you like just about all of us at one point in our lives? Yeah, me too.

The Koch brothers' campaign is merely part of a larger, truly unprecedented Republican strategy to sabotage the entire health care law passed in 2009 by a Democratic House and Senate and signed by President Obama.

The Republicans need the law to fail because its success will only further cement the reality that government regulations can and do bring tangible benefits to people. In other words, the law's success will translate into further defeats for their party and for their extreme anti-government ideology. This has been the Republican thinking on health care reform for 20 years. Will the Koch/Republican campaign succeed? Not if we can help it.

These thoughts were on my mind as I had a conversation with a physician I know, an obstetrician-gynecologist. The physician mentioned a patient who asked if the implementation of Obamacare would alter her relationship with her doctor or the practice in general. The patient was quite concerned, unsurprisingly, as change can be unsettling—especially change relating to one's health care.

The physician put the patient at ease, explaining that the patient-doctor relationship would not change, that she'd be able to continue seeing her current doctor. On the other hand, the Koch brothers' ad includes ""Julie"" asking: ""If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know our family is going to get the care they need?"" Of course, there's nothing in the health care legislation that reduces a patient's ability to choose his or her own doctor.

For the rest of the conversation, please follow me beyond the fold."
http://news.yahoo.com/tough-week-white-house-buys-time-obamacare-website-100139041--sector.html,,[],"After tough week, White House buys time for Obamacare website fix","By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama promised on Saturday that his troubled healthcare website was just weeks away from a cure as he struggled to convince Americans he is on top of what has become a self-inflicted wound to his signature first-term achievement. His administration unveiled a plan on Friday to make Obamacare insurance marketplaces on healthcare.gov - a website riddled with error messages, long delays and bugs - work better by the end of November. It was the end to an embarrassing week where Obama discovered he had overshot on an Oct 1. promise of a website that would make shopping for health insurance as easy as buying ""a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon."" ""As you may have heard, the site isn't working the way it's supposed to yet,"" Obama said in his weekly Saturday address - an understatement after days of reports of people being shut out of the system. ""In the coming weeks, we are going to get it working as smoothly as it's supposed to,"" he added. Obama had stood firm against Republican attempts to defund or delay the healthcare law, known popularly as Obamacare - efforts that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month. He and his top officials had warned publicly before October 1 that there could be ""glitches,"" but the White House has been scrambling to control the damage from a rollout that was far worse than expected. The depth of the design flaws has raised questions about why the Obama administration was so insistent on starting the enrollments on October 1 when the system was clearly not ready - and laid bare the president's mistake in raising expectations about how good the website was going to be. ""Either they made assumptions that were too optimistic and were caught off guard, or they knew that the difficulties would be greater than the public understood, but chose not to say so,"" said Bill Galston, a Brookings Institution expert who was a domestic policy adviser to Democratic President Bill Clinton. ""It may be some of both."" CRISIS MANAGEMENT 101 Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients, appointed on Tuesday to figure out how to manage the complicated fixes for the website, was an unannounced participant on a conference call with health reporters on Friday afternoon. Zients gave a deadline, although he cautioned there was a lot of work to do. ""By the end of November, healthcare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,"" he said. Borrowing from the lexicon of homebuilders, Zients said he had hired a ""general contractor"" to manage the many contractors on the project, and developed a ""punch list"" of dozens of problems to address. The message followed classic corporate crisis management strategy, said Peter LaMotte, a senior vice president at Levick, a firm that devises communications strategies for large corporations and organizations. ""State the facts, be clear, be transparent, and then shut up,"" LaMotte said. ""That is what we often recommend to our clients."" That deadline buys the administration and tech experts time to iron out the bugs in the website before millions of Americans give up trying to use it, LaMotte said. But he added, ""People are going to hold you to that date."" Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said the date was ""comforting"" because it came from Zients, who is known for being a ""straight shooter"" with private-sector management expertise. ""He's not making it up. It does not serve his interests to pick a date without a clue as to whether you can make it,"" Ornstein said, noting Zients would become Obama's top economic adviser at the White House on January 1. ""His credibility is at stake here,"" Ornstein said. POLITICAL BREATHING ROOM Republicans are using the problems to push for a delay to the requirement that Americans buy insurance by March 31. ""Despite hundreds of millions of taxpayers dollars invested, the website still does not work for most,"" Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in the Republican reply to Obama's Saturday address. Upton's panel will grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing next week. Zients' Friday announcement will take some pressure off Sebelius in the hearing, said John Ullyot, who works on crisis communications as a managing director at High Lantern Group. But Ullyot, a former Senate Republican aide, said the plan would have had more punch had it been presented earlier in the week by the ""much louder megaphone"" of either Sebelius or Obama. ""They had a full week of drip, drip, drip in the media, and you never want to have that,"" he said. Once the website is fixed, officials will face another communications challenge. They will need to concentrate on luring back to the site those people who gave up trying to access it in the initial phases, said a former Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think that people are going to like the site and sign up for it. The problem is once a user has a bad experience at a website, they're not usually going to want to go back to it,"" the official said.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/17/gop-governors-stand-ground-on-obamacare-health-exchanges/,2013-02-17 00:00:00,[],GOP governors reject ObamaCare health exchange partnerships,"As the final deadline for creating state health insurance exchanges passed Friday, New Jersey, Tennessee and Florida said they would not work with the federal government on establishing insurance markets required under ObamaCare.

Exchanges are online markets required under the federal health care law where consumers will be able to buy individual private policies and apply for government subsidies to help pay their premiums.

In his announcement Friday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said his administration is committed to complying with ObamaCare, but ""only in a manner that is the most effective and efficient for the residents of New Jersey, and the businesses that will carry the costs of this new program.""

Christie, who previously vetoed legislation establishing a state-run health insurance exchange, said in a statement that the federal government is best equipped to operate the exchange.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, said in a letter to U.S. Health and Human Resources Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the partnership model doesn't address his concerns over what he called ""aggressive federal timelines, a lack of true flexibility for states, and misguided federal policies.""

Haslam noted that he had the same complaints when he rejected a state-based exchange in December. His deadline decision means Tennesseans will participate in an exchange completely run by the federal government.

In Florida, which already missed the deadline for operating an exchange on its own, Gov. Rick Scott also declined to partner with the federal government.

“We continue to be concerned about the many unknowns impacting the cost of operating an exchange, and simply do not have enough information to make a decision about running one at this time,” Scott’s communications director, Melissa Sellers, told the Palm Beach Post.

Friday's deadline showed that the nation is about evenly split between states that decided they want a say in running new insurance markets and states that are defaulting to federal control because they don't want to participate in the exchanges. That choice was left to state governments under the law.

With some exceptions, states led by Democrats opted to set up their own markets, called exchanges, and Republican-led states declined.

Barring last-minute switches that may not be revealed until next week, 23 states plus Washington, D.C., have opted to run their own markets or partner with the Obama administration to do so.

Twenty-six states are defaulting to the feds. But in several of those, Republican governors are trying to carve out some kind of role by negotiating with Sebelius. Utah's status is unclear. It received initial federal approval to run its own market, but appears to be reconsidering.

With some exceptions, including Idaho, Nevada and New Mexico, Republican-led states are maintaining a hands-off posture, meaning the federal government will step in.

""There is a sense of irony that it's the more conservative states"" yielding to federal control, said Sandy Praeger, the Republican insurance commissioner in Kansas, a state declining to run its own exchange. First, she said, the law's opponents ""put their money on the Supreme Court, then on the election. Now that it's a reality, we may see some movement.""

They're not budging in Austin. ""Texas is not interested in being a subcontractor to Obamacare,"" said Lucy Nashed, spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry, who remains opposed to mandates in the law.

In Kansas, Praeger supported a state-run exchange, but lost the political struggle to Gov. Sam Brownback. She says Kansans will be closely watching what happens in neighboring Colorado, where the state will run the market. She doubts that consumers in her state would relish dealing with a call center on the other side of the country. The federal exchange may have some local window-dressing but it's expected to function as a national program.

Christine Ferguson, director of the Rhode Island Health Benefits Exchange, says she expects to see a big shift to state control in the next few years. ""Many of the states have just run out of time for a variety of reasons,"" said Ferguson. ""I'd be surprised if in the longer run every state didn't want to have its own approach.""

In some ways, the federal government has a head start on the states. It already operates the Medicare Plan Finder for health insurance and prescription plans that serve seniors, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Both have many of the features of the new insurance markets.

Administration officials are keeping mum about what the new federal exchange will look like, except that it will open on time and people in all 50 states will have the coverage they're entitled to by law.

Whether or not the bugs get worked out, consumers will be able to start signing up Oct. 1 for coverage that takes effect Jan. 1. That's also when two other major provisions of the law kick in: the mandate that almost all Americans carry health insurance, and the rule that says insurers can no longer turn away people in poor health.

States setting up their own exchanges are already taking different paths. Some will operate their markets much like major employers run their health plans, as ""active purchasers"" offering a limited choice of insurance carriers to drive better bargains. Others will open their markets to all insurers that meet basic standards, and let consumers decide.

""It's healthy for the states to have various choices,"" said Ben Nelson, CEO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ""And there's no barrier to taking somebody else's ideas and making them work in your situation."" A former U.S. senator from Nebraska, Nelson was one of several conservative Democrats who provided crucial votes to pass the overhaul.

Now, with its online insurance marketplaces days from opening for business, the White House is focused on a task that many of the law’s supporters complain is overdue: explaining it.

On Thursday, the president debuted a healthcare primer in a speech meant to convince young, uninsured Americans that they will find insurance coverage to suit their budgets.

The speech was laced with political jabs at congressional Republicans who want to gut or delay the program, but mostly it was a direct plea to Americans to give the new virtual marketplace a try when the six-month enrollment period opens Tuesday.

“This is real simple,” Obama told the crowd at a community college in Largo, Md. “It’s a website where you can compare and purchase affordable health insurance plans side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak, same way you shop for a TV on Amazon.”

“You’ve got new choices,” he said. “You’ve got new competition because insurers want your business, and that means you will have cheaper prices.”

The administration has faced considerable criticism from fellow Democrats for not selling the Affordable Care Act, as the law is called, in the 3 1/2 years since Obama signed it into law. White House officials have countered that until the benefits became clear to consumers through the online system, such efforts would have been futile.

A few glitches in that system are popping up. Small businesses in almost three dozen states will have to use paper forms to sign up until November because that part of the online system isn’t ready to go.

Republican critics noted the irony of what was supposed to be a cutting-edge digital operation resorting to snail mail and, as one GOP staffer scoffed in an email, “facsimile machines!”

But advisors to the president are hoping that the shopping experience of comparing plans, with subsidies and lower premiums available for many users, will win people over.

Obama and his White House have their work cut out for them. Polls show that uninsured Americans, the primary target for the law’s new marketplaces, are wary. A Pew Research survey conducted last week found that the uninsured were as likely to disapprove of the law as they were to approve of it, with about one-third of those without insurance saying they thought the law would have a negative effect on them. Only half of the uninsured surveyed knew that the law offered subsidies.

“The policy is complicated. It doesn’t lend itself to slogans and one-liners,” said Patrick Griffin, former legislative director for President Clinton and now the academic director of the Public Affairs and Advocacy Institute at American University. “This is really the critical moment for the president, as people get to know the program.”

Attracting consumers, particularly young, healthy ones whose support is essential for the system to hold costs down, has been priority No. 1 for the Obama administration during much of this week. Most everyone, from the commander in chief to rank-and-file staff, has explained details to the media.

Obama’s speech will be followed by a series of events in which White House and agency officials will fan out to participate in conferences, briefings and online conversations with target groups.

In a preview of the online sign-up, White House Deputy Senior Advisor David Simas showed more than three dozen reporters how the “experience” works.

Applicants answer questions about their age and income, then find plans for which they are eligible. They can select from four plan levels — bronze, silver, gold or platinum — and compare premium costs, coverage and providers.

The administration has invested heavily in time and money to make sure the online prompts work, knowing that one glitchy experience can turn off a potential customer and create a talking point for the law’s opponents.

“News flash: There will be glitches. When glitches arise, we will fix them. This is what you do,” Simas said, noting that other complex healthcare initiatives have also had problems when they were rolled out. “We are confident that, when things arise, there are teams and people in place that will address them and remediate.”

The federal government has been training people at community centers, clinics and hospitals to guide applicants through the process. Call centers will be open 24 hours a days to help resolve problems.

Even the looming government shutdown, which could start Tuesday, won’t threaten the rollout of the president’s signature plan, administration officials vowed. Key workers already have been designated as “core and essential” and will continue to work even as other government employees are furloughed.

The program, Obama said at Prince George’s Community College, “is going to happen in five days.”

On Capitol Hill, opponents of the law were hard at work to prove him wrong.

House Republicans want a one-year delay of the healthcare program in exchange for granting Obama’s request to raise the national debt limit by Oct. 17.

“The president says, I’m not going to negotiate,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday after talking over the strategy with colleagues. “I’m sorry, but it just doesn’t work that way.”

At first, it looked like conservatives would leave themselves a way to propose their own version of the same reforms in Obamacare, and rename it on their own terms. As such, there seemed to be a method to it when, at the outset, conservatives worked hard to prevent an actual discussion of the substance of the law itself. Much of the initial hatred of the ACA was focused on a series of phony talking points and outright lies (“government takeover” of health care; “death panels”; the law was “rammed through” using corrupt procedural tricks; etc.)."
http://news.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-filibuster-obamacare-194126361.html,,[],Why Ted Cruz will spend the rest of the day speaking on the Senate floor about Obamacare,"In a Capitol Hill hallway leading to the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had just finished telling reporters that no Republican would delay a vote to fund the government. But then Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, carrying a stack of papers under his arm, strolled past him toward the door of the chamber.



Cruz turned his head toward the gaggle of reporters around Reid and walked through the doors onto the floor, where he stopped at his desk on the far-right corner of the room.

“I intend to speak about defunding Obamacare until I am unable to stand,” he declared.

With his colleague Utah Sen. Mike Lee on his left and an aide on his right, Cruz began what is expected to be an hourslong speech that could last late into the night about the importance of gutting the federal health care law that President Barack Obama signed in 2010.

Cruz’s move has all the looks of an old-fashioned filibuster, but it’s technically just a very long speech that will draw attention and focus to his cause. In this case, he will be delaying a vote on a bill to fund the government that, when the Democrat-controlled Senate is finished with it, will include funding for the health care law, but he won't derail it. According to Reid's spokesman Adam Jentleson, Cruz ""negotiated the terms"" of his speech with the Democratic majority leader before taking the floor.



Congress must approve a bill that sets federal spending rates by Oct. 1, or the government will shut down. For months, Cruz and a small group of conservative Republicans have called on their party to refuse to fund the government unless spending on the president's signature domestic policy win is stripped, even if it means shutting down the government.



Among Republicans in the upper chamber, there aren't many takers.

At about the same time that Cruz began his speech, Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who doesn’t support the Texas lawmaker's filibuster-esque strategy, voiced clear disapproval with the delay tactic. Without Cruz’s objection, Senate Republicans could have given up their time to debate the funding bill, which would have sped up the voting process.

Story continues

Because Cruz chose to use up most of that time, the Senate won’t be able to return its version of the funding bill back to the House until Sunday night — just a day before the shutdown deadline — eliminating the leverage House Republicans might have had in the debate.

“It would be to the advantage to our colleagues in the House who are in the majority to shorten the process, and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process, I would not object,” McConnell told reporters in the first moments of Cruz’s speech. “I don’t know who else in the conference may feel differently. But I do know that if the House doesn’t get what we send over until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot.”

When House lawmakers return to Capitol Hill that day, they will be asked to vote on what the Senate has sent them: a government spending bill that includes funding for Obamacare. They will have a choice to whether pass the bill as is, or change it and send it back to the Senate and risk a shutdown.

If the bar for success is actually defunding Obamacare, Cruz's effort is almost sure to fail. Senate Democrats and the president have made clear they will not approve any legislation that defunds the law, even if it means bringing the nation to the brink of a shutdown.

But that’s really not the point.

By making himself into a stalwart on the issue who is at odds with members of his own party on the approach, Cruz is setting himself up to be a hero of the party’s conservative base who want lawmakers to eliminate the health care law at all costs.

To that end, Cruz’s exercise will be a success."

A federal judge in the District of Columbia will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in one of several cases brought by states including Indiana and Oklahoma, along with business owners and individual consumers, who say that the law does not grant the Internal Revenue Service authority to provide tax credits or subsidies to people who buy insurance through the federal exchange.

At the same time, the House Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing to examine whether Mr. Obama is “rewriting his own law” by using his executive powers to alter it or delay certain provisions. The panel also will examine the legal theory behind the subsidy cases: that the I.R.S., and by extension, Mr. Obama, ignored the will of Congress, which explicitly allowed tax credits and subsidies only for those buying coverage through state exchanges.

“We have agencies under this administration having an attitude that they can fix a statute, that they can improve upon a statute, that they can look at a statute’s clear language and disregard it,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who is bringing one of the cases, said in an interview Monday. “The president himself has said on more than one occasion, ‘I can’t wait on Congress.’ In our system of government, he has to.”"

Updated 4 p.m. ET, 11/15/2013

(CNN) - The House approved Republican legislation on Friday giving health insurers the option of extending plans through 2014 that would otherwise be canceled for not complying with Affordable Care Act standards.

The bill, approved 261-157, would also allow new customers to enroll in those plans. Thirty-nine Democrats crossed party lines and joined a nearly unanimous GOP caucus in voting for the measure proposed by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan.



It has little to no chance of clearing the Democratic-controlled Senate, however.

The White House has also indicated President Barack Obama would veto the measure if it reaches his desk, saying the Republican plan would undermine the integrity of the law aimed at providing health coverage to millions of Americans without it.

The Senate is taking a wait-and-see attitude about possible legislation over the politically charged insurance cancellations after Obama ordered administrative steps on Thursday to address the matter.

Obama's signature domestic policy initiative has been marred by the disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov website, which allows consumers to buy new health plans online, and by the policy cancellations.

Both problems have put congressional Democrats in a difficult political position since the Affordable Care Act was approved in 2010 with no Republican support and signed by Obama, a Democratic president.

Earlier, the House rejected a similar plan offered by Democrats, but it was more restrictive than the Republican measure and therefore not supported by the majority.

Separately, Obama sat down with insurance company executives on Friday at the White House.

Prior to the meeting, the President said that he and his administration would brainstorm with and solicit ideas from industry on how to smoothly carry out the changes he is making to the Affordable Care Act.

Obama said there would be a ""collaborative process"" around his proposal to reverse insurance plan cancellations due to broader coverage requirements under the sweeping law.

""We want to make sure that we get this done,"" Obama said."

But rather than $2,500 by the end of Obama’s first term, the White House says it would be $2,000 in savings by 2019—in part because the health care law will not even be fully implemented until 2014."

When we last saw the health-insurance-is-evil mascot, in September, he was performing gynecological exams on young women and prostate exams on young men, in an effort to make Americans believe that the government is “playing doctor.”

In the new, Halloween-themed spot, he’s part of a pressure-campaign — with hints of the movie “Videodrome”— to make a young man sign up for insurance through an exchange.





It’s more of the same the-government-is-coming-to-get-you nonsense. But there’s one substantial difference between the September ads and the October version. Whereas the original ads merely instructed viewers to opt “Opt Out of ObamaCare,” the Halloween one also states “You have options. Get the insurance that’s right for you.”

What, exactly, are these options? I went to optout.org to find out, following links to a FAQ.

Q. Don’t I have to buy into Obamacare? Isn’t it illegal to not buy Obamacare insurance? A. No. There is a relatively small tax associated with not buying government-approved health insurance, but you can pay that small penalty and buy a health insurance plan that meets your individual needs. For example, in Virginia right now there are 87 health care plans sold on the individual market — the cheapest one being $40.84 per month. Not all of those plans would meet the standards to be sold in a government “exchange,” but almost all of them would be a better deal for young Virginians. It’s like that across the country.

So Generation Opportunity isn’t counseling young people to forgo health insurance — it’s suggesting they buy insurance that doesn’t meet A.C.A. standards. That advice is both terrible and nonsensical.

Let’s start with the terrible part.

I checked out the $40.84 a month plan, now selling for $46.25 and, surprise surprise, there’s a reason it’s cheap. It doesn’t cover office visits for primary care doctors or office visits for specialists. It comes with a $10,000 a year deductible. If you end up in the emergency room, you have to pay 20 percent co-insurance after the deductible. Same with outpatient surgery and hospitalization.

Onto the nonsensical.

After January 1, no matter where you buy insurance — through an exchange or directly from an insurer through an agent — the basic rules will be the same. All insurance plans will have to meet government standards: essential benefits, tiers of coverage, no discrimination for pre-existing conditions and so forth. That means cut-rate policies like the one recommended by Generation Opportunity won’t exist. You can buy it in these last two months of 2013, but when you renew it in 2014, it’ll look completely different and will cost more.

The assurance that “you have options” turns out to be as empty as the Republicans’ “repeal and replace” slogan. The Republicans have no viable replacement plan; Generation Opportunity can point to no workable alternative."

USA TODAY

Almost one in four Texans are uninsured%2C the highest rate in the nation

President Obama%27s health care law has been attacked by Texas%27 Republican leaders

Federal government will run health care exchange

This story was originally published Aug. 14, 2013.

Most Americans know the Affordable Care Act — aka ""Obamacare"" — as the legislation birthed from one of the most acrimonious political debates in years. In 139 days, the law will shift from talking points to the kitchen table, from an eventuality to reality. This sweeping government experiment, after all, stands to affect tens of millions of people.

Jan. 1, 2014, will be the official launch date for a federal endeavor that will reshape the U.S. health insurance market coast to coast. People without insurance can start signing up Oct. 1. Depending on where you live, your experiences with the new law — and your costs — could differ dramatically.

USA TODAY's Julie Schmit, Rick Jervis and Greg Toppo reported from California, Texas and West Virginia to see what people are seeing, and thinking, as the law is being rolled out in three very different ways in these three states.

• • •

AUSTIN — Sometimes Darrell Tatum's car gets only a quarter-tank of gas. Other months, the grocery list gets whittled down. Or the purchase of notebooks, pens and other school supplies for five children is postponed.

The budgetary gymnastics Tatum and his wife, Quintina, perform each month are necessary to meet the $500-to-$600 monthly health care premiums they pay — an amount that has risen steadily over the years and that he says is slowly drowning the Dallas couple in debt.

Tatum, 41, says he's stuck in financial limbo: He makes too much money as a municipal worker to qualify for benefit programs for the poor but not enough to cover the rising cost of health care.

""We're trying to do the best we can with what we have, but it's rough,"" he says. ""It's almost like you're penalized for working.""

HOPE OR HEADACHE?

For Tatum and thousands like him, the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance exchanges offer hope. Almost one in four Texans — more than 6 million residents — are uninsured, the highest rate in the nation, according to the Census Bureau. The Affordable Care Act could halve the Texas number by next year, according to a recent study by the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.

Welcomed by many residents and scorned by others, the law has been vilified by Texas' Republican leaders. Gov. Rick Perry has led the charge, criticizing the legislation as bad policy and the health insurance exchanges it creates as lacking appropriate funding. Texas, along with 26 other states, has opted not to set up a state-run exchange to market health coverage to the uninsured. For states with leaders who disagree with the initiative, it's the best way to protest the Washington directive. In these cases, the federal government will run the exchanges.

Texas would be better off receiving block grants from Washington to help the uninsured rather than being forced to participate in a federal system, says state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, an outspoken critic of Obamacare who has been a state senator since 2007.

""We're smarter about Texas than Washington is,"" he says. ""This is the worst legislation I've ever seen from the federal government.""

Despite the resistance from state leaders, grass-roots groups across the state are scrambling to inform Texans about the exchanges. Foundation Communities, an Austin-based group that helps low-income residents with their taxes, has set up two enrollment centers to help residents sift through the benefits of the law, says Elizabeth Colvin,a director of the group.

The key struggle is persuading residents that the exchanges will be available, despite highly publicized attacks from leaders in Austin, she says. ""It's a challenge for Texans because there's no state leadership on this issue,"" Colvin said. ""It's all coming from the local level.""

'HIGH-RISK POOL'

Cost predictions have been elusive because the federal government has yet to release the health care rates that will be available through the exchanges, says David Warner, health and social policy professor at the University of Texas.

One group of Texans stands to instantly benefit: the ""high-risk pool,"" those previously uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions or other factors. The new law will cut their premiums in half, Warner says.

Also set to benefit are individuals not part of a large employer insurance group. ""They'll be able to get coverage, and it won't be totally unaffordable,"" Warner says.

That's welcome news for Will Love, 27, co-owner of an Austin video production company who has been uninsured for two years. After the Houston firm he worked for closed, Love paid for his own insurance from Humana. The rates steadily began to climb, from $125 a month to $150 a month, even though he remained healthy and incident-free. So he dropped coverage.

He says he's counting on a stable, affordable alternative with the exchanges. ""I hope to find a reasonable price with a reasonable company that's not going to jack up the prices once you sign up,"" Love says.

Though Tatum first heard about the exchanges via a friend's Facebook post, he plans to attend seminars to learn more about the program he says could better his life.

""It'll give me a better feel for where my dollars are going and what I think is best for my family,"" Tatum says. ""I'd just like to have that option."""
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-administration-pushes-back-over-canceled-health-plans-002343897--sector.html,,[],Obama administration pushes back over canceled health plans,"By David Morgan and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration, under pressure over the botched opening of its healthcare website, scrambled on Tuesday to try to appease hundreds of thousands of people whose coverage is being canceled as insurers prepare for reforms in 2014. President Barack Obama and his top officials are trying to contain the fallout from people angry they have lost their insurance and frustrated with being unable to shop easily for alternatives on the malfunctioning website, HealthCare.gov. Obama had repeatedly promised that under the new signature law, people with insurance would be able to keep their existing plans if they wanted to - a pledge that glossed over details of which policies would be protected from new minimum benefit requirements. ""The president, as awesomely powerful as the office is, can't go back in time,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters when asked whether Obama would use the same words to describe the grandfathering provision. Obama's Chief of Staff Denis McDonough urged a group of insurance executives on Tuesday to tell consumers in cancellation notices that they could qualify for premium tax credits through the new online marketplaces. Some cancellation victims hear only about costly replacement plans from their insurers and not about options available through the marketplaces, including the subsidies. ""He's saying that we all need to do the best we can in getting information that consumers need,"" Carney said. OBAMA TO DALLAS, SEBELIUS ON THE HILL On Wednesday, Obama will visit volunteers in Dallas who are helping people sign up for health insurance - part of a push for senior officials to highlight the program in cities with the highest number of uninsured residents. In Dallas County, more than 670,000 people or 28 percent of the total population do not have insurance, the White House said. Texas has the nation's highest percentage of uninsured people. Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will face tough questions at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Wednesday, both from Republicans who oppose Obamacare as an unwarranted expansion of the federal government, and from Democrats dismayed at how poorly the launch has gone. Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the federal agency responsible for the Obamacare rollout told lawmakers on Tuesday that her staff is working on a plan to get more information to people with canceled plans. ""This is actually a conversation we're having today ... Is there a way we can actively engage to reach out to people who have been canceled?"" Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. In California, officials announced that a major insurer - Blue Shield of California Life and Health Insurance Co - has agreed to allow 115,000 state consumers who had been notified of cancellations to keep their lower-priced policies through the first quarter of next year. SUBPOENAED REPORTS Under Obamacare, it is mandatory for everyone to have health insurance or pay a fine. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million Americans would sign up for insurance in the first year. The administration had expected about 800,000 enrollees in October and November. But the problems reduced that to a trickle. The government will release the month's enrollment figures next week. On Tuesday, a U.S. House of Representatives oversight panel subpoenaed the Obama administration for internal reports on enrollment. Officials are racing to fix the website's problems by the end of November in hopes that people will be able to enroll by December 15. Two hospital operators - Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Holdings Inc - said on Tuesday that HealthCare.gov's technical problems were gradually diminishing. The law calls for new coverage to kick in on January 1, although the ultimate deadline for signing up without penalty is March 31. During a 2-1/2 hour hearing in the Senate on Tuesday, even members of Obama's Democratic party made plain their concerns. ""There's been fear, doubt and a crisis of confidence,"" said Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat. ""What I worry about is that there's such a crisis of confidence that people won't enroll."" Tavenner said the administration plans to start a four-month media campaign in selected markets next month aimed at bringing back uninsured Americans, particularly young adults, who were unable to enroll. The administration also will continue to try to shame state Republican governments which have opted out of expanding Medicaid programs for the poor such as Texas - part of what Obama's visit to the state will highlight on Wednesday. ""These are the folks who do not have the access to healthcare, and if they do, it's too expensive for them in the jobs that they have,"" said Garnet Coleman, a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Expanding Medicaid in Texas would mean about $24 billion in federal revenue to Texas over three years, reducing the costs of ""uncompensated care"" for people who show up at emergency rooms without any insurance - costs currently covered by property taxes, said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, a Democrat, who spoke to reporters on a conference call organized by the White House.

Ted Cruz vowed Sunday he would seek to stop legislation to keep the government running unless President Obama agrees to defund the nation’s new healthcare law.

The potential presidential contender from Texas has taken the lead in the Senate in a politically risky effort that has sparked divisions within the GOP. Although conservative and tea party groups have rallied to his cause, Cruz acknowledged Sunday he did not yet have enough GOP senators willing to launch a filibuster that could shut down the government. But he’s working on it.

“I believe we should stand our ground,” Cruz said on “Fox News Sunday.” “This has been a fast-moving target. You know, just a few weeks ago we didn’t have anywhere near the votes we needed in the House or in the Senate,” he said. “It’s now our turn to unify, to stand together with House Republicans.”

House Republicans have made stopping the Affordable Care Act their top priority before the healthcare law’s new online marketplaces open for business Oct. 1, the start of the new federal fiscal year.

Late last week, the House GOP approved legislation that would defund the healthcare law as part of a bill to keep the government running past Sept. 30.

Senate Republicans now find themselves in a bind. Because Democrats have the majority in the upper chamber, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to easily have the 51 votes needed to strip the healthcare provision from the bill, keeping Obama’s signature domestic achievement intact.

Cruz is pushing his fellow GOP senators not to let the bill advance to that stage. In a move that has drawn criticism from within his party, Cruz argued that Republicans’ only hope is to mount a filibuster to stop the entire bill, refusing to give their support to cross the required 60-vote threshold to proceed to the legislation.

That creates a complicated procedural argument, as was seen over the weekend as the conservative Heritage Action supported the bill in the House but on Saturday urged senators to block it. When the debate starts this week the Senate will have just a few days to act before government funding for routine services, including keeping national parks open and providing pay for soldiers, would run out by Oct. 1.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/planned-parenthood-nyc-teen-pregnancy-psa-bloomberg-182816020.html,,[],Planned Parenthood trashes NYC’s ‘Cost of Teen Pregnancy’ PSAs,"Planned Parenthood denounced a new ad campaign aimed at sexually active teens, unveiled by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week, for shaming current and expectant teen parents and their children.

“The latest NYC ad campaign creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people,” Haydee Morales, vice president of education and training at Planned Parenthood's New York office, said in a statement released on Wednesday. “The city’s money would be better spent helping teens access health care, birth control and high-quality sexual and reproductive health education, not an ad campaign intended to create shock value.”

The ""Cost of Teen Pregnancy"" campaign—displayed in subways and bus shelters citywide—includes images of concerned toddlers with messages for their teen parents.

""Honestly Mom,"" one poster reads, ""chances are he won't stay with you. What happens to me?""

""Dad, you'll be paying to support me for the next 20 years,"" reads another, noting that New York state law requires a parent to pay child support until a child is 21.

The public service announcements also instruct teens to text ""'NOTNOW' to 877877 for the real cost of teen pregnancy.""

[Related: NYC rolls out 'Cost of Teen Pregnancy' PSAs]

""This campaign makes very clear to young people that there’s a lot at stake when it comes to deciding to raise a child,” Bloomberg said in his weekly radio address on Sunday.

The effort, he said, will ""let thousands of young New Yorkers know that waiting to become a parent could be the best decision they ever make.”

According to the health department, the city's teen pregnancy rate has fallen 27 percent in the past decade. But Morales said stigmatizing teens who have already become parents ""has not been a part of what has led to this success.""

In 2011, the city quietly rolled out a controversial pilot program that allowed teens access to the contraceptive drug Plan B—the so-called ""morning after pill""—in some of its public schools without parental consent. (Parents could choose to exclude their children from access.) In 2012, officials expanded the program to 13 schools with hopes of implementing it citywide.

That program—dubbed CATCH, or ""Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Health""—is supported by Planned Parenthood."

Story highlights Stephen Breyer, 74, fell off his bike near the Korean War Veterans Memorial He underwent ""reverse shoulder replacement"" surgery, the Supreme Court says Breyer is expected to be released from the hospital early next week

(CNN) —

Stephen Breyer is known as one of the most active and engaging justices on the Supreme Court.

He’s also been known to take a painful spill, every now and then.

One such fall – from the bicycle he was riding Friday afternoon near the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington – landed the associate justice in an ambulance, and eventually at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, the Supreme Court announced in a press release.

It is the third publicly known major bike crash for Breyer in the last two decades.

At the hospital, the 74-year-old was diagnosed with a proximal humerus fracture – the humerus being the upper bone of the arm. He underwent reverse shoulder replacement surgery on Saturday morning.

Unlike in a healthy shoulder, where the humerus ends in a ball shape and fits into the shoulder blade to form a shoulder, in reverse shoulder replacement surgery the anatomy is reversed. In other words, a new metal “ball” is attached to the shoulder blade, or scapula, and a plastic cup is put at the upper end of the humerus bone.

Patients typically leave the hospital after this procedure – first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 – in two or three days, according to the American Academy of Ortophaedic Surgeons. The Supreme Court said Breyer is expected to head home early next week.

It’s not the first time that he’s tumbled off his bike and ended up in a hospital.

In 1993, he had a nasty accident when a car stuck him in Harvard Square while he was on his two-wheeler. He suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs.

Then, over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Breyer broke his right collarbone after falling off his two-wheeler in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he has a second home.

He’s had bad luck in other ways as well.

An intruder armed with a machete robbed Breyer, two guests and his wife – renowned pediatric psychologist Dr. Joanna Breyer – while they were vacationing on the Caribbean island of Nevis in February 2012.

Three months later, his Washington home was burglarized.

Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government ­information technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers.

By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law.

The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say.

In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record “could well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.”

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration.

But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics.

Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars.

The review of CGI Federal concluded there was “no evidence of performance risk,” according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process.

CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011.

At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group’s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm.

Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags.

“Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?” asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. “Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.’’

Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency “adheres by a long-

established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.”

CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal’s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS.

Former AMS executives have defended that company’s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS’s earlier failures.

CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company’s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress.

People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions.

The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system.

Linda Odorisio, CGI’s vice president for global communications, said the company “continues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience” on the Web site.

She added that CGI Federal “contributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.”

Umbrella contract

In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking “world-class IT services” to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal.

CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process.

In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company’s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a “risk assessment” of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors.

Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of “predecessor companies,” such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency.

AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI’s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area.

One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports.

AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. “That should have stood out,’’ the former official said.

CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM.

While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting.

Deadline pressure

In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act’s all-important Web site. “Time is of the essence,” said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011.

With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. “There was very great time pressure,” recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. “The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.’’

Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal.

As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees.

“I deliberately stayed out of contracting,’’ said Leslie Norwalk, the agency’s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. “If that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.’’

Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders’ business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel.

The companies’ past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said.

While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company’s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal’s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it.

And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues.

CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies.

Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company’s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm’s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor."
http://www.nbcnews.com/health/states-losing-billions-refusing-expand-medicaid-report-finds-2D11697962,2013-12-05 17:18:00+00:00,['Maggie Fox'],"States losing billions in refusing to expand Medicaid, report finds","Texas will lose $9.2 billion in 2022; Florida says goodbye to $5 billion; Georgia is out $4.9 billion. A new report details just how much states are losing because they don’t want to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, and it’s not chump change.



Red states may be sticking to their Republican beliefs in small government, but the Commonwealth Fund finds they are passing up billions in federal funding by saying no to the Medicaid expansion.

“By choosing not to participate, Texas, for example, will forgo an estimated $9.58 billion in federal funding in 2022. Taking into account federal taxes paid by Texas resi­dents, the net cost to taxpayers in the state in 2022 will be more than $9.2 billion,” the report by Sherry Glied and Stephanie Ma of New York University says.

“We find that the Medicaid expansion will be a relatively large source of federal revenue to state enter­prises,"" the report adds. States expanding Medicaid will get, on average, more than twice as much in federal funding than they get in federal highway funds, they said.

It’s the latest report on what Medicaid expansion would mean on a fiscal level to states, and the timing couldn’t be better for the administration of President Barack Obama. The White House has launched a three-week drive to highlight what it says are the benefits of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and Obama has been urging states to expand Medicaid.

The ACA was designed to transform health care in the United States, which most experts agree currently costs too much and leaves far too many people without health insurance. One way to do that is through the health insurance exchanges, where people can buy private insurance and which are dominating the headlines now.

The other way was by requiring states to extend Medicaid to people earning up to about 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $14,800 for single people and $31,000 for a family of four.

Medicaid is usually a cost-sharing program – the federal government pays on average about 57 percent of costs and states pay the rest. But under the expansion, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the additional costs for the first three years. States will have to kick in a very small percentage more each year after that. By 2020, the federal government will pay 90 percent of the costs.

But after a series of challenges to the law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the Medicaid expansion requirement went too far. States can’t be forced to add more people to Medicaid, the court ruled.

Many Republican-led states immediately said they would not be expanding Medicaid.

“As of November 2013, 20 states have decided to opt out of the Medicaid expansion,” the report said.

Glied and Ma calculated how much this would cost by 2022, and took into account states’ arguments about the so-called woodwork effect – the argument that people who were already eligible for Medicaid but had not applied would do so if they heard about the expansion. These people would still cost states the 43 percent or so of state contributions to Medicaid.

But they also calculated savings. States would not only get the direct federal money, but would save the money that taxpayers end up spending on so-called uncompensated care – when sick or injured uninsured people show up in emergency rooms seeking treatment.

Their calculations show that by 2022, Florida would lose more than $5 billion and Georgia would forgo $4.9 billion. They also looked at what Medicaid brings to states in comparison to two other giant federal programs – federal highway funds and defense funds.

The report projects that Alabama would bring in $2.1 billion in federal funds from expanding Medicaid; $975 million in federal highway funds and $10.4 billion in defense procurement contracts. North Carolina would get $5.7 billion in Medicaid money; $1.3 billion in federal highway funds and $4.6 billion in defense contracts.

Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Tennessee are undecided about the expansion. Indiana would bring in nearly $2.6 billion in Medicaid money in 2022; $1.2 billion in highway funds and nearly $5.6 billion in defense contracts.

Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming are not expanding Medicaid.

The Urban Institute, Lewin Group and Rand Corp. have also issued reports showing states will lose billions by not expanding Medicaid.

The decision not to expand Medicaid has more than financial effects. It leaves a lot of people without any inexpensive options for health insurance, because the law assumed states would expand Medicaid and doesn’t provide insurance subsidies for the very poor.



“If adopted by all states, the Medicaid expansion is expected to provide health insurance to as many as 21.3 million Americans by 2022,” the report says.



“No state would experience a positive flow of funds by choosing to reject the Medicaid expansion. Because the federal share of the Medicaid expansion is so much greater than the state share, taxpayers in non-­participating states will nonetheless bear a significant share of the overall cost of the expansion through federal tax payments—and not enjoy any of the benefits,” the report concludes.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/17/gop-governors-stand-ground-on-obamacare-health-exchanges/,2013-02-17 00:00:00,[],GOP governors reject ObamaCare health exchange partnerships,"As the final deadline for creating state health insurance exchanges passed Friday, New Jersey, Tennessee and Florida said they would not work with the federal government on establishing insurance markets required under ObamaCare.

Exchanges are online markets required under the federal health care law where consumers will be able to buy individual private policies and apply for government subsidies to help pay their premiums.

In his announcement Friday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said his administration is committed to complying with ObamaCare, but ""only in a manner that is the most effective and efficient for the residents of New Jersey, and the businesses that will carry the costs of this new program.""

Christie, who previously vetoed legislation establishing a state-run health insurance exchange, said in a statement that the federal government is best equipped to operate the exchange.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, said in a letter to U.S. Health and Human Resources Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the partnership model doesn't address his concerns over what he called ""aggressive federal timelines, a lack of true flexibility for states, and misguided federal policies.""

Haslam noted that he had the same complaints when he rejected a state-based exchange in December. His deadline decision means Tennesseans will participate in an exchange completely run by the federal government.

In Florida, which already missed the deadline for operating an exchange on its own, Gov. Rick Scott also declined to partner with the federal government.

“We continue to be concerned about the many unknowns impacting the cost of operating an exchange, and simply do not have enough information to make a decision about running one at this time,” Scott’s communications director, Melissa Sellers, told the Palm Beach Post.

Friday's deadline showed that the nation is about evenly split between states that decided they want a say in running new insurance markets and states that are defaulting to federal control because they don't want to participate in the exchanges. That choice was left to state governments under the law.

With some exceptions, states led by Democrats opted to set up their own markets, called exchanges, and Republican-led states declined.

Barring last-minute switches that may not be revealed until next week, 23 states plus Washington, D.C., have opted to run their own markets or partner with the Obama administration to do so.

Twenty-six states are defaulting to the feds. But in several of those, Republican governors are trying to carve out some kind of role by negotiating with Sebelius. Utah's status is unclear. It received initial federal approval to run its own market, but appears to be reconsidering.

With some exceptions, including Idaho, Nevada and New Mexico, Republican-led states are maintaining a hands-off posture, meaning the federal government will step in.

""There is a sense of irony that it's the more conservative states"" yielding to federal control, said Sandy Praeger, the Republican insurance commissioner in Kansas, a state declining to run its own exchange. First, she said, the law's opponents ""put their money on the Supreme Court, then on the election. Now that it's a reality, we may see some movement.""

They're not budging in Austin. ""Texas is not interested in being a subcontractor to Obamacare,"" said Lucy Nashed, spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry, who remains opposed to mandates in the law.

In Kansas, Praeger supported a state-run exchange, but lost the political struggle to Gov. Sam Brownback. She says Kansans will be closely watching what happens in neighboring Colorado, where the state will run the market. She doubts that consumers in her state would relish dealing with a call center on the other side of the country. The federal exchange may have some local window-dressing but it's expected to function as a national program.

Christine Ferguson, director of the Rhode Island Health Benefits Exchange, says she expects to see a big shift to state control in the next few years. ""Many of the states have just run out of time for a variety of reasons,"" said Ferguson. ""I'd be surprised if in the longer run every state didn't want to have its own approach.""

In some ways, the federal government has a head start on the states. It already operates the Medicare Plan Finder for health insurance and prescription plans that serve seniors, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Both have many of the features of the new insurance markets.

Administration officials are keeping mum about what the new federal exchange will look like, except that it will open on time and people in all 50 states will have the coverage they're entitled to by law.

Whether or not the bugs get worked out, consumers will be able to start signing up Oct. 1 for coverage that takes effect Jan. 1. That's also when two other major provisions of the law kick in: the mandate that almost all Americans carry health insurance, and the rule that says insurers can no longer turn away people in poor health.

States setting up their own exchanges are already taking different paths. Some will operate their markets much like major employers run their health plans, as ""active purchasers"" offering a limited choice of insurance carriers to drive better bargains. Others will open their markets to all insurers that meet basic standards, and let consumers decide.

""It's healthy for the states to have various choices,"" said Ben Nelson, CEO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ""And there's no barrier to taking somebody else's ideas and making them work in your situation."" A former U.S. senator from Nebraska, Nelson was one of several conservative Democrats who provided crucial votes to pass the overhaul.

Good luck. Not only will you have to navigate the technical problems that have plagued the site -- but in most states, those running the exchanges are not posting ratings that could give shoppers a clear sense of how good the plans are.

The consumer ratings are called for in the Affordable Care Act. They would be provided by a respected independent company, allowing consumers to judge health plans by treatment outcome, service and consumer satisfaction.

Federal and state officials, though, largely decided it would reflect poorly on the insurance exchanges if some companies were rated and others were not -- and have not yet published them.

""We think that is ludicrous,"" said Garry Maisel, CEO of Western Health Advantage, an ObamaCare-approved provider. ""Consumers deserve to know what is unrated versus what has been around a long time and has a good quality rating.""

The controversy arose last week in California, when Western Advantage and two other highly rated providers -- Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Care -- complained the state failed to post their ratings because of opposition from lower-rated plans.

""When a quality rating is available, consumers should have access to it,"" said Maisel. ""If I was a consumer, I would want to know [if] the plan I pick, the network of providers I access care through, was just put together or has been around a long time.""

Kaiser Permanente in California is ranked #7 nationally. Blue Shield in California is ranked #414. But on the Covered California website, consumers have no way of knowing that, because the state refused to post the ratings.

Last week, officials reversed that decision and said the state will begin adding quality scores in 2015.

""To make a smart choice, we need more information, that is why this rating system is so important,"" said health care analyst Betsy McCaughey. ""Otherwise choosing a plan on these exchanges is just a shot in the dark.""

The National Council on Quality Assurance rates almost every health plan available nationwide on treatment, prevention and customer service. Each category is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and then plans are ranked from best to worst.

Eighty percent of insurers nationwide are rated by the NCQA. But only eight states are posting those ratings. The rest, including the 34 state health care exchanges managed by the federal government, do not.

""It is extremely important consumers have this rating information, otherwise people are just going to pick the lowest price plan when in fact a more expensive one may serve them better,"" said McCaughey.

Some states -- like Colorado, Minnesota and Oregon -- do post ratings. The Oregon website lists the quality score right next to price, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. Maisel said it is a model other states should strive for.

""Value is a combination of price versus quality,"" he said. ""It's like an equation, like a teeter totter. So put it out there! Price is out, so put the quality rating out there and let the consumer decide who they want to buy based on value.""

Under the law, the health care exchanges have until 2016 to display quality-of-care data."

The new HealthCare.Gov website collapsed early Tuesday morning under the weight of 2.8 million users,said Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

""As with any product launch, there will be glitches. We will fix them,"" Tavenner told reporters on a conference call.

“Sorry, Health Insurance Marketplace Live Chat isn’t available right now,” the website advised. “We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try again later, or call your Customer Service Center at 1-800-318-2596.”

President Barack Obama said it crashed under the weight of a flood of users. ""“More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning,” he said, adding:

“There were five times more users than have ever been on medicare.gov at one time. That gives you a sense of how important this is to Americans around the country,"" Obama said in an address aimed mostly at criticizing the federal government shutdown.

That doesn't make the exchanges a failure, however, Obama said. ""A couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new operating system, and within a few days they found a glitch and fixed it,"" he said. “I don’t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads -- or threatening to shut down the company if they didn’t. That’s not we do things in America. We don’t actually root for failure.”

The federal government apologized via Twitter. “We're working to fix these issues as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience,” @HealthCareGov tweeted.

That means people in the 36 states where the federal government is running the health insurance exchanges couldn’t sign up right away on the first day.

Republicans in Congress used the new ammunition to immediately attack the Administration's plans for health reform.

""Today, across the country, Americans are attempting to purchase health insurance on Obamacare exchanges and are being met with crashing websites, missing price information, confusing forms and in some cases, exchanges that had to delay their start date because they aren't ready yet,"" said California Republican Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .

""These 'glitches,' which the President is trying to brush off, reveal how totally unprepared the government is for this launch even with three and a half years to prepare.""

Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican who has been a critic of the ACA, tweeted a picture of her state's malfunctioning site. ""#ObamaCare exchanges open today and #WA State's website isn't even working. Precursor to the complications to come,"" she said.

Tony Jewell of Ventnor, N.J., was disappointed but not surprised.

“I did not log on this morning expecting to sign up for health care today and they didn’t let me down,” said Jewell, who says he quit a full-time job to open his own public relations business, in the expectation that he could buy health insurance on the new exchanges.

“I would have been pleasantly surprised if it had worked,” added Jewell, who tried to log onto the federal exchange website in his home state of New Jersey.

Maryland's site for enrolling people crashed early Tuesday. ""We are currently experiencing a high volume of traffic on MarylandHealthConnection.gov and we want to make the experience as positive for everyone as possible. Please check back later,"" the site advised. California's site also seemed stuck.

The health insurance exchanges are at the heart of the changes being made by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is taking effect in stages. Tuesday is the first day that people who don't have health insurance can begin to sign up, either on the federal exchange, or on state exchanges in the 14 states that are running their own.



But it's a six-month open enrollment period, so people do not have to get signed up the first day. The government and advocacy groups, anticipating problems, have hired thousands of ""navigators"" to help walk people through the process, which even on a good day was expected to take 45 minutes or longer.

Jewell, a Republican who says he is embracing Obamacare reluctantly because there’s nothing better being offered, is confident the health exchanges will eventually work. “As a patient, I assume they will get the program up and running,” he said.

And he knows it can be difficult to launch a new program. Jewell was a spokesman at the Health and Human Services Department under former President George W. Bush.

""I am a Republican who is sympathetic to the program. It would be helpful if it worked for me. I assume it will,” he said. He and his wife have pre-existing health conditions that make it difficult to buy private insurance, but the ACA forces insurers offering new policies to take all comers, regardless of previous health issues.

Jewell was among thousands of Americans who were ready to try the new online marketplace. He doesn’t think it crashed under the weight of demand, however.

“I was trying during the 7 am hour on the East Coast. I can’t believe people were setting their alarms to get up for Obamacare,” Jewell said.

But some states suggested that is what did happen. “We logged 10,000 visitors in the last 3 hours,” Connecticut’s exchange administrators tweeted at @AccessHealthCT. “22 enrollments so far. Make sure your browser is updated if you are having problems!”

Some saw the website crashes as a sign of success. ""This plan that the Radical GOP says is so bad is on the verge of crashing due to such high volume,"" said Mark Nelson of Kingman, Ariz., in a Facebook posting."

Monday is the last chance for consumers to sign up for Obamacare insurance that starts Jan. 1 under the federal healthcare law.

Last-minute shoppers should prepare for busy signals if they call the Covered California insurance exchange, or for long waits at some enrollment events.

There’s been a sharp increase in applications in recent days ahead of Monday’s deadline for January coverage, according to state officials, agents and enrollment counselors. More than 53,000 people enrolled in health plans over a three-day period last week.

“The pace is frenetic right now,” said Dede Kennedy-Simington, a vice president at Polenzani Benefits in Pasadena who has been working at numerous enrollment events. “There’s growing interest, not from a sense of desperation, but from a desire to get it done.”

If you miss this deadline, there will be other opportunities. Open enrollment lasts through March 31 under the Affordable Care Act.

Here are five things to know for Monday’s deadline:

1. The Shop and Compare tool at the state website, www.coveredca.com, is a good place to start.

You can get a quick idea of health plan options and prices in your area and what government assistance you may be eligible for. You can do all that without having to create an account or complete a lengthy application.

2. Filling out an application and selecting an insurance plan takes time.

Some individuals can get through the process in 30 to 45 minutes, but agents and enrollment counselors warn that it could take up to two hours for some families to enter their information and sort through the various coverage options.

It takes extra time, in particular, when some family members qualify for Medi-Cal and others need to purchase regular health insurance.

3. Applying over the phone or on paper may not be your best bet.

The Covered California service-center number is 800-300-1506. But the average wait time has been more than 30 minutes, if you get through at all.

“Our staff is working at top speed to answer questions and process all the applications,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California.

The exchange said it is still accepting paper applications Monday, but it recommended that people go online instead so they can get immediate feedback on whether the application includes all the required information.

4. There may be help nearby.

Statewide, thousands of county health workers, enrollment counselors and state-certified insurance agents are sitting down with folks and helping them enroll. Many of them are working at special enrollment events Monday at libraries, community centers, clinics and other locations.

This link at the Covered California website can give you names and locations for assistance near you.

5. Don’t forget to pay.

Health insurers won’t start coverage until you pay the first month’s premium. In California, the deadline to pay that first premium is Jan. 6, with coverage retroactive to Jan. 1.

The exchange says insurers should send out member identification cards and an enrollment packet within 10 days of receiving payment.

Some consumers who enrolled weeks ago have complained about not getting a bill yet from their insurer. People should contact the insurance company, not the exchange, about billing matters.

After Monday, the next sign-up deadline is Jan. 15 for insurance starting Feb. 1.

Advocacy groups had lobbied hard for the Medicaid expansion, and Democrats in the Legislature applauded it.

But it also reflected Mr. Christie’s national ambitions and his continued push to present himself as a different kind of Republican — one who could teach Washington a thing or two about bipartisanship. He talked about how he had “turned Trenton upside down” in his first three years, ending what he described as the tax-and-spend ways of his Democratic predecessors. His proposed budget of $32.9 billion is an increase of about 4 percent over the one approved last year, but he emphasized that the state will spend less than it did in the 2008 fiscal year.

Accepting federal money for Medicaid, he said, would save the state $227 million in the fiscal year that begins in July. Earlier this month, the governor showed his opposition to the health care law when he declined to establish a state-run exchange to allow people to buy health insurance, insisting that the federal government would have to do it.

Under the new law, the federal government pays the full cost of Medicaid expansion for the first three years, and 90 percent of the cost after that. The governor said in his speech that he would end the expansion if, “because of adverse actions by the Obama administration,” it no longer made fiscal sense.

Still, the partial embrace by one of the country’s most prominent Republicans was a boost to the president’s health care program. It came a week after Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a former health care executive, reversed his previous position and joined a number of Republican governors taking federal money to expand Medicaid. The Supreme Court ruled last year that though the law was constitutional, states could choose not to expand their programs."

President Obama’s first term in office was a busy time for the first lady.

Nearly three-quarters of black women say it’s a good time to be a black woman in America, saying Michelle Obama’s role in the White House has raised their profile, according to a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

Nearly three-quarters of black women say it’s a good time to be a black woman in America, saying Michelle Obama’s role in the White House has raised their profile, according to a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

They’re at it again.

The latest public rant against Michelle Obama’s effort to promote low-calorie school lunches was recently caught on tape in Alabama — the usual protest against the federal government meddling in local business. And then it quickly found its way around to the first lady’s posterior.

“Fat butt Michelle Obama,” said Bob Grisham, a high school football coach who was surreptitiously recorded by one of his students. “Look at her. She looks like she weighs 185 or 190. She’s overweight.”

Grisham, who was suspended Monday, is neither the first nor the most high-profile person to feel moved to comment on the first lady’s physique. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has repeatedly called her Michelle “My Butt” Obama. And Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican, issued an apology after he was caught commenting on her “large posterior.” (Grisham has also said he misspoke.)

Michelle Obama obviously is not the first first lady to be subjected to criticism for the way she looks. Hillary Clinton was accused of having “cankles” — slang for chubby ankles. One of her predecessors was immortalized in song by the group Mission of Burma: “I’m haunted by the freakish size of Nancy Reagan’s head /No way that thing came with that body.”

The first lady stuck with one of her favorite designers, Jason Wu, for her second inaugural gown — but what’s the big fuss? Style reporter Katherine Boyle stops by to explain the significance of first lady fashion decisions throughout the years. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

But what is it with Michelle Obama’s critics and the fixation with her derriere?

“We have a history in this country of white people not showing adequate respect for and devaluing the bodies of black women, and this most definitely falls in line with that,” says Ayana Byrd, the co-editor of the anthology “Naked: Black Women Bare All About Their Skin, Hair, Hips, Lips and Other Parts.” (Grisham, Limbaugh and Sensenbrenner are white men.)

The focus on this first lady’s posterior has historical antecedents. It reaches back to the imagery of Hottentot Venus, a woman from what is now South Africa whose naked body and pronounced posterior were paraded in shows throughout 19th-century Europe. On to the selling and trading of black women’s bodies through slavery. In modern times, black women’s figures continue to be up for public discussion in ways that are celebratory (see: “Brick House” by The Commodores) and insulting (see above).

Michelle Obama — who is 5-foot-11 and praised for her fashion sense, her bangs and her toned biceps — regularly emerges in polls as one of the most popular public figures in the country. (The White House does not discuss her weight.) She has graced magazine covers from Vogue to Better Homes & Gardens. Women’s health magazines have created workouts to help other women get “Michelle Obama arms.”

Her presence as first lady challenges the historic view of a black woman’s place and notions of beauty, says Michaela Angela Davis, a fashion expert who has campaigned for more positive images of black women in the media. “Michelle is black from a distance. She’s a real black girl,” Davis says. “A lot of people have tried to make diversity into this weird beige thing. Her presence is just really powerful to interject into the global consciousness.”

The first lady’s critics “are reacting to the culture in which they’ve grown up or they are using it as a code to racialize Michelle Obama and remind people that she’s black,” says Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. “It is unreasonable to expect a nearly 50-year-old woman to have the body of a 25-year-old. She looks great for her age.”

Although the White House declined to comment, Michelle Obama was asked a few years ago during an interview whether the focus on her has affected her body image.

“No, not really — but I thank God I’m 45 in this and not 35. I feel bad for young women going through the same thing, because [at that age] you don’t know who you are. I know what makes me happy,” she said. “My message to women: Do what makes you feel good, because there’ll always be someone who thinks you should do it differently.”

To put these two plans in perspective, let's imagine that Ms. Barrette's luck runs out and she receives a diagnosis of breast cancer that will cost $120,000 to treat.

Under her current junk plan, she would probably receive no more than a few hundred dollars of benefits for doctor visits and drugs. It wouldn't cover her surgery, her chemotherapy, her many expensive medications, or the repeated diagnostic tests she'd likely require. She would end up with probably $119,000 of unpaid medical bills. With the Humana plan, those bills top out at $6,300 a year, no matter what."

Days after opponents of Obamacare failed to derail it by shutting down the government, a federal court in Washington took up a lawsuit aimed at canceling the premium subsidies the law provides for many low- and moderate-income Americans. It’s the first of two such challenges to reach the federal courts this month, and it illustrates — again — how some of the law’s critics are trying to repeal it by inflicting the maximum possible damage on the public. The courts should reject the challenges.

At issue is the Internal Revenue Service’s decision in May 2012 to make premium subsidies available in all 50 states for individuals with incomes less than four times the federal poverty level, currently $11,490 for a one-person household. In the case heard Monday in Washington, the plaintiffs argue that the IRS exceeded its legal authority because the text of the law calls for subsidies to be provided only “through an exchange established by the state.”

In their view, that means there should be no subsidies available in the more than 30 states where officials decided to let the federal government operate the exchange. It would also mean that employers in those states would not face a mandate to provide coverage, because that requirement is inextricably linked to the availability of subsidies. (The administration announced in August that it would not enforce the employer mandate until 2015.)

The Justice Department argues persuasively that the plaintiffs — four self-employed individuals and three businesses that do not want to buy or provide the required amount of insurance next year — misread the law. Congress clearly intended that the new exchanges help all uninsured Americans, regardless of who runs their state’s version. It also defies credulity to argue that Congress would require some poorer Americans to buy insurance without subsidies simply because their elected officials weren’t able or willing to set up an exchange. Most important, it would be wrong to reverse the IRS’ stance now, long after state officials decided not to operate their own exchanges. At the very least, the stakes should have been clear to the public and their representatives before they made that choice.

A preliminary ruling in the first case is expected as soon as Tuesday. If the courts involved don’t dismiss these challenges soon, millions of Americans could be at risk of receiving subsidies that must later be repaid, or of being denied the aid they need to afford the coverage required by law. Ideally, Congress would clarify the law to remove any doubt about the premium subsidies. But if lawmakers aren’t willing to do so, they should at least be prepared to restore them swiftly if the courts rule the other way."
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/business/24menu.html,2010-03-24 00:00:00,['Stephanie Rosenbloom'],Health Law Requires Chains to Post Calorie Counts,"Buried deep in the health care legislation that President Obama signed on Tuesday is a new requirement that will affect any American who walks into a McDonald’s, Starbucks or Burger King. Every big restaurant chain in the nation will now be required to put calorie information on their menus and drive-through signs.

In other words, as soon as 2011 it will be impossible to chomp down on a Big Mac without knowing that it contains over 500 calories, more than a quarter of the Agriculture Department’s 2,000-calorie daily guideline.

The legislation also requires labels on food items in vending machines, meaning that anybody tempted by a king-size Snickers bar will know up front that it packs 440 calories.

The measure is intended to create a national policy modeled on a requirement that has already taken effect in New York City and was to go into effect in 2011 in places like California and Oregon. The new federal law requires restaurant chains with 20 or more outlets to disclose calorie counts on their food items and supply information on how many calories a healthy person should eat in a day."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-fights-to-recapture-health-care-initiative-035746716.html,,[],Obama fights to recapture health care initiative,"After an initial phase of shell-shocked damage control, President Barack Obama’s efforts to save his signature health care law — and with it his second term and his place in U.S. history — are taking on an aggressive tone.

“Let’s face it, a lot of us didn’t realize that passing the law was the easy part,” Obama told scores of supporters late Monday at a posh Washington hotel.

The new approach — emphasizing Affordable Care Act benefits that are already in effect and don’t require navigating a botched website, promoting the law’s success stories, blaming Republicans and the news media in equal measure for the bad news — also comes with a renewed focus on issues that helped unite the winning coalition of his 2012 re-election campaign.

The president has stepped up calls for Congress to pass, by year’s end, legislation overhauling America’s immigration policy. On Tuesday, he’ll meet with top executives to make the argument that doing so would help the economy.

And the Democratic-held Senate voted 61-30 late Monday to advance a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, with seven Republicans breaking ranks to side with the majority. “Common sense,” Obama told activists backing his Organizing for Action group at the St. Regis Hotel.

Amid headlines screaming out Obamacare’s setbacks, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the president’s “No. 1 priority has and will be economic progress.”

That's two issues that rally pivotal segments of the public behind the Democratic position, while dividing Republicans, and one that remains atop the list of voter concerns. Is the president in campaign mode one year after his re-election and one year before the 2014 midterms?

“I just promise that in November of 2013 I haven't had a single conversation about 2014,” Carney insisted Monday.

Riiiiiiight. The White House has said that the president will travel to Dallas on Wednesday for an event with health care volunteers — and then fundraising for the Democratic Senate campaign fund. On Friday, after a stop in New Orleans to discuss export growth, Obama will head to Miami for more Democratic fundraisers.

Story continues

And somehow neither the president nor Vice President Joe Biden mentioned the Affordable Care Act directly when they headlined separate rallies for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Sunday and Monday. His GOP opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, has bet his chances for an upset win on opposition to the health care law.

But for the first time in its brief history, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s fate isn’t up to congressional arm-twisters, or White House negotiators or even the voters. It’s up to a phalanx of experts (affectionately dubbed “the nerds” by some in the West Wing) doing surprisingly literal damage control, trying to fix HealthCare.gov

Democrats and Republicans alike say that repairing the site by the administration’s self-imposed early December deadline could dramatically reshape the Obamacare battlefield.

“It comes down to the website, which has really been a manifestation of people’s fears. It validates people’s concerns about the law,” a top aide to a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 told Yahoo News.

“The best thing that could happen for us is for the fix to be good enough, the enrollment drive good enough, that it makes what happened in the last two months seem like it never happened,” said the aide, speaking anonymously to discuss the situation candidly. “We need this law to work.”

After that, Democrats say, the law could benefit from steadily growing numbers of Americans getting benefits.

But “this fix, the website, the enrollment drive that comes next, it has got to dwarf what came before, make it look like a campaign for elementary school class treasurer,” the Democratic aide said.

“I won’t say that fixing the website two months after it launched is a huge victory, but the website was an obvious, easily understood failure we had nothing to do with,” one Republican congressional aide told Yahoo News. “We’ll still push on the job losses and the ‘if you like your plan, you can keep it.’”

Republicans have seized on Obama’s refrain as evidence of dishonesty. Major news outlets have highlighted the many thousands of people losing their existing health care coverage because it does not meet the law’s more generous requirements.

On Monday, Obama himself tried to retroactively add a little fine print. “What we said was, you could keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed,” he told supporters.

That was in the legislation — plans that existed before it became law (and remained unchanged) were grandfathered in. New plans or those that underwent modifications had to adhere to the ACA’s tougher standards.



The White House points out that plans disappeared all the time before the Affordable Care Act — and that many of those vanishing now offer precious little actual coverage. Obama aides also underline that the higher cost of options provided under the new law reflect more generous benefits, while emphasizing that many Americans will qualify for subsidies to make it easier to buy health insurance.

But those qualifiers weren’t in Obama’s public campaigning.

“Nobody is changing what you’ve got if you’re happy with it,” the president said the day he signed the measure into law. “If you like your doctor you will be able to keep your doctor.”

The White House also has deployed more standard weapons — an array of what it calls “fact checks,” positive anecdotes to counter the (frequently dubious) horror stories, and links to positive coverage.

Outreach to worried congressional Democrats has been uneven. After the problem-plagued Oct. 1 rollout, it wasn’t until Oct. 30 that all Senate Democratic offices received their first White House-drafted talking points — a delay one Democratic leadership aide blamed on the two-week government shutdown.

(UPDATE: Another Senate Democratic leadership aide wrote in to dispute that account, saying that all Senate Democratic offices “were provided with message guidance and talking points consistently, both from the White House and HHS [Department of Health and Human Services], throughout October.”)

At the same time, the administration has held at least 20 briefings this year for lawmakers of both parties, and 10 more for staff.

“These briefings, were both offered proactively to and done at the request of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, and are in addition to regular, constant outreach conducted at the staff level between White House staffers and Hill staffers on a daily basis,” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “They also are in addition to four meetings the president himself had in early October with House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. “

Obama aides have taken the president’s lead and adopted a freshly combative tone — but that may be in part because they know things will get worse before they get better.

In mid-November, the administration is due to release the number of Americans who have successfully enrolled in health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

Even with day-by-day improvements to HealthCare.gov, administration officials expect that number to be low, touching off a fresh round of criticisms.

“We're only one month into a six-month open enrollment period,” Obama said Monday. “It’s not as if this is a one-day sale or something. So we've just got to keep on working.”"

In fact, I’d suggest using this phrase to describe the Obama administration as a whole. F.D.R. had his New Deal; well, Mr. Obama has his Big Deal. He hasn’t delivered everything his supporters wanted, and at times the survival of his achievements seemed very much in doubt. But if progressives look at where we are as the second term begins, they’ll find grounds for a lot of (qualified) satisfaction.

Consider, in particular, three areas: health care, inequality and financial reform.

Health reform is, as Mr. Biden suggested, the centerpiece of the Big Deal. Progressives have been trying to get some form of universal health insurance since the days of Harry Truman; they’ve finally succeeded.

True, this wasn’t the health reform many were looking for. Rather than simply providing health insurance to everyone by extending Medicare to cover the whole population, we’ve constructed a Rube Goldberg device of regulations and subsidies that will cost more than single-payer and have many more cracks for people to fall through."

Pollak'],"When It Mattered, Red-State Dems Voted Against Obamacare Delay","Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.

new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline — Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013

The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.

Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.

As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.

When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.

What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead."

Mr. Snyder’s preferred bill — one he had lobbied for intensely for months — initially fell short by one vote, but the governor salvaged a deal hours later. The vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 20 to 18, with only 8 Republicans in favor. The Michigan House, which had earlier approved a similar measure, will need to vote on the Senate version before Mr. Snyder can sign the bill.

“The Affordable Care Act has probably been one of the most divisive issues that our country has faced in the last few years, and many people do have strong opinions both for and against,” Mr. Snyder said after the vote. “I just ask that all Michiganders step back and look to say this isn’t about the Affordable Care Act. This is about one element that we control here in Michigan that we can make a difference in here in people’s lives.”

While the authors of the federal health care law intended to expand Medicaid, the federal and state health program for poor people, and at least initially pay for the expansion, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out, setting up a struggle that has played out in the states largely along partisan lines."

Peters'],Senators Make Bipartisan Push for Mental Health Care,"WASHINGTON — While the Senate has been consumed with a divisive debate over expanded background checks for gun buyers, lawmakers have been quietly working across party lines on legislation that advocates say could help prevent killers like Adam Lanza, the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., massacre, from slipping through the cracks.

Proponents say the plans, which stand a good chance of being included in any final gun-control bill, would lead to some of the most significant advancements in years in treating mental illness and address a problem that people on both sides of the issue agree is a root cause of gun rampages. Unlike the bitter disagreements that have characterized efforts to limit access to guns, the idea of improving mental health unites Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural, blue state and red state.

“This is a place where people can come together,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, who has worked with some of the Senate’s most conservative Republicans on a piece of mental health legislation. “As we’ve listened to people on all sides of the gun debate, they’ve all talked about the fact that we need to address mental health treatment. And that’s what this does.”

The issue also appeals to members of Congress in another important way: it serves as a political refuge for Republicans and more conservative Democrats who are eager to offer a federal response to the shootings in Connecticut and Aurora, Colo., but have no interest in taking any action that could be seen as infringing on constitutional gun rights."

They lost.

On Wednesday, those two ugly facts began to sink in among the House’s hard-core conservatives. For nearly three years, they had effectively led the House itself — drawing their power from the intimidating sense that they were capable of anything. They often compared themselves to William Wallace, the Scottish rebel who (at least in the movies) succeeded because he refused to compromise.

But then — just like in the movies — “Braveheart” died.

On Wednesday, conservatives’ frontal attack on President Obama’s signature health-care law had ended after a government shutdown, a major decline in Republican popularity and a final compromise that gave them almost none of what they had wanted.

“We tried,” Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said at a gathering of glum conservatives on Wednesday morning. “We lost.”

Senate leaders announced a budget compromise Wednesday that will raise the debt ceiling and re-open the government. In Play's Chris Cillizza breaks down which political players came out of the deal on top and which ones did not. (The Washington Post)

He continued. It got worse. After the first effort to defund the health-care law, Mulvaney noted, conservatives tried to take away health-care subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs. If Obama­care would survive, then at least the “political class” would not benefit from it, he said. But then — “We lost that one as w ell.”

“We’re all pretty down today,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), sitting on the same dais. Labrador’s only hope was that the polls were wrong and that the American people had somehow been impressed by all this. “Now they know we’re willing to fight,” he said.

For House conservatives, Wednesday was a day unlike many others in the giddy period since Republicans took the House in 2010. They had lost all control of the standoff after House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) had failed to find a bill that all Republicans could support.

So the Senate — led by Democrats — was supposed to cut the deal instead. And did. The House was expected to pass it, with most Democrats and a few Republicans voting yes. And did.

For House conservatives, at last, there was nothing to do but wait. And then lose.

“He said, ‘Y’all need to get some rest. Go home. Sleep. We’re going to live to fight another day,’ ” said Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), relaying the message Boehner gave House Republicans in a private meeting Wednesday afternoon.

But before they could go home, there was a vote. And it wasn’t supposed to come until the evening. In the meantime, some conservatives filled the empty hours giving tours of the Capitol (since the regular tour guides had been furloughed by the shutdown).

“It actually looks like a jellyfish,” said Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who was in a basement tunnel, showing a group the display of artwork from students who had won a congressional art competition. The winner from Wilson’s district sent in an abstract composition. Apparently some kind of marine life.

“You see a lot of teen angst as you walk down here,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), doing the same thing, in the same tunnel, a few feet behind Wilson.

Inside a House hearing room, several members attended a lunch meeting called “Conversations with Conservatives.” Over lunch from Chick-fil-A, they pondered what could have gone wrong.

The answer, for several members, was that other people had done them wrong. At the top of the list were Democrats and Obama. The conservatives — having taken the ultimate hardball tactic of refusing to fund the government unless “Obamacare” was defunded — were unhappy that Democrats had played so tough in response.

“He won’t negotiate,” Labrador said.

The conservatives also blamed Democrats for not acting on a series of miniature spending bills to reopen parts of the government.

Another problem: Congress’s Republican leadership. In particular, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) blamed his party’s leaders for . . . well, for acting on a series of miniature spending bills to reopen parts of the government.

“We kept talking, and in a negotiation, the person who keeps talking loses,” Massie said. “That’s what Harry Reid did so wonderfully. He refused to talk,” Massie said, referring to the Senate majority leader, who steadfastly refused to consider what Republicans were sending over.

The conservatives also, at times, seemed to blame their own faction. They lamented that one potential winning message — that the health-care law’s “individual mandate” should be delayed a year — had been obscured by other demands.

“We didn’t really articulate that well,” said Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). “It kind of got lost in the shuffle of the initial ‘defund’ push.”

By the “defund” effort, DeSantis meant the attempt — led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) — to defund the health-care law entirely. Defunding the law was even more odious to Democrats than delaying its impact. Its chances of being accepted were zero.

So, in hindsight, DeSantis said throwing the GOP’s weight behind the defunding effort was a mistake.

He did not mention that among the legislators who made this mistake was . . . DeSantis himself. “I fully support the House’s continuing resolution that will keep our government open while stripping funding from Obamacare,” DeSantis said in a statement on Sept. 19.

On Wednesday, the legislators at “Conversations with Conservatives” said they would look to the future. They hoped that — as in “Braveheart” — this abject defeat would lead to victory. Eventually.

Maybe new Republicans would be elected to Congress next year, they said. “This would have turned out better if we had more conservatives in the House,” Labrador said.

Reporters asked: Will they try the “Braveheart” strategy again? After all, if the Senate’s plan passes, the debt ceiling will need to be raised again in a few months. And the government will need to be funded.

But even before this fight ended, there was a sense that the next one might be different.

“I’m going to commit candor here,” Massie said. “I think we have less leverage on the next CR, and on the next debt-limit [debate], than we do right now.”

The vote, at last, came about 10:20 p.m. Conservatives clustered in the back of the chamber, looking at the votes tallying up. They lost, as expected — the vote was 285 to 144. The ayes had it.

Usually, when a big vote is won, that is the moment when somebody cheers. But in this case, both sides kept quiet. The conservatives and everybody else just filed toward the exits, out toward the end.

More than two weeks into the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov, the website created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law still isn't working right.

""The website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable,"" Obama said during a Tuesday interview with KCCI television in Des Moines, Iowa. But the administration won't disclose exactly what's wrong with the health insurance exchange website, or when consumers can expect to see the promise of convenient, one-stop shopping for health benefits and financial assistance fulfilled.

Time remains for these problems to be resolved, but not much. ""If things aren't resolved in three weeks, we've got some serious, serious problems,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor and health care reform expert at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va., and an Obamacare supporter. ""I don't think we're anywhere close to there yet, but if the whole thing collapses, it'll be another generation before we get this problem fixed.""

The White House vowed to fix the problem and said people are managing to sign up for health care. ""The website is unacceptable, but we're working to improve it and the product is good,"" said White House official Tara McGuinness. ""Across the country people today are getting access to affordable care. We're going to work intensely for the next six months to make sure we meet the demand. We're going to make affordable health care accessible through the website, through the phone, in communities across the country, and with in-person assistance.""

The stakes are high for uninsured people, individuals and families who buy their health insurance directly and the entire health care industry. Without a functioning health insurance exchange, many people too sick or too poor to get health insurance under the old rules will remain shut out of the system. The millions of Americans who already buy their own insurance will face major disruptions. Health insurance companies could experience a nightmare scenario where the bulk of the individuals who brave the frustrating sign-up process are those who are sick, desperate for coverage and expensive to treat.

And anyone who isn't able to get coverage because of the exchanges' problems could confront the prospect of tax penalties through no fault of their own.

For Obama and the Democrats who've stood behind Obamacare during four years of relentless attacks from Republicans -- including a face-off that led to a 16-day government shutdown and a threat of U.S. default -- failure of this magnitude would discredit a core premise of this presidency, that government can do big things to improve Americans' lives.

Although there are signs of incremental improvement, HealthCare.gov is unable to reliably allow consumers to create accounts, verify their identifies, apply for tax credits available to low- and middle-income people or shop for health insurance plans. Insurers are receiving bad enrollment data and states are reporting difficulties in accessing the federal system.

The administration won't say how many people have signed up so far, but its reported goal of enrolling 500,000 people this month appears difficult to reach. Some thousands of dogged shoppers appear to have signed up for plans on the federal health insurance exchanges, also called marketplaces. But others have become discouraged, and traffic to HealthCare.gov has waned, according to one independent analysis. People working to help consumers are using paper applications for financial assistance that eventually will have to be entered into the computer system.

If the administration does succeed in getting the website in working order in the coming weeks, the system will be strained by a backlog of pending applications and a crush of consumers frantically trying to get their coverage in place before the new year.

Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a plan for Jan. 1, and until Feb. 15 to avoid being hit with tax penalties for violating the law's mandate that individuals obtain health insurance. The 2014 enrollment period ends March 31.

The administration insists it's doing everything it can to get HealthCare.gov into shape. In states operating their own health insurance exchanges, a small but growing number of people are signing up.

""We really do need to get this thing resolved pretty quickly. And then, of course, the longer you wait to resolve it, the more you have piling up for the last minute with the risk of another crash,"" Jost said.

Robert Laszewski, a health care industry consultant, is skeptical that the health insurance exchanges' information technology failings can be mitigated in time to prevent chaos. ""The fix might be to take it down and start over,"" he said. ""I don't know what the best-case scenario for these guys fixing this thing is, but it's got to be two or three weeks, minimum.""

The urgency is underscored not only by the fact that the low-income Americans and the 48 million uninsured -- those whom the law was primarily intended to benefit -- won't get the help they were promised. There's also the plight of those who currently have coverage they bought themselves that now has to be replaced, said Laszewski, who is president of Alexandria, Va.-based Health Policy and Strategy Associates. That represents about 3.6 percent of the population, according to census data.

Many health insurance products currently on the market don't meet Obamacare's benefit standards and consumer protections so they are being discontinued. Consumers with these plans are the most likely to see rate increases next year, especially if they earn too much to get tax credits. ""They've got to convert to a new policy -- no ifs, ands or buts about it,"" Laszewski said.

And while people who currently pay for their own health insurance are likely to do whatever they can to remain covered, buying a plan directly from an insurance carrier or using a private online broker isn't what Obamacare promised, and tax-credit subsidies aren't available without the federal system. Moreover, these private companies aren't prepared to deal with millions of customers who were supposed to be using the government marketplace, Laszewski said.

Under these circumstances, the lion's share of the people who do whatever is necessary to sign up through HealthCare.gov are likely to be the sickest and most expensive to cover because they have the greatest need, Laszewski said. That would make the pool of people covered very costly, causing health insurers to lose money and likely rethink whether they want to participate in the exchanges, he said. ""The fundamental threat to Obamacare is we don't get enough healthy people in the pool to keep the rates reasonable, and they are in grave danger of that problem,"" he said.

If these problems persist longer -- weeks, months, a whole year -- the entire Obamacare project falls apart, Laszewski said: ""It's a holy shit moment.""

(CNN) —

It was the government’s fault, contractors on the problem-plagued website for President Barack Obama’s signature health care reforms told a congressional hearing on Thursday.

In more than four hours of testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, officials of companies hired to create the HealthCare.gov website cited a lack of testing on the full system and last-minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment system.

Angry exchanges between Republicans who oppose Obamacare and Democrats defending it erupted repeatedly, while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software buckled when the system went online on October 1.

Complaints about logging in, lengthy delays, incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have fueled continued GOP attacks on the 2010 Affordable Care Act that was upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

The White House and administration officials say the enrollment problems are being fixed. On Thursday, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) that oversees the new programs under the health care reforms said almost 700,000 applications have been submitted online on either the federal or state websites.

While the applications don’t mean that many people have fully enrolled for health insurance under the new system, the figure represents a significant increase in those who have been able to start the process in recent days.

However, Julie Bataille, the CMS director of communications, was unable to say how many of the 700,000 applications were submitted on the federal website.

Bataille seemed to agree with some of the criticism by contractors at the hearing, saying that “due to a compressed time frame, the system just wasn’t tested enough, especially for high volume.”

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on Thursday raised the threat of a possible subpoena if Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius doesn’t respond to his panel’s questions and requests for documents about problems with the Obamacare website. Committee aides say Sebelius has failed to respond to a previous request and Issa is now giving her until Monday to comply or possibly face “compulsory” action.

At Thursday’s hearing, committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan called the launch of the website “nothing short of a disaster,” noting that contractors at the hearing previously “looked us in the eye and assured us repeatedly that everything was on track, except that it wasn’t.”

Upton and other Republicans said it heralded problems with the rest of the Obamacare reforms.

“I am more nervous today than I was when I got here,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said of security concerns raised by Thursday’s testimony, such as code changes being made to fix the problems without undergoing normal testing.

Democrats, however, accused Republicans of continuing a campaign to sabotage the health care reforms instead of working to fix problems in the system intended to help millions of uninsured Americans obtain affordable health coverage.

They noted that media headlines in 2006 blared similar descriptions of rollout problems with the Medicare Part D prescription drug reforms of the Bush administration, but that Democrats then worked with Republicans to resolve the issues instead of trying to scrap the legislation.

“The Republicans don’t have clean hands coming here. Their effort is not to make things better,” said Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. “Let the goal here be to fix it, not nix it.”

In the first detailed account of what happened, officials of four contractors involved in the website creation described a convoluted system of multiple companies operating separately under the oversight of CMS, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Each said their individual components generally performed as planned after internal testing, but all conceded that CMS failed to conduct sufficient “end-to-end” testing of the entire system before the launch.

“The system didn’t receive adequate end-to-end testing,” declared Andrew Slavitt of Optum, while Cheryl Campbell of CGI Federal added “no one ever gets enough time for testing.”

Campbell, whose company has a contract worth a possible total of more than $200 million for its work on the system, noted than an end-to-end test conducted within two weeks of the launch caused the system to crash. She said it was up to CMS to decide on proceeding with the rollout.

Slavitt, whose company stands to make up to $85 million for its work, acknowledged that unexpected volume at the start overwhelmed the “enterprise identity management” or EIDM entry portal blamed for the initial blockages.

He and Campbell blamed a decision by CMS within two weeks of the launch to require users to fully register in order to browse for health insurance products, instead of being able to get information anonymously, as originally planned.

While the technical change to require registration was easy, the result was a much greater burden on the system that it failed to handle, Slavitt and Campbell said.

Insurers pledge to help solve website problems

Bataille of CMS called the change a business decision to ensure that users could fully enroll from the start. She blamed the initial problems of the website on “pent up consumer demand.”

However, Slavitt of Optum said CMS was warned about the system’s problems ahead of the launch.

That was enough for GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina to say: “The bottom line here is that CMS is responsible for this failure.”

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday that administration officials “did not anticipate, we did not know of the kind of problems that would take place beginning on October 1 until October 1 came and we saw these challenges.”

He repeated the President’s insistence that the problems were being fixed, an assurance also provided by Bataille.

“We increased our bandwidth by adding servers and improving site architecture. We’re continuing this work,” she said. “Problems wtih our database and system synchronization also made it hard for visitors to initially create accounts. So we improved site architecture, substituted in hardware and optimized database inquiries.”

White House video makes HealthCare.gov issues seem simple

Sebelius offered a similar view while addressing reporters in Arizona, acknowledging continued issues while insisting “fixes” are being instituted regularly to make things better.

“It’s better today than it was on October 1, but it’s a long way from perfect,” Sebelius said after visiting one of 17 call centers where some 10,000 representatives talk by phone or online with those asking about health plans. “And we are determined to make it perfect.”

Campbell blames initial problems on the “enterprise identity management” function known as EIDM that serves as the entry portal to the website.

Her company expects the online system to be able to enroll Americans seeking health insurance by January 1, she added, rejecting media reports that software needs to be scrapped or that five million lines of code must be rewritten.

Campbell called the software program unprecedented, noting that “for the first time in history” it combines the process of enrolling and selecting health insurance with determining eligibility for government subsidies “all in one place.”

Sebelius on the spot in Obamacare website fiasco

The EIDM tool designed by another contractor, which Campbell’s advance testimony doesn’t name, “created a bottleneck that prevented the vast majority of users from accessing” Healthcare.gov when it opened, according to Campbell.

However, Republicans said they had failed to gain full access to the website despite repeated attempts and complained they hear similar stories from their constituents across the country.

Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President

The latter sent an eight-page letter Wednesday to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together HealthCare.gov giving them two days to provide documents, meeting lists and all communications with the Obama administration on the project, committee spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said.

Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Chuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter to 47 contractors on Thursday also seeking extensive details of their work on the Obamacare website including all contracts and other information.

Congressional Republicans have sought to undermine the health care reforms, trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying them a requirement for legislation to fund the government.

Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President

The White House has been pushing back against not just Republicans, but some Democrats who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond March 31 and/or a delay in penalties for those who don’t sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues.

The Obama administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care, and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon.

Still, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted “the individual mandate timing” – i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by March – “has not changed. … It was true this morning. It is true tonight.”

USA TODAY

A sign of our divided times: Even a first lady project encouraging people to drink more water is drawing criticism.

Michelle Obama traveled Thursday to Watertown, Wis. — naturally — to promote a new program by her Partnership for a Healthier America to encourage people to drink more water.

""Drink just one more glass of water a day and you can make a real difference for your health, your energy, and the way you feel,"" Obama said. ""So Drink Up and see for yourself.""

Yet Politico reports several public health experts as saying that the White House is overselling the benefits of water.

""There really isn't data to support this,"" said Stanley Goldfarb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""I think, unfortunately, frankly, they're not basing this on really hard science. It's not a very scientific approach they've taken. ... To make it a major public health effort, I think I would say it's bizarre.""

Goldfarb also told Politico: ""The idea drinking water increases energy, the word I've used to describe it is: quixotic,"" he said. ""We're designed to drink when we're thirsty. ... There's no need to have more than that.""

The White House and its experts say too many Americans aren't drinking nearly enough water.

Ursula E. Bauer, director of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said drinking water has many positive benefits.

""Drinking water can help people maintain a healthy weight and may be an important strategy for preventing obesity,"" Bauer said. ""Even mild levels of dehydration may result in decreased concentration, alertness, and short-term memory among children and adults as well as diminished athletic performance.""

In announcing Michelle Obama's ""Drink Up"" program, the White House said:

""To remind families of the importance of drinking water, supporters of PHA's effort will carry the Drink Up logo on nearly 300 million packs of bottled water; more than half a billion bottles of water; 200,000 packages of reusable bottles; and more than 10,000 reusable bottles in the next year.

""Additionally, more than 10,000 outdoor public taps are expected to carry the brand over the next few years. Cities will also be utilizing the logo to encourage people to drink more tap water.

""And hosts on a dozen TV shows are participating in an around-the-clock, cross-network, bilingual day of drinking water and encouraging their audience to Drink Up."""

Many Democrats also want to see a more aggressive and visible president to push the law across the country. This week Mr. Obama is returning to the fray to an extent unseen since he signed the law in 2010, including a White House event on Friday to promote the law’s benefits for women, the first in a series of appearances for health care this year.

A number of health insurance changes have already taken place, but this fall, just as the 2014 election season heats up, is the deadline for introducing the law’s core feature: the insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, where millions of uninsured Americans can buy coverage, with subsidies for many.

For the third time, Republicans are trying to make the law perhaps the biggest issue of the elections, and are preparing to exploit every problem that arises. After many unsuccessful efforts to repeal the law, the Republican-led House plans another vote soon. And Republican governors or legislatures in many states are balking at participating, leaving Washington responsible for the marketplaces."

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']",Delay of employer mandate only latest snag in implementing ObamaCare,"The Obama administration delaying the start of the employer mandate part of ObamaCare this week is not the first snag in implementing the president’s signature health care law.

Other parts of the 2010 law have already been delayed or discarded, including a requirement that businesses fill out an IRS form for any purchases over a year exceeding $600. Congress repealed that in June 2011.

“It was extremely onerous (and) raised very little revenue,” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and chief economic policy adviser to Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Amanda Austin, a public policy director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, compared the IRS 1099 requirement to the employer mandate, which required many small and medium-sized businesses to provide employee health insurance or face paying penalties.

She argued both came with “tons” of “extremely complicated” paperwork and that the changes were in large part the result of business uproar.

“I think you heard a lot from businesses, really an outcry of why are we doing this,” she said about the IRS requirement. “And down the road obviously we got the provision repealed.”

The administration acknowledged as much in the surprise announcement Tuesday that the start of the employee mandate would be delayed from 2014, when much of the law is scheduled to take effect, to 2015.

“We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,” said Mark J. Mazur, a Treasury Department assistant secretary.

Holtz-Eakin and others also point out the administration also had to scrap the so-called CLASS Act section of ObamaCare that offered federally-subsidized insurance for long-term health care because the legislation stated the premiums had to cover the cost.

Holtz-Eakin called the plan “unworkable.”

Two other parts of the law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, also have either been delayed or scuttled.

Earlier this year, the administration delayed until 2015 the start of a managed-care option inserted into ObamaCare by Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who then accused officials of dragging their feet to avoid lower cost competition.

“Our read of the statute is that you're supposed to do it in 2014 and not spend your time luring people into the exchange,” Cantwell said in April on Capitol Hill. “Is there a bias somewhere in the administration against lower-cost, managed-care delivery systems?”

The administration has also delayed the start of an ObamaCare provision known as SHOP – an insurance exchange that gives small business a range of choices.

Now those businesses have only one plan, contrary to Obama’s vow that the law would provide a range of options.

“I think the bottom line is that the law is very convoluted, very complicated and is bad policy,” said Katie Mahoney, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive director of health care policy.

Neil Trauntwein, an employee-benefits lawyer for the National Retail Federation, says the delays have at least allowed business leaders to return to Capitol Hill to discuss such issues as whether the cutoff for the employer mandate should less than 50 full-time employees and if a 30-hour week is the best definition of a full-time worker."

Darrell Issa (R-Vista) purporting to show the shortcomings of Obamacare.

Bingo! We have not one but two “investigative” news reports, from CBS and ABC, based on the same partial transcript. And both, consequently, have the same level of credibility: none. CBS News even offers a dividend -- a thoroughly dishonest and discreditable interview with Issa himself. We’ll get to that in a moment.

The topic of the latest leak is the purported security flaws in healthcare.gov, the federal health enrollment website. The raw meat is a partial transcript of an interview conducted by the staff of Issa’s House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with Teresa Fryer, chief information security officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is handling the healthcare.gov rollout.

Cue Sharyl Attkisson of CBS: “A top HealthCare.gov security officer told Congress there have been two, serious high-risk findings since the website’s launch, including one on Monday of this week.”

Advertisement

Well, yes. But not exactly. Fryer said more, which you’d know if you read the parts of the transcript left out of the Issa leak but distributed by the committee’s Democratic minority. There you discover that Fryer also said that the system’s security measures exceed industry standards, that there haven’t been any security breaches of the website, and the parts of the system affected by the high-risk findings were promptly shut down and quarantined.

That brings us to Issa, who went before the CBS cameras to charge that Fryer’s recommendation that the website launch be delayed was overruled by mysterious “individuals” who, he said, “were looking at a broader array of risk.” His tone of voice put air quotes around that “broader.” He continued, “I took that to mean the risks such as risk to the president of embarrassment, the risk to people who were counting on being able to sign up for these plans.”

See what he did there? He suggested that CMS was pressured by the White House to launch a website with security holes.

But there’s absolutely no basis in Fryer’s transcript -- zero -- to support that. What she said was that it’s standard operating procedure to place security assessments like hers in a broader context. In fact, the process is set forth by NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is the government’s technology assessment agency. And of course that makes sense: You weigh the security aspects of a technical system against numerous other factors, including the importance of the program, and decide from the totality whether to launch.

There’s nothing in Fryer’s words even remotely hinting at an effort to spare the president “embarrassment.” Issa appears to have made that up out of whole cloth.

But he didn’t stop there. He suggested to CBS that the healthcare.gov website exposed virtually the entire government to hacking. “Remember, Sharyl, this is not about your application being compromised. This is a system, exchange and portal, that lets me go into the Department of Homeland Security, lets me go into the IRS ... Social Security. Think about what’s at Social Security, what’s at IRS, what’s at Department of Homeland Security. That’s the vulnerability.”

Is that so? A flaw in a healthcare enrollment website that could let hackers in on our most precious government secrets? Let’s agree that if this were true, it would be huge. But once again, Issa has absolutely no evidence that it’s remotely true. If he had it, he would shout it from the rooftops, and he’d be right to do so. He wouldn’t slink around in the dark to a news show and slip it into the conversation with a credulous reporter.

CBS plainly knows Issa was blowing smoke. If his assertion was at all credible, Attkisson would have made it her lead, instead of going with some threadbare assertion by a middle-level bureaucrat about “findings” that there were flaws in the website and that were dealt with promptly.

Advertisement

Of course, it’s possible that healthcare.gov has such flaws. But most of the concern about the site up to now has involved the possibility that hackers could obtain the information that applicants type in, not that hackers could jump from the website directly into the government’s internal systems. Curiously, Issa specifically disavowed concerns about the first possibility.

In the words of Kevin Drum, who has been collecting Issa’s selective leaks as tenaciously as my kids once collected beanie babies, “When will reporters learn not to trust Issa? Judging by current practice, never.”

But you don’t have to be so gullible."

Jack Kingston: Not 'Responsible' To Let Obamacare Fail,"A Republican congressman running for the U.S. Senate in Georgia broke with many members of his party on Monday and said it was irresponsible to just let Obamacare fail.

Speaking to a local conservative radio station called ""Z Politics,"" Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) discussed his Small Business Fairness In ObamaCare Act, which would exempt small businesses from the requirement that companies with over 50 full-time workers provide health insurance.

Kingston's legislation obviously falls far short of fully repealing Obamacare, which many conservatives insist should be the main goal. But Kingston said such a focus was not the best path.

""And there’s some criticism, 'Well, are you helping improve this law when you make that change? And should we be doing that?'"" Kingston said, referring to pushback against his bill. ""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, let’s just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own.' But I don’t think that’s always the responsible thing to do.""

""I think we need to be looking for things that improve health care overall for all of us,"" he added. ""And if there was something in Obamacare, we need to know about it.""

Listen:

Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford told the Hill, which first picked up Crawford's comments, that the congressman was pushing for a replacement to Obamacare.

""He essentially said that we don't just need to wait for Obamacare to die under its own weight, we need to be looking for solutions that would replace it,"" Crawford said.

Kingston has also repeatedly voted to defund Obamacare.

Kingston is running against seven other Republicans in the primary to replace the retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and the winner is expected to face Michelle Nunn, the leading contender on the Democratic side, in the general election. An October survey by the Democratic Public Policy Polling found Nunn tied with with a generic Republican opponent.

Kingston's position is notable because his primary opponents have staked out positions far more to the right. On Monday, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.), for example, posted an op-ed on the conservative site Breitbart titled, ""Stop Wasting Time Trying To Fix Obamacare.""

""Obamacare is simply not fixable, and Congress must stop wasting time passing bills which keep Obamacare in place,"" wrote Broun.

Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) has promised to ""help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home"" and not run for reelection.

While every Republican seems to want to repeal Obamacare, there is no consensus on what should go in its place. Making sure people have health insurance is expensive and disruptive, and Republicans don't have much appetite for taking up that battle.

""If you think about it, it would be in the interest of conservatives who believe in the magic of markets to make this system work,"" wrote Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""If it can be demonstrated that real competition in a real marketplace offers good services at lower overall costs, that adds powerful ammunition to the case for free markets. Let’s face it: The unrelenting opposition to all parts of the law ... is far more about Barack Obama than it is about the structure and nature of the Affordable Care Act."""

(JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

The Obama administration has postponed one of the fundamental provisions of the health-care reform law, responding to mounting concerns from business owners who would have been required to start providing health coverage to their employees next year.

On Tuesday evening, Treasury Department officials announced the government would not penalize businesses that fail to provide health insurance next year, delaying what is known as the “employer mandate” component of the law until 2015. Starting then, firms with more than 50 employees will be required to provide at least a minimum level coverage to their workers or pay a steep fine to the federal government.

Officials made the decision to push the requirement back after fielding a flood of complaints from business owners about its implementation.

“We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,” Mark Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy, wrote in a blog post announcing the postponement, later adding that the administration plans to use the additional time to “consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements” for business owners.

The newly delayed mandate has been a major point of contention for small business owners and lobbyists since it was approved as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many warned that it would cause administrative nightmares for small employers and discourage those near the cutline from expanding beyond 50 workers.

Meanwhile, some firms have started scaling back their payrolls to get underneath the cap.

“Small companies have told us they are confused by the law and are simply finding it difficult to comply with, no matter when it goes into effect,” Rep. Sam Graves, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, said in an email to The Washington Post. “Instead of providing relief for businesses, this simply kicks the can down the road.”

A White House official said the added time would help small business owners adapt to the changes, arguing that the law will still drive down prices for coverage on Main Street.

“This allows employers the time to . . . make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits while staying the course toward making health coverage more affordable and accessible for their workers,” Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to Obama, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

This latest delay is the most consequential in a series of setbacks for the president’s signature law, which has shown signs of fragility as the initial deadline for full implementation approaches at the end of the year.

In April, the administration announced it would delay for one year a key cost-cutting feature of the law’s new small business health insurance marketplaces. Initially, the exchanges were supposed to allow employers to choose different plans for different workers; now, for the first year, they must select only one plan from a single carrier for their entire business.

More recently, the Government Accountability Office announced that federal and state officials have fallen well behind schedule setting up the marketplaces, which are scheduled to open for enrollment in October.

“This is simply the latest evidence that implementation of this terrible law is going to be difficult if not impossible, and the burden is going to fall on the people who create American jobs,” Amanda Austin, director of federal public policy at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement.

The NFIB, a small business lobbying group, has pushed back against the health care law since it was making its way through Congress, later spearheading an effort to repeal the legislation that ended at the hands of the Supreme Court. The group has since focused on repealing some of the provisions it considers most detrimental to businesses on Main Street, including the employer mandate and a new tax on insurers.

Instead of delayed, Austin argued the mandate should be eliminated altogether.

“Temporary relief is small consolation,” she said. “We need a permanent fix to this provision to provide long term relief for small employers.”

Washington (CNN) - The top Democrat in the House is pushing back against calls to extend open enrollment in the new health care exchanges because of the massive technical problems plaguing HealthCare.gov.

""I don't support that,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday morning, just hours after Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire appeared to be the first Democrat in Congress to join a growing number of her Republican colleagues in suggesting the deadline be pushed back.

The current law stipulates that enrollment in the insurance exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act ends on March 31, 2014. Those who are uninsured after that point face fines by the Internal Revenue Service.

""As website glitches persist, we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans,"" Shaheen wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama. ""I also fear that people that have tried, and failed, to enroll online may become frustrated and not return to the website to try again at a later date... Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.""

When asked by CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh, Pelosi said she disagreed with Shaheen, adding that ""I think we should fix what we have. Move forward with the deadline we have, respectful of what her (Shaheen's) experience may be, of her suggestion, but not supportive of it.""

Pelosi also told reporters on Capitol Hill that she didn't hear any members who took part in a closed door meeting of House Democrats and officials implementing the health care exchanges earlier Wednesday suggest that they wanted to push back the deadline.

But one senior House Democrat who spoke with CNN following the meeting didn't rule it out.

""I'm not prepared to say that now. We're going to have to find out,"" said longtime Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, a healthcare reform patriarch, when asked about pushing back the enrollment deadline or removing the fine.

Shaheen faces re-election next year in a purple state but early polling indicates she's far ahead of her possible GOP challengers. Regardless of her push to extend the deadline, Shaheen does not appear to be a turncoat in the war over Obamacare. The Senator's letter to the President offers high praise of - and some patient frustration with - the law.

Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas also supports pushing back the deadline.

""The senator has seen the letter and supports the effort to extend the enrollment deadline,"" Michael Teague, Pryor's communications director, told CNN Wednesday afternoon.

Pryor, like Shaheen, is also up for re-election next year. He faces a tough bid for another term in office in a red state and is being challenged by GOP Rep. Tom Cotton.

The answer appeared to be “no” during Monday’s oral arguments. The justices signaled that they probably will bar any grants of exclusive and profitable patents on human genes that prevent other scientists from testing these pieces of DNA.

But the justices were aware the issue itself was anything but simple, and they sounded wary of going too far and taking away the financial incentives for companies and their scientists to explore new uses for DNA.

“The patent law is filled with uneasy compromises,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. “We do want people to invent. On the other hand, we’re very worried about them tying up … a thing that could be used for further advance.”

Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are carefully monitoring the case because a ruling rejecting the patentability of human genes could curb investment in gene-related research and new drugs.

The case before the court arose when cancer patients and medical researchers sued in 2009 to challenge the patents issued to Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City. Its researchers discovered DNA sequences in two genes that signal a high risk for the development of breast or ovarian cancer.

The company filed for a patent for one gene, called BRCA1 for BReast CAncer1, in 1994, and for another, called BRCA2 for BReast CAncer2, in 1995. Their flagship product, BRACAnalysis, tests for key mutations in both genes.

About 1 million patients have been tested so far. Myriad charges more than $3,000 for each test.

Breyer and other justices insisted that “products of nature” could not be patented, whether it is a plant leaf that has medicinal potential or human DNA. “It’s important to keep products of nature free of restrictions,” he said.

It also is not enough to find a new substance, other justices said. What about “the first person who found a liver?” Justice Elena Kagan asked. Surely, that person could not have been given a patent on livers, with the exclusive right to test or treat them, she said.

At the same time, the justices said inventors should be able to patent a new use for a natural substance.

Though a ruling against Myriad could have a chilling effect on investment in certain biotech and pharmaceutical companies, some industry experts said the immediate fallout may be muted because many of the current patents on genes, first sought in the 1990s, already have lapsed or are expiring soon.

“This is an important juncture for the biotech industry, and this decision will set the tone from a patent standpoint,” said Karen Dow, a La Jolla patent lawyer who represents biotech companies and investors.

“We already have a problem with early-stage investors not wanting to invest in biotech and pharma companies because it takes so long to get a return on their investment. This ruling could have an even more chilling impact on that investment,” Dow said.

The bigger worry, some experts said, would be a broadly written court ruling that casts doubt on patents for other naturally occurring proteins, antibodies and other building blocks used by biotech companies to develop new therapies and tests.

“If the court decides that products of nature aren’t patentable more broadly, how far does it go? It’s possible they are willing to cover more than just genes,” said Lisa Haile, a San Diego patent lawyer for the industry.

Advertisement

Myriad said that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted more than 40,000 patents that were drawn from genetic material and that its patents were “the product of creative, human ingenuity.”

The company said its scientists “applied their inventive faculties to a previously undistinguished mass of genetic matter and created a new chemical entity.”

A lawyer for the breast cancer patients disagreed.

“What exactly did Myriad invent? The answer is nothing,” Christopher Hansen of the American Civil Liberties Union told the justices.

Advertisement

He conceded Myriad deserves credit for having “unlocked the secrets of two human genes,” but it does not deserve an exclusive patent for discovering a natural substance.

But Gregory Castanias, a lawyer for Myriad, said the Utah scientists had indeed invented something new. He cited the example of baseball bat. “A baseball bat doesn’t exist until it’s isolated from a tree. But that’s still a product of human invention,” he said, because the wood has been shaped and cut.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. objected. “A baseball bat is quite different” because it is shaped from a tree.

“Here, what’s involved is snipping,” he said, referring to the gene sequences. “You snip off the top and you snip off the bottom, and there you’ve got it.”

Like Roberts, most of the justices sounded skeptical of Myriad’s argument that “isolated DNA” can be patented. In recent years, the justices have faulted the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for being too willing to grant patents. “The PTO seems very patent happy,” Kagan said Monday.

Scientists who are skeptical of the idea of patenting genes said they were hopeful after the arguments that the justices would overturn the Utah company’s claims.

“I was on pins and needles the whole time,” said Dr. Wayne Grody, director of the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory at the UCLA Medical Center, who was present at the arguments. “But at the end I thought, ‘The justices really get it.’ ... I felt that all of them who spoke weren’t comfortable with the idea of patenting a gene.

“The justices really focused on a gene as a product of nature. They kept making the analogy of finding a medicinal plant in the Amazon. You can’t just pick the plant up and patent it.”

The ACLU and the Public Patent Foundation had argued that giving one company a monopoly over a distinctive gene sequence resulted in patients paying too much for testing, and it prevented them from getting a second opinion from other medical experts.

They had lost in the federal circuit court that oversees patent appeals. The court upheld Myriad’s patents in 2011 and again last year, despite the high court’s warning on the issue in a previous case. The patent judges held that isolating the particular gene that signals a risk of cancer was a “new and useful” invention that can be patented.

Even though Myriad’s patents are due to expire within two years, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the ACLU’s contention that genes cannot be patented.

A decision in the case of Assn. for Molecular Pathology vs. Myriad Genetics can be expected by the end of June.

An august committee had for the first time relied only on the most rigorous scientific evidence to formulate guidelines to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which kill one out of every three Americans. The group had worked for five years, unpaid, to develop them. Then, at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, it all went horribly awry.

Many leading cardiologists now say the credibility of the guidelines, released Nov. 14, is shattered. And the troubled effort to devise them has raised broader questions about what kind of evidence should be used to direct medical practice, how changes should be introduced and even which guidelines to believe.

“This was a catastrophic misunderstanding of how you go about this sort of huge change in public policy,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who is a past president of the American College of Cardiology. “There will be a large backlash.”

What went wrong? Some critics say the drafting committee mistakenly relied only on randomized controlled clinical trials, the gold standard of medical evidence, but ignored other strong data that would have led to different conclusions. The group’s efforts were severely underfunded. And it announced fundamental changes in medical practices without allowing a public debate before its guidelines were completed."
http://news.yahoo.com/sebelius-obamacare-website-153801787.html,,[],Sebelius: Obama didn't know about tech issues,"The woman at the center of the firestorm surrounding the tech-plagued launch of the Obamacare website says President Barack Obama was not informed of potential red flags until it went live.

In an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta on Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the president was told of problems with the site in the ""first couple of days"" after the Oct. 1 launch of HealthCare.gov, but not before.



""Nobody says the site is working the way we want it to,"" Sebelius said. ""No one could be more frustrated than I am, and the president, that this isn't smooth.""



Sebelius, though, defended going ahead with the launch of the Affordable Care Act portal despite concerns from health insurance companies that it wouldn't work and a failed test run in late September involving just a few hundred users.



""There are people in this country who have waited decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families,"" she said. ""What's clear is we have a product. The product really works. We have created a market where there wasn't a market.""



She added, ""I was optimistic that things would go smoothly. I felt that the day had finally come I've done this work now for three and a half years, implementing this historic law.""



The secretary blamed some on the site's problems on ""extremely high"" volume.



""We've had nearly 20 million people visit the website in the first three weeks,"" Sebelius said. ""And that shows, I think, the pent-up interest that people have in affordable, available health coverage.""



About 500,000 people have created accounts on the site, she said, though she declined to disclose how many of those enrolled in health care plans.



""What we can tell you is that thousands of people have signed up,"" Sebelius said. ""We know that people are getting through every day. It is not where we need it to be. It isn't as smooth as we want it to be for the volume of people who want this product.""



On Monday, Obama said “experts” are mounting a “tech surge” to fix the Obamacare website.



“We’ve got people working overtime, 24/7, to boost capacity and address the problems,” he said in a speech in the Rose Garden. “Experts from some of America's top private-sector tech companies — who've, by the way, have seen things like this happen before — they want it to work.



“They're reaching out. They're offering to send help. We've had some of the best IT talent in the entire country join the team,” the president said. “And we're well into a tech surge to fix the problem. And we are confident that we will get all the problems fixed.



“There's no sugarcoating it,"" Obama added. ""The website has been too slow; people have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am.”"

He starts off with a lament that I think we don't express enough: That talking about the life-saving benefits for the uninsured seems to be an insignificant issue for too many Americans.



Normally, I would start this discussion by providing chapter-and-verse details about the 47 million men, women, and children who now have the opportunity to obtain health insurance, to live longer and healthier lives, to avoid needless bankruptcies. But, in what to me is one of the saddest developments in our nation’s history, that reality is irrelevant to ardent Obamacare opponents....These days, I have to start by answering the question “What’s in it for me?”

This is the fundamental issue that too many people do not understand. There seems to be this belief among some that those who are uninsured simply go off and die somewhere, thus having no impact on the medical-care-delivery system in the United States. But the opposite is true—the uninsured have some of the most dramatic effects of any group on our nation’s health-care system...In fact, the uninsured affect the finances, quality of care, and availability of medical assistance to every person in a community, regardless of their insurance status.

And answer he does. He begins with the clearest of points that too often is ignored: the uninsured get health care, whether they have insurance or not.Then, he presents the most amazing numbers I've seen in this debate: The PRECISE amount the uninsured are costing those with insurance. He begins with the national average (he gives for two years, I'll use the 2010 estimates.) That amount: $1,502. That is not the premium - that is the EXTRA premium that the insured are paying to compensate for the bills the uninsured are unable to pay.

Even more fun, the piece then shows that the highest amount in extra premium is being paid by, you guessed it, the states that are the biggest opponents of Obamacare:



It is the citizens of states most opposed to Obamacare and who are refusing expansions of Medicaid who are taking the biggest shellacking: Texas residents are paying $2,786 more in premiums for family policies provided through employers. Montana, $2,190. Alaska, $2,248. Idaho, $2,152. North Carolina, $1,828.

I've already started reciting those numbers to some friends who have bought into the Republican lies. Their only response is ""splutter.""

Then Eichenwald points out something I never knew. Those communities with the highest numbers of uninsured have the lowest quality of care, not just for the uninsured, but for the insured as well.



Follow the logic. Hospitals don’t have poverty wards; if a patient comes in the door in bad shape, they don’t do a wallet biopsy before deciding what care that person should receive—everyone at a hospital receives the same quality. But if a community has a higher number of uninsured, that means the latest and greatest technology and treatments will drive up the amounts of unreimbursed care. In essence, hospitals that provide the best, most modern, and most expensive treatments in an area with lots of uninsured will be forced to pass unsustainable amounts of cost to their prices. Insurance companies won’t pay it, local governments won’t finance it, and the hospitals will go out of business. The only option then? Don’t provide the top-quality care to anyone—insured or not.

Eichenwald then immediately acknowledges that people might not believe the logic, and so cites multiple studies proving he's right.

It is only after this lengthy description of medical economics that Eichenwald returns to the benefits to the uninsured.



With the “what’s in it for me” question regarding the benefits of covering the uninsured, now let’s go to the price they pay for being without health insurance. This one is as simple as screaming “death panels”: the uninsured die. As the Texas health-care task force reports: ""Overall, the uninsured receive less preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease, and once diagnosed, receive less therapeutic care than do the insured. Thus, lack of adequate insurance leads to premature death."" Hopefully, those words are easy enough for everyone to understand. If Republicans truly are dedicated to the sanctity of life, they should be the first ones on the front lines trying to get policies for the uninsured.

This is as much as I can quote and still stay within fair use. But it is a long, long article loaded with powerful facts, figures and arguments. Before you have another arguments with the deluded, just print it out and hand it to them. It was exhilarating to read!"

(CNN) —

The Obamacare website is open for business. But the Charlton Memorial Hospital in Folkston, Georgia, is closed.

Because Republicans in half the states have blocked the expansion of Medicaid, funds to public hospitals with large uninsured populations have been slashed. So far, at least five public hospitals have been closed this year and 5,000 hospital employees have been laid off nationwide. The closures are expected to worsen in the coming years.

In Georgia, as many as 15 more rural hospitals may close “within months” and in Tennessee, which is putting off a decision on expanding Medicaid, almost half of the 61 rural hospitals in the state might face “major cuts or closure.” This is a direct — and disastrous — consequence of Republicans’ ideological opposition to Obamacare.

Sally Kohn

When the Affordable Care Act was originally passed, subsidies to hospitals with large uninsured “charity care” populations were cut, figuring that the expansion of Medicaid under the law would replace this funding. But then the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to expand Medicaid or not. Half the states have said they will not extend Medicaid or are putting off deciding. These are states mostly controlled by Republican governors, state legislatures, or both.

There was really no downside to extending Medicaid to cover individuals who earn up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government is covering 100% of the cost of Medicaid for the next two years and 90% afterward. Columnist Josh Barro has pointed out the bind: “(W)hen Republican state officials decline to participate, they will have to explain to both medical providers and potential Medicaid beneficiaries that they turned down free federal money just to spite the President.” And yet the 25 states that have indeed refused Medicaid expansion will soon find they’re not just spiting the President but also their own citizens.

The people who rely on these “essential hospitals” aren’t just low-income folks. Middle-class Americans who live in rural communities will have to travel 40 or 50 miles just to reach the nearest emergency room if these hospitals close their doors.

According to Bloomberg News, Pam Renshaw crashed her four-wheeler in Folkston, Georgia, and suffered painful second- and third-degree burns on nearly half her body. But her local hospital had shut down. It took two hours for her to get to an ambulance center 20 miles away and then on to a hospital in Florida where she could get treatment.

As more of these horror stories emerge and as more hospitals close, even the most diehard Republican voters in these rural communities won’t care about ideological grandstanding. They’ll just want their hospitals open.

On the heels of news of rural hospitals shuttering come reports that health care costs overall are falling and that the cost of Obamacare is expected to be billions of dollars less than expected. Of course, some of the decline in health care cost is certainly the result of a still-sluggish economy. Yet does anyone doubt that if health care costs had risen in the same period to even a fraction of a degree, Republicans would be screaming from the rooftops, blaming Obamacare?

We might not be able to expect fervent anti-Obamacare ideologues to act rationally in the face of facts — but what we can expect is that their constituents will be even more vexed to see that as health care costs nationwide are falling, the hospitals on which they depend are closing.

Desperate to try to blame everything and the weather on the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have tried to pin the cuts in subsidies to hospitals on the dynamics of the law alone.

A spokesperson for Georgia’s Republican Gov. Nathan Deal blamed the Affordable Care Act for cutting subsidies to the hospitals that treat the uninsured while refusing to acknowledge the governor’s power to expand Medicaid at the state level and solve the entire crisis.

You heard that right: Republicans like Deal, constantly railing against the federal government and clamoring for “state’s rights,” are suddenly abdicating state responsibility and blaming the feds for not fixing the problem.

It’s the same hypocritical dynamic at work in more than 30 states that have turned their roles in setting up health insurance exchanges over to the federal government. It seems Republicans want state authority when it comes to pushing their conservative agenda but not when it comes to providing basic health care and access to insurance for their residents.

Not that Republicans at the federal level are any more responsible. Congress refused to pass a law that would have delayed the subsidy cuts for rural hospitals until more states decide whether they’re extending Medicaid.

These acts of ideological intransigence by Republicans at the federal and state levels will not hurt Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, its components are broadly popular with the majority of American people and it will only become more so as it is fully implemented and most people see the quality of their care go up as their costs go down.

No, Republicans are only hurting their constituents — folks in redder parts of red states who rely on rural hospitals for emergency room treatment, oncology visits, maternity wards and other basic care. Purely for ideological reasons, Republicans are creating a health care crisis — in their own states.

A successful society works to help make sure that the people are well cared for, avoid illness, and have access to good medicine and good advice. But that's not always the case, at least not to Republicans.

States like Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana have all made moves to cut prenatal care, and at the same time, they move to cut funding to planned parenthood, of course. In their mind, it means fewer abortions. In reality, it means far more unwanted pregnancies, and a raise in rates of infant mortality.

http://www.guttmacher.org/...

One in 10 women said that they had switched to a less expensive provider of contraceptive services. This increased demand for lower-cost services was mirrored in the survey responses from family planning providers. Two-thirds of the family planning centers surveyed noted an increase in the number of clients seeking services between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 (see chart, page 10). Importantly, the vast majority of providers surveyed said they had seen an increase in the number of clients who are poor or low income and, therefore, eligible for free or reduced-fee care from providers receiving any subsidy from the federal Title X program. More than half the providers reported significant service delivery challenges in meeting clients' needs. Most often, they reported staff layoffs or a hiring freeze during 2009. Many also said that they had been forced to reduce the number of contraceptive methods they are able to offer; more expensive methods such as the IUD, the implant, the patch and some brand-name oral contraceptives were the most likely to be cut. One in four providers said that waiting times had increased, typically doubling from less than a week to about two weeks.

As women have less and less access to effective birthcontrol, the rate of potential unwanted pregnancy goes up.

The republicans counter this claim with: ""Then don't have sex"". My response: OK, let us see how long you men who pass these laws can go without sex. We'll have a Jerry Seinfield like competition and check it out.

The sad fact is, this move to cut access to early care and family planning doesn't cut abortion as much as it increases infant mortality - and which is more negative to you?



In general, Owens said, many pregnant women don't realize the importance of getting their own medical problems treated. ""We know that the way we get the best pregnancy is to have a healthy mom before mom and baby are together,"" she said.



Birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. Not all are preventable, but a mother can reduce risk by keeping her own health under control by eliminating smoking, drinking and illegal drugs. The same is true for premature births, another leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. The March of Dimes recently released its Premature Birth Report Card and gave failing grades to Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Mississippi has the largest premature birth rate based on the 2011 national statistics used in the report.

With conservative states leading the way in rates of birth defects and premature births. Not all birth defects can be prevented, but many, say the March of Dimes as well as the CDC, can be prevented through good prenatal care, proper nutrition, access to routine checkups.. which includes health of the mother, blood pressure control, etc. These are common things for those with insurance and care, but not for the poor.

So, let's be blunt.. the decrease in prenatal care means a rise in infant mortality and an increase in children born with preventable birth defects because of lack of care.

The March of Dimes speaks to exactly how effective good pre-natal care is.

http://www.pcrm.org/...

The medical costs of care for children with disabilities resulting from birth defects have been estimated to exceed $1.4 billion annually. While some types of birth defects have decreased, mainly through preventive methods, many have increased. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 38 types of birth defects occurring over the period 1979-89, 27 had increased, including several cardiac defects, chromosomal defects such as trisomy 18, and fetal alcohol syndrome; nine had remained the same; and only two had decreased.

That's OK, though, because Republicans will want to fund support for all the children of disabilities born because of bad prenatal care, and they will provide support for women who lose their child in the first year, right?

Don't worry, Republican governors have got that.



2. A program to help adults with disabilities live independently faces an enrollment freeze in the new budget, which will leave nearly 17,000 men and women throughout the state without vital resources over the next two years. Family Care helps provide a wide range of services such as in-home care, supported living communities, meal delivery, and job training to help keep more than 31,000 people integrated with their communities; waiting lists for private resources like housing can be well over a decade. Cutting off enrollment in Family Care is a message from Scott Walker to men and women already disproportionately affected by poverty and discrimination that in his eyes they’re less than human.

So, with more unwanted pregnancies, a higher infant mortality, and an increase in preventable birth defects, I want to know: when did Republicans become the party that likes any of these things? Because rooting for increases in infant mortality and birth defects is so abhorrent to me, I cannot fathom the logic.

Sorry Republicans. I prefer babies who breath and live healthy, long lives. That's why I favor prenatal care support. Please, advocate for me that you want more children to die after birth, as long as they aren't aborted. Because it would be an honest assessment of how this will turn out.

The President has hit record disapproval rating (56% among RVs, 55% among adults) and his Affordable Care Act is tanking in the public’s opinion.

Not only does the public disapprove of Obama’s job performance, more than half do not like him. Fifty-two percent say they have an unfavorable image of the President. To drive that home, the three metrics used to measure Obama’s “leadership and empathy” are all in the red.

Half or more now say he is not a strong leader, does not understand the problems of “people like you,” and is not honest and trustworthy. Perceptions of the president as a strong leader have dropped 15 points since January, and over the past year the percentage of registered voters who say he is not honest and trustworthy has increased 12 points.

These ratings carry over to opinions on Obamacare. Fifty-six percent say Obama is not a good manager and this is evident when looking at opinions about his health care program specifically. Almost two-thirds (63%) disapprove of of the program’s roll out and 57% straight up oppose the Affordable Healthcare Act, a 10% jump up from last month. The lynchpin of Obama’s program, the mandate to purchase insurance also performs quite poorly with two thirds (65%) opposing it.

Polls are considered a snapshot in time, so there is no telling if America’s sour outlook on Obama and Obamacare will stick. Obama has promised to “re-brand” his health care program and it remains to be seen if the country will give him a second chance. Certainly the unintended consequences or rather, the particulars of the law which were concealed from the public, are not popular and indicate that if the public had “read the law before they passed it” it might not have ever been approved."

(CNN) - Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, called on the president Saturday to delay the individual mandate in the health care law that requires Americans to obtain insurance or face a penalty.

The GOP-controlled House passed a bill this summer urging the administration to do so, but the bill has no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.



The administration already announced it would delay a provision requiring businesses with more than 50 employees to provide insurance.

""It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate,"" the congresswoman said in the GOP weekly address. ""Let’s delay this health care law not just for some, but for all Americans.""

Read a full transcript of her remarks below.



It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate.

Hi I'm Shelley Moore Capito, and I represent West Virginia’s Second Congressional District.

Last month, members of both parties came together in the House to pass legislation delaying the individual mandate in the president’s health care law.

Because you and your family deserve the same relief the president gave to big businesses by delaying the employer mandate – it’s only fair.

Actually, it’s more than fair when you look at how this law is already raising costs, hurting jobs, and reducing access to the plans and the doctors you like.

Recent developments have proven the wisdom – and the urgency – of this bipartisan vote.

More companies have said that because of this law, they’ll have to shift full-time workers to part-time and lay off others altogether.

More states have detailed the rate shock consumers will soon experience.

And just days ago, it came to light that the president gave big businesses another pass – this time at the behest of insurance companies that say they need more time to comply. Meanwhile, yes, you and your family are expected to adhere to all the prescribed mandates, as scheduled.

Where’s the fairness in that?

The president claims this law is “working the way it’s supposed to,” but clearly it’s not. Not when the administration is missing deadlines, issuing waivers, and granting delays hand over fist. Things have become so bad that the administration wants to rely on the ‘honor system’ to verify who is eligible for subsidies. Senator Max Baucus was right about this law he helped write: it’s a ‘train wreck.’

The need for the bipartisan, House-passed delay of the individual mandate couldn’t be plainer. Yet, even though the president has already signed seven bills that repeal or defund parts of this law, he has threatened to veto this one.

Mr. President, in light of this latest unfair delay, we ask you to reconsider. It’s time for your Senate to pass – and for you to sign – the House’s bipartisan delay of the individual mandate. Let’s delay this health care law not just for some, but for all Americans. That would only be fair. That would be government working the way it’s supposed to.

For now, Republicans will continue to work to protect all Americans from the president’s health care law so we can focus on patient-centered reforms that actually lower costs and help jobs.

Thank you for listening, and enjoy your weekend."

http://news.yahoo.com/health-care-divides-republican-senate-rivals-152131025--election.html,,[],Health care divides some Republican Senate rivals,"ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans see the 2014 midterm elections as a chance to capitalize on voter frustration with the problem-plagued health care overhaul, but the GOP first must settle a slate of Senate primaries where conservatives are arguing over the best way to oppose President Barack Obama's signature law.

In intraparty skirmishes from Georgia to Nebraska, the GOP's most strident candidates and activists are insisting on a no-holds-barred approach. They accuse fellow Republicans — including several incumbent senators — of being too soft in their opposition to the Affordable Care Act and to the president in general.

The outcomes will help determine just how conservative the Senate Republican caucus will be during Obama's final two years. And they could influence which party controls the chamber, with Democrats hoping that the most uncompromising Republican standard-bearers will emerge from the primaries and fare as poorly in general elections as their counterparts did in several 2012 Senate races. Republicans need to gain six seats for a majority.

Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, who wants to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, stepped into the rift recently when he seemed to scold much of his party during an interview on a conservative talk radio show.

""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own,"" Kingston said. ""Well, I don't think that's always the responsible thing to do.""

Rep. Paul Broun, one of Kingston's rivals in a crowded primary field, pounced immediately, declaring in an Internet ad, ""I don't want to fix Obamacare, I want to get rid of it."" Conservative commentators hammered Kingston with headlines like ""Kingston has surrendered on Obamacare.""

In Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr blasted Sen. Lamar Alexander for serving as a key GOP negotiator in the deal to end the partial government shutdown that resulted from House Republicans' efforts to deny funding for the health care law. Alexander subsequently described himself as a ""conservative problem solver,"" a characterization that Carr says ""typifies how out of touch he is.""

Story continues

Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin is using a similar line of attack in trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as is Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel in his primary challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran. Carr, Bevin and McDaniel all say they'd be more like freshmen Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, tea party favorites who pushed the defunding strategy and vexed their longer-serving colleagues.

In Nebraska and Louisiana, Republican candidates who say they oppose the health care law have had to defend their past positions on health care.

National Republicans settled on Rep. Bill Cassidy as their best shot to beat Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. But retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness notes that Cassidy, as a state senator and a physician in the state's public hospital system, pushed health care policies similar to those in the Affordable Care Act.

""He has to defend his entire record, regardless of how he's voted in Washington,"" said Maness, a GOP candidate who hopes to unseat Landrieu with tea party support.

Midland University President Ben Sasse, one of several Republicans running in Nebraska for retiring Sen. Mike Johanns' seat, says he opposes the health care law but has had to explain previous speeches and writings in which he was less absolute, at one point calling the act ""an important first step"" in overhauling American health care.

""This goes right to the bigger fight between the ideologues and the pragmatists,"" said Republican strategist Todd Rehm of Georgia, who isn't affiliated with any of the eight GOP candidates for Chambliss' seat. Candidates who want to capture the divided Republican electorate, he said, ""see that you can't compromise on any of it. ... The moment you start to sound like you're open to any compromise, you've sold out the ideologues.""

Indeed, Alexander, McConnell, Kingston and Cassidy all voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and for symbolic repeal proposals since then. Some in the GOP leadership say the intraparty struggle is only about tactics, not the bottom line. Carr insists that's exactly the point.

""Their presumption is that tactics don't matter because the outcome would be the same,"" he said. ""But it wouldn't. There wasn't a single Republican vote that passed the Affordable Care Act, whether we're talking establishment, tea party, moderate, conservative, whatever. ... So if it's so bad — and it is — the question is why did establishment Republicans not fight to defund it?""

Leaders of national conservative groups, which have been key players in recent Senate elections, say the distinction is an important consideration as they decide endorsements.

""I would say that any candidate who is a vocal opponent of that (defunding) strategy would certainly cause us hesitation,"" said Easton Randall of FreedomWorks political action committee. ""The burden is on them to explain what they would do differently to achieve a goal we all claim to share.""

So far, FreedomWorks has endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in Mississippi and Nebraska state Treasurer Shane Osborn over Sasse. The group is watching several other races.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, split with FreedomWorks in Nebraska, siding with Sasse. But the fund endorsed Maness in Louisiana, Bevin in Kentucky and McDaniel in Mississippi, among others. DeMint now runs the Heritage Foundation, whose political arm also is monitoring several other races.

Those groups' recent record is mixed. Democrats are hoping for a repeat of 2010 and 2012 races where the far right groups backed less-viable candidates who lost general elections in Colorado, Nevada, Delaware and Indiana. But the same groups also helped elect Lee, Cruz and Marco Rubio in the presidential swing state of Florida.

At FreedomWorks, PAC treasurer and policy chief Dean Clancy dismissed any notion that his efforts would hurt the party.

""Republicans make a mistake when they try to waffle on these issues or sound like Democrat-lite,"" he said.

Republicans said it was unfair for Mr. Obama to delay enforcement of the employer mandate without granting similar relief to individuals, who may face tax penalties if they go without health insurance next year.

Both requirements were scheduled to take effect in January. But the White House announced this month that it would delay the employer mandate to 2015 because of business concerns about the complexity of the requirements.

On the bill to delay the individual mandate, the vote was 251 to 174. On the bill to delay the employer mandate, the vote was 264 to 161."

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)

Adam Peterson’s life is about to change. For the first time in years, he is planning to do things he could not have imagined. He intends to have surgery to remove his gallbladder, an operation he needs to avoid another trip to the emergency room. And he’s looking forward to running a marathon in mid-January along the California coast without constant anxiety about what might happen if he gets injured.

These plans are possible, says Peterson, who turned 50 this year and co-manages a financial services firm in Champaign, Ill., because of a piece of plastic the size of a credit card that arrived in the mail the other day: a health insurance card.

Peterson is among the millions of uninsured Americans who are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law that launched far-reaching changes to the U.S. health-care system and is President Obama’s premier domestic achievement.

These beneficiaries have not been oblivious to the problems of the new insurance exchanges, including a rollout so botched that Obama called it his biggest mistake of the year. Many, including Peterson, had firsthand encounters with the error-prone federal Web site, HealthCare.gov, that tested their patience and resolve. Some called help lines that couldn’t help them. Others drove long distances to meet with trained enrollment workers who couldn’t get them enrolled. Yet they persisted.

And as New Year’s Day approaches, and with it, health insurance, their frustration is trumped by gratitude. “I get these messages from acquaintances on Facebook saying, ‘Let me keep my doctor,’ ’’ Peterson said. “Well, what about those of us who didn’t have health insurance before? . . . I have been walking a tightrope and have had some twists and falls off of it. To not have to worry about this anymore is a tremendous relief.”

Getting Americans health insurance is at the heart of the health law, the most significant change in health-care policy since the 1965 creation of Medicare, the federal program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor and disabled. Such a dramatic expansion in coverage had eluded presidents, including Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat Bill Clinton, for decades.

This core mission has sometimes been obscured by the political and legal disputes that have dogged and, in important ways, altered the law. Strong research links having health insurance and being healthy. Having a health plan does not guarantee that a good doctor is within reach when a patient needs one. But insurance matters.

Dan Munstock knows this. A 62-year-old retiree in Greenville, Tenn., he hasn’t had insurance since he left his job as a crisis counselor in Miami six years ago. He lives on Social Security income of less than $15,000 a year. Although he does not know of any major ailments, he would like a checkup because, he said, “you can seem fine until the day you drop over with something.”

Like thousands of other Americans, Munstock ran into technical problems with the federal Web site before managing to pick a health plan Dec. 1. He qualified for a federal subsidy to help him afford the insurance, so he has to pay just $87.57 a month toward his premium. After his welcome packet from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee arrived in the mail, Munstock was so eager to finish the process of enrolling and getting an insurance card that he picked up the phone to pay the first premium instead of using the mail.

“It felt really good,” he said. Paying toward his own insurance, he said, gives him “a certain dignity,” a feeling that he is not “one of the takers.” The next day, he called the doctor’s office. His appointment for a physical is Jan. 2.

“I’m feeling surprisingly moved by all of this,” Munstock said. “This finally seems real. And I’m thinking that maybe all the talk and the promises and the messy politics can actually lead to something good after all.”

‘Desperate’ for insurance

Various studies have found that children without insurance are less likely to get immunized or treated for a sore throat or even a ruptured appendix. Adults without coverage are less likely to get mammograms or prostate exams. If they have high blood pressure or diabetes, it is more likely to be out of control. If they have a stroke, it is more likely to leave lasting damage. The Institute of Medicine has said there’s “a chasm” between the health needs of uninsured people and their access to effective care — a gap that “results in needless illness, suffering and even death.”

In health-care economics, it is considered rational to provide coverage, so that people can readily get small medical problems taken care of before they become big, expensive, pent-up medical problems. But the gallbladder surgery Peterson is about to have and the unforeseen ailments that Munstock’s physical on Thursday could unearth also illustrate a risk for the health plans that have been signing up new patients under the law: Unless those plans also attract new customers who are young, healthy and inexpensive to insure, the rush of people like Peterson and Munstock is going to freight the new system with costs that are too heavy. Insurance rates could go up. Plans could drop out. Will it happen? No one knows.

That is the macro view. The micro view, for people who have been waiting for insurance for years, is financial protection. Hospitals frequently charge uninsured people two to four times what health insurers and government programs pay for hospital services, according to a 2007 Health Affairs study.

In the years since Medicare and Medicaid were created, there have been smaller expansions in government health-care coverage — public insurance for children of the working class, the addition of drug benefits to Medicare.

Still, nearly 48 million Americans were uninsured as of 2012, according to the most recent official figures — 11 million more than at the turn of the century, or almost one in every six people. More than 6.5 million children are uninsured.

The law wasn’t designed to help everyone who is uninsured. But it is likely to cover a big chunk — 32 million people, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office about the time Obama signed the 2,000-page legislation into law.

How many people will take up the offer remains to be seen. The CBO has estimated that 7 million will sign up for private plans by the end of the first annual open enrollment period on March 31, while another 9 million will enroll in an expanded Medicaid program or in the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

But with insurers canceling health plans that fail to meet new benefit standards for millions of individuals, and many Americans finding it difficult this past fall to use HealthCare.gov, it will be hard to know if the ranks of the uninsured will go up or down right away, health experts say. Starting next year, the law requires that most Americans have health insurance or risk a fine.

The creators of the law envisioned that about half the people who gain insurance would enroll in private health plans, the other half in Medicaid. The Supreme Court sliced into the second goal, ruling that states could opt out of the expansion, something that has occurred in many states led by Republicans.

Maryland expanded Medicaid, which means that 55-year-old Nancy Beigel of Beltsville will be getting insurance for the first time in about a decade. With an income of $11,000 a year from her small cleaning service, she hasn’t been able to afford insurance but didn’t qualify until now for Medicaid.

An emergency appendectomy in 2009 ended up requiring two operations — the first one failed to properly remove the appendix. Beigel was left not only with $91,000 in medical debt but also a lump in her abdomen that she believes is a hernia. She hasn’t been to a doctor to get a diagnosis and, in the meantime, she avoids “really heavy lifting” because she’s worried that doing so could cause a potentially fatal complication.

Medicaid, she said, “is not exactly glamorous.” But she is glad to have coverage beginning in January. “I’m so desperate to have insurance,” she said. “For me, it’s fabulous.”

Amy Torregrossa is 27, lives in San Francisco and creates Web tools for political candidates. She has been without insurance only since July, when coverage through her boyfriend’s company ended because he changed jobs. In the months since then, Torregrossa has found that “it’s really scary to not be covered.” She has a congenital heart defect and a history of high blood pressure. She no longer runs, she said, because “if I twist my ankle or get hit by a car . . . any doctor visit is so expensive.”

When California’s insurance exchange opened Oct. 1, she was among the first to sign up, picking a $310 silver plan. She made sure her cardiologist was in the insurer’s network and plans to schedule a checkup for early next year.

As Torregrossa has been worrying about her heart, Emily Wright has been worrying about the mole on her back. The suspicious mole is on a mental list of “little things” that Wright, 28, of Johnson City, Tenn., said she wants to get checked out. Recurring joint pain in a foot and knee are also on the list. So are her frequently swollen glands.

Wright also needs surgery for endometriosis, a painful gynecological condition that has already required her to have two operations. Constant pain makes it difficult for her to work delivering pizzas and attend East Tennessee State University, where she hopes to get a history degree in May.

Enrolling through the federal exchange, she qualified for a federal subsidy and picked a top-tier plan that will cost her $125 a month. The soonest appointment she could get with an obstetrics-gynecology practice, the first step before surgery, is Jan. 17.

“I am excited. I am ready,” she said. “It feels like the light at the end of the long dark tunnel.”

‘A normal life’

For Adam Peterson, awaiting gallbladder surgery in Illinois, the dark tunnel without insurance began about six years ago, when he decided to forgo health coverage because he needed the cash to set up his financial services business. The cost of that decision hit home in March, when the emergency surgery to remove a gallstone cost him $27,000.

When he went to HealthCare.gov this fall, the online system at first balked at verifying his identity — an essential step. It took a few calls to a help line before anyone called back. But just before Thanksgiving, he managed to enroll in a top-tier plan with a monthly premium of $475.

“I do not feel that it gives me the freedom to do reckless things,” Peterson said, contemplating his insurance coverage, which begins on New Year’s Day. “More, it just allows me to live a normal life with one less worry.”"

(CNN) —

As a rehabilitation physician, I’ve supported many of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act since before Barack Obama’s presidency began. During the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009, I wrote an essay called “Standing up for Obama’s health plan,” and I have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us, most especially disabled Americans, stand to share under the ACA.

But when the Obama administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the ACA, they lost my faith in their political wisdom.

There was a practical necessity to many of the president’s other compromises in order to get the ACA passed. Regrettably, it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state-based social services. It allows states to eviscerate Medicaid in ways that don’t make sense.

In some states, Medicaid pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital, but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person’s ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social-service safety net.

Coutesy of Ford Vox Ford Vox

The vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers, although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000, and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. Low-quality insurance, like so-called “mini medical” plans, is common. Employees won’t know their coverage is insufficient until it’s too late. If you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma, the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply won’t be enough. I’ve seen this gut-wrenching situation time and again.

True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace, where health care is centered. But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA’s requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2,000 to $3,000, the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. It is delaying a critical national debate on what the ACA minimums should be.

How did this happen? The administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists, who, according to Politico, “mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior White House officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical.” It’s too bad patients and health care providers didn’t get their counterbalancing message out. Without it, the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses weren’t ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer (or don’t).

Without that critical information, the rest of the already heavily compromised ACA apparatus starts to tilt precariously. How can the government enforce the individual mandate, which requires people to buy insurance if their employers don’t offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced? Without information from businesses, the government won’t know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not.

The federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits. American business lobbyists don’t gripe so much about the nearly $200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer-offered health benefits nontaxable. You’d think businesses would be pleased that the Congressional Budget Office projects that businesses that don’t offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $10 billion in penalties in 2014. Now they’ll be paying zilch.

In its notice announcing the ACA delay, the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. But so what? The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it.

America’s employers, left to their own devices, have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long. Peachtree Hotel Group, which owns a variety of chain hotels, mostly in the South, recently disclosed to The Wall Street Journal how much it nickle-and-dimes the health of its 550 employees. The company’s chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan, and now that the ACA is delayed for a year, it may increase the employee contribution on the full-benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law.

The next time you stay at Peachtree’s Courtyard by Marriott in Gulf Shores, Alabama, know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that Peachtree can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees. But if a Peachtree employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury, every taxpaying citizen of Alabama would be paying a few cents more to provide the Medicaid coverage and social services the patient needs.

Why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit? These are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the ACA should combat.

The retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act’s wounded carcass. Republicans are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the ACA is unworkable. They’re using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law.

They’re right to do so. The ACA represents a large, painful change for a number of American institutions. Hospitals, doctors, patients, insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society’s many layers. Handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us, and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections.

The administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned. Mortally wounding the ACA before the coming battle isn’t compromise – it’s foreshadowing.

USATODAY

Even supporters worry that the administration isn%27t nearly ready to meet the deadline for exchanges on Oct. 1.

Fervent Republican attempts to make the law fail are compounding the administration%27s shortcomings.

Most small businesses have fewer than 50 employees and won%27t be required to provide coverage.

President Obama signed his ambitious health reform plan into law more than three years ago. Let's say that again: more than three years ago.

When Obama signed the law on March 23, 2010, everyone knew that all but the smallest businesses would be required to offer their employees health insurance by Jan. 1, 2014. But now, not unlike a college student who hasn't used his time wisely, the White House says it needs an extension.

On Tuesday, the administration put off for a year the provision that requires any business with at least 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for workers or pay a penalty of $2,000 per employee. That wasn't the first delay: Earlier this year, the White House put off another provision that would have affected the way employees could buy insurance on health exchanges.

This might just be what the White House says it is – a smart and needed pause to allow officials and businesses to refine complicated rules that govern how the mandate will work. And in at least one way it might be smart politics for Democrats. It buys temporary peace with businesses that deeply dislike the mandate and have threatened to slash workers or reduce them to part-time status to avoid the insurance requirement. The disruptive change will now kick in after next year's congressional elections.

In another way, though, the delay is an indicator of deeper troubles that lie just ahead. ""This is a clear acknowledgment that the law is unworkable,"" declared House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. No it's not – but indications have been mounting for months that implementation, beginning just three months from now -- is going to be rocky and potentially unpopular.

Even ObamaCare supporters worry that the administration isn't nearly ready to meet the deadline for getting health exchanges, where people will choose their insurance, up and running by Oct. 1 and the rest of the law in place on Jan. 1. And whenever the exchanges are ready, some people are likely to see huge rate increases, particularly if young people opt to pay a $95 penalty rather than participate. Insurers have been predicting that outcome for months.

Meanwhile, fervent Republican attempts to make the law fail are compounding the administration's shortcomings. The Republicans have refused to set up exchanges in some states, blocked funding for implementation and tried to inhibit administration attempts to help people understand what's coming.

Introducing a program this big was always going to be bumpy. Even the much-simpler introduction of Medicare drug coverage during he Bush administration got off to a very rough and unpopular start. But in the end, it proved both popular and necessary.

ObamaCare has the same characteristics. Perfecting it will take years, but it's far better than the alternative, which is to see more and more people lose their insurance as costs rise to unaffordability.

The business mandate in particular makes perfect sense because the goal from the start was to preserve the American model – long supported by both parties -- in which most people get their coverage from their employers. Adding a mandate that employers provide coverage disrupts a race to the bottom -- in which businesses feel compelled to reduce or eliminate coverage as a cost-cutting measure to remain competitive.

In practical terms, though, this is not the most important part of the new law. Most small businesses have fewer than 50 employees and won't be required to provide coverage. Studies show most companies larger than that already provide coverage: 98% of companies with more than 200 workers, and 94% of companies with 50 to 199 workers (though smaller companies don't always offer coverage to every employee).

That said, in a nation where 50 million people are without insurance, businesses – including the restaurants and retailers who have led the resistance to the employer mandate -- will play an important role in the push for full coverage. It was galling to hear their leaders cheer the delay, and it's unclear whether they'll change their tune even after their complaints about the process are resolved.

“Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn’t working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama told supporters in the Rose Garden. But he insisted: “The product, the health insurance, is good. The prices are good. It is a good deal. People don’t just want it; they’re showing up to buy it.”

With the shutdown and debt limit crisis past, Washington’s attention has turned to persistent problems with the website, which processes enrollments for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. But the site — healthcare.gov — has been plagued since it opened Oct. 1 by glitches that threaten to overshadow Obama’s signature domestic accomplishment.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

The president relaunched his campaign to sell the law as Republicans announced plans for hearings on the balky website. A Gallup poll last week found that 7 out of 10 uninsured Americans were “not too familiar” or “not familiar at all” with the online marketplaces.

Administration officials initially claimed the problems were caused by the unexpectedly high volume of visitors to the federal portal, which serves consumers in 36 states. Obama acknowledged that the website needed to work “better, faster, sooner,” but did not explain what went wrong or when it would work properly. He said “some of the best IT talent in the entire country” was part of a “tech surge” to fix it.

Residents in the other states, including California, Connecticut and Kentucky, shop on state-run marketplaces, which have fared better. But even the Covered California website has endured technical glitches. Many consumers in the state have expressed concern about signing up before the exchange fixes its online directory of doctors and hospitals for the health plans. The provider search tool has been offline since Oct. 9 while the state tries to resolve its problems.

Even as the president sought to reassure Americans, a consensus appears to be growing among tech experts that the online marketplace has fundamental flaws that could take months to repair. Their concerns have been heightened by the Obama administration’s refusal to explain the issues in detail.

Administration officials said Monday that they had upgraded the system for authenticating the identity of consumers who set up online accounts to better handle the high volume. They also identified bugs in the application process that caused timeouts, delays and other error messages.

The officials declined to provide additional information, but emphasized that some consumers had successfully enrolled. Nationwide, the administration reported that nearly half a million applications for coverage had been submitted through the state and federal insurance marketplaces.

The troubled rollout of the healthcare law’s website has armed Republican critics with new ammunition and made it difficult for Obama to dismiss their denunciations as politically motivated.

“They’re going to be looking to go after it even harder,” he acknowledged, but he also said, “It’s time for folks to stop rooting for its failure because hard-working, middle-class families are rooting for its success.”

On Capitol Hill, Republicans see a chance to rebound from their shutdown debacle by highlighting the botched rollout.

“Obamacare’s problem is larger than a website failure, and it will take more than a ‘tech surge’ to fix it,” Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the House majority leader, said in a statement. “The website does serve as stark evidence that the federal government is ill-equipped to centrally manage our nation’s healthcare.”

On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans a hearing on “implementation failures” with testimony from federal contractors engaged with the website.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “intended to testify,” but had a conflict, said spokeswoman Joanne Peters. She was scheduled to be in Phoenix, but officials declined to say why.

The committee’s chairman, Fred Upton (R-Mich.), called her decision “wholly unacceptable.” Sebelius is expected to testify at another hearing before the committee next week. “We were told repeatedly that implementation was ‘on track,’ and it is now time for all those responsible to explain what happened,” Upton said in a statement. “As the administration continues to withhold important details and enrollment figures, I hope Secretary Sebelius is ready to give answers and finally live up to the president’s celebrated claims of transparency.”

Many health policy experts say the administration took too long to make key decisions on the website and failed to test it soon enough. But the Obama administration has recently conceded deeper technical problems. Insurance companies have reported that they are not consistently getting accurate data about consumers enrolling in their plans.

Among the major design flaws was the requirement that consumers create an online account before they could compare insurance plans, creating a bottleneck that may have caused long wait times. The Obama administration has changed that feature to allow shoppers on the federal site to “window shop.”

Such design flaws are relatively easy to address, said Bill Curtis, chief scientific officer at CAST, a New York-based firm that analyzes information technology systems. “They will get past that,” he said.

But evidence has emerged of problems in how the system shares information among federal databases to calculate whether consumers qualify for subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums. That has prompted experts to predict it may take weeks or months to get the marketplace to work properly.

“When you slam a big system together like this in too short of time and without adequate testing, this is what you will often see,” Curtis said. “They will solve one problem and it reveals a set of other issues.”

Some experts say the Obama administration may need to use more drastic measures, such as taking the website down for a complete overhaul and extending the deadline to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to enroll, if they want to get coverage starting Jan. 1. The open enrollment period lasts until March 31.

David Gruber, director of healthcare research at Alvarez & Marsal, a consulting firm in New York, said: “Their incremental fixes are unlikely to work and the consumer experience will remain poor. The question is: ‘How often will consumers go back and try it?’ At some point, the well runs dry.”

As problems persist, anxiety is mounting among the law’s supporters and insurers. If only the sickest Americans fight through technical problems to buy a health plan, while younger, healthier Americans stay away, that could drive up future premiums and hamper the viability of the healthcare expansion.

“That could be an unintended consequence of this computer fiasco,” Gruber said.

Over the weekend, the Health and Human Services Department said it had hired “some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.”

The administration also has added staff to call centers to handle phone registrations, but officials would not provide details on the number of centers or whether operators would use the same faulty online system.

The president’s aides tacitly acknowledged the setbacks. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney suggested the administration might be flexible on when people will have to pay the fine for failing to get health insurance.

As he defended the law and the marketplaces, Obama’s pitch had the touch of an infomercial. “The website is still working for a lot of people,” he said.

He told uninsured Americans they could also buy insurance by phone or in person. “Real people” are standing by, he said, “24 hours a day.”

Flanked by consumers, Obama even supplied testimonial evidence. One satisfied customer introduced him and he read letters from others, including a man named John Mier, who wrote, “Yes, the website really stank for the first week.”

“John said that when he saw what they’d be paying, he turned to his wife and told her, ‘We might just pull through. We can afford this,’” Obama said. “And John eventually predicted that ‘the website will work like a champ.’”

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election in 2014, wrote to Obama on Tuesday and asked him to delay the enrollment deadline for the individual mandate. “Given the existing problems with the website, I urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014,” Shaheen wrote to the president. “Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.”

On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), who is facing a tough challenge in his 2014 re-election against Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR), came out in support of Shaheen’s call for a delay of the individual mandate’s enrollment deadline. Pryor had previously been on record as supportive of the mandate as is.

Now, according to CNN’s Bash, the Democratic Party is coordinating an effort to support a delay in the individual mandate.

“new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline,” Bash tweeted on early Wednesday evening.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is on record as supporting a one-year delay in the individual mandate as well, although Manchin is not up for re-election in 2014.

The Democrats’ push comes shortly after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently launched a crusade against Obamacare. Cruz’s efforts and those of Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) showed the American people the president and Senate Democrats were unwilling to compromise on Obamacare, and the Democrats’ stubbornness resulted in a temporary partial government shutdown and a short-lived debt crisis scare.

Many Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), have been predicting for months that the Democrats would look for an Obamacare “escape hatch” ahead of 2014."

Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his filibuster-like Senate floor speech Tuesday evening, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) challenged the assertion that Senate Republicans must vote for cloture to support the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that defunds Obamacare, offering two alternative methods for passage which preserve that element of the legislation.

“Now, it’s interesting that what we’re discussing here today, much of what we’ve been discussing today has been on the upcoming cloture vote,” Lee said. “There have been those who have argued that if you want to support the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives–remember, this is the continuing resolution that will keep our federal government funded while defunding Obamacare–if you want to support that, that you must vote yes on the cloture vote on the bill.”

Lee then questioned the logic of that argument, which has been presented by GOP Senate leadership.

“It’s anticipated that Senator Harry Reid… and 53 democratic allies, as I understand, will all be voting for cloture on that bill,” he said. “That begs the question… does that mean that Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats likely to follow him are supporting the House-passed Continuing Resolution, the one that keeps government funded while defunding Obamacare? I find that a little strange. I find it a little counterintuitive.”

Lee argued the logic is not sound.

“That’s a problem, indeed, because that… [allows] neither an open amendment process nor an up-or-down vote on the House-passed resolution in as-is condition–in either of those circumstances, we would be fine,” Lee said. “But we’re not getting that. We’re getting stuck with something else. He wants to gut the House-passed continuing resolution of the defunding language without an open amendment process and without the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.”

“So in that circumstance, I don’t understand why it would be the case that Republicans would feel that voting ‘yes’ would be supporting the House of Representatives and voting ‘no’ would be voting against the House of Representatives.”

Then Lee told Cruz that it seems to him that such a move “would be quite the opposite of that.”

“It seems to me, Senator Cruz, that if–if one, in fact, wanted to stand behind the House of Representatives and stand behind their willingness to defend the American people and protect them from this harmful law… [one] would necessarily need to vote ‘no’ if, in fact, Senator Reid does what we expect him to do later this week.”"

If this were happening in any other country, Americans would be aghast. A sentence of life in prison, without the possibility of parole, for trying to sell $10 of marijuana to an undercover officer? For sharing LSD at a Grateful Dead concert? For siphoning gas from a truck? The punishment is so extreme, so irrational, so wildly disproportionate to the crime that it defies explanation. And yet this is happening every day in federal and state courts across the United States. Judges, bound by mandatory sentencing laws that they openly denounce, are sending people away for the rest of their lives for committing nonviolent drug and property crimes. In nearly 20 percent of cases, it was the person’s first offense.

This is what happens when politics is focused on fear. Forty years of getting ""tougher on crime"" and pretending that things were getting ever worse even as real crime statistics were trending steadily down has brought us to this state of tragic idiocy.

Dana Milbank is convinced it's game over, man.

President Obama’s signature initiative is on the ropes — Down in the count! Fourth and long! — but he remains strangely sportsmanlike. “We fumbled the rollout on this health-care law,” he admitted at Thursday afternoon’s news conference. “I am very frustrated, but I’m also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, you know, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team.” ... on the broader question of whether Obama can rebuild an effective presidency after this debacle, it’s starting to look as if it may be game over. The record for recent second-term presidents is not good: Reagan had Iran-contra, Clinton had impeachment and Bush had Katrina and Iraq. Once a president suffers a blow such as Obama is now suffering with his health-care law — in which the public not only disapproves of a president’s actions but starts to take a negative view of him personally — it is difficult to recover.

What were we talking about last week? Oh yeah, how the Government shutdown had doomed the Republicans. In a town where the average memory reaches back ten minutes or less, everyone gets a second act. I'm not writing any obituaries.

The Washington Post editorial board complains about the GOP efforts to block Medicaid expansion. Let me say that again: The Washington Post editorial board complains about blocked Medicaid expansion.

“Arizonans are losing the health-care plans they love. The doctors they know. And millions still remain uninsured,” blares a political advertisement in Arizona, part of a multimillion-dollar anti-Obamacare campaign funded by conservative group Americans for Prosperity and running in swing congressional districts. Despite the ad’s clear intent to deceive, it makes a good point — just not one that should hurt those who favored the law, or those who are trying to help it succeed. The latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reckons that 55 million non-elderly people in the United States lack health insurance; after the law phases in fully, there will be around 31 million. Last year, the CBO figured that the number of non-elderly uninsured after the phase-in would be lower — 27 million. Is the worsening outlook more evidence that the Affordable Care Act is a fundamentally flawed reform? That government is incapable of organizing the insurance system in a more rational way? That the Obama administration is incompetent? None of the above. Unfortunately, the health-care law will not quite achieve universal coverage in the United States, for a variety of reasons. The law doesn’t cover illegal immigrants, for example. Most of these reasons were easy to anticipate as lawmakers hammered out the policy, leaving to a later Congress the work of extending coverage to all. But a factor that the law’s authors couldn’t foresee was Republican intransigence combined with last year’s Supreme Court ruling. The justices proclaimed that states could opt out of an expansion of Medicaid, a partnership between states and the federal government that provides health care to poor people. The law aimed to cover a larger percentage of low-income people by raising Medicaid’s eligibility limits across the country, with the federal government paying for nearly all of the cost. It was a bargain that no state leader should have passed up. Yet Republican politicians have blocked Medicaid expansion in half the states.

Why? Well... don't look for reasons that show, you know,. Just like the punishing food policy, and the senseless policy of lifetime sentencing for petty crime, the purpose of limiting Medicaid expansion is simply to hurt people. That's not a side effect, it's the goal.

Leonard Pitts looks back 150 years to the greatest speech in American history, and to words that were intended to heal, not harm.

When it was his turn, Abraham Lincoln stood in that cemetery in Gettysburg, a town whose walls were still pitted with bullet holes from the great battle four months before and whose heart was still scarred with the memory of bodies lying twisted, bloated and mangled in the rain. “Four score and seven years ago,” he said in that high, piping twang, “our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.” In a speech lasting just two minutes, he grappled with the challenge of defining America. It is noteworthy that the second greatest thing any American ever said echoed the first. Standing at Lincoln’s shrine a century later, Martin Luther King noted his “symbolic shadow” and his signing of the Emancipation Proclamation “five score years ago.” And when he said, “I have a dream,” the first dream King articulated was that “one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

It you're already feeling a little bored with the history lesson... suck it up and read those words again. Lincoln came closer to the heart of what Americathan anyone before or since. And go read the rest of Pitts' column, which is one of his best.

Rebecca Solnit Shows how the language of hate only compounds disaster.

A lie repeated often and confidently enough can become widely mistaken for the truth, becoming a belief that obscures the facts. False beliefs about disaster follow this model; their poison is concentrated in a few oft-deployed words, notably ""mobs,"" ""panic"" and ""looting."" This poison is being poured out over the disaster zones of the Philippines right now as misleading coverage threatens to become its own disaster, augmenting the existing one. Attempts at survival are not criminal acts, yet that is how they are often portrayed in news reports suggesting the problem is out-of-control mobs or looting rather than that the largest typhoon ever to make landfall has left thousands dead and tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands, without food, water or medical care. We have headlines like these: ""Video Shows Looting in Tacloban Store"" (from Euronews); ""Looting, Gunfire Erupts in Typhoon-Hit Philippines"" (the New York Post); and ""Desperate Philippine Survivors Turn to Looting"" (the Chicago Tribune). ... Why does this misrepresentation matter? Thanks to bad journalism, many readers come to believe that the storm victims are criminals or thugs or mobs and that the situation is savage rather than tragic. That can affect relief aid, and it can also provide cover for a government to take the chaos of the storm as a chance to shift priorities — maybe suspend the constitution, impose long-term martial law, prevent aid from reaching the victims or bring violence rather than help. Governments may do this partly because they believe the media stories. Thanks in part to rumor-mongering and demonizing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many people in power were willing to believe the worst of New Orleans' residents. Stories suggested that survivors were shooting at helicopters and killing refugees in the Superdome, and the retractions that eventually came were too late to matter. The media can whip up another layer of suffering and destruction on top of an already dire situation, and they often have. Right now, they appear to be doing so again.

This is another strong piece that deserves to be read in full.

Graham Lawton presents seven animals made extinct by humans.

Until recently, the great auk was thought to be the only extinct species whose final moments were recorded for posterity. On 2 June 1844, three men clambered onto Eldey, a rocky island off the coast of Iceland. The next day, they captured and strangled a breeding pair of great auks and smashed the egg they were incubating. The carcasses were sold to a collector – the last of this magnificent bird, mercilessly hunted to extinction for its meat, eggs and pelts. However, it now seems that this large flightless seabird – the ""penguin of the north"" – survived a bit longer. A sighting off the Canadian island of Newfoundland in 1852 is accepted as genuine.

Just one of seven in today's gallery."
http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-says-obamacare-website-fixed-end-november-171107188--sector.html,,[],White House says 'Obamacare' website will be fixed by end of November,"By Caroline Humer and Sharon Begley (Reuters) - The website for Americans to buy insurance under President Barack Obama's healthcare law should be working smoothly for most users by the end of November, a White House official assigned to fix Healthcare.gov said on Friday. Jeffrey Zients also told reporters in a conference call that Quality Software Services Inc, or QSSI, will now serve as a general contractor to oversee repairs to the glitch-ridden website. The administration has not had a technology company overseeing the entire project. Instead, the government decided early on that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, would serve as the system integrator. Republican critics and technology experts have questioned whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had the experience and know-how to handle such a complex task. Online insurance exchanges launched on October 1 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, often called ""Obamacare,"" to offer health insurance plans to millions of uninsured people in the United States. But many have experienced error messages and long waits in trying to sign on to Healthcare.gov, which has become a political embarrassment for Obama. ""By the end of November, the vast majority of consumers will be able to successfully and smoothly enroll through Healthcare.gov,"" Zients said. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who is battling some Republicans' calls for her resignation, said on Friday that the website has clearly not lived up to its full potential. But she said it is not beyond hope. ""We want to dispel the notion that the website is fatally flawed. It can be fixed and it will be fixed,"" said Sebelius, speaking at forum on enrollment in the new national healthcare system in San Antonio, Texas. The White House said last week that Obama still has ""full confidence"" in Sebelius, whose department is responsible for implementing the law. Sebelius on Friday said calls for her resignation are coming from lawmakers who ""unfortunately have been ferociously opposed to the expansion of healthcare."" QSSI, a unit of health insurer UnitedHealth Group, already has a technology contract related to the website and testified on Thursday to a congressional panel about problems with the system. QSSI produced the federal data hub and a software tool to register consumers before allowing them to browse, a requirement that caused early logjam problems. However, Andrew Slavitt, executive vice president with QSSI's parent, testified that it was the administration that did not fully test the website until the last minute and also introduced the account creation feature just 10 days before launch. 'A LOT OF PROBLEMS' Zients said he had brought in technology experts to establish the problems with the website and to prioritize the repairs. ""It will take a lot of work and there are a lot of problems that will need to be addressed, but the bottom line is that it is fixable,"" he said. He said experts had identified ""dozens of items"" to be fixed in terms of both performance and functionality, and that a problem related to communications with insurers was on the top of the list. He did not provide further details about the nature of the glitches. Earlier this week, the government told insurers in a meeting that it was working to fix data transmission problems with applications and also with the technology that can allow insurers to directly enroll consumers in exchange plans. The government expects about 7 million people to enroll for individual insurance in 2014, many of whom are expected to receive government subsidies. Consumers must enroll by mid-December to have insurance on January 1, and those who have not enrolled by the end of March 2014 will have to pay a penalty laid out in the Affordable Care Act. About 90 percent of people who try to create accounts are able to do so, but the ability to complete an application has been ""volatile,"" Zients said. The government said that about 700,000 Obamacare applications had been filled out across the country but has not provided enrollment figures. The federal government is running the website for 36 states while 14 other states have built their own exchanges to sell insurance policies under Obamacare. Some state sites have also had technology issues. Republican lawmakers, long opposed to Obamacare, have pounced on the rocky rollout to start multiple investigations into the administration's missteps and the role of contractors. Some Democrats have also criticized the administration and called for extending the open-enrollment period beyond the existing March 31 deadline. Sebelius on Friday dismissed the idea of extending the enrollment period. Two committees in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will hold hearings next week, one with Sebelius and the other with Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., along with a half-dozen other Republican senators, introduced the ""ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act"" on Tuesday. It would strip a provision in the Affordable Care Act pertaining to so-called ""risk corridors,"" which could allow the government to pay insurance companies to offset financial losses.

Rubio calls it a ""blank check"" for the industry.

""The idea that the federal government should be bailing out insurance companies in order to make ObamaCare work, that's not something a lot of people are aware of,"" Rubio told Fox News. ""And I haven't taken a poll on it, but I guarantee you it would be hugely unpopular.""

The provision has been in the law since passage, but Rubio and other senators raised concern about it after President Obama announced last week that he would allow insurance companies to continue to offer out-of-compliance plans. The announcement was made in response to the millions of people receiving cancellation notices -- but industry representatives raised concern that if they offer the old plans again, premium revenue could go down.

In addition, the federal website for ObamaCare is still experiencing problems, meaning the industry is not receiving as many new customers as it had initially hoped.

In a statement last week, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that the risk corridor program could be used to help insurance companies.

Gary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said in a letter to insurance commissioners that the program ""should help ameliorate unanticipated changes in premium revenue"" and the government is looking at ways to modify the rules ""to provide additional assistance.""

Asked about the program, an administration official told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that they would be providing more information ""very soon"" on risk corridors and how they might be adjusted in light of the recent announcement.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, stressed that the three-year program is only temporary, and said it's not out of the ordinary for new laws.

""There's a lot of uncertainty about what the markets are going to look like,"" he said, noting the payments are designed to help stabilize the market.

Rubio, though, fired off a letter Tuesday to the Congressional Budget Office asking for a cost estimate for the program.

""It is clear that the risk corridors' only purpose over the next 3 years will be to serve exclusively as a taxpayer bailout mechanism for health insurance companies,"" he wrote.

Rubio's bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Mike Lee, R-Utah; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and David Vitter, R-La.

According to Politico, Obama told insurance executives at a meeting last week that the government's assistance to the industry would be limited. Obama plans to meet Wednesday afternoon with insurance commissioners, some of whom have already announced they would not implement the president's plan.

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday that human genes cannot be patented.

But in something of a compromise, all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable, a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented.

Legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing, likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable.

The overriding legal question addressed was whether “products of nature” can be treated the same as “human-made” inventions, allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies.

The broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting-edge medical science, the power of business and individual legal rights, and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases, like cancer.

The issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities. But it was a blockbuster celebrity, actress Angelina Jolie who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test.

The Supreme Court case involves Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified – BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities.

It says 1 million patients have benefited from its “BRAC Analysis” technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly.

An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second called BART to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars.

Jolie had Myriad’s breast cancer test.

Plaintiffs and testing

Among those challenging the Myriad patents were sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40.

The initial BRCA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carried the cancer-causing mutation all along.

Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers.

Breast cancer survivor Lisbeth Ceriani was another plaintiff. She faced having to pay thousands for Myriad’s test to see if she had a mutation for ovarian cancer. Because of cost, she waited 18 months before she could afford it, learning she carried a mutation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented plaintiffs.

All sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task. Myriad has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research. But the issue of patenting has divided the scientific and business communities.

A history of patent protection

In the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents.

On one side of the Myriad case, scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives.

On the other, patient rights groups and civil libertarians countered the patent holders were “holding hostage” the diagnostic care and access of information available to high-risk patients.

Outside the court during oral arguments in April, several protesters held signs, such as “Your corporate greed is killing my friends” and “My genes are not property.”

The patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose. One is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the X-ray machine.

The second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability.

All patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws, distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles, and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles.

The Supreme Court ruling

The Supreme Court has long allowed patent protection for the creation of a new process or use for natural products. Whether “isolating” or “extracting” genes themselves qualifies for such protection became the central argument.

The justices took the position offered by the Obama administration – DNA itself is not patentable but so-called “cDNA” can be.

Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones.

Use of this protein-isolating procedure, known as “tagging,” is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome.

“Genes and the information they encode are not patent-eligible under [federal law] simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material,” said Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the 9-0 court opinion.

“Myriad did not create anything,” said Thomas. “To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.”

But Thomas said, “cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments.”

Reaction to the decision

The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision represents a major shift in patent law and overturns established policy.

“Today, the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation,” said Sandra Park, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women’s Rights Project. “Myriad did not invent the BRCA genes and should not control them. Because of this ruling, patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued.”

Dr. Harry Ostrer, a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said the decision will not undermine the genetically engineered drug industry and expects the costs of tests to fall.

“I’m thrilled. We can offer BRCA 1 and 2 testing to low-income women without concerns about how it will be paid for,” he said.

Jolie also hoped for a meaningful impact.

“I hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives, not just in the U.S. but around the world – whatever their means and whatever their background,” she said.

Peter D. Meldrum, president and chief executive officer of Myriad, said in a statement the company believed the court “appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA”

The ruling, he added “underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward.”

Investors in Myriad were pleased with the ruling with the stock soaring as much as 9% before settling back but still higher.

The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (12-398).

Administration officials reported Sunday that about 1.1 million people had enrolled in health plans using the federal website, HealthCare.gov, the main entry point for coverage in 36 states. Nearly all the enrollments came in the last couple of weeks as the deadline approached for coverage that would take effect Jan. 1.

Several hundred thousand people have enrolled on separate sites run by 14 states and the District of Columbia, with the largest figure coming from California, where more than 400,000 have signed up.

An exact count nationwide is not yet available because not all states have tallied their figures, but the total appears to be about 2 million. That remains short of the administration’s original goal of 3 million by this point, but marks a significant recovery from the system’s disastrous debut in October.

More than 4 million additional people have been found eligible for coverage under the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

How the law will ultimately work and whether it can endure remain unclear, though the fact that coverage will now be real for several million people will almost certainly change the debate over Republican efforts to repeal it.

While that broader political fight plays out, doctors, hospitals and pharmacies across the country are bracing for more confusion as patients struggle to understand their new coverage.

Some may show up at physicians’ offices without insurance cards, victims of the error-plagued enrollment process that bedeviled the initial rollout.

Others may discover that although they’re properly enrolled in a health plan, the doctor or hospital they visit or the prescription they want to fill won’t be covered by the plan they have selected.

Still other patients, including many who have never had insurance before, may be shocked to learn they have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before their coverage kicks in. Like employer-provided health plans, many insurance plans set up under the health law come with low premiums and high deductibles.

Surveys indicate that many Americans have little understanding of basic insurance concepts such as co-pays and deductibles.

“We still have a lot of education to do for the average man on the street who doesn’t really understand the Affordable Care Act,” said J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare Inc., a California-based insurer that is selling policies in nine states.

Relatively few healthcare providers are likely to encounter significant numbers of patients with problems related to coverage under the new law. The number of people covered by the law is dwarfed by the more than 270 million people who already have some form of health insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicare.

Jeff Goldman, vice president for coverage policy at the American Hospital Assn., said most hospitals already had systems to help patients sort out their insurance, something that consumers often struggle with, particularly at the beginning of the year.

“We are pretty confident that people are prepared,” he said.

Still, the health law remains a political lightning rod, and providers and others anticipate every problem will be magnified.

“The fact that not everything will go exactly as was intended by the ACA when most of its biggest changes start to go live … should surprise no one,” the American College of Physicians warned its members in a recent newsletter outlining potential headaches after Jan. 1.

“In a less political environment, the mantra as problems arise with ACA implementation would be fix it, not nix it. Until we get to that point, we’ll have to muddle through.”

HealthCare.gov and the separate state sites are the primary portals created by the health law to help Americans who don’t get coverage through work to select a plan.

Plans sold on these marketplaces must meet new consumer standards. Insurers are prohibited from turning away customers with preexisting medical conditions. Americans making less than four times the federal poverty line — about $46,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four — will qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.

Enrollment in these plans started Oct. 1 and is scheduled to go until March 31. The surge in enrollment in the last few weeks has intensified anxieties about potential mix-ups early next year and prompted administration officials and insurers to take steps to try to head off problems.

TIMELINE: The year in politics

Insurers announced last week they would allow consumers who selected a health plan in December to begin getting coverage Wednesday even if they don’t make their first premium payment until later in the month. Initially, consumers had to pay before Tuesday to be guaranteed coverage in January.

Administration officials have also asked insurers to initially cover some out-of-network care and prescriptions to help consumers who are moving from one provider network to another. That could be particularly important for patients with complex conditions such as cancer or AIDS. Industry officials said doing so may be difficult.

CVS Caremark Executive Vice President Helena Foulkes said the pharmacy giant may provide some patients with a “transitional supply” of prescriptions if their insurance is temporarily interrupted in January.

Such interruptions dogged the first few weeks of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2006, prompting the George W. Bush administration to step in to help seniors who couldn’t get their medications, according to former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt. Speaking to a group of insurance industry officials in Washington recently, Leavitt cautioned that something similar may again be necessary.

Supporters of the Affordable Care Act are nonetheless urging patients to be careful as they begin trying to use their insurance next year.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state’s insurance marketplace, emphasized that consumers shouldn’t assume their previous doctor or prescription would be covered under their new health plan.

“Going to an out-of-network provider subjects you to out-of-network rules. Consumers need to understand that,” Lee said.

For their part, physicians and hospitals anticipate they will have to assume more responsibility for educating patients about their insurance, a job many are increasingly doing anyway.

MemorialCare Health System, which runs six hospitals in Southern California, has given its front-line admissions staff additional training on how to deal with a barrage of questions about co-pays, benefits and networks, said John Cascell, a vice president at the system.

In Ohio, the state medical association anticipates calls from members who have problems submitting insurance claims for new patients.

In Texas and elsewhere, physician groups are already increasingly asking patients to leave a credit card on file to make collecting bills easier as co-pays and deductibles increase, said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians.

Despite the challenges of dealing with newly insured patients, however, many medical providers fear that the uninsured still pose a far greater challenge. That’s particularly true in states, including Texas, where lawmakers oppose the health law and have declined to expand their Medicaid programs next year. Millions of poor Americans will lack coverage next year in those states.

“The much bigger issue is uncompensated care,” said Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Assn. “That is what we are most concerned about.”

However, he explained to his supporters over the years that a “potential transition” would be necessary to break away from the current system.

Interestingly, as the implementation of the Obamacare exchanges face problems and millions begin to lose coverage from their private insurers, something President Obama promised would not happen, Democrats and their liberal allies are now beginning to suggest a single payer system as a solution to the rickety exchanges.

Rep. John Larson (D – CT) told Breitbart News last Wednesday that under a single payer system Americans would not be losing their private health care coverage, claiming, “You would be covered automatically. But that’s not the law. The law is that it’s a free enterprise system and they have the right not to enter into the exchange or not to provide for you in the exchange. That is their right.”

The video below shows clips of Obama explaining to supporters his views over the years about how he would transition a single payer system into the United States. At the same time he criticizes his detractors, saying the Affordable Care Act is not a “government take over” of American health care.

Obama – Remarks to AFL – CIO

“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer health care plan. The United States of America–the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent–14 percent of its gross national product on health care and cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody and that’s what Jim is talking about when he says, ‘Everybody in. Nobody out.’ A single payer health care credit–universal healthcare credit. That’s what I’d like to see, but as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House and we’ve got to take back the Senate and we’ve got to take back the House.”

Obama – Remarks – 8/4/07

“This is a two trillion dollar part of our economy and it is my belief that it’s not just politically but economically it is better for us to start getting a system in place–a universal healthcare system signed into law by the end of my first term as president and build off that system to further to make it more rational…”

“By the way, Canada did not start immediately with a single payer system. They had a similar transition step. “

Obama- New Hampshire Public Radio 11/21/07

OBAMA: It’s a transitional system building on the existing systems that we have.

HOST: Transitional to what?

OBAMA: Transitional, hopefully, because the system is currently a patchwork of inefficiency that over time I would want to see Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)–all those integrated more effectively.

Obama – Public Remarks 4/3/07

“Let’s say that I proposed a plan that moved to a single payer system–Let’s say Medicare plus. Essentially, everybody can buy Medicare, for example…”

“Transitioning a system is a very difficult and costly and lengthy enterprise. It’s not like you can turn on a switch and you go from one system to another. So it’s possible that up front, you wouldn’t need not just– you might need an additional ninety or a hundred billion dollars a year.”

Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07

“But I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”

Obama – Public Remarks – 1/27/05

“There’s no denying that part of the solution in the health care arena as we transition and deal with the legacy systems that we’ve inherited will probably require some additional money.”

Obama – Remarks to American Medical Association – 6/15/2009

“The public option is not your enemy. It is your friend…Let me also address an illegitimate concern that is being put forward by those who are claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single payer system.”

Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07



“My commitment is to make sure we’ve got universal health care for all Americans by the end of my first term as president…”

“I would hope that we could set up a system that allows those who can’t go through their employers to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort…but I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”

Rep. Barney Frank (D – MA) – 7/27/09

“I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to single payer and that’s the best way to reach single payer.”

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D – IL) – 4/18/09

“And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then argued against the public health insurance option saying, ‘It wouldn’t let private insurance compete–that a public option will put the private insurance industry out of business and lead to single payer.’ He was right. The man was right.”

Obama – Public Remarks

“Nobody is talking about some government take over of health care.”"

The enrollment numbers are actually not that terrible. While the media and Republicans are focusing on the roughly 100K that have chosen a plan, fact is that 846,000 have completed their applications, but haven't chosen a plan. Part of that is technical difficulties. Part of that is people doing their due diligence before making an important decision. Part of it is procrastination. Why spend too much time now doing something that won't take effect until January?

If the enrollment numbers remain low in late December and January, then that would certainly be cause for concern. But right now? During Romneycare's first enrollment month, 130 people had signed up—130. But the optics of those numbers aren't great, particularly given previous administration-supplied projections.

On the other hand, the optics of Obama's broken promise that everyone would be able to keep their insurance are brutal. We are in ""Read my lips, no new taxes"" territory. Sure, Obama's claim was supposed to apply only to employer-provided insurance, but he never qualified it as such. So now we're subjected to endless stories about people losing their (crappy substandard) insurance, even though Obama said they wouldn't.

So enter Sen. Mary Landrieu's fix to this issue (see here and here for details). In short, it would allow people to keep their crappy individual insurance policies, but insurance companies would be unable to keep selling them to new customers, and they'd have to let their customers know why the government considers their policies crap and point them to the exchanges for other options. The idea may not be a home run on the policy side, but Democrats don't have the benefit of perfect policy having botched this thing so badly (from original passage to implementation). But even on the policy, it's not terrible.

But on the politics? Woo-boy it's a winner! Remember, some policies are being cancelled because they are substandard. Some are being cancelled because insurance companies are trying to scam their customers into more expensive plans. In both cases, the problem is the insurance companies.

Right now, the blame is being put on Obama and the Democrats. This bill would turn things around and put the pressure exactly where it belongs: on insurance companies and obstructionist Republicans.

Republicans are acting as if these insurance cancellations are the worst thing since Hitler. Well, put them on the spot: Are they really interested in mitigating the law's unintended injustices (whether real or perceived), or do they merely want to undermine its implementation for sabotage purposes?

We know the answer, of course. Landrieu's bill doesn't have a prayer of passing. Republicans will obstruct it every step of the way. But instead of having Obama taking away your insurance, we'll reverse the equation: It'll now be Republicans defending the ability of insurance companies to cancel those policies.

Heading into 2014, that may be the difference between retaining the political high ground, or facing another 2010. Landrieu's gambit is genius.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-says-1-million-signed-health-care-204634907--politics.html,,[],Obama says 1 million signed up for health care,"WASHINGTON (AP) — His health care plan facing a dicey transition, President Barack Obama said Friday that insurance sign-ups are surging now that the government's website is working better for consumers. But it was too soon to say the rollout has turned the corner.

More than 1 million people have enrolled since Oct. 1, Obama said at his end-of-the-year press conference. That's more than two-and-a-half times the number on Nov. 30, when major fixes to the website were completed. At that point, only 365,000 had signed up through new federal and state markets offering subsidized private insurance.

""That is a big deal,"" Obama said of getting coverage for uninsured people. ""That's why I ran for this office.""

Separately, officials said 3.9 million people have qualified for government health care through the law's Medicaid expansion. Even so, things aren't exactly humming along.

HealthCare.gov was down for part of the day Friday, as technicians attempted to fix an error that occurred Thursday night when the site was undergoing routine maintenance, officials explained.

The administration cannot afford for the balky website to crash this weekend. Because of Monday's deadline to sign up so coverage can take effect Jan. 1, unusually heavy traffic is expected on the federal site and those run by states.

Largely hidden from consumers, another set of technical problems is frustrating insurers, who say the government continues to send them inaccurate data on some enrolled individuals. Insurers call some of those jumbled enrollment files ""orphans"" and others ""ghosts.""

They could turn into gremlins after Jan. 1 for some patients trying to use their new coverage. Consumers might show up at the pharmacy counter or doctor's office only to be told they're not in the system.

That's not the only potential issue. Administration officials are scrambling to prevent breaks in coverage among more than 4 million people whose individual policies were cancelled this fall because they did not meet the law's requirements. An estimated 500,000 have yet to secure new coverage. On Thursday, the administration said those individuals would not be penalized for remaining uninsured, and that they could also have access to special bare-bones catastrophic insurance plans.

Story continues

The president minimized the significance of that accommodation Friday, calling it a net to catch a small number of people who may slip through the cracks.

Still tinkering with the website, the administration now faces crucial deadlines within a two-week stretch.

The last day to sign up for coverage to take effect with the new year is Monday. And Jan. 1 is the day the people can start using their new policies. Starting then, the law forbids insurers from turning away people with pre-existing medical conditions. The law's mandate that virtually all Americans carry coverage also goes into place, although uninsured people can avoid a tax penalty if they pick a plan by Mar. 31.

The stakes are much higher now than Oct. 1, when HealthCare.gov went live. It's not just that the president's political reputation has been tarnished by website woes and insurance cancellations.

The risk now is that ordinary people with pressing medical needs will suffer harm if the transition to coverage is fumbled. If that happens, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will face a new round of demands for her resignation.

""Implementing the website is the relatively easy part,"" said Mark McClellan, who oversaw the problematic rollout of the Medicare prescription drug benefit for President George W. Bush. ""Implementing the coverage itself involves a lot more things that could go wrong, and there's a lot more at stake.

""It was possible for people to wait a month or two to use the website,"" McClellan added. ""People who need care on Jan. 1 are not going to be able to wait a month or two to get it."" McClellan is now a health policy expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank.

Obama was feeling optimistic Friday. In first three weeks of December, more than 500,000 people signed up through the federal website, he noted. On Oct. 1, only a handful managed to enroll successfully.

Crossing the 1 million mark was a milestone, but the administration's own estimates called for 3.3 million to enroll by Dec. 31. The target now is 7 million by the end of open enrollment on Mar. 31.

In Florida on Friday, Lisa Hulsey wasn't feeling very confident. She had waited nearly an hour to sign up for health insurance with a counselor because the website was down. The couple before Hulsey zipped through in less than an hour and chose a midrange silver plan.

Hulsey, a paralegal, had employer insurance at no cost to her. But her company is no longer offering coverage, instead pushing employees into the federal marketplace where they may qualify for subsidies.

""I'm hungry. I'm frustrated. It should work,"" said Hulsey. She was leaving this weekend to visit her family in Alabama and did not know when she would have time to try again before Monday's deadline.

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/states-brace-web-barrage-when-health-reform-goes-live-6C10489606,2013-06-30 16:55:00+00:00,['Sharon Begley'],States brace for web barrage when health reform goes live,"NEW YORK -- About 550,000 people in Oregon do not have health insurance, and Aaron Karjala is confident the state's new online insurance exchange will be able to accommodate them when enrollment under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform begins on October 1.

What Karjala, the chief information officer at ""Cover Oregon,"" does worry about, however, is what will happen if the entire population of Oregon -- 3.9 million -- logs on that day ""just to check it out,"" he said. Or if millions of curious souls elsewhere, wondering if Oregon's insurance offerings are better than their states', log on, causing Cover Oregon to crash in a blur of spinning hourglasses and color wheels and an epidemic of frozen screens.

Multiply that by another 49 states and the District of Columbia, all of which will open health insurance exchanges under ""Obamacare"" that same day, and you get some idea of what could go publicly and disastrously wrong.

Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), could fail for many reasons, including participation by too few of the uninsured and a shortage of doctors to treat those who do sign up. But because its core is government-run marketplaces selling health insurance online, the likeliest reason for failure at the opening bell is information technology snafus, say experts who are helping with the rollout.

Although IT is the single most expensive ingredient of the exchanges, with eight-figure contracts to build them, experts expect bugs, errors and crashes. In April, Obama himself predicted ""glitches and bumps"" when the exchanges open for business.

""This is a 1.0 implementation,"" said Dan Maynard, chief executive of Connecture, a software developer that is providing the shopping and enrollment functions for several states' insurance exchanges. ""From an IT perspective, 1.0's come out with a lot of defects. Everyone is waiting for something to go wrong.""

Two states that intended to build their own exchanges, Idaho and New Mexico, announced this spring that because of the tight timeline and daunting challenges they would have the federal government operate their IT systems.

""Nothing like this in IT has ever been done to this complexity or scale, and with a timeline that put it behind schedule almost before the ink was dry,"" said Rick Howard, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner.

WHAT COLOR WAS YOUR VOLVO?

The potential for problems will begin as soon as would-be buyers log onto their state exchange. They'll enter their name, birth date, address and other identifying information. Then comes the first IT handoff: Is this person who she says she is?

To check that, credit bureau Experian will check the answers against its voluminous external databases, which include information from utility companies and banks on people's spending and other history, and generate questions. The customer will be asked which of several addresses he previously lived at, for example, whether his car has one of several proffered license plate numbers, and what color his old Volvo was.

It's similar to the system that verifies identity for accessing personal Social Security information. If someone gets a question wrong, he will be referred to Experian's help desk, and if that fails may be asked to submit documentation to prove he is who he claims to be.

The next step is determining if the customer is eligible for federal subsidies to pay for insurance. She is if she is a citizen and her income, which she will enter, is less than four times the federal poverty level. To verify this, the exchange pings the ""federal data services hub,"" which is being built by Quality Software Services Inc under a $58 million contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

The query arrives at the hub, which does not actually store information, and is routed to online servers at the Internal Revenue Service for income verification and at the Department of Homeland Security for a citizenship check.

The answers must be returned in real time, before the would-be buyer loses patience and logs off. If the reported income doesn't match the IRS's records, the applicant may have to submit pay stubs.

These federal computer systems have never been connected before, so it's anyone's guess how well they'll communicate.

""The challenge for states,"" said Jinnifer Wattum, director of Eligibility and Exchange Solutions at Xerox's government healthcare unit, is that they have to build ""the interfaces needed with the federal data services hub without knowing what this system will look like."" That makes the task akin to making a key for a lock that doesn't exist yet.

CMS's contractors are working to finish the hub, but ""much remains to be accomplished within a relatively short amount of time,"" concluded a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, in June. CMS spokesman Brian Cook said the hub would be ready by September, and that the beta version had been tested for its ability to interact with the exchanges Oregon and Maryland are building.

The federal hub has to verify even more arcane data, such as whether the insurance offered to a buyer through his job is unaffordable, in which case he may qualify for federal subsidies, and whether the buyer is in prison, in which case she is exempt from the mandate to purchase insurance.

If someone's income qualifies him for Medicaid, or his children for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), software has to divert him from the ACA exchange and into those systems. Many of the computers handling Medicaid and CHIP enrollment are, as IT people diplomatically put it, ""legacy systems,"" meaning old, even decades old.

Many are mainframes, lacking the connectivity of cloud computing. They typically process eligibility requests in days, not seconds.

The legacy systems ""rely on daily or weekly batch files to pass information back and forth,"" and often require follow-up phone calls, said Wattum of Xerox, which is working to configure Nevada's exchange so it can interface with the federal hub.

'NO WRONG DOOR'

A ""we'll call you"" message is unacceptable under Obamacare, which has a ""no wrong door"" goal: A buyer must never come to a dead end. If she is diverted to Medicaid, for instance, she must not be required to resubmit information, let alone wait a week for an answer about whether she's now enrolled.

State IT systems must therefore ""be interoperable and integrated with an exchange, Medicaid, and CHIP to allow consumers to easily switch from private insurance to Medicaid and CHIP,"" said an April report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress.

To make all those systems communicate, the state exchanges must either develop entirely new systems or use application programming interfaces (APIs) that work with the legacy systems to exchange data in real time. APIs are programming instructions for accessing Web-based software applications.

GAO's Stan Czerwinski compares the necessary connectivity to adapters that let American electronics work with European outlets.

State officials told the GAO that verifying eligibility, enrolling buyers and interfacing with legacy systems are the most ""onerous"" aspects of developing their exchanges, ""given the age and limited functionality of current state systems.""

A key goal for exchange officials is keeping would-be buyers in the portal so they don't give up and use a state's ACA call center, which could quickly be swamped.

To avoid this, Oregon brought in potential users to test design prototypes, recorded what people did and where they had trouble, and tweaked the consumer interface to make it as user-friendly as possible, said Karjala.

""Even with that, if you have a family of four and you're eligible for a tax credit to offset your premium,"" he said, ""you could be sitting at the computer for a long time.""

What everyone hopes to avoid is a repeat of the early days of the Medicare prescription-drug program in 2006. Some seniors who tried to sign up for a plan were mistakenly enrolled in several, while others had the wrong premium amounts deducted from their Social Security checks.

Another challenge is capacity. Websites regularly crash when too many people try to access them.

""I had no choice but to be extremely conservative"" in estimates of how many simultaneous users Cover Oregon has to be prepared for, Karjala said. ""Building capacity is the only way to avoid the spinning hourglass or the site freezing, so in our performance testing we're seeing what happens if the whole U.S. population came to Cover Oregon to check it out.""

This summer, state exchanges will test their ability to communicate with the federal data hub, whose security frameworks and connectivity protocols are still works in progress. But whether Obamacare 1.0 flies won't be known until the new health plans take effect on January 1. Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates Inc, a consulting firm, said he wouldn't be surprised if some patients showing up at doctors' offices next year with Obamacare policies are told their insurers never heard of them.

But those first numbers may mask a different set of numbers

Many states are using Medicaid enrollees in their count toward initial Obamacare applications

The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work.

Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance.

The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.

But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans -- those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance.

Officials announced Thursday that 700,000 people have applied for insurance plans in both the 36 states that are using a federally run health care exchange and the 14 states running their own exchanges.

But don't apply that 700,000 application figure to the 7 million enrollment goal. For starters, there's no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan.

And those 700,000 applications include Medicaid enrollments.

Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance.

As the law was originally envisioned, more than half of the uninsured people in the United States -- 24 million or so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation -- who would be getting insurance through Obamacare would have been getting Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level -- about $27,000 for a family of four -- isn't eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, so Medicaid is effectively their only option.

So it's not necessarily a bad thing if more than half of the people getting insurance under Obamacare so far are getting Medicaid. But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.

Should it be alarming that so many of these 700,000 new applications are people trying to get Medicaid and not private insurance?

Not yet, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

""There's nothing in what we've seen to suggest anything like that,"" he said. ""Whether you're able to be eligible for Medicaid or not is totally dependent on your income.""

But he did admit ""Some of the numbers we've seen, preliminary, early numbers, do seem a little out of whack.""

But he said there's a reason for that.

""In these small handful of states, they're aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid,"" Salo said.

Salo pointed to people who the states already know are on food stamps receiving some other kind of state or locally funded health program.

""You know who they are, you know what their income is, you know they're OK accepting government benefits. If you go after these guys, there should be no surprise that these people are being enrolled.""

Also, in some states, Medicaid coverage starts immediately, meaning there may be more of an incentive to enroll early because you get coverage sooner than on the private market where no matter when you enroll in the first two and a half months coverage still starts on January 1.

In Arkansas they've insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1. But in a novel twist they're doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.

And Oregon has been approved to use food stamps and other metrics as a prequalifier for Medicaid enrollment. So the state sent letters to uninsured welfare recipients that detailed simple steps to enroll in Medicaid -- i.e. just sign a form and mail it back or call a hotline. This has resulted in tens of thousands of enrollees. But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance. It's the one state that elected to fix the glitches in its website before going live.

It may very well be that not enough people -- particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy -- are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.

But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell."

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his leadership role in the effort to defund Obamacare in the wake of attacks from the mainstream media and anonymous statements from establishment Republicans and their staffers.

“I do feel obligated to speak because Senator Cruz is my senator and I endorsed him last year in his election against Lt. Gov. [David] Dewhurst,” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) said in response to a question from Breitbart News at Thursday’s Conversations with Conservatives press event on Capitol Hill. “We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for his vision and his leadership,” he explained. “We are grateful for the fact that we are here today with this opportunity to deliver for the American people. We hope that the American people will help the Senate understand the enormous task that is in front of us.”

Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) added that Republicans are united in their push to defund Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution (CR). Labrado said he believes it is a “mistake” for some anonymous Republicans to suggest Cruz is somehow splitting the Party.

“Anonymous members and anonymous aides accusing other people of dividing the Republican Party?” Labrador said in response to Breitbart News’ question. “I think that’s a mistake. I think we’re behind this move.”

“I think you’re going to see a huge number of members, in fact, I almost believe that it’s going to be unanimous with the Republican members in the House,” he ventured. “I don’t think we’ve ever been this unified.”

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), along with House conservative leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Tom Graves (R-GA), deserve credit for helping unite the Republican Party around the effort to defund Obamacare. He said the American people also deserve credit for rising up and demanding their lawmakers fight for them.

“I’ll just echo that the Senators are getting credit and Tom Graves and Jim Jordan and others for helping get us to this point,” Duncan said. “They all deserve credit. But I’ll tell you what: The involvement of the American people cannot be ignored in this. Their voices were heard.”

“They made phone calls to our offices. They came to a rally here in Washington. They made personal contact during August at town halls,” he continued.” The American people got engaged and so I don’t want to discount them at all and I actually want to give them all the credit for getting us where we are today on this.”

Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) argued that the current debate is the result of the American people wanting leaders in Congress like Cruz to stand up and defund Obamacare.

“Republicans are always blamed for defunding Obamacare and this is like 30 or 40 times we’ve done that,” Yoho said. “We’re not doing it because we want to do it. It’s because the American people have spoken up and said we want this thing done and if you go back to 2009 when the infamous words were ‘we have to pass it to see what’s in it. We have to pass it to see how it’s going to work.'”

“You’re seeing now what’s coming out and the American people don’t want it. American business said ‘no we don’t want it.’ The unions are saying ‘no we don’t want it.’ So I think the people have spoken loud and clear and I’m proud to be on this team in the 113th Congress where we’ve said we’re going to do this for the American people,” he stated. “This is what’s right for our country. This is what’s going to stimulate our economy by creating jobs and getting rid of this.”

Later on Thursday on a conference call with Cruz and conservative media, Reps. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) and Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) also signaled their thanks and support for Cruz.

“It’s an honor to be on the phone with Sen. Cruz, and I think we have Jim Bridenstine on the call with us too, another great patriot,” Salmon said. “I just want to thank the leadership in the Senate of Sen. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee.”

“It’s been interesting to watch this debate develop,” Bridenstine added. “It started off when this debate first started and Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee have been doing the Lord’s work on this effort.”"

The third-largest U.S. health insurer has said it is seeking to limit its exposure to the risks of providing health plans to America's uninsured, but did not give details about its decision to pull out of specific markets.

""We believe it is critical that our plans not only be competitive, but also financially viable, in order to meet the long-term needs of the exchanges in which we choose to participate. On New York, as a result of our analysis, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to withdraw,"" Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.

The New York decision comes as states finalize the roster of health plans that will be offered to millions of uninsured Americans beginning on Oct. 1.

Aetna and its newly acquired Coventry Health unit, a low-cost provider that caters to individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries and provides private Medicare policies, still have applications to sell coverage in 10 states, based on publicly available information.

Michener said the full list of state exchanges where Aetna will participate is still being finalized.

The new online insurance exchanges are the lynchpin of Obama's healthcare reform, representing a massive technology build-out that has run up against multiple delays and political opposition in many states. In their first year, the exchanges aim to provide coverage to 7 million uninsured Americans, many of whom will be eligible for government subsidies.

Aetna's large competitors, such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and WellPoint Inc, have also planned limited entries into the new exchanges while they wait and see whether they operate smoothly and whether enough healthy people sign on to offset the costs of sicker new members.

""We've got this period where the exchange experience, the exchange sentiment, and news headlines are probably not going to be very flattering and that's not going to have a positive impact on turnout,"" said Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley.

""Longer-term, those kinks will get ironed out, more people will get comfortable and in (the next few years) more people will be accessing their health insurance through an exchange of some sort,"" he said.

'RISK-BASED APPROACH'

Aetna signaled last month that it was considering withdrawing some applications because of its purchase of Coventry, which also had filed documents to sell insurance plans on exchanges around the country.

""We have taken a prudent risk-based approach to both our overall exposure and exposure within a given marketplace,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a conference call with analysts at the time.

Since then, it has withdrawn applications in Maryland, Ohio, Georgia, and Connecticut, where it is based. In Maryland, Aetna's decision came after state regulators ordered the company to lower rates dramatically from what it had proposed.

Aetna also has filed applications in Florida, Arizona and Virginia, where the federal government will operate the exchanges, and in Washington, D.C., which is running its own exchange.

Coventry filed applications to sell insurance in Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to those states' insurance departments. Iowa is working with the government on its exchanges while the rest are being run entirely by the federal government.

Coventry withdrew its applications in Georgia and Maryland when Aetna bowed out but it remains in Ohio. It also withdrew earlier this month from Tennessee.

Aetna and Coventry may also have filed plans in other states that have not released any information about participants.

Insurance plans in the 33 states that have defaulted to the federal government exchanges must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and then insurers sign off on them. Earlier this week, HHS delayed the sign-off deadline to mid-September after originally aiming for early next month.

Michener said the company will continue to serve small business and large business customers in New York and will offer products to individual consumers outside of the exchanges.

Only 17,000 or so people in New York currently buy individual insurance, but the exchange is expected to bring in 1 million people during the first three years. The exchange announced insurance participants on Aug. 20. Aetna was not on the list."

As a US Army private he served for 15 months in Baghdad, calling in artillery and air support in his role as a member of a reconnaissance unit. Deadly roadside bombs and insurgent attacks were everyday occurrences in the city divided by sectarian violence. Being hyper-vigilant can help keep a soldier alive in a warzone, but when Macie returned home in 2007, he couldn’t switch off. “My brain was working on overdrive all the time,” he says. “I couldn’t relax, couldn’t unwind.”

He was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but found the standard treatments – mainly psychotherapy and anti-depressants – were of little help. While searching for an effective alternative, Macie came across the website of Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). This not-for-profit group was sponsoring research into the use of MDMA, better known by its street name ecstasy, as a treatment for PTSD. He enrolled in a study that is currently looking at whether combined use of the drug and psychotherapy could provide relief for those with the debilitating anxiety disorder.

MDMA was originally developed by scientists at the German chemical and pharmaceutical company Merck a century ago, while they were investigating ways to stop abnormal bleeding. In the 1970s, a number of psychiatrists used the chemical to enhance communication with patients. The practice ended when MDMA became better known as a party drug, leading to it being outlawed in the US in 1985.

Evidence for its therapeutic efficacy was largely anecdotal. However, a small clinical trial published in 2010 suggested the drug can increase response to psychotherapy among people with PTSD. Now Rick Doblin, the founder and executive director of MAPS, hopes further studies, such as the one Macie is taking part in, will eventually lead to MDMA being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a new effective treatment option for PTSD. “Everywhere we go, what we’re told is ‘this is really important’, but the people we’ve spoken with were not high enough in the hierarchy to comfortably say yes,” says Doblin. He does, however, believe he is making headway. He recently had a meeting in the Pentagon to discuss his research (although he declined to identify the office on the record).

On trial

MAPS also funded the clinical trial published three years ago, which was led by Michael Mithoefer, a psychiatrist based in South Carolina. It involved 20 PTSD patients, the majority of whom had the disorder after being sexually assaulted, or being sexually or physically abused as children. Participants were given either MDMA or an inactive placebo during psychotherapy sessions, and were later assessed for symptoms of PTSD. Ten of the 12 (83%) given MDMA responded positively, compared to just two of the eight (25%) who took placebos.

Mithoefer’s interest in MDMA dates back to a career shift in 1991, when he moved from emergency medicine to psychiatry. “I was interested in experiential therapy, helping people shift their consciousness in some way,” he says. He became interested in MDMA's possible use in psychotherapy from anecdotal evidence reported prior to the drug's US ban. ""There were published reports, but no controlled research,"" he says. PTSD was beginning to rise in the public consciousness in light of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I thought it behoved us to take a careful look at whether these anecdotal reports of MDMA could be born out with rigorous controlled trials.""

Mithoefer is also running the trial that Macie is participating in. A group of 24 veterans and firefighters will take part in three sessions during which they will be given MDMA before undergoing psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that participants will feel less fear and be better able to talk about the traumatic experiences that caused their PTSD while under the influence of the drug.

One problem with the previous study was the use of inactive placebos. Those in the control group would have known that they were not receiving the active drug and this knowledge could have influenced their mental state. To get around this Mithoefer is giving those in the current study low, medium, or high doses. As participants will not know which does they have been given, he says this should effectively create double-blind conditions that would give the study greater validity. Results will be measured using a questionnaire-based PTSD diagnostic tool. The study is due to be completed next year.

Treatment options for PTSD are by and large ineffective, and so MDMA is not the only “non-traditional” treatment under investigation. At the Army’s Fort Bliss Restoration and Resilience Center in Texas, patients receive therapies ranging from acupuncture to Reiki, a Japanese spiritual treatment. In California, researchers at the Pentagon-funded Institute for Creative Technologies have studied the use of virtual reality as part of “exposure therapy” for veterans with PTSD.

Bad reputation

These days, researchers have no problems finding subjects for such work. It is estimated that the US military is diagnosing between 14,000 and 15,000 new cases of PTSD every year among deployed service members. “We have 400 veterans on a waiting list who have called us, and that’s without doing recruiting,” says Mithoefer.

Doblin thinks that getting MDMA through the FDA’s regulatory hurdles will only take eight to 10 years and $15 to $20 million – relatively speedy and cheap compared to what is normally required to license a new drug. “The FDA knows more about MDMA right now than any drug that they’ve ever approved in their entire history,” he says, pointing to a wealth of literature generated, ironically, by MDMA’s illegal status.

But whether the new research will convince critics, particularly those influenced by MDMA's reputation as a party drug, is more doubtful. Part of the problem is overcoming the stigma of hallucinogens, and some of the biased research that has been done in the past. Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, points to the studies conducted by Timothy Leary of Harvard in the 1960s. In a prison study, Leary claimed that hallucinogens combined with psychotherapy could reduce re-offending among prisoners, but those conclusions were later shown to be erroneous. Doblin published a follow-up study, highlighting problems with Leary's means of tracking re-offending in the long-term.

“It’s striking that even in the 60s and 70s people lined up on different sides on hallucinogens,” says Moreno. The lines are drawn pretty dark on various positions.”

It’s not just the recreational use and abuse of MDMA that raises concerns. There is what Doblin calls the “disastrous legacy of mind control experiments” at the Pentagon. During the Cold War, both the Army and the CIA experimented with using hallucinogens as a weapon. Particularly notorious was MK Ultra, a CIA project which experimented with the use of psychedelics for mind control, sometimes with unwitting subjects.

“That is in people’s minds,” says Doblin, adding that it has been sufficiently far in the past that it is not their dominant concern.” Doblin does say he was approached by a former member of the military who asked about the possibility of using MDMA, which fosters feeling of trust, as a tool for interrogating terrorists. “That was a scary thing,” says Doblin, who also expressed doubt such use would be effective.

The bigger barrier, Doblin says, is the fear of MDMA's recreational associations, and that it could be misused. Several researchers at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) turned down requests to be interviewed about Mithoefer's MDMA study. ""VA does not use ecstasy as a treatment for PTSD,"" said a spokesman in a statement. ""Nor has it conducted, nor is currently conducting, any studies into whether it could be used in such a capacity."" Ecstasy ""is an illegal drug and VA would not involve veterans in the use of such substances.""

For Macie, however, much of the debate is academic. He has taken part in one session of combined MDMA and psychotherapy as part of Mithoefer's study and already believes the approach has helped him. He does not see the drug as a magic bullet and recognises such treatment is likely to still require a great deal of effort on his part. “I don’t want you to think that doing it puts you in happy mode forever,” he says. “It’s hard work.”

It's back, now with even more pain.

Rep. Paul Ryan has once again resurrected his hugely unpopular Medicare voucher plan (they're calling it ""competitive bidding"" ), now with even more stuff to make it unpopular. Bowing to the reality that his numbers just don't add up to what he says will be a balanced budget in 10 years, Ryan has decided to break the promise Republicans made to protect people 55 and older from his cuts.

That's the promise he and Mitt Romney made on the 2012 campaign trail and the promise GOP Congress members ran on, and now some of them are ""furious"" with Ryan's reversal.



After agreeing to write a budget resolution that will balance the budget over the next decade, Ryan conceded that he might have to adjust the age to as high as 59. The dwindling group of middle-of-the-road House Republican lawmakers decried the potential change in age because the party for the past two years has repeatedly cited 55 years and above as the untouched generation. Some of the members are also facing challenging reelection races next year. “A lot of people had made commitments at 55. In other words, in the campaign [Republican vulnerable members] said it wouldn’t affect your Medicare for retirees or near retirees for those 55 and up ... and [if] this budget forces them to renege on that, that would be problematic for many,” said the GOP lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The handful of ""moderate"" Republicans (the ones who have to appear not quite as crazy as they really are because they're in tougher districts) aren't likely to be a big enough force in the party to convince Ryan to change his mind. He's got to make a stab at getting his numbers to finally work, and the only way he can do that, and get in all the tax cuts he wants, is by starving a few more grannies.

All of which could make 2014 just a little more profitable for Democrats, particularly if they can stave off any grand bargain that includes Medicare."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/22/fire-departments-volunteers-as-full-timers-under-obamacare-would-drain-budgets/,2013-12-22 00:00:00,[],Fire departments voice concern over role of volunteers under ObamaCare,"The backbone of small-town America's fire safety could be broken if the federal health care overhaul hits too hard.

Fire departments and other emergency squads say they are still waiting to learn from the IRS whether they will have to pay for volunteers’ medical insurance under ObamaCare and that having to cover such costs would really hurt many small-budget operations.

President Obama’s signature health-care law requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for them. However, whether the IRS considers volunteers full-time employees remains unclear, in part because some receive a stipend or other financial incentives.

“At this point, it’s pretty much wait and see,” Michael Berg, president of the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad in Virginia, told The Daily Progress. “We’re an all-volunteer organization. …. There’s a lot of speculation.”

Volunteer groups around the country -- which operate in more rural areas and rely largely on fundraisers and donations to buy fire trucks and other rescue equipment -- have gotten some bipartisan help from Capitol Hill.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta, a Republican, have sponsored legislation to exempt volunteer fire, medical and rescue personnel from full-time status.

“This is just another example of how ObamaCare was not well thought out,” Barletta said. “So, we’re left to try to pave over the potholes. And this is a big one -- possibly affecting fire stations nationwide,” Barletta said Dec. 11 upon introducing the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act.

He also said that classifying volunteers as full-time employees could result in “unbearable financial burdens” for agencies and is “threatening public safety.”

Barletta said he wrote the IRS in November requesting clarifications.

The legislation has support from the National Volunteer Fire Council and the International Association of Fire Chiefs.

“Agencies don’t have the resources to provide health benefits to their volunteers, and individual volunteers have no expectation of receiving such benefits from the agencies they serve,” said NVFC Chairman Philip C. Stittleburg.

The Obama administration this summer delayed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act’s so-called “employer mandate” until 2015. It was supposed to start Jan. 1, 2014, but was delayed to give officials more time to simplify the regulations.

The IRS has yet to give an official ruling. However, Treasury spokeswoman Victoria Esser recently told The Patriot-News of central Pennsylvania that the agency has received comments regarding the proposed regulations issued last December.

“We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer responsibility provision, 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code,” she said. “Pending issuance of the final regulations, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on their likely content.""

ObamaCare defines a full-time employee as somebody working 30 hours or more.

Among the lingering questions is how the IRS would count volunteers’ hours.

“Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone?"" Barletta asks. “Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner? These are all legitimate questions raised since ObamaCare has been forced on Americans.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/notre-dame-sues-over-birth-control-mandate-214953073.html,,[],Notre Dame sues over birth control mandate,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — The University of Notre Dame on Tuesday filed another lawsuit opposing portions of the federal health care overhaul that forces it to provide health insurance for students and employees that includes birth control, saying it contravenes the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in South Bend claims the Affordable Health Care Act violates Notre Dame's freedom to practice religion without government interference. Under the law, employers must provide insurance that covers a range of preventive care, free of charge, including contraception. The Catholic Church prohibits the use of contraceptives.

The lawsuit challenges a compromise, or accomodations, offered by the Obama administration that attempted to create a buffer for religiously affiliated hospitals, universities and social service groups that oppose birth control. The law requires insurers or the health plan's outside administrator to pay for birth control coverage and creates a way to reimburse them.

The Rev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, said that wasn't enough.

""The government's accommodations would require us to forfeit our rights, to facilitate and become entangled in a program inconsistent with Catholic teaching and to create the impression that the university cooperates with and condones activities incompatible with its mission,"" he said in a statement.

Notre Dame says in the lawsuit that its employee health plans are self-insured, covering about 4,600 employees and a total of about 11,000 people. Its student health plans cover about 2,600 students. The lawsuit says the health plans do not cover abortion-inducing products, contraceptives or sterilization.

""The U.S. government mandate, therefore, requires Notre Dame to do precisely what its sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit — pay for, facilitate access to, and/or become entangled in the provision of objectionable products and services or else incur crippling sanctions,"" the lawsuit says.

Story continues

Notre Dame argues that the fines of $2,000 per employee if it eliminates its employee health plan, or $100 a day for each affected beneficiary if it refuses to provide or facilitate the coverage, would coerce it into violating its religious beliefs.

Daniel Conkle, an Indiana University professor of law and adjunct professor of religious studies, said Notre Dame's arguments are similar those in a case last month where a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted the Pittsburgh and Erie Catholic dioceses a delay in complying with the federal mandates.

The Obama administration argues that the burden on the Catholic entities is minimal, Conkle said. Notre Dame and other Catholic groups say it's substantial.

Steve Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at Catholic University of America, said the administration's accommodations ""are sufficient to protect the Catholic conscience for administrators of these plans at Catholic universities."" But he said the lawsuits were still needed.

The accommodations ""really rest on the good graces of the administration and those good graces could disappear with a new administration,"" he said.

Notre Dame argues that it is not seeking to impose its religious beliefs on others, but that it just wants to protect its right to the free exercise of its religion. The lawsuit argues that the government could pay for contraception through the expansion of its existing network of family planning clinics or by creating a broader exemption for religious employers.

Notre Dame filed a similar lawsuit in May 2012. U.S. District Judge Robert Miller Jr. dismissed that case last December, saying the university wasn't facing any imminent penalty or restrictions because the federal government was reworking some of the coverage regulations.

The U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to consider two cases in which business have objected to covering birth control for employees on religious grounds. Hobby Lobby, a Christian-owned arts and crafts chain with 13,000 full-time employees, won its case in lower courts, while Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Mennonite-owned company that employs 950 people in making wood cabinets, lost its claims in lower courts.

About 40 for-profit companies have requested an exemption from covering some or all forms of contraception."

The plan, which emerged on Saturday, would also impose a one-year delay of Obamacare and a full repeal of the law’s tax on medical devices.

""The House has again passed a plan that reflects the American people’s desire to keep the government running and stop the president’s health care law,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement, adding, ""Now that the House has again acted, it’s up to the Senate to pass this bill without delay to stop a government shutdown.""

Even before the House voted, Senate Democrats pledged to reject the measure and the White House issued a statement vowing a veto in any event. Republicans are pursuing ""a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown,"" it said.

The Senate is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If so, a House GOP rank and file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades – or coming away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama.

Undeterred, House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on Tuesday. ""Obamacare is based on a limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people,"" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.

Another Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown. ""How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you?"" he said.

Apart from its impact on the health care law, the legislation that House Republicans decided to back would assure routine funding for government agencies through Dec. 15. Under House rules, the measure went to the Senate after lawmakers voted 248-174 to repeal the medical tax, then 231-192 for the one-year delay in Obamacare.

A companion measure headed for approval assures U.S. troops are paid in the event of a shutdown.

The government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands by House Republicans, who passed legislation several days ago that would permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding for the government.

It also contained significant concessions from a party that long has criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates on industry, in some cases far exceeding what Republicans have been willing to support in the past. Acknowledging as much, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said that as a conservative he had often found during Obama's presidency that his choice was ""between something bad or (something) horrible.""

GOP aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote, most portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would remain unchanged. That includes requirements for insurance companies to guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children to be covered on their parents' plans until age 26. It would not change a part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription drug expenses.

One exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage, based on religious or moral objections.

The measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and of a separate feature of the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for coverage from private insurers.

By repealing the medical device tax, the GOP measure also would raise deficits – an irony for a party that won the House majority in 2010 by pledging to get the nation's finances under control.

The Senate rejected the most recent House-passed anti-shutdown bill on a party-line vote of 54-44 Friday, insisting on a straightforward continuation in government funding without health care-related add-ons.

That left the next step up to the House – with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter.

For a moment at least, the revised House proposal papered over a simmering dispute between Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership, and tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing the health law that all Republican lawmakers oppose.

It was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has become the face of the ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a fundraising tool.

In debate on the House floor, Republicans adamantly rejected charges that they seek a government shutdown, and said their goal is to spare the nation from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the quality of care. The law is an ""attack and an assault on the free enterprise and the free economy,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas.

Democrats disagreed vociferously. ""House Republicans are shutting down the government. They're doing it intentionally. They're doing it on purpose,"" said Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland, as Republican lawmakers booed from their seats on the floor.

In the Senate, there was little doubt that Reid had the votes to block a one-year delay in the health care program widely known as ""Obamacare."" He said the same was true for the repeal of the medical device tax, even though 33 Democrats joined all Senate Republicans in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the year.

The 2.3 percent tax, which took effect in January, is imposed on items such as pacemakers and CT scan machines; eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and other items are exempt. Repealing it would cost the government an estimated $29 billion over the coming decade.

If lawmakers miss the approaching deadline, a wide range of federal programs would be affected, from the national parks to the Pentagon.

Some critical services such patrolling the borders, inspecting meat and controlling air traffic would continue. Social Security benefits would be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.

The new health insurance exchanges would open Tuesday, a development that's lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending bill to gut implementation of the law. ___

USA TODAY

Health care law says most companies must cover birth control

Owners of corporations object based on their religious beliefs

Legal fight for Obama comes on top of legislative%2C political battles

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court added a new legal challenge Tuesday to the legislative and political battles raging over President Obama's embattled health care law.

The justices agreed to consider whether for-profit corporations whose owners oppose abortion on religious grounds must abide by the law's mandate that health insurance policies include free coverage of government-approved forms of contraception.

It's the first legal challenge to reach the high court since it upheld the law 17 months ago in a 5-4 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts. While a loss for the government wouldn't strike down the law itself, conservatives still seething over Roberts' rescue of Obamacare say the case offers Roberts an initial chance to rule against it.

Beyond its attachment to the health care law, however, the legal challenge is significant in its own right because it will answer a fundamental question with far-reaching consequences: Can corporations pray? Until now, no court has granted religious rights under the First Amendment's ""free exercise clause"" to for-profit businesses.

The corporations whose lawsuits were chosen over some 40 others say, in essence, that they do pray. The cases were filed by Hobby Lobby, a chain of more than 500 arts-and-crafts stores with about 13,000 full-time employees, and Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Lancaster, Pa., woodworking business run by a Mennonite family.

Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma City-based company founded by David Green in 1970, closes on Sundays and funnels millions of dollars in profits to ministries. Its website proclaims its commitment to ""honoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles.""

To avoid promoting alcohol, for instance, Hobby Lobby doesn't sell shot glasses. And to avoid promoting abortion, it doesn't cover drugs or devices which it claims are capable of terminating a pregnancy, including the after-sex drugs Plan B and Ella and two types of intrauterine devices. The government and abortion rights groups say those drugs and devices only postpone ovulation.

Norman and Elizabeth Hahn operate Conestoga Wood with their three sons, and they ""integrate their faith into their daily lives, including their work,"" says their brief to the high court.

""Both cases represent a broad diversity in which families in America practice their faith as they try to earn a living, all the way from Mennonites making wood cabinets to the Green family operating a chain store,"" said Matt Bowman of Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Conestoga.

The health care law says companies with 50 or more workers that offer health insurance must cover contraceptives as part of a preventive care package for women. Churches and other houses of worship were excluded from the mandate, and some religious institutions, such as universities, were allowed to have insurers offer the benefit directly.

""We believe this requirement is lawful and essential to women's health and are confident the Supreme Court will agree,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""These steps protect both women's health and religious beliefs, and seek to ensure that women and families — not their bosses or corporate CEOs — can make personal health decisions based on their needs and their budgets.""

The law's defenders say the exclusions should not extend to corporations like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood. ""Corporations don't pray … they don't have a religious conscience,"" says David Gans of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal law firm and advocacy group. ""These are all human attributes that don't apply to corporations.""

Combined with smaller companies and those who did not change their insurance plans since the law was implemented, up to one-third of Americans are covered by exempt plans. But larger for-profit corporations must comply or face fines of $100 per day per employee, which could total $475 million a year in Hobby Lobby's case. An alternative -- dropping employee health insurance altogether -- would cost $26 million in annual penalties.

Hobby Lobby says that's a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed by Congress in 1993 to protect ""a person's exercise of religion"" from government intrusion. Conestoga Wood also alleges that the mandate violates its right under the Constitution to freely exercise its religious beliefs.

""As the federal government embarks on an unprecedented foray into health care replete with multiple overlapping mandates, few issues are more important than the extent to which the government must recognize and accommodate the religious exercise of those it regulates,"" Hobby Lobby argues in its brief.

The Supreme Court already has established that corporations have free-speech rights. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the justices struck down government restrictions on corporate and union political advertising.

But a generation earlier in 1990, the court ruled in an Oregon case that the government does not have to protect religious beliefs when they conflict with existing laws. That case led Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in an effort to tilt the balance back toward individuals.

Now comes the question that subjected Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to ridicule last year: Are corporations people?

Appeals courts have split down the middle, virtually forcing the Supreme Court to settle the matter. Two federal circuit courts have said private companies should be able to sidestep contraception coverage on religious grounds, including Hobby Lobby. Two have said the companies must comply with the contraception mandate, including Conestoga Wood. And one ruled earlier this month that companies cannot exercise religious beliefs in that way, but their owners can.

""The court took this case because there is a wide and rapidly deepening circuit split on these important issues,"" said Kyle Duncan of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents Hobby Lobby. ""People who run a commercial business also have religious liberty rights.""

The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Hobby Lobby in a case from Oklahoma, where the company is based. The court said the Obama administration ""has given us no persuasive reason to think that Congress meant 'person' ... to mean anything other than its default meaning in the Dictionary Act — which includes corporations regardless of their profit-making status.""

But Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, warns a decision for the companies could subject other forms of health care to religious freedom challenges, including end-of-life care and coverage for HIV/AIDS.

In a dissent this month from another decision against the contraception policy, Judge Ilana Rovner of the 7th Circuit appeals court raised similar warnings for stem cell therapy, unpaid family leave for gay parents and even traditional medicine, depending on company owners' religious beliefs.

The U.S. solicitor general's office warned in its brief asking the Supreme Court to take the case that a victory for the companies would transform the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ""from a shield for individuals and religious institutions into a sword used to deny employees of for-profit commercial enterprises the benefits and protections of generally applicable laws.""

While most Supreme Court experts had predicted the justices would grant the Hobby Lobby case, the court may have added Conestoga's challenge because that company is owned directly by a family, rather than a trust.

""It's a really significant case,"" says Josh Blackman, an assistant law professor at South Texas College of Law and author of a recent book on the constitutional challenges to Obamacare."

Jerry Brown’s claim that California has improved its mental healthcare for inmates enough to end 17 years of court oversight, a victory for prisoners’ lawyers who say they will use it to seek further sanctions against the state.

U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton’s 68-page decision is a blow to Brown’s larger ambition to halt court control of California’s entire prison medical program and to remove court limits on the prison population. Courts have cited overcrowding as the main reason the state has failed to provide basic medical and mental healthcare.

Brown has vowed to take his case for restoring state control to the same U.S. Supreme Court that less than two years ago said California prison conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

A spokeswoman for Brown’s corrections department called Friday’s ruling “unfortunate,” saying it failed to give appropriate weight to the state’s paid experts, who said adequate improvements had been made in housing and treating mentally ill prisoners.

Karlton tossed out that core evidence, saying it was based on “tainted” reports crafted in secret. He accused California’s lawyers of unprofessional conduct by allowing the state’s paid experts to question inmates about the care they were receiving without telling their lawyers. The questions were intended to bolster the state’s legal case, Karlton wrote.

“There was nothing unethical” about the state’s assessment, corrections spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman said in a prepared statement. “We will appeal this decision and are confident that we will prevail.”

Karlton found that “ongoing constitutional violations remain,” including failure to act on suicide-prevention methods recommended by the court’s special master and one of the state’s own experts. What gains California has made in reducing waiting lists for seriously ill inmates to receive psychiatric care “are new, and work remains,” he said.

The judge found climbing suicide rates, shortages of mental health crisis beds and mental health workers, in addition to inadequate treatment space, despite years of planning, amounting to what he termed “deliberate indifference.”

Court records show that Brown’s surprise Jan. 7 motion to end federal oversight had been in the works since at least late 2011. The motion triggered a 90-day deadline for a ruling, leaving inmate lawyers roughly 10 weeks to hire experts, tour prisons and build their opposing case and giving Karlton a matter of days to weigh thousands of pages of contradictory depositions.

Lawyers representing more than 32,000 mentally ill inmates said the governor’s failed effort may backfire on him. They said it reopened access to prisons and shed light on new problems.

Those include a mental ward where most of the psychiatrists have quit, the use of cages to hold inmates for therapy sessions and the isolation of mentally ill inmates in punitive segregation cells.

“We will be moving for additional relief to fix problems we weren’t focused on,” said Michael Bien, lead lawyer for inmates in the 23-year-old class-action lawsuit that triggered federal oversight.

The state’s experts contended that, after touring 13 of California’s 33 prisons, they found that conditions, while imperfect, met the minimum adequate care required under the U.S. Constitution and were continuing to improve.

Documents filed in the case provided a glimpse of the Brown administration’s thinking — that it was saddled with a judge who “hated” the state and with battles it couldn’t win against a court-appointed special master over 120 detailed aspects of care. In addition, Sacramento was paying $7 million a year to fund that scrutiny.

The court papers include a five-page December 2011 strategy memo written by Jeffrey Beard, the retired chief of Pennsylvania prisons hired as a consultant to the Brown administration. In the memo, Beard told state lawyers he believed California was close to making the case that the state met the standard for six basic areas of care.

A year later, Brown named Beard as his new corrections chief.
