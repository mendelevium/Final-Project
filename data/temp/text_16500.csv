(CNN) —

We already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo. Now we know they have no shame.

Some of them are deliberately mixing apples and oranges and trying to use the tragedy of the Boston Marathon bombing to scuttle efforts in Washington to achieve immigration reform.

All last week, my friends in the immigration reform community held their collective breath and hoped that – when investigators finally zeroed in on a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing – that person would NOT turn out to be foreign-born. Immigrants are blamed for enough in society; they need not be blamed for this tragedy.

Besides, from the perspective of the reformers, the timing couldn’t be worse.

A few days after the bombing, the Senate’s “gang of eight” unveiled what is the most significant piece of immigration reform legislation in more than a quarter century. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 is an expertly crafted, bipartisan compromise that has a real shot at improving the lives of millions of people and fixing a broken system.

Yet, because of unrelated events, the legislation could wind up hanging by a thread. Why? Because the prime suspects in the Boston bombing are immigrants: 19-year-old Dzhokhar “Jahar” Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The brothers are from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States. Tamerlan was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar escaped and was at large Friday until he was found in Watertown, Massachusetts, and apprehended by police.

According to what two sources told CNN, Tamerlan had been living in the United States legally on a green card. Dzhokhar first came to the United States as a tourist in the early 2000’s and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen just last year, on September 11, 2012.

There’s that infamous date again.

It’s worth noting that Americans started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on September 5, 2001, when President George W. Bush welcomed Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner in his honor.

Earlier in the day, both leaders told reporters that they wanted to fix the immigration system and match willing employers in the United States with willing workers in Mexico. The reform was supposed to include a pathway to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States.

Six days later, our country was attacked and the world changed. Immediately, immigration reform was put so far onto the back burner that it eventually fell clear off the stove.

Most supporters of immigration reform, including many Latinos, believe that this was immensely unfair. The 19 hijackers were from the Middle East, and they came to the United States legally, many on student visas. So why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from Latin America?

Now, here we are again. Earlier this week, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa – a vocal foe of immigration reform who has suggested the answer to securing the border is electrified fencing because, as he once said on the House floor, “we do this with livestock all the time” – suggested that the congressional debate on the immigration bill should go slow because the suspects in the Boston bombing might turn out to be foreign nationals.

That is just what happened. Was that a lucky guess? Or is that how this guy’s mind works – that every time something bad happens, an immigrant must be to blame?

On Friday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa jumped into the fray during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“Given the events of this week, it’s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,” he said. “How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the United States? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill?”

Also piling on was conservative columnist Ann Coulter, who has made clear over the last few months that she opposes immigration reform because she thinks it would lead to the “end of America” since Latinos are busy “having illegitimate children and going on welfare.” She marked the shootout in Boston, and took a poke at the Florida senator who is leading immigration reform efforts, by mischievously tweeting:

“It’s too bad Suspect No. 1 won’t be able to be legalized by Marco Rubio, now.”

Again, the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants, but they didn’t need to be “legalized.” They were already in the country legally. But, hey, why let facts in the way of a good screed?

In response, a spokesman for Rubio said in an e-mail to the Christian Science Monitor: “There are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened. Regardless of the circumstances in Boston, immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security. Americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Boston with the millions of decent, law-abiding immigrants currently living in the U.S. and those hoping to immigrate here in the future.”

Let’s hope that’s right, and that most Americans do see these tactics for what they are: desperate attempts to thwart reform.

Here is the predicament that the nativists and right-wing demagogues find themselves in, whether they realize it or not. They want to opportunistically use the fact that bombing suspects were foreign nationals to once again derail immigration reform. But, in doing so, they walk away from the table and wind up defending the current immigration system.

The Rubio spokesman had it right. We have to know who is in this country, and what their intentions are – whether they came legally or illegally. This is one of the things that immigration reform is about.

No reform plan is perfect, but the status quo is flatly not acceptable. We have to keep the debate going.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/obama-nsa_n_3403389.html,2013-06-07 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']","Obama Defends NSA Programs, Says Congress Knew About Surveillance","WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Friday forcefully defended revelations that the National Security Agency is collecting phone records and electronic communications, saying that Congress was fully briefed and the programs are limited in scope.

""The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""

""Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,"" he said.

News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.

In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. ""They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,"" he said.

He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. ""Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,"" he said.

""I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,"" he continued. ""I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.""

Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. ""I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,"" he said.

He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. ""I don't welcome leaks,"" he said. ""There's a reason these programs are classified.""

The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.

Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as ""professionals."" ""In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,"" he said.

Disclosure: The Huffington Post is owned by AOL, which has denied knowledge of the PRISM program."

Is Glenn Greenwald endangering America?

To listen to U.S. security officials, the columnist who revealed secret surveillance by the U.S. National Security Administration has exposed to terrorists the methods that the American government uses to prevent attacks.

Greenwald rejected and took issue with that argument in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Monday.

“I think that suggestion is so ludicrous that it’s actually an insult to the intelligence of the people at whom it’s directed,” he told Amanpour from Hong Kong, where the man who leaked intelligence on the NSA program is in self-imposed exile.

“Any terrorist that’s unaware that the government wants to [spy on them],” Greenwald said, “is a terrorist incapable of writing his own name, let alone detonating a bomb successfully on American soil.”

The identity of the leaker was revealed on Sunday as 29-year-old Edward Snowden, a contractor for the NSA with high-level security clearance.

Before Greenwald began publishing his articles in The Guardian, Snowden fled to Hong Kong, though his whereabouts are unknown since he checked out of his hotel Monday.

“I spent a long time trying to understand his motives,” Greenwald told Amanpour.

He said that Snowden had a choice of leaking information about the NSA program to a foreign intelligence agency or an adversary of the U.S., but chose instead to give it to the media.

“He felt like it was his duty as a human being to disclose it,” Greenwald said.

The American Government has begun a criminal investigation into Snowden’s leak.

“There are extremely invasive spying programs that the public still does not know about,” Greenwald said. “To the extent that we can shine light on them and bring transparency to them, consistent with national security, we fully intend to do so, and to do so as quickly as we can.”

The administration’s efforts at downplaying may also stem, in part, from a desire to manage expectations, since Snowden may continue to elude U.S. custody. But it’s clear that in the last several days, the administration has sought to de-escalate confrontations over his flight.

Snowden fled Hong Kong on Sunday to avoid a U.S. extradition request and landed in Russia. Since then, he has apparently been in a transit lounge at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport while seeking asylum in Ecuador.

At the beginning of the week, administration officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, were condemning Russia, China and Ecuador as repressive governments, comments that provoked pique, especially in Moscow.

Now, even as American officials continue their effort to get Snowden, Obama has made it clear that the administration wants to limit damage to its relationship with China, its largest trading partner, and Russia, which has leverage over Washington on the Syrian civil war, nuclear arms talks, the Iranian nuclear program and other matters.

U.S. officials also indicated that they would move carefully in trying to dissuade Ecuador from granting Snowden’s asylum request.

The Chinese and Russians appear to be of a similar mind. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants a scheduled September meeting of the Group of 20 nations to underscore Russia’s importance in global affairs, has been eager to wind down the controversy. He made that clear Tuesday, saying the Snowden issue was “like shearing a pig — lots of screeching but little wool.”

The Chinese showed their desire to put the issue behind them by signaling to Hong Kong authorities their wish that Snowden be allowed to leave for Moscow.

“China took a strategic approach … by getting rid of the problem,” said Yukon Huang, a China specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The U.S. move to shift the issue onto a legal track and further away from big-power politics is consistent with the way Washington tries to handle spy cases — with minimal publicity and private diplomacy — experts noted.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, made disclosures about large-scale surveillance programs directed both at foreigners and American citizens that have embarrassed the administration. The surveillance of telephone records and the Internet have drawn condemnations from governments, including China’s and Russia’s, that Washington frequently criticizes for authoritarian tactics and human rights abuses.

Obama said he would like to see Snowden, who faces three felony counts in the United States, in custody. But at a news conference in Senegal, where the president began a three-nation Africa visit, he sought to portray the pursuit of the fugitive as a routine law enforcement issue, far less important than the business the administration is trying to conduct with the two countries Snowden has visited so far in his flight.

In response to a question, Obama said he had not sought to contact Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping personally on the issue because “I shouldn’t have to.”

“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” he said. “I’m not going to have one case of a suspect who we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited.”

Advertisement

The case was of a kind that is “routinely dealt with between law enforcement officials in various countries,” he said. “This is not exceptional from a legal perspective.”

He waved off a question about whether he intended to try to block Snowden’s departure from Moscow, saying, “I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.”

Advertisement

Obama also suggested that the U.S. has little to fear from further disclosures by Snowden.

“In terms of U.S. interests, the damage was done with respect to the initial leaks,” he said. “We don’t yet know what other documents he may try to dribble out there,” but “on the other hand, what I’m also confident about is that the way we run these programs abides by the laws.”

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say they assume that Russian and Chinese intelligence services have already gotten everything Snowden took from the NSA.

“Everything he had in his head and on devices is absolutely compromised,” one former senior counterintelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters.

“There is a well-established and relatively active liaison between the Russian and Chinese intelligence services, to include training of intel officers. So I’m sure this is a cooperative effort,” the former official said.

Russia, though now with only a shadow of the power it wielded in Soviet days, has a unique ability to obstruct American strategic goals. And the White House is preparing for a potentially important Obama trip to Russia in September and strategic discussions with top Chinese officials in Washington in less than two weeks.

“No one has an interest in blowing the Russia meetings up over Snowden,” said Andrew Weiss, a former Russia advisor to President Clinton who is now with the Carnegie Endowment.

The administration has far less to fear from any confrontation with Ecuador. But conflict with the left-leaning regime in Quito, which relishes a chance to tweak Washington, could draw unwanted attention, and officials signaled that they hoped to keep the discussion muted.

Ecuadorean officials began Thursday defiantly, saying they were withdrawing from a 2-decade-old trade pact with the United States because it left them vulnerable to U.S. “blackmail” as they consider whether to grant Snowden’s asylum request. In fact, the program is likely to lapse anyway for reasons unrelated to the Snowden case.

State Department officials have warned that granting asylum for Snowden would have a “grave impact” on relations. But they add that they hope to avoid a dispute since the United States is Ecuador’s largest trading partner and accounts for 35% of its trade.

“We don’t want this issue to negatively impact our relations,” said Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman.

In a related development Thursday, Britain’s Guardian newspaper, which has published most of Snowden’s disclosures, reported that the NSA for several years had been collecting so-called Internet metadata of foreigners and Americans alike, including the “to” and “from” fields in email and IP addresses of senders that can reveal location.

The Obama administration halted the program in 2011 “for operational and resource reasons, and [it] has not been restarted,” Shawn Turner, spokesman for the national intelligence director, said in an email. A U.S. intelligence official said the program had been stopped because it wasn’t producing much.

Tom Price,"A comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally is ""highly unlikely"" to pass the Republican-majority House of Representatives, Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, said.

During a Christian Science Monitor breakfast meeting Wednesday, a reporter asked Price if a majority of House members could support a path to legality for immigrants similar to the provision in the bill currently moving through the Senate.

""I think at this point, that would be highly unlikely,"" Price said. ""Because I don't think there's a trust of our conference in the administration to enforce the current laws that are on the books as they relate to much of immigration. And not just this administration—it has been previous administrations as well.""

Price, who opposes the comprehensive approach taken in the Senate—which combines enhanced border security with a path to legality—pointed to the failure of the comprehensive immigration reform bill signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Despite promises at the time that the law would end the flow of illegal immigration, millions still reside in the United States outside the bounds of the law.

Price said that the Obama administration would need to prove that it can enforce current laws before he would consider supporting new comprehensive legislation. In the meantime, Price said he would rather Congress take a piecemeal approach.

""There's no trust at all. The first step in regaining that trust is living up to the promise that was made to the nation back in 1986, and that is controlling and securing the border,"" Price said. ""So until the administration is able to do that, I don't think that there's any trust that whatever could pass would be enforced or made certain that it would work in a positive way.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee in May approved its own immigration bill, which supporters hope will receive a vote by the full chamber by July 4. A bipartisan group of House members are still negotiating a version for the lower chamber.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the lead architects of the Senate bill, will attend a meeting of conservative House members to discuss the bill on Wednesday."

USATODAY

When attempts at immigration reform fail — as they so often have over the past two decades — the cause is always the same. People remember that the last major reform, in 1986, promised amnesty for undocumented workers in exchange for blocking new illegal immigration and delivered only the former.

So there's reason to look warily at the latest plan, which the Senate will begin debating this week.

But taken to extremes, demands for tough enforcement can be used as a tool for killing reform entirely. And that, unfortunately, appears to be the tactic of choice for some Senate Republicans, who don't want to lose Hispanic votes by opposing a bipartisan immigration bill but don't particularly want it to pass either.

Their plan is to set impossible enforcement goals that would have to be met before any of today's estimated 11 million undocumented workers could gain legal status.

One case in point is a proposed amendment to the compromise bill crafted by the so-called Gang of Eight senators. Written by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the amendment would turn the plan's 10-year wait for green cards for undocumented workers into a never-ending one.

Among its unrealistic goals is the adoption of biometric entry-exit screening systems at all international airports and seaports. This is a worthy effort, one that both parties have been trying to reach since 9/11. But progress has been stymied by the complexity of the task. And, looking forward, it's hard to see it being put in place any time soon.

The measure would also require that border agents be aware of 100% of all illegal border crossings and that they thwart at least 90%. These standards would be subject to interpretation by both the secretary of Homeland Security and the head of the Government Accountability Office (an investigative branch of Congress). This means that some future administration or Congress could throw a wrench into the plan.

The underlying bill is no slouch on enforcement. It would spend $5.5 billion over 10 years along the border. It would also set a goal of 90% apprehension in areas where most of the illegal crossings take place. After five years, if the goal had not been met, more money would be committed and border-state governors would be given a greater say.

The firm belief is that the goals will be met. The government is already spending $18 billion on immigration enforcement each year — more than on all other law enforcement activities combined. Illegal crossing over the U.S.-Mexico border has slowed to a trickle, and by some accounts it has even reversed as job opportunities south of the border have grown.

There is still much that needs to be done. The E-Verify system for checking applicants' status at the workplace needs to be fully deployed. And some form of entry-exit system needs to be phased in. But none of these things should be used as an excuse for ignoring other issues, including the need to bring some 11 million people into the mainstream.

Unlike 1986's political sleight of hand, this year's legislation is a tough, credible plan for preventing a new surge of illegal immigration. A quest for unattainable perfection should not be allowed to undo the good that it would achieve.

FBI has received aviation clearance for at least four domestic drone operations

By Craig Whitlock,

The FBI has received clearance from federal aviation officials to conduct drone surveillance operations in the United States on at least four occasions since 2010, according to public records and U.S. officials.

The FBI began seeking permission in 2009 from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones domestically and received authorization for its first operations a year later, according to documents released Thursday by the FAA.

The documents provide virtually no detail on where the FBI has operated drones in U.S. airspace, for what purpose or how long the missions lasted. But they shed some additional light on the origins and extent of the FBI’s secretive drone program, which FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III revealed Wednesday in Senate testimony.

Mueller told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI uses drones “in a very, very minimal way and very seldom.” He gave no other details, except to say that the agency has “very few” drones and “that our footprint is very small.”

The FBI, he added, is working to develop privacy-protection guidelines, a major concern for lawmakers who worry that drones could be used by the government or private companies to revolutionize spying in the United States.

Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, declined to say how many drones the agency has, where they are flown or how many surveillance operations it has conducted. He said the FBI always receives approval in advance from the FAA. “We don’t want to get into how many or the geographic locales,” he said Thursday.

In a statement after Mueller’s testimony, the FBI said it used a drone in Alabama in February during a seven-day hostage standoff. The documents released Thursday show that the FAA granted the FBI permission to fly three other drone operations in 2010 and 2011. The records were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights group based in San Francisco.

The FAA redacted the vast majority of the text, citing the need to keep law enforcement operations confidential. But the records suggest that in at least one operation, the FBI was flying a Puma AE, a lightweight drone with a range of about six miles. The Puma has a wingspan of eight feet and carries powerful infrared and electro-

optical cameras. It is made by AeroVironment, a California firm.

Drones, or unmanned aircraft, are generally prohibited from flying in U.S. airspace. The FAA has granted special exemptions to dozens of law enforcement agencies and universities, but authorization is generally limited to a confined geographic area and for a fixed period of time.

In June 2012, the Justice Department informed Congress that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had six drone helicopters in its fleet and that the Drug Enforcement Administration had “two robotic miniature helicopters,” but made no mention of whether the FBI had any unmanned aircraft.

The Transportation Security Administration has delayed a policy change that would have allowed passengers to carry small folding knives onto planes.

In a letter Monday to employees, TSA chief John Pistole said he decided to maintain, at least temporarily, a post-9/11 ban on knives after meeting with an aviation security panel. The policy change allowing knives had been scheduled to take effect Thursday.

Pistole’s letter did not say whether or when he might reconsider lifting the knife ban. Still, he defended easing the ban, saying the bombings at the Boston Marathon underscore the need for TSA to focus on more serious threats such as explosives.

Opponents of allowing knives on planes attributed Pistole’s reversal to “a huge backlash” from flight attendants, airline executives and lawmakers. Since Pistole announced his plans to allow knives, the TSA chief has even been pressured by the families of 9/11 survivors to reconsider.

TSA officials said Pistole made the decision Monday to consider the comments and suggestions of a panel of 27 aviation experts, including airline and airport executives, pilots, flight attendants and families of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

“So we can incorporate their input and to continue training requirements nationwide, I have decided to temporarily delay implementing the prohibited items changes,” he said in a letter to TSA workers.

The proposed policy change, announced last month, would have allowed passengers to carry folding knives with blades 2.36 inches or shorter and less than a half-inch wide, as well as pool cues, ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks, golf clubs and novelty-size bats.

Until further notice, the items remain banned from the cabins of commercial planes.

According to a survey of about 1,800 Americans released Monday, about 73% said they do not want knives in airplane cabins.

In a statement Monday, a coalition of flight attendants said it would continue to pressure Pistole to keep knives off planes.

“The United States has banned all knives from commercial flights since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for good reason: Knives were the terrorists’ weapons of choice in bringing down four jetliners and murdering thousands of Americans,” the group said in a statement.

Congressman Ed Markey (D-Mass), who has spoken out against allowing knives on planes, called the delay “a victory for the passengers, pilots, flight attendants and law enforcement officers who would have immediately been at risk of a knife attack.”

A retired airline pilot who flew commercial planes for 34 years said allowing knives on planes is a bad idea.

“A knife is a weapon, and why make others think we are softening our position?” said Barry Schiff, an aviation safety expert and retired captain for TWA.

Even though pilots are now locked in the cockpit behind metal doors, terrorists could use knives to threaten flight attendants or passengers as a way to force the pilots to open the cockpit doors, Schiff said.

“We’ve done pretty well without knives, and my thought, personally, is to keep them out,” he said.

Story highlights NEW: The Brazilian government does not plan to respond to open letter, an official says Snowden has agreed to testify via video to a European Parliament panel, sources say His open letter was posted online in two places, according to journalist Glenn Greenwald Snowden mentions the need for asylum

(CNN) —

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has written an “open letter to the people of Brazil” offering to help investigate U.S. surveillance of Brazilian citizens.

The letter was posted on the website pastebin and on the Facebook page of David Michael Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, according to a tweet from Greenwald.

In the letter, Snowden says he has told Brazilian lawmakers that he is willing to help investigate “suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.”

“I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so – going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!

“Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak.”

Morales challenges U.S. after Snowden rumor holds up plane

The Brazilian government does not plan to respond to Snowden’s letter, according to an official in the press office of the Foreign Ministry.

At this point, no new request for asylum has been received, so authorities also will have have no comment on speculation surrounding the possibility one could be forthcoming, the official said.

An initial request was received in July, but it was a letter sent not by Snowden himself, but by Amnesty International to several countries. Brazil said then that it was not going to respond to the generic letter.

Consternation in South America

Brazil has been in an uproar over reports of U.S. spying.

In September, Brazilian lawmakers said they planned to send a commission to Russia to speak with Snowden, who had allegedly leaked information about U.S. spying against the country’s president.

Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo called the situation “an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty.”

Last month, Brazil acknowledged its own past snooping. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed that Brazil spied on foreign diplomats inside Brazil in 2003 and 2004. Its targets included officials from Russia, Iran and the United States.

“I see the situations as completely different,” Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told the paper.

Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional

In his letter, Snowden, a former NSA contractor, writes, “Today, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their target’s reputation.

Opinion: Who really broke the law, Snowden or the government?

“American Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not ‘surveillance,’ it’s ‘data collection.’ They say it is done to keep you safe. They’re wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement – where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion – and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: they’re about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They’re about power.”

Snowden to testify to panel of European Parliament

Snowden has agreed to testify, via teleconference, before a civil liberties committee of the European Parliament, sources in the Parliament say.

Some within the Parliament opposed the invitation, but the majority supported the idea, the sources said. The testimony may take place in January, they said.

It’s unsure whether Snowden would testify live or would be pre-recorded, the sources said, adding that his testimony is expected to cover all aspects of NSA surveillance internationally.

Obama to meet with tech bosses after judge rules on NSA data-mining

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/us-citing-security-to-censor-more-public-records-analysis-finds/,2013-03-11 00:00:00,[],"US citing security to censor more public records, analysis finds","The U.S. government, led by the Pentagon and CIA, censored in the name of national security files that the public requested last year under the Freedom of Information Act more often than at any time since President Barack Obama took office, according to a new analysis by The Associated Press.

Overall, the Obama administration last year answered its highest number of requests so far for copies of government documents, emails, photographs and more, and it slightly reduced its backlog of requests from previous years. But it more often cited legal provisions allowing the government to keep records or parts of its records secret, especially a rule intended to protect national security.

The AP's analysis showed the government released all or portions of the information that citizens, journalists, businesses and others sought at about the same rate as the previous three years. It turned over all or parts of the records in about 65 percent of requests. It fully rejected more than one-third of requests, a slight increase over 2011, including cases when it couldn't find records, a person refused to pay for copies or the request was determined to be improper.

The government's responsiveness under the FOIA is widely viewed as a barometer of the federal offices' transparency. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Anyone who seeks information through the law is generally supposed to get it unless disclosure would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas.

The AP's review comes at the start of the second term for Obama, who promised during his first week in office that the nation's signature open-records law would be ""administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails."" The review examined figures from the largest federal departments and agencies. Sunday was the start of Sunshine Week, when news organizations promote open government and freedom of information.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that during the past year, the government ""processed more requests, decreased the backlog, improved average processing times and disclosed more information pro-actively."" Schultz said the improvements ""represent the efforts of agencies across the government to meet the president's commitment to openness. While there is more work to be done, this past year demonstrates that agencies are responding to the president's call for greater transparency.""

In a year of intense public interest over deadly U.S. drones, the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, terror threats and more, the government cited national security to withhold information at least 5,223 times — a jump over 4,243 such cases in 2011 and 3,805 cases in Obama's first year in office. The secretive CIA last year became even more secretive: Nearly 60 percent of 3,586 requests for files were withheld or censored for that reason last year, compared with 49 percent a year earlier.

Other federal agencies that invoked the national security exception included the Pentagon, Director of National Intelligence, NASA, Office of Management and Budget, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.

U.S. courts are loath to overrule the administration whenever it cites national security. A federal judge, Colleen McMahon of New York, in January ruled against The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union to see records about the government's legal justification for drone attacks and other methods it has used to kill terrorism suspects overseas, including American citizens. She cited an ""Alice in Wonderland"" predicament in which she was expected to determine what information should be revealed but unable to challenge the government's secrecy claim. Part of her ruling was sealed and made available only to the government's lawyers.

""I find myself stuck in a paradoxical situation in which I cannot solve a problem because of contradictory constraints and rules — a veritable Catch-22,"" the judge wrote. ""I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws, while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret.""

The AP could not determine whether the administration was abusing the national security exemption or whether the public was asking for more documents about sensitive subjects. Nearly half the Pentagon's 2,390 denials last year under that clause came from the National Security Agency, which monitors Internet traffic and phone calls worldwide.

""FOIA is an imperfect law, and I don't think that's changed over the last four years since Obama took office,"" said Alexander Abdo, an ACLU staff attorney for its national security project. ""We've seen a meteoric rise in the number of claims to protect secret law, the government's interpretations of laws or its understanding of its own authority. In some ways, the Obama administration is actually even more aggressive on secrecy than the Bush administration.""

The Obama administration also more frequently invoked the law's ""deliberative process"" exception to withhold records describing decision-making behind the scenes. Obama had directed agencies to use it less often, but the number of such cases had surged after his first year in office to more than 71,000. After back-to-back years when figures steadily declined, the government cited that reason 66,353 times last year to keep records or parts of records secret.

Even as the Obama administration continued increasing its efforts answering FOIA requests, people submitted more than 590,000 requests for information in fiscal 2012 — an increase of less than 1 percent over the previous year. Including leftover requests from previous years, the government responded to more requests than ever in 2012 — more than 603,000 — a 5 percent increase for the second consecutive year.

The Homeland Security Department, which includes offices that deal with immigration files, received more than twice as many requests for records — 190,589 new requests last year — as any other agency, and it answered significantly more requests than it did in 2011. Other agencies, including the State Department, National Transportation Safety Board and Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed worse last year. The State Department, for example, answered only 57 percent of its requests, down from 75 percent a year earlier.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services drove a dramatic increase in the number of times DHS censored immigration records under exceptions to police files containing personal information and law enforcement techniques. The agency invoked those exemptions more than 136,000 times in 2012, compared with more than 75,000 a year earlier. Even though USCIS is not a law-enforcement agency, officials used the exceptions specifically reserved for law enforcement.

The AP's analysis also found that the government generally took longer to answer requests. Some agencies, such as the Health and Human Services Department, took less time than the previous year to turn over files. But at the State Department, for example, even urgent requests submitted under a fast-track system covering breaking news or events when a person's life was at stake took an average two years to wait for files.

Journalists and others who need information quickly to report breaking news, for example, fared worse last year. The rate at which the government granted so-called expedited processing, which moves an urgent request to the front of the line for a speedy answer, fell from 24 percent in 2011 to 17 percent last year. The CIA denied every such request last year.

Under increased budget pressure across the government, agencies more often insisted that people pay search and copying fees. It waived costs in 59 percent of requests, generally when the amount was negligible or the release of the information is in the public interest, a decline from 64 percent of cases a year earlier. At the Treasury Department, which faced questions about its role in auto bailouts and stimulus programs during Obama's first term, only one in five requests were processed at no charge. A year earlier, it granted more than 75 percent of fee waivers. The CIA denied every request last year to waive fees.

The 33 agencies that AP examined were: Agency for International Development, CIA, Agriculture Department, Commerce Department, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Defense Department, Education Department, Energy Department, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Interior Department, Justice Department, Labor Department, State Department, Transportation Department, Treasury Department, Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Election Commission, Federal Trade Commission, NASA, National Science Foundation, National Transportation Safety Board, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service.

Four agencies that were included in AP's previous analysis of FOIA performance did not publicly release their 2012 reports. They included the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Personnel Management."

Senator Ron Wyden, an earnest and wonky Democrat from Oregon, instead saw opportunity to again sound his cryptic but insistent warning about the alarming scope of government surveillance.

For hours before a C-SPAN camera and a mostly empty chamber, he expounded about his concerns over the nine-year renewal of a broad Bush-era surveillance law, loading his remarks with references to Ben Franklin, colonialists and obscure semiannual intelligence reports.

“I do not take a back seat to any member of this body in terms of protecting the sources and methods of those in the intelligence community,” Mr. Wyden said. But he warned that those efforts “should never be a secret from the American people.”

Late Wednesday, the secret was exposed, bringing to light the scale of government collection of communication information in the name of national security that Mr. Wyden and another serious-minded Western Democrat — Mark Udall of Colorado — have been hinting at for years."

Dianne Feinstein says program info aided two declassified cases ""If they want to get you, over time they will,"" Snowden says U.S. officials say the program is overseen by courts and Congress Senators have expressed concerns about the scope of the program before

(CNN) —

A 29-year-old computer technician for a U.S. defense contractor leaked details of a top-secret American program that collects vast streams of phone and Internet data, American and British newspapers revealed Sunday.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” the source, Edward Snowden, told Britain’s the Guardian, one of the papers that broke stories on the program last week.

The Washington Post also disclosed Sunday that Snowden was the source on its stories.

Snowden is a former technical assistant for the CIA and has been working at the National Security Agency, the U.S. electronic intelligence service, for the past four years, the newspaper reported. He said he walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and has holed up in a hotel in Hong Kong in preparation for the expected fallout from his disclosures.

“I’m willing to sacrifice all of that because I can’t in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they’re secretly building,” he said.

Video: What did NSA want with Verizon data?

The Guardian reported Wednesday that Verizon Business Network Services had been ordered to hand over telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. An order from a U.S. court that oversees U.S. surveillance efforts backed up the demand, the newspaper reported.

Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of customer activities – including “audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents” and other materials – from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms.

Snowden said the NSA’s reach poses “an existential threat to democracy.” He said he had hoped the Obama administration would end the programs once it took office in 2009, but instead, he said, President Barack Obama “advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in.”

“I don’t see myself as a hero, because what I’m doing is self-interested,” he said. “I don’t want to live in a world where there’s no privacy, and therefore no room for intellectual exploration and creativity.”

Will he be extradited?

The first call for Snowden’s prosecution came shortly after his identity was made public, from Rep. Peter King, the chairman of a House Homeland Security subcommittee and a member of the Intelligence Committee.

“If Edward Snowden did in fact leak the NSA data as he claims, the United States government must prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law and begin extradition proceedings at the earliest date,” King, R-New York, said in a written statement. “The United States must make it clear that no country should be granting this individual asylum. This is a matter of extraordinary consequence to American intelligence.”

Though Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China, the former British colony has a free press and tolerates political dissent under a semi-autonomous government.

Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for “political” crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the “defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy” of either party.

James Clapper, director of the Office of National Intelligence, had no direct comment on Snowden’s admission, but noted, “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law.”

A law enforcement official told CNN the United States must charge Snowden before a process to seek his extradition can begin, adding that any talk of such action is “jumping ahead” of where things stand in the case.

The Justice Department declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the leak.

Leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress defended the program Sunday.

Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it helped lead to convictions in two cases:

– Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York.

– David Headley, who pleaded guilty to conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people.

“These programs are within the law,” Feinstein, D-California, told ABC’s “This Week.” And Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC, “The inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what Dianne and I know this program really does.”

“The instances where this has produced good – has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks – is all classified,” said Rogers, R-Michigan. “That’s what’s so hard about this.”

Obama defends NSA program

Clapper: Programs were authorized by Congress

Clapper’s office declassified some details of the programs, which it said were “conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress.”

U.S. officials said earlier that phone-call data isn’t looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terrorism, and only then on the authority of a judge. Officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas. And Obama tried to reassure Americans about the programs Friday, saying, “Nobody is listening to your telephone calls.”

Clapper’s office said PRISM was created in 2008, targets “foreign targets located outside the United States” and gets reviewed by the administration, Congress and judges. And Rogers told reporters Sunday that “there is not a target on Americans.”

Some shrug at NSA snooping: Privacy’s already dead

But Glenn Greenwald, the lead author of the Guardian pieces, told ABC’s “This Week” that the articles show the NSA hasn’t leveled with members of Congress who have expressed concerns about the scope of electronic surveillance. He said Americans need an “open, honest debate about whether that’s the kind of country that we want to live in.”

“These are things that the American people have a right to know,” said Greenwald, a lawyer and civil-liberties advocate. “The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and the way they exercise power in the dark.”

Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who has long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on Americans, said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week’s disclosures.

“Maybe Americans think this is OK, but I think the line has been drawn too far towards ‘we’re going to invade your privacy,’ versus ‘we’re going to respect your privacy,’ ” Udall told CNN’s State of the Union.

Udall is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of Americans’ phone records but have been limited in what they could say publicly.

Udall told CNN that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown.

“It’s unclear to me we’ve developed any intelligence through the metadata program that’s led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means,” Udall said, pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and Rogers that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records.

’I do not expect to see home again’

The Guardian reported that Snowden grew up in North Carolina and Maryland. He joined the Army in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident. He never completed a high-school diploma but learned computer skills at a community college in Maryland.

He started his career as a security guard for an NSA facility at the University of Maryland, then went to work for the CIA in Internet security. In 2009, he got the first of several jobs with private contractors that worked with the NSA.

In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Booz Allen said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. Reports that he had leaked American secrets were “shocking” and if true, “represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,” the company said.

Snowden told the Guardian that he left for Hong Kong on May 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned.

“I do not expect to see home again,” he told the paper, acknowledging the risk of imprisonment over his actions.

“You can’t come up against the world’s most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept the risk,” he said. “If they want to get you, over time they will.”

Obama and his top security advisers met with chief executives from 13 companies in the White House Situation Room to talk about how the government and private sector could improve cyber security, including the need for legislation.

The White House has elevated the issue after efforts to improve U.S. cyber defenses through new laws failed in Congress last year.

""I think we all agreed — and that included the administration and the president — that we want as light a government touch on this as possible,"" Honeywell International's David Cote told CNBC after the meeting.

""Flexibility is important, because this is the kind of threat that changes very quickly,"" he said.

The meeting came a day after U.S. intelligence leaders said for the first time that cyber attacks and cyber espionage had supplanted terrorism as the top security threat facing the United States.

Obama signed an executive order last month to encourage information-sharing, which most business leaders welcome, and voluntary security standards, which have been a point of contention.

But the executive action is not as strong as law and Obama has urged Congress to try again on legislation. ""There are ways that we can harden our critical infrastructure, our financial sector,"" Obama said in an interview with ABC earlier on Wednesday. ""They need to get this done.""

Obama took the unusual step of meeting with corporate executives in the Situation Room, the secure site in the West Wing basement where the president meets with national security advisers during crises.

The meeting included Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Wes Bush of Northrop Grumman, Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, and Nicholas Akins of American Electric Power Co..

""The threat is real ... there is a consistent, persistent threat here that we need to be concerned about as a country,"" Cote told reporters after the meeting.

This week, U.S. authorities said they were investigating reports that Obama's own family had been hit by hacking.

The president said in the ABC interview that he did not know whether reports were true that hackers had posted financial and personal information online about his wife, Michelle, along with other high-profile Americans.

""It would not shock me if some information ... among people who presumably have pretty good safeguards against it, still gets out,"" he said.

USA TODAY

Obama says no decision yet on retaliation%2C but limited response is under consideration

Public release of intelligence report meant to bolster case for possible military action

Administration careful to show difference from Iraq war

WASHINGTON--President Obama said Friday that the U.S. has determined with high confidence the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people, as the White House released a four-page report summarizing their case against the Bashar Assad regime.

""This kind of attack is a challenge to the world,"" Obama said. ""We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale.""

Obama repeated on Friday that he has still not made a final determination on whether the U.S. will carry out a punitive military strike against Syria, but a senior defense official told USA TODAY that military leaders are preparing for an imminent strike.

The U.S. military is ready to execute a strike immediately on the president's order, said the official.

In a brief appearance before reporters, Obama emphasized that he is only considering a ""limited, narrow act"" against Syria.

""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""

In laying out their intelligence report publicly, the Obama administration hoped prove that they have a preponderance evidence that would justify a potential military strike on Syria. Obama tapped Secretary of State John Kerry to detail the intelligence community's findings and announce the release of the report before he made his own comments.

""I'm not asking you to take my word for it,"" Kerry told reporters at the State Department. ""Read for yourselves the verdict reached by our intelligence community"" that the government of Syria was responsible for the attack.

The intelligence community believes with ""high confidence"" that the Assad government used chemical weapons in the Damascus suburbs based on human sources as well as intercepts of conversations by senior Syrian officials, according to the report and Kerry. Assad is the ultimate decision maker for the chemical weapons program, the report asserts, but stops short of concluding that Assad ordered the attack.

""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime's chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" said Kerry, referring to intercepts of conversations of Syrian officials. ""And we know that the Syrian regime elements were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking precautions associated with chemical weapons.""

Kerry added, ""We know that a senior regime official who knew about the attack confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime, reviewed the impact, and actually was afraid that they would be discovered.""

The Syrian regime has the types of munitions that were used to carry out the attack on Aug. 21, that left more than 1,400 dead, including 429 children, according to the report. The regime also has the ability to strike simultaneously in multiple locations.

The U.S. intelligence community has discounted the possibility that Syrian rebel groups could have been behind the attack, noting that it doesn't have the rocket and artillery capability that was used in the most recent attack.

""We assess that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons over the last year primarily to gain the upper hand or break a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold strategically valuable territory,"" the report said. ""In this regard, we continue to judge that the Syrian regime views chemical weapons as one of many tools in its arsenal, including air power and ballistic missiles, which they indiscriminately use against the opposition.""

With the release of the intelligence report and a telephone briefing for lawmakers on Thursday evening, the White House looked to bolster the case for taking action against Assad even as objections to a strike continue to mount in the U.S. and with the nation's closest ally, Britain, against taking military action.

Obama was also given a bolt of international backing on Friday, when President François Hollande of France announced his support for international military action against the Syrian government.

On Thursday, the British parliament voted to reject taking military action in Syria, even as the government published an intelligence document that detailed how it concluded the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical attacks on the outskirts of Damascus last week.

Skepticism about a potential strike among the American public and lawmakers also remains an issue that Obama has yet to overcome. Nearly 80% of Americans say Obama should seek congressional approval before taking any military action in Syria, according to an NBC News poll published Friday.

Kerry also acknowledged the specter of the long U.S. war in Iraq weighs heavy in the minds of the Obama administration and the public.

As a candidate for the White House in 2008, Obama ran as an anti-war candidate. Kerry also was highly critical of President George W. Bush in his unsuccessful 2004 run for the White House.

""The American people are tired of war,"" Kerry said. ""But fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility."" He said that ""history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly"" if the United States does not respond to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.""

The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the Syrian civil war that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a ""red line"" that must not be crossed.

The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.

But after last week's suspected chemical attack in a rebel-controlled suburb of Damascus, Obama has appeared to inch toward a stronger response."

Obama quoted the Al Qaeda leader during his wide-ranging speech on counterterrorism policy last Thursday in Washington. As part of his argument in defense of the lethal drone program, Obama suggested bin Laden himself deemed the strikes to be effective.

""Don't take my word for it,"" Obama said. ""In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden's compound, we found that he wrote, 'We could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight airstrikes with explosives.'""

It is without question that the strikes have killed key terror leaders, and have changed the way Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate. The bin Laden document Obama referenced said as much.

But the document -- one of several bin Laden writings published by West Point's Combating Terrorism Center -- showed bin Laden discussing how drones strikes have changed his organization's tactics, not necessarily how they have Al Qaeda on the run.

More On This...

The document, which refers repeatedly to the ""ummah,"" or Muslim population, says: ""The Ummah should put forward some, but enough, forces to fight America. The Ummah must keep some of its forces on reserve. This will be in the Ummah's best interests. The Ummah will use the reserve in the future, but during the appropriate time.

""In the meanwhile, we do not want to send the reserves to the front line, especially in areas where the enemy only uses airstrikes to attack our forces. So, the reserves will not, for the most part, be effective in such conflicts. Basically, we could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives!""

The document goes on to say that ""we still have a powerful force which we can organize and prepare for deployment.""

Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argued that bin Laden's full quote has a far different meaning than that conveyed by the excerpt Obama cited last week.

""When you look at the context of the whole statement, it doesn't support their story,"" he told FoxNews.com.

He acknowledged that the drones have killed senior terrorists, but said ""it's just more complicated than that.""

Joscelyn wrote in The Weekly Standard: ""The full quote actually supports a different argument -- that al Qaeda's 'reserves' have been removed from the drones' kill box. It is quite obvious that improvised explosive devices, car bombs, small arms and the like cannot take out unmanned drones. So, Al Qaeda has simply moved some of its forces elsewhere.""

Joscelyn said the ""selective citation"" speaks to a broader problem -- ""the president and his administration only see what they want to see in the fight against Al Qaeda and affiliates groups.""

In his counterterrorism speech, Obama said the ""core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat,"" while at the same time acknowledging Al Qaeda affiliates continue to threaten U.S. interests.

Obama vowed to put new limits on the U.S. drone program, while defending the need for it in an unconventional war.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" accused Obama of ""sounding retreat"" in the address.

""At the end of the day, this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine,"" he said.

Other lawmakers praised Obama for taking new steps to disclose details about the U.S. drone program.

""I am also encouraged that the administration is taking steps to improve transparency as it pertains to the use of lethal force, particularly when it comes to the possible targeting of U.S. citizens,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said last week."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A prototype shipboard laser will be deployed on a converted amphibious transport and docking ship in the Persian Gulf, where Iranian fast-attack boats have harassed American warships and where the government in Tehran is building remotely piloted aircraft carrying surveillance pods and, someday potentially, rockets.

The laser will not be operational until next year, but the announcement on Monday by Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of naval operations, seemed meant as a warning to Iran not to step up activity in the gulf in the next few months if tensions increase because of sanctions and the impasse in negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program. The Navy released video and still images of the laser weapon burning through a drone during a test firing.

The laser is designed to carry out a graduated scale of missions, from burning through a fast-attack boat or a drone to producing a nonlethal burst to “dazzle” an adversary’s sensors and render them useless without causing any other physical damage."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Sunday suggested that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has lost his credibility in fighting global terrorism.

McCain argued on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government's vast surveillance program is not ""necessarily wrong"" because it operates under court oversight. Paul, who appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" has taken the opposite position, calling the government's phone records monitoring program an ""extraordinary invasion of privacy.""

Asked to square the two positions by CNN host Candy Crowley, McCain said that Paul was wrong about the terrorism threat in the days before the Boston Marathon bombings. ""Just prior to the Boston bombing, he said the battlefield was no longer in America,"" McCain told Crowley.

McCain was referring to a Paul appearance on Fox News in April. ""It's different overseas than it will be here,"" Paul said in that appearance. ""Which gets precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans who say, 'Well, the battlefield is everywhere, there is no limitation.' President Obama says this. Some members of my party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the laws of war apply. It's important to know that the law of war that they're talking about means no due process.""

McCain isn't the first to suggest that the Boston bombings should serve to chasten Paul. A post-bombings Wall Street Journal editorial also took issue with the Kentucky senator's April remarks.

""Boylston Street sure looked like a battlefield on Monday, and so did Watertown on Thursday night,"" The Journal wrote in its editorial. ""The artificial distinction is Mr. Paul's focus on geography. The vital distinction for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the U.S., wherever they are.""

McCain's disagreement with Paul on foreign policy and terrorism was previously highlighted by Paul's lengthy March filibuster of President Barack Obama's drone program, a move that McCain dismissed as ""wacko.""

""Americans' suspicions have been aroused by ... the IRS, Benghazi [scandals],"" McCain acknowledged on Sunday.

But in an apparent reference to Congress, he said, ""I don't think the government should be briefed on every program like this. That's why we have intelligence agencies. It's a balancing act."""

Darrell Issa's criticisms of their work On Wednesday, White House released e-mails on administration response to attack

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama called on Congress Thursday to fully fund administration requests for additional diplomatic security measures in the wake of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The requests include increasing the number of Marine guards dispatched to protect facilities around the world, Obama said.

“I am intent on making sure we do everything we can to prevent another tragedy like this from happening,” he told reporters Thursday at a joint news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Obama’s entreaty to Congress comes amid continuing sharp criticism by many Republicans of the administration’s response to the September 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others.

One of the sharpest critics, U.S. Rep Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been engaged in a dispute with the co-chairmen of the Accountability Review Board over their report last year on the attack and the U.S. response to it.

Former U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering and retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen wrote to Issa to demand a public hearing to answer Issa’s criticisms, according to a letter obtained exclusively by CNN.

“The public deserves to hear your questions and our answers,” they wrote.

Pickering and Mullen chaired the Accountability Review Board convened in October by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to investigate the attack.

Their report found “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies” at the State Department leading to the attack.

But it also found no evidence of a breach of duty by any U.S. officials related to the incident.

Many Republicans, however, argue that the administration failed to strengthen diplomatic security in Libya despite deteriorating conditions there, failed to adequately to respond to the attack once it was under way and then misled the public about what had happened.

Issa has called the board’s review “a failure” and has asked for further investigations into the Obama administration’s response during the attack and its aftermath.

The dispute between Issa and the co-chairmen came to a head after neither Pickering nor Mullen attended a May 8 House Oversight Committee hearing on the attacks, sparking a heated back and forth about who was invited and when.

The rhetoric intensified Sunday during a highly contentious joint appearance with Issa and Pickering on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in which Issa maintained that the two “refused to come before our committee.” Pickering insisted that he was not invited despite expressing a willingness to testify.

Issa also suggested on the program that Pickering and Mullen meet with the committee behind closed doors so as not to create “some sort of stage show.”

But the two asserted in their letter that a public hearing is a “more appropriate forum” and accuse Issa of changing his “position on the terms of our appearance.”

“Having taken liberal license to call into question the Board’s work, it is surprising that you now maintain that members of the committee need a closed-door proceeding before being able to ask ‘informed questions’ at a public hearing,” they write.

Pickering and Mullen assert that since they are not witnesses but rather officials asked to serve on a review board, they should be permitted to testify in public.

“While we understand and respect that your committee has the authority and responsibility to review the Benghazi attacks, we ask that you similarly understand and respect that the Accountability Review Board bore its own authority and responsibility to review Benghazi,” they write.

“What the Committee is now proposing is highly unusual in the context of senior officials who are not fact witnesses but instead are reporting their own independent review.”

They have suggested a hearing May 28 or June 3.

On Wednesday, the White House released more than 100 pages of e-mails detailing the complex conversations between the CIA, State Department and White House in developing unclassified talking points that were used to underpin the administration’s controversial and slow-to-evolve account of the attack.

That account initially focused on an explanation – later proved untrue – that the attack stemmed from a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States. There had been such a demonstration in Cairo.

The White House and its congressional allies say the initial confusion and conflicting information was a result of the “fog of war,” not a deliberate effort to mislead the public about the source of the attacks.

Senior Obama administration officials contend that the e-mails demonstrate the process of developing talking points for members of Congress to use in media interviews was not focused on politics but rather on events.

For instance, some of the e-mails expressed caution about what should be said publicly during an FBI investigation while others centered on the strength of intelligence at the time.

“Collectively, these e-mails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House’s interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Thursday."

In a letter to congressional leaders, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said the administration had deliberately killed Anwar Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who was slain in September 2011 in Yemen, but had killed three other Americans inadvertently.

They include Samir Khan, an Al Qaeda propagandist who grew up in Queens, N.Y., and who was killed in the car with Awlaki, and Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, who was born in Denver and killed in Yemen two weeks later. The previously unknown fourth was Jude Mohammed, who lived in Raleigh, N.C., and was killed in November 2011 in Pakistan.

“These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States,” Holder wrote.

The development raises the stakes for the policy speech Obama is scheduled to deliver Thursday at the National Defense University. He is facing growing public pressure to explain the use of drone missile strikes to kill suspected terrorists around the globe, and to outline his evolving strategy against a weakened Al Qaeda.

Obama, who personally approves individual CIA drone strikes in some cases, has never publicly explained the legal framework his administration uses to select who is targeted and what evidence is considered and why. The highly classified program receives congressional oversight but no apparent judicial review.

The fact that drones have killed four Americans and that only one, Awlaki, was specifically targeted suggests the process is not as precise as officials have suggested.

“Our conservative data tells us a shot of directed energy costs under $1,” Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder said in a statement. “Compare that to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it costs to fire a missile, and you can begin to see the merits of this capability.”

The laser’s power also can be scaled down, presenting the Navy a non-lethal alternative to ward off threats such as pirates, terrorists and smugglers.

“Because lasers run on electricity, they can be fired as long as there is power and provide a measure of safety as they don’t require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships,” the Navy said.

The technology, called the Laser Weapon System, was developed by engineers and scientists from the Navy, defense industry and academia. It involves commercial fiber solid state lasers and has already successfully shot down a flying target (see the video above).

It will be deployed on board USS Ponce in 2014.

The announcement to utilize the laser comes as military researchers continue to try to make progress on directed energy weapons.

In 2011, the Navy had success with another laser system mounted on a warship when it fired and set fire to an empty motorboat as it bobbed in the Pacific Ocean. It was the first time in history the Navy pulled off the feat.

In what was once considered the stuff of science fiction, the development of laser technology has been fraught with setbacks.

Last year, the Missile Defense Agency’s airborne laser program was canceled after more than 15 years of development and $5 billion in federal funding.

The program involved a Boeing 747 jumbo jet equipped with an advanced tracking system and a massive laser gun on its nose to identify and obliterate enemy missiles as they blast off. But the program experienced a series of cost overruns and delays. It never went beyond testing.

The Navy’s desired targets with the Laser Weapon System are far smaller and slower.

Following next year’s USS Ponce demonstration -- which comes two years ahead of schedule -- Navy and Pentagon officials said they will continue to research ways to integrate affordable laser weapons into the fleet.

“We still have a long way to go, but this bipartisan movement is a major breakthrough,” he said.

The group described four main pillars: border enforcement, employer enforcement, the handling of the flow of legal immigration (including temporary agricultural workers and high-skilled engineers) and a pathway to citizenship for those who entered the nation illegally. Mr. McCain called the pathway to citizenship the “most controversial piece of immigration reform,” saying that the current situation amounts to “de facto amnesty” and that the illegal immigrants deserve a chance to live legally in the country and ultimately become citizens.

“We have been too content for too long to allow individuals to mow our lawn, serve our food, clean our homes and even watch our children, while not affording them any of the benefits that make our country so great,” he said. “I think everyone agrees that it’s not beneficial to our country to have these people hidden in the shadows.”

Mr. Schumer said that he and Mr. Durbin spoke Sunday evening with President Obama, who plans to deliver his own speech on immigration Tuesday in Nevada, and that “he couldn’t be more pleased.” Mr. Menendez met with the president Friday as part of a meeting that the White House held with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus."

As Eric Lichtblau reported in The Times on Sunday, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has for years been developing what is effectively a secret and unchallenged body of law on core Fourth Amendment issues, producing lengthy classified rulings based on the arguments of the federal government — the only party allowed in the courtroom. [...] As outrageous as the blanket secrecy of the surveillance court is, we are equally troubled by the complete absence of any adversarial process, the heart of our legal system. [...] Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, recently reintroduced a bill that would require declassification. It was defeated in December. In light of the national uproar over the most recent revelations, the leadership in Congress should push to pass it and begin to shine some light on this dark corner of the judicial system. We don’t know what we’ll find. The surveillance court may be strictly adhering to the limits of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Or not. And that’s the problem: This court has morphed into an odd hybrid that seems to exist outside the justice system, even as its power grows in ways that we can’t see.

Many people compare Edward Snowden to me unfavorably for leaving the country and seeking asylum, rather than facing trial as I did. I don’t agree. The country I stayed in was a different America, a long time ago.There is no chance that experience could be reproduced today, let alone that a trial could be terminated by the revelation of White House actions against a defendant that were clearly criminal in Richard Nixon’s era — and figured in his resignation in the face of impeachment — but are today all regarded as legal (including an attempt to “incapacitate me totally”). I hope Snowden’s revelations will spark a movement to rescue our democracy, but he could not be part of that movement had he stayed here. There is zero chance that he would be allowed out on bail if he returned now and close to no chance that, had he not left the country, he would have been granted bail. Instead, he would be in a prison cell like Bradley Manning, incommunicado.

Meanwhile, Daniel Ellsberg writes an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing leaker Edward Snowden was right to flee the country:Do you agree?

Greg Sargent thinks Democrats need to step it up when it comes to revising the nation's spying laws:



Progressives and Dems who continue to care about this issue can push Democratic leaders to vocally call for more transparency around these opinions and to get behind the proposal being pushed by a bipartisan group of Senators, including progressive Jeff Merkley and Tea Partyer Mike Lee — and a companion measure in the House — that would compel the Obama administration to declassify and release them.

The lawmakers said the FBI is still seeking to interview “persons of interest” in the United States who may know something about the bombings, or about the brothers’ actions, that could help in the investigation.

Since the capture of 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on April 19 and the death of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, U.S. officials have said the siblings appeared to have acted alone and were not part of a wider conspiracy.

But Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said it was too early to rule out the possibility that others were involved. He criticized what he called a “rush to judgment” by some in the Obama administration.

“I think given the level of sophistication of this device, the fact that the pressure cooker is a signature device that goes back to Pakistan, Afghanistan … and the way they handled these devices and the tradecraft leads me to believe there was a trainer,” McCaul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“Are they overseas in the Chechen region or are they in the United States?” he said. “In my conversations with the FBI, that’s the big question. They’ve cast a wide net, both overseas and in the United States, to find out where this person is. But I think the experts all agree that there is someone who did train these two individuals.”

Two members of the House Intelligence Committee said investigators want to speak with several people in the U.S. and others abroad.

“There are still persons of interest in the United States that the FBI would like to have conversations with,” said Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House intelligence panel.

“We’re looking at phone calls before and after the bombing,” added Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). Both appeared on ABC’s “This Week.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said investigators have to yet to find evidence pointing to a larger plot.

“There is no evidence at this point that these two were part of a larger organization, that they were in fact part of a -- some kind of terror cell or any kind of direction,” McCaskill said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It appears, at this point, based on the evidence, that it’s the two of them.”

On Saturday, a U.S. counter-terrorism official told the Los Angeles Times that Russian authorities had secretly wiretapped a 2011 conversation between a man believed to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother discussing the idea of jihad.

The Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, also intercepted a second telephone call between the mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, and another man living in southern Russia who has been the subject of a separate FBI investigation, the official said.

The vague substance of the calls was shared only a few days ago with U.S. officials investigating the April 15 bombing near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

http://news.yahoo.com/army-5-billion-waste-094500638--politics.html,,[],The Army’s $5 billion Waste,"In 2004, the Army decided to scrap the two traditional camouflage uniforms that had long been used by the military—one meant for woodland environments, another for the desert—and claimed to have come up with a universal pattern that could be worn anywhere and blend in with any environment. The $5 billion dollar experiment with the universal pattern is over as the Army is phasing out the uniform after less than a decade of use. But many soldiers and observers are wondering why it took this long and cost this much to replace an item that performed poorly from the start during a period when the money could have been spent on other critical needs, like potentially life saving improvements to military vehicles and body armor.

Less than a decade after the so-called Universal Camouflage Pattern, or UCP, was introduced the Army is back to the drawing board, set to announce a new camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by the more than million members of the active duty and reserve forces.

Evidence of the UCPs inadequacy as a combat uniform is easy to find—just look at pictures of soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan, they’re not wearing the UCP, which was deemed unsuitable for operations there, but a different uniform known as the MultiCam. In 2009, Congress responded to soldiers’ “concerns about the current combat uniform which they indicated provides ineffective camouflage given the environment in Afghanistan,” by passing a bill in the appropriations act requiring that the DOD “take immediate action to provide combat uniforms to personnel deployed to Afghanistan with a camouflage pattern that is suited to the environment of Afghanistan.” The result was the MultiCam. But that uniform, while it is currently worn in Afghanistan, was not a replacement but an interim substitution for the UCP, which is still the Army’s official uniform and the one worn by all soldiers not overseas.

Only 5 years after it was introduced the UCP’s failures had already become glaring enough to compel congressional intervention but despite the moratorium on its use in Afghanistan, it will have taken another 5 years for the Army to field its replacement.

Story continues

Eventually, after mounting criticism and reports of the uniforms problems, the Army started looking for something better. This time, instead of hoping for a universal, one-size-fits-all design, an Army source who wished to remain unnamed explained that the Army solicited designs from companies for patterns with three variations, one for the desert, another for woodlands and jungles and a third, traditional semi-wooded pattern similar to the one currently used by soldiers in Afghanistan. After several rounds of testing, four patterns with three variations for each, from companies in New York, Virginia and Alaska were submitted to the Army to choose a winner.

Critics say this has been a huge waste of money.

Last year, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, issued a report taking the Army to task for spending $5 billion on UCP-covered uniforms and field equipment, only to spend an estimated $4 billion replacing them with whatever design it picks next. The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center, which does research and development on things like food, clothing, shelter for the military, conducted two studies on the Universal Camouflage Pattern, once in 2006 and again in 2009, both times finding that the UCP’s performance came up short when compared to other, more popular camouflages, like the Marine Corps desert pattern or the MultiCam. Natick scientists also went on record alleging that the Army had already selected the UCP before testing on it was completed and a full evaluation could be made of its performance compared to other designs.

Representatives from Natick did not return requests for comment on this story and the Government Accountability Office is currently closed due to the government shutdown.

But these reports only reinforce the views expressed by, arguably the most important critics of the Army’s near-decade long quest for the perfect uniform: the soldiers who have to wear them.

During former Army Officer Matt Gallagher’s 15-month deployment to Iraq from 2007-2009, he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern. In an attempt to blend in with all kinds of environments, the pattern instead wound up sticking out everywhere, its grey, gravel design that only a help to soldiers hoping to blend in with a parking lot. Gallagher said his soldiers would call the uniform pajamas, “both a testament to its comfort and its inability to look right on anyone, no matter their build.” But Gallagher found that the biggest concern with the UCP in Iraq was shoddy velcro.

“On a night raid, if it gets caught on a wire or something, it would make a crunchy sound that might alert insurgents to a soldier’s location,” he said. “That wouldn’t happen with just cloth.”

Army Sergeant Matt Pelak laughs at the mention of the universal camouflage pattern.

“It is one of the things that drives me craziest about the army I have to admit,” he told The Daily Beast. We started rolling it out in ‘05 and everyone was baffled by it.”

While Pelak admits there were some upsides to the design, such as easy-to-access pockets, his complaints outweighed the positives.

“Even currently, in my unit that I’m in now, we wear the normal uniform, the UCP when we’re back on base, but when we go in the field we wear MultiCam,” he said. “We have to carry two uniforms around, one that functions properly and one that’s merely administrative.”

Pelak points out this is hardly the first time the Army has spent billions of dollars on insufficient equipment just to spend more money to replace it, recalling the $20 billion Future Combat Systems program that launched in 2003 to develop a fleet of universally used lightweight armored vehicles and was canceled in 2009, ultimately considered a failure.

“It’s as ridiculous as buying 20 million humvees to go to war in that weren’t armored and then when the war started they had to build all new humvees that were bullet proof,” he said. “It’s that absurd.”

Pelak is not hesitant to admit that, within the ranks, the seemingly unnecessary and wasteful uniform program smells like “a giant conspiracy.”

“People in the military associate certain projects with nepotism, a Good Old Boy network,” Pelak said. “Maybe someone’s brother owns the company that designs the uniforms, or he’s on the Defense Appropriations Committee. No one knows exactly, but there are a lot of theories that all involve some sort of cronyism or backhand deal.”

If it were up to Gallagher, the billions that have been spent on two rounds of designing, testing, issuing new uniforms would instead go to finishing a water treatment plant that was started when he was in Iraq. “The local citizens need that treatment plant far more than we need a new batch of uniforms,” he said.

Neither Gallagher nor Pelak are sure that the ambitious goal of designing a universally functional pattern is realistic, but they both agree that the MultiCam design or the Desert Camouflage Uniform, are the best options they’ve been given so far.

For his part, Pelak would like to see less money spent designing uniforms and more money spent on better quality field equipment, such as more durable boots and lighter backpacks.

“It took 12 years to develop body armor for women,” he said. ‘I thought that was a joke when they announced body armor for women at the end of both wars and that’s absolutely needed. Not a lower budget version of a backpack you can’t even jump out of an airplane with.”

Unfortunately, Gallagher said, “What’s best for soldiers in the field is usually not a primary decision-maker. This is all about defense industry contracts, and just one example of the labyrinth that is that messy, nepotistic world.”

The Army, however, downplays the conspiracy theory. “It’s not like someone pulled the UCP out of their posterior and said let’s use it,” said the unnamed Army source. “They actually did a test and it performed pretty well, but as you can imagine, anything that’s universal doesn’t work that well in all situations.”

The Army source’s claim that the UCP tested well is contradicted by two different studies conducted by Natick showing that the MultiCam outperformed the UCP in various environments and the statements made by Natick scientists accusing the military of selecting the UCP before the full testing on it was complete.

The same source also insists the fuss over wasted money is overblown. “It’s like if you spent $5 billion on Hanes t-shirts and then 5 years later decided you should have bought Under Armor,” he said. “It’s not like you wasted money on those shirts because you got use out of them. We used those uniforms for their lifespan.”

The criticism made by many soldiers and Army watchdogs is that clothing that costs $5 billion dollars and is made for Soldiers going into combat ought to be of higher quality and last longer than a Hanes t-shirt. Despite the Army’s initial claims about fielding a universal uniform of the future, the UCPs nine-year lifespan is less than half the length of its considerably less expensive predecessor, the BDU uniform, which lasted for two decades. What’s more, the UCP wasn’t even worn by soldiers in Afghanistan during the last four years of its duration.

Over the past decade the Army has utilized four different uniforms, with each representing a considerable expenditure and investment of time and resources that could have been applied to other commonly cited needs, like upgrades to field equipment and improvements to tactical vehicles.

Whether the current quest for the consummate camouflage will prove time and money well spent or yet another waste remains to be seen. In the meantime, Pelak said, “We’re stuck with a uniform we can’t wear in the field.”

Over the next two decades, officials published 534 maps of active earthquake faults. New construction was prohibited on top of these fissures because previous quakes showed that buildings could be torn apart during violent shaking.

But the mapping campaign has slowed to a crawl — with many dangerous faults still undocumented.

Since 1991, only 23 have been drawn. Because of budget cuts, none were completed between 2004 and 2011, according to records reviewed by The Times.

State officials said there are still about 300 maps to draw and even more to revise — including some in heavily populated areas of Southern California. That represents about 2,000 miles of faults statewide.

The slow pace affects public safety. The ban on building atop faults is enforced only for those formally mapped by the state; the regulations don’t cover faults not on California’s official map.

It has become an issue in recent months because of several new developments planned along the Hollywood fault, which runs through the heart of the famed entertainment district. A high-rise development has been approved by the Los Angeles City Council along the fault area, and another large mixed-use project nearby is already under construction.

State law requires new buildings located near faults mapped by the state to perform extensive testing to prove their structures are not on top of the fissures.

But the Hollywood fault has not been officially mapped, even though the state has known of its existence for decades.

The state geologist’s office said it hopes to complete mapping the Hollywood fault by 2014. After that, officials want to concentrate on the Santa Monica fault in the Westside. Officials are also concerned about several other zones they believe need further seismic research, including San Diego Harbor, Yorba Linda, the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, Indio, Napa County and South Lake Tahoe.

The state geologist’s budget has dropped from $9.1 million in 2001 to $2.9 million for the current fiscal year. State geologist John Parrish said his office scraped up funding from its existing budget to restart the mapping program last year, though he said progress has been slow.

“We try to perform as best we can do,” Parrish said.

Many earthquake faults have already been extensively researched by scientists at places such as USC, Caltech and the University of California. When creating a map, the state reviews all this outside research and draws a roughly quarter-mile zone around the fault. Under the state’s Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning act, developers in that zone must prove their structure does not sit on top of the active faults.

The 557 maps the state has completed represent various parts of different fault lines, including such well-known ones as the San Andreas, Hayward and Newport-Inglewood.

Experts say it’s crucial to complete the mapping to keep new structures away from dangerous areas straddling faults.

“Then there’s no mistake [about] the red line,” said retired state geologist Robert Sydnor. “It helps at the political level: the city council and the mayor cannot somehow override” it.

James Dolan, a USC earth sciences professor who has experience mapping faults, recalled driving through the Westside when he was doing research on the Santa Monica fault 20 years ago. “I was stunned to see, either right next to or on top of where I was mapping the fault, a big building in excavation,” he said.

He called around and found out the fault had not been officially mapped by the state, so the property was not covered by the law.

Seismic safety experts have long studied the destruction caused above faults when big quakes strike. But the Sylmar quake reinforced the risks to officials.

One side of the San Fernando fault moved as much as 8 feet from the other side. Many homes and commercial buildings were severely damaged by the ground fracturing. About 80% of the buildings along the fault suffered severe to moderate damage.

The law applies to new construction along faults. But the discovery of fissures has led some to take action. Los Angeles Southwest College demolished two buildings in 1991 that straddled the Newport-Inglewood fault. The Los Angeles Unified School District tore down a portion of the new Belmont Learning Center after finding that a fault ran underneath it.

In Hayward, the original City Hall sits on the Hayward fault and has slowly been damaged by earth movement. The city abandoned the building after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Between the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake and the 1994 Northridge quake, some cities stepped up production of their own fault maps. But Parrish said that city mapping has now essentially stopped.

In the case of the Hollywood fault, The Times found the city’s map incomplete. It does not include some sections of the fault drawn in maps published in scientific journals and by federal and state agencies.

Back in the 1970s, the state began its mapping by focusing on faults with recent histories of major ruptures, such as the San Andreas, which caused both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the Loma Prieta quake. By contrast, the Hollywood fault is capable of producing a 7.0 earthquake but hasn’t ruptured in modern L.A. history.

Parrish said state officials also had to pay special attention to mapping areas where an earthquake could cause soil to liquefy into mud. The dangers of liquefaction became apparent in 1989, when parts of San Francisco’s Marina district were destroyed.

Still, Parrish said there are many faults in populated areas that need to be mapped.

“If you don’t know what’s there, then it’s easy to just ignore it,” he said. “That’s why the Legislature set it up that they be zoned — to make local planning departments aware of these high-hazard areas.”

The landmark earthquake law that started the mapping was co-written by the late state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who was considered a champion of seismic safety.

His wife, Elaine Alquist, recently retired after serving in the state Senate. Fault mapping took a back seat during the state’s long financial crisis of the last decade, but Alquist said she believes now is the time for the Legislature to begin investing again.

“We have a history in California and in America of not doing things to take care of issues until somebody dies,” Alquist said. “It would be a crying shame that we have not updated our process for mapping fault lines.... We need to put money into this. We need to know exactly where the fault lines are.”

Brennan, President Obama’s nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, about the secrecy of the strikes, their legal basis and the reported backlash they have produced in Pakistan and Yemen.

Adding a new element to the roiling debate, the committee’s chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she would review proposals to create a court to oversee targeted killings. She gave no details but said such a court would be analogous to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees eavesdropping on American soil.

Mr. Brennan was noncommittal, noting that lethal operations are generally the sole responsibility of the executive branch. But he said the administration had “wrestled with” the concept of such a court and called the idea “certainly worthy of discussion.”

On the same day two other administration officials, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a plan they had supported to arm Syrian rebels had been rejected by the White House, the notably aggressive questioning Mr. Brennan received seemed to underscore the increased scrutiny Mr. Obama’s national security policies are facing as he begins his second term."

The Federal Aviation Administration announced the selection of sites in Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.

California, vying to become the Silicon Valley of robotic aircraft, was among the losers in the 24-state competition.

“These test sites will give us valuable information about how best to ensure the safe introduction of this advanced technology into our nation’s skies,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in a statement.

In 2012, Congress directed the FAA to draw up rules for incorporating the remotely piloted aircraft in U.S. airspace by 2015.

TIMELINE: The year in politics

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta has estimated that 7,500 small drones could be aloft within five years.

The remotely piloted aircraft could be used for activities such as spotting wildfires, helping police track criminal suspects, scouting film locations and inspecting pipelines.

California was thought to be a favorite in the competition, considering it is home to the nation’s major drone makers, such as AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of Poway, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., which builds drones in Palmdale.

Huerta said in a call with reporters that the agency considered factors such as geographic and climatic diversity, availability of ground infrastructure, the type of proposed research, the aviation experience of the applicants and the volume of air traffic near the test sites.

He declined to say what the agency found lacking in the losing bids until FAA officials can meet with the unsuccessful bidders. He said those states not chosen will be debriefed in the coming days.

“Safety continues to be our first priority as we move ahead,’’ he said, citing the need to ensure that unmanned aircraft can detect and avoid other aircraft.

Those bidding for the test sites -- in many cases alliances of economic development groups, universities and aerospace companies -- believe that if they land a test site, drone manufacturers will follow. Currently, drones are not allowed to fly in the U.S. except with special permission from the FAA.

The testing comes amid concerns among the public and lawmakers that greater use of drones will violate privacy rights.

Huerta, acknowledging sensitivity to privacy concerns, said the agency will require test-site operators to comply with laws protecting an individual’s right to privacy.

Michael Toscano, president and chief executive of the Assn. for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, called the FAA announcement an “important step toward recognizing the incredible economic and job creation potential this technology brings.’’

Huerta said he expects the first test site to begin operating within 180 days.

Cpl. Nathan Kemnitz, who was gravely wounded in 2004 from a roadside bomb in Iraq, has limited use of his right arm and is incapable of lifting it above his head, according to the website.

During a recent trip to the state capitol building in Sacramento, Calif. -- where Kemnitz was being honored as his legislative district’s veteran of the year -- the retired Marine was reportedly asked to remove his dress shirt.

He was also asked by TSA workers at Sacramento International Airport to lift his arms above his head during a full-body scan. Kemnitz could not comply with either request, telling Military Times, ""My right arm doesn’t work. It’s a lot of hassle for me to do that.""

Kemnitz's travel partner, Patricia Martin, was outraged following the incidents and wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to express her anger.

“What does a uniform and heroism represent if our own citizens — in this case employees of the TSA and security personnel — have no regard for them?” Martin reportedly wrote.

""I feel so strongly that you need to know just how shamefully even a Purple Heart recipient/disabled veteran can be treated by some TSA and security employees,"" she said, according to the website.

TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein said in a statement Monday that ""Our intent is to treat all injured service members and veterans with the dignity they deserve. As always, all passengers with disabilities and medical conditions are eligible for screening procedures sensitive to their particular disability, medical condition or other unique medical circumstance.

“Transportation Security Officers have to resolve any anomaly detected at the checkpoint,"" Feinstein said. ""As is standard procedure for all passengers, if travelers alarm when passing through a metal detector or an advanced imaging technology (AIT) unit, additional screening is required in order to resolve that anomaly.""

""Wounded Warriors, members of the military and veterans are all required to place their carry-on items on the conveyor belt and in bins prior to passing through either a metal detector or AIT unit,” he said.

The modified pat-down of Kemnitz at the airport lasted about six minutes. At no time did he complain or express any annoyance about the inspection, according to the TSA.

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday.

Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi Initial tests on those envelopes detected the deadly poison ricin; additional tests under way

(CNN) —

An arrest has been made in connection with possibly contaminated letters sent to President Barack Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, the Department of Justice said Wednesday.

Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested by the FBI at his home in Corinth, Mississippi, the department said in a statement.

Discovered Tuesday, the letters were addressed to Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and to Obama. The justice department release said a third letter was sent to a Mississippi justice official.

The letters to Wicker and Obama were stopped at a government mail-screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin.

Because initial tests can be “inconsistent,” the envelopes have been sent off for additional tests, an FBI statement said. The FBI does not expect to receive results from the tests until Thursday, federal law enforcement sources told CNN.

The letters read: “To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.”

They were signed “I am KC and I approve this message,” a source said.

Reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also came into two Senate office buildings late Wednesday morning. Capitol Police evacuated the first floor of the Hart Senate Office Building for more than an hour and questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes, but the man was not taken into custody.

“It just reminds you that with public service comes the real possibility that you could be a target,” said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. “But on the other side of it, we have an excellent police force, and I think they’ll get to the bottom of it.”

What is ricin?

Beyond Washington, suspicious letters spotted

Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi, told CNN Wednesday night that she received an envelope with a suspicious substance and a letter similar to the ones sent to the offices of Obama and Wicker.

Last Wednesday, the judge received and opened a typewritten letter – postmarked from Memphis, without a return address – that included “suspicious content,” Lee County Sheriff Jim Johnson told reporters. The letter had “great consistencies and similarities” to the letters sent to Obama and Wicker, he said. Investigators were testing the contents of the letter to determine whether ricin was inside, he said.

Holland told CNN the letter originally tested negative for ricin but was being retested Wednesday. Local authorities were awaiting the test results to determine whether to file state charges, Johnson said.

“The letter was handled, the chemical was handled by several different individuals in our justice court system,” Johnson said, but added that “we do not have any reason to believe that anyone’s life is in danger.”

Investigators are trying to determine whether suspicious letters found at Senate offices elsewhere in the country came from the same source, federal law enforcement sources said.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said one of his home-state offices received a “suspicious-looking” letter and alerted authorities. “We do not know yet if the mail presented a threat,” said Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A staffer for Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake flagged “suspicious letters” at the freshman Republican’s Phoenix office, Flake spokeswoman Genevieve Rozansky said in a statement, but “no dangerous material was detected in the letters.”

Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Jacobs said the envelope contained some type of powder. The person who initially found the envelope is being treated at a Phoenix-area hospital for a pre-existing condition and stress from the event, and others in the immediate vicinity were examined as well.

In a statement issued Wednesday, the FBI said it has no indication of a connection between the tainted letters and Monday’s bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. But the discoveries further heightened security concerns at a time when Congress is considering politically volatile legislation to toughen gun laws and reform the immigration system.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president had been briefed on the letters.

“Obviously, he understands and we all understand that there are procedures in place, as the FBI has said. There are – there is is a process in place that ensures that materials that are suspicious or substances that are found to be suspicious at remote locations are then sent for secondary and more intense testing, and that process is under way now,” Carney said.

A Texas chiropractor’s words in the spotlight

While authorities in Washington investigated the letters, the wife of a Texas chiropractor said the wording in them caught her by surprise.

The phrase used in the letters is something chiropractor John Raymond Baker once said and has been widely quoted online, his wife, Tammy Bennett Baker, told CNN.

On Wednesday, she sounded surprised when told by CNN that the wording was included in the letters under scrutiny in Washington. She said she was not aware of the letters and that the phrase refers to her husband’s general philosophy of care. She said their office phone started ringing frequently Wednesday afternoon, and it was “kind of freaking out our other employee.”

A 2006 post on a blog for Baker’s office says the comment originally was a criticism of insurance companies. Since then, the site says, it “has been a quote that has been picked up and quoted (sometimes without attribution) around the net” and “people are using it about all kinds of injustices.”

The letter sent to Wicker had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides Tuesday. Wicker has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.

A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin on the letter addressed to Wicker after initial field tests also indicated the poison was present, according to Gainer. However, the FBI said additional testing was needed because field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results.

“Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,” according to the bureau.

A law enforcement source said further tests would be conducted at the Army’s biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

After the arrest was announced Wednesday night, Wicker released a statement thanking “the men and women of the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police for their professionalism and decisive action in keeping our family and staff safe from harm.” His offices in Mississippi and Washington “remain open for business to all Mississippians,” Wicker said in the statement.

Mail for members of Congress and the White House has been handled at offsite postal facilities since the 2001 anthrax attacks, which targeted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota.

Senate mail service shut down

Senators were told Tuesday that the mail facility would be temporarily shut down “to make sure they get everything squared away,” Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon.

“The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,” she said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also praised the postal workers and law enforcement officers for “preventing this threat before it even reached the Capitol.”

“They proved that the proactive measures we put in place do, in fact, work,” he said.

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms – an amount the size of the head of a pin – can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed.

It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction.

Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later.

A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified it in a letter in a Senate mail room that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist’s office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.

Lindsey Graham reiterated his pledge to block all of Obama’s nominees for executive branch positions until Congress is allowed to hear testimony from those on the ground during the Benghazi terrorist attacks in 2012.

“I shouldn’t have to do this – to make these threats,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Graham says there are still too many unanswered questions about the Sept. 11 attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

While there have been a number of Capitol Hill hearings on the deadly attack in Benghazi, Graham is among a group of lawmakers who say they aren’t satisfied with the information provided and want more.

“I don’t think it’s over the top to find out what happened to four dead Americans,” he said. “I don't think it’s over the top to talk to survivors. The State Department interviewed these survivors.”

Along with Ambassador Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed in the attack.

Graham has been asking for the FBI’s transcripts of interviews with State Department and CIA survivors who were evacuated to Germany after the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate.

In an Oct. 28 letter Graham, the State Department’s Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, Julia Frifield, referred to ""significant risks"" and ""serious concerns about having the survivors of the attack submit to additional interviews.""

Graham and other Republicans believe the transcripts will show the survivors told the FBI it was a terrorist attack and made no mention of a video or anti-U.S. demonstration at the consulate.

“So I’m going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,” he said.

Graham also called on fellow lawmakers in Washington for help.

“The only way this will work is if my GOP colleagues get behind me and Democrats too and support my request to find out exactly what happened,” he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/advocates-press-obama-act-immigration-080816471--politics.html,,[],Advocates press Obama to act on immigration,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Frustrated with the failure of House Republicans to tackle immigration, advocates are demanding that President Barack Obama use his powers as chief executive to stop deportations or provide some relief to many of the 11 million immigrants living here illegally.

Obama insists that the nation's laws limit his ability to act unilaterally, even though his administration acted on its own last year to suspend deportations of some immigrants brought illegally into the country as children and more recently decided some relatives of U.S. service members living here illegally could remain.

The administration has also quietly changed the rules for immigrants from Visa Waiver Program countries, people who arrived in the U.S. legally but stayed longer than the 90 days the program allows. Now people from the 37, mostly European, countries in the program who are immediate relatives of U.S. citizens can apply to stay in the United States legally.

The moves stand in sharp contrast to the actions of Obama's Homeland Security Department, which has deported a record 1.47 million people during the president's nearly five years in office, according to internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. Heckling of the president during California appearances Monday underscored the dissatisfaction with the Democratic president, not only over the stalled immigration overhaul but the administration's policies.

""Stop deportations! Stop deportations!"" audience members yelled at Obama during a speech in San Francisco that was interrupted by a young man who said his family has been separated for 19 months.

""Executive order"" was the rallying cry at a separate Democratic fundraiser Monday. Obama, the former instructor in constitutional law, responded to the criticism with a brief lesson in the nation's rules.

""If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" Obama told the first group. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.""

Story continues

House Republican leaders have rejected the Democratic-controlled Senate's comprehensive immigration bill, which passed on a bipartisan vote in June. The far-reaching measure would provide new visa and workplace enforcement programs and billions of dollars for border security, along with a path to citizenship for millions.

Small, stand-alone bills from the House Judiciary Committee have languished for months, and leaders signaled that votes are unlikely in this year's remaining legislative days even though Obama recently embraced the piecemeal approach. Prospects for immigration legislation in 2014, with congressional elections looming, are slim despite the issue's political drag on the GOP.

Advocacy groups have been as loud as the California protesters in calling for Obama to act while they maintain pressure on House Republicans with protests and acts of civil disobedience.

""House Republicans are infuriating, and legislation is the permanent solution, and we're going to keep fighting for legislation. But that doesn't let Obama off the hook,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigrant group, said Tuesday. ""He continues to be the president who presides over record deportation.""

What angers the advocacy groups is that many of those deported are immigrants who would qualify for legal status or citizenship under the Senate-passed legislation, which Obama supports.

The organizations argue that Obama could expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which dealt with some of the children brought illegally into the country, to their parents. He also could delay action against workers who have helped in the prosecution of employers who have broken the law or immigrants who don't represent a threat to national security, the groups say.

""The president does have the authority and the ability to ease the crisis on the ground while the legislative process continues to play out,"" Ana Avendano, director of immigration and community action at the AFL-CIO, said in an interview.

Advocates point to a June 2011 memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement that provided guidance on using prosecutorial discretion in carrying out the nation's immigration laws. The discretion applied to a range of steps that could be taken in enforcing the laws, such as deciding whom to stop and arrest, or whom to release, and applied to officers, agents and lawyers.

""Prosecutorial discretion is the authority of an agency charged with enforcing a law to decide to what degree to enforce the law against a particular individual,"" the memo said.

Advocates contend that the memo gave agents, officers and lawyers flexibility in pursuing immigrants living here illegally, with priority given to criminals. But the Obama administration, they say, continues to strictly implement deportations.

About 370,000 people were removed last year, down from more than 409,000 people last year. The Homeland Security Department received money to remove about 400,000 a year, but the government decides who those people are. Hirsoshi Motomura, a law professor and immigration law expert at UCLA, said Obama could decide, for instance, to provide deferred action to groups of people described as low priorities in previous discretion memos issued by former ICE Director John Morton.

Meantime, several advocacy groups continue to fault the administration.

Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said in a statement that Obama has a ""credibility gap"" on immigration, imploring Congress to pass legislation while his administration implements its deportation policy.

""The president can do more, and he knows it,"" Alvarado said.

Traveling with Obama in California, a White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, did not rule out some sort of executive action. That possibility unnerves Republicans who point to Obama's unilateral changes to the health care law, such as delaying some requirements and enrollment deadlines.

Among prosecutors and defense lawyers, there’s a name for that kind of hyperbole: overcharging. Whatever his crimes — and he clearly committed some — Mr. Snowden did not commit treason, though the people who have long kept the secrets he revealed are now fulminating with rage.

If Mr. Snowden had really wanted to harm his country, he could have sold the classified documents he stole to a foreign power, say Russia or China or Iran or North Korea. But even that would not constitute treason, which only applies in cases of aiding an enemy with whom the United States is at war.

His harshest critics might argue that by exposing American intelligence practices, he gave aid and comfort to Al Qaeda and its allies, with whom the country remains in a military conflict, thanks to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, which Congress passed after Sept. 11, 2001, and is in force now. It’s unlikely that Qaeda leaders did not already know or suspect surveillance before Mr. Snowden’s disclosures. But treason means more than that, too. In the landmark 1945 case Cramer v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that one had to provide aid and comfort and also “adhere” to an enemy to be guilty of treason."

Florida Today

The U.S. military draft ended in 1973

The switch has had both positive and negative effects on the military and the nation

There have been efforts to reinstate the draft%2C including those by Rep. Charles Rangel%2C D-N.Y.%2C over the past decade

MELBOURNE, Fla. -- Young men today no longer face the prospect of being called to compulsory military duty. This month marks the 40th anniversary since the draft ended and the military became an all-volunteer force.

The switch has had both positive and negative effects on the military and the nation as a whole, depending on who you ask.

Today's fighting force is undeniably better educated and motivated than in the days when much of the enlisted ranks of the Army were filled with conscripts on two-year tours.

Nearly all of today's enlisted men and women have at least a high school diploma. Many are college graduates. There is a perception that there are fewer discipline problems than during the Vietnam War-era. The all-volunteer military has consistently demonstrated its ability from Desert Storm to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But an all-volunteer military also means that the burden of defending the nation is carried by a small fraction of Americans.

Robert Taylor, a professor of American military history and head of the Department of Humanities and communication at Florida Institute of Technology, said the all-volunteer military has been a success, though it is ""a two-sided coin.""

""The downside is that the vast majority of the American people expect the small number of people to fight our wars for us,"" he said.

That relatively small group is carrying the weight of service in the military, which has led to multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

From World War II to the final days of Vietnam, nearly every young man in the country faced the prospect of being drafted into the Army.

As time went on, more young men were able to avoid the draft by attending college or seeking other deferments.

Research published in the late 1970s showed that men from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to fight in Vietnam than men from middle- and high-income families who could avoid being drafted by going to college or finding a slot in a stateside National Guard unit.

""The American people lost confidence in the draft as a means of raising an army when it ceased to require equal sacrifice from everyone that was eligible to serve,"" said Bernard Rostker, a former director of the Selective Service System and the author of ""I Want You! The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force.""

The feeling that the draft was not applied equally, combined with widespread unhappiness with the war, led to increased calls to end the draft, which the Selective Service did in 1973.

Dwight Elliott Stone, then an apprentice plumber from California, became the last draftee to be inducted. Stone, now living in San Francisco, didn't go happily. ""I just wanted to do my two years and get the hell out,"" Stone said. He ended up serving about 17 months, and never had to go overseas.

Others, though, say that compulsory military service gave valuable discipline and direction to many young men.

Retired Army Sgt. 1st Class Juan Santiago, a Vietnam War veteran, said that because many draftees didn't want to go to the war, there were problems. But having to serve was good for many of the draftees who could have ended upin trouble.

""The Army molded them to be good citizens,"" said Santiago, 74, of Melbourne, Fla.

Some like Santiago ended up making the military their careers.

Santiago said he was a high school drop-out when he joined, while today's recruit must have at least a high school education. He went on to get his high school diploma and take college courses while serving.

Interest in the military has waxed and waned during the past 40 years, often dependent on such outside forces as the strength of the economy or the renewed sense of patriotism following the Sept. 11 attacks.

At an Army recruiting station in Rockledge, a board displays the photos of dozens of volunteer recruits who will be starting basic training in coming weeks. Many of them are idealists who find it their duty to serve in the military.

Shafaq Maria Yuhanna, 19, of Rockledge, who four years ago became a U.S. citizen, said that in her native Pakistan, she would not have had the opportunities she has here as a woman. She said she wanted to try every sport when she found that in the United States she was free to do so.

""I want to protect the country that gave me freedom,"" she said. ""Even though I've been here four years, it is my country.""

Latiesha Bryant, 24, of Melbourne, who earned a associate degree from Kaiser University, said she wanted to serve for the experience and to further her education. She said she wants to make a difference.

""I feel like today there are still gender stereotypes,"" she said. ""I want to break that stigma.""

The Pentagon is happy with the all-volunteer force. But others say it is time to bring back the draft.

Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has made several attempts during the past decade to reinstitute the draft on the grounds that a small fraction of U.S. citizens are bearing a disproportionate burden in fighting the nation's wars. But his bills have gone nowhere.

That hasn't stopped him from trying. Earlier this year, Rangel — who earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for Valor after volunteering for the Army during the Korean War — introduced another bring-back-the-draft bill that also would require women to register.

""Women have proven that they can do the very same tasks, military and non-military, that men can,"" Rangel said.

Santiago said that while there were some advantages to conscription, today's all-volunteer force is better prepared than it used to be.

""They have more professional soldiers,"" he said. ""Today, we have the best Army in the whole world.""

The pending wave of releases has revived one of the most caustic — and seemingly resolved — issues between the allies just as relations have hit a new low over Mr. Karzai’s refusal to sign a long-term security agreement with American officials. Officials from both countries who support the security deal say they are worried that the mass release of militants with American blood on their hands could scuttle talks altogether and lead to a complete Western withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014.

It was out of concern that dangerous militants might be too easily returned to the battlefield that American military commanders initially resisted Mr. Karzai’s demands in the spring to hand over all detention operations. As the Americans relented, they said they had received his personal assurances that security would be maintained.

Suddenly, it is a major issue again, though the releases have not been made final.

The Afghan commission charged with reviewing detainee cases at the main military prison near Bagram Air Base, a coalition hub north of Kabul, is planning to release more than 85 prisoners who the coalition and Afghan defense officials say should face trial. The plans were detailed by American and Afghan officials alarmed by the move, and have been confirmed by commission members."

“We’ve found a lot of value in having these high-visibility security details,” said John Siqveland, a spokesman for Metro Transit, which operates buses and trains Minneapolis-St. Paul. He said that local transit police have worked with VIPR teams on security patrols on the Metro rail line, which serves the Minnesota Vikings stadium, the Mall of America and the airport.

Kimberly Woods, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said the railroad has had good experiences with VIPR team members who work with the Amtrak police on random bag inspections during high-travel times. “They supplement our security measures,” she said.

But elsewhere, experiences with the teams have not been as positive.

In 2011, the VIPR teams were criticized for screening and patting down people after they got off an Amtrak train in Savannah, Ga. As a result, the Amtrak police chief briefly banned the teams from the railroad’s property, saying the searches were illegal.

In April 2012, during a joint operation with the Houston police and the local transit police, people boarding and leaving city buses complained that T.S.A. officers were stopping them and searching their bags. (Local law enforcement denied that the bags were searched.)

The operation resulted in several arrests by the local transit police, mostly for passengers with warrants for prostitution and minor drug possession. Afterward, dozens of angry residents packed a public meeting with Houston transit officials to object to what they saw as an unnecessary intrusion by the T.S.A.

“It was an incredible waste of taxpayers’ money,” said Robert Fickman, a local defense lawyer who attended the meeting. “Did we need to have T.S.A. in here for a couple of minor busts?”

Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of the T.S.A., said he generally supports the VIPR teams but remains concerned about the warrantless searches and the use of behavior detection officers to profile individuals in crowds."

Cheney suspects Edward Snowden might be a spy

Former VP helped oversee response to the 9/11 attacks

Obama said he doesn%27t believe that the collection of phone records violates privacy

WASHINGTON — Former vice president Dick Cheney on Sunday called the contractor who disclosed information about top-secret U.S. surveillance programs a criminal and a traitor.

He said he also suspects Edward Snowden might be a spy.

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Cheney accused the 29-year-old contract worker for the National Security Agency of damaging the nation's intelligence capabilities by leaking documents about programs that track telephone and Internet communications. Snowden also said the U.S. has hacked into the systems of China and other countries.

""I think it's one of the worst occasions in my memory of somebody with access to classified information doing enormous damage to the national security interests of the United States,"" said Cheney, a former Defense secretary who as vice president helped oversee the nation's response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Asked whether he thinks Snowden is a Chinese spy, Cheney replied: ""I'm deeply suspicious, obviously, because he went to China. That's not a place where you would ordinarily want to go if you are interested in freedom, liberty and so forth."" Snowden said he went to Hong Kong because of its history of free speech.

On CBS' Face the Nation, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said it was too soon to know how much damage Snowden's leaks had done, but he said that sort of disclosure ""in effect gives the playbook to those who would like to get around our techniques and our practices, and obviously that's not in our interest in the long haul.""

President Obama said he doesn't believe that the NSA's sweeping collection of telephone records violates Americans' privacy, McDonough said. He said Obama, now on a three-day trip to Europe, would discuss the issue publicly ""in the days ahead.""

James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, sent Congress a letter over the weekend that said the surveillance programs had helped thwart ""dozens"" of terrorist plots in the United States and elsewhere. He said phone records for fewer than 300 Americans had been scrutinized last year."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/04/07/Seven-Hundred-Retired-Military-Special-Ops-Tell-Congress-To-Form-Select-Committee-On-Benghazi,2013-04-07 00:00:00,['Kerry Picket'],700 Retired Military Special Ops Tell Congress to Form Select Committee on Benghazi,"Seven hundred retired Military Special Operations professionals from the organization “Special Operations Speaks” sent a letter to the House of Representatives urging members to support H.Res 36, which will create a House Select Committee to investigate last September’s deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.

Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.

Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However, any information that may be garnered from that committee will, as always, remain classified.

“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans, I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so,” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News.

Boykin added, “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station, or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”

Last month, Rep. Wolf, along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), a House Ways and Means Committee member, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more informatio n on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry, Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries. Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a Senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees,” Issa told Breitbart News.

Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors, more Republican members, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.

Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues, including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi, if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.

“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations, we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning, he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th, 2012 happened, how it happened, and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad,” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.

The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11, 2012,” adding that the, “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”

http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/politics/terror-word,2013-04-16 00:00:00,['Halimah Abdullah'],Obama has learned tough lessons on using the word ‘terror’,"Story highlights President Barack Obama uses word ""terror"" in latest comments on Boston bombings The lack of the word ""terror"" in Obama's comments on Monday raised questions Obama learned lesson early on about the political ramifications of using the word ""terror""

(CNN) —

When President Barack Obama addressed the nation in the hours following Monday’s Boston Marathon bombing, he did not use the word “terror,” immediately raising questions.

When he took the podium at the White House less than 24 hours later, his phrasing changed. But he still was very careful about what he said, making separate points.

“Any time bombs are used to target civilians, it is an act of terrorism,” Obama said.

He said it was unclear who carried out the attack and why, but that the Boston bombings were a “heinous and cowardly act” that the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism.

The two bomb blasts near the downtown finish line of the storied marathon killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and sent more than 170 others to local hospitals, some with critical injuries.

With developments unfolding late on Monday, Obama spoke to the nation from the White House, saying “we still do not know who did this or why” and cautioning Americans against jumping to any conclusions.

“But make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this. We’ll find out why they did this,” he said.

Obama, calling attack ‘terror,’ shifts to response

Though Obama didn’t mention “terror,” federal investigators and a White House official later classified the bombings as such. Those close to the case have said it is not clear whether the attack was domestic or foreign in origin.

It makes sense Obama would be cautious in his initial public remarks and then clarify matters later with more information known, said Aitan Goelman, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute the Oklahoma City bombing case.

“The president is absolutely right in cautioning people we don’t know who did this,” Goelman said.

’Boston will overcome,’ mayor vows amid bombing investigation

Careful decision-making in communicating information to the public seems to reflect lessons learned by a chief executive who has had to navigate the aftermath of attacks or threatened attacks where American lives were lost or threatened.

“There were three attacks in the first 17 months of the administration, four if you count Fort Hood,” said Matthew Miller, who served as a director of the Office of Public Affairs for the Justice Department during Obama’s first term.

“What we learned in dealing with each of those is it’s important for government officials to communicate early and reassure the public,” he said.

The president learned that lesson on Christmas Day in 2009 when a passenger attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard an international flight heading into Detroit.

The White House called it an attempted terrorist attack and it took Obama three days to address the incident publicly, delay that some Republicans in Congress criticized.

A thwarted attempt to detonate explosives in New York’s subway system in September 2009, the November 2009 shooting massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, and a failed bombing of New York’s Times Square in May 2010 offered valuable lessons on communicating early, often and cautiously, Miller said.

The administration has also benefited from consistency in staffing. Key officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who in 2009 served as National Security Council chief of staff, and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, who formerly served as a senior Justice Department official, are at Obama’s side now.

The administration also learned a tough political lesson around the word terror when Obama was hesitant to say it outright when first describing the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September.

Details emerge: Boston bombs may have involved pressure cooker, timer

The president did call the attack one of several “acts of terror.”

The administration’s reluctance to clearly label that attack terrorism and comments blaming events initially on a response to an anti-Islamic film ignited partisan bickering and an election-year showdown with Republicans over his administration’s handling of the matter.

Politics aside, experts point out that classifying an attack as terrorism carries important legal and investigative meaning.

“You know, there’s been much discussing about the parsing of words: is this terrorism, isn’t it terrorism, it’s criminal? First of all, terrorism is a crime. So it’s automatically a criminal case if it’s a terrorism case,” said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor.

“But secondly, if it was not terrorism, the FBI would not be in charge. It would be Boston P.D. running this case. So it’s clear the authorities are absolutely clear. This is a terrorism investigation. It’s a terrorism case,” he said."

“The granting of citizenship is the most solemn honor this country can confer,” TheTeaParty.Net founder Todd Cefaratti said in a statement obtained by Breitbart News. “It is not something that ought to be used to score political points or to win the next election.”

“Before the American people extend this gift they must be assured that verifiable border security has preeminent priority. The Senate bill currently does not have it,” he explained. “Americans will not be bullied, intimidated and steamrolled into accepting this legislation.”

“We have proposed a conservative alternative at secureamericanow.us for which we will be rallying Congressional support in the coming days.”

The group said in its release it will be briefing members of Congress on the alternative immigration reform plan in the coming days and weeks.

TheTeaParty.Net’s chief strategist Niger Innis added that he thinks the “Senate amnesty bill is a non-starter.”

“But instead of just saying we’re against something, we have put forward eight principles that we believe are the necessary pillars of an America First Immigration alternative,” Innis said. “Over the coming days we will be meeting with conservative Senate and House members about getting them to support the plan.”

“We will not be bullied by a Harry Reid-Chuck Schumer agenda that undermines the Constitution by ramming through a bill that the American people do not support,” Innis promised. “The only way to stop a bully is to confront them.”

Many other Tea Party organizations, like Tea Party Patriots, have already announced their opposition to the Gang of Eight bill. More than 150 of them banded together in recent months to sign a letter sent to members of Congress announcing their ardent opposition to the legislation.

TheTeaParty.net did not sign that letter at the time and was fighting suggestions from the office of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) that it may support the legislation.

Politico previously erroneously claimed that TheTeaParty.net was among groups that had become an “ally” of the Gang of Eight. Politico later quietly edited the story after Breitbart News discovered the groups it claimed supported the bill had not expressed support for the legislation. Rather, the groups had me with Rubio’s team to get his take on the bill before they made a decision.

“We are going to hear him out, rather than rely on the liberal media interpretation of his legislation,” Innis told Breitbart News at the time. “Reports that we have agreed to support the Gang of Eight bill are utter make-believe.”"

— Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, April 22, 2013

In journalism, there’s an old rule: The only dumb question is the one not asked.

Still, Paul’s question in a letter urging delay of comprehensive immigration reform appears to ask the wrong question, based on the information that is now known about the Boston Marathon bombing suspects and their arrival in the United States.

The Facts

One undisputed fact about the Tsarnaev brothers is that they were both minors when they arrived in the United States. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was 8 or 9, while his older brother Tamerlan was 15 or 16.

Second, they ended up in the United States because their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, applied for asylum.

It has been reported that Anzor first arrived on a tourist visa in April 2002, with the youngest son, while Tamerlan and two sisters remained behind. The chronology is still a bit confused; some accounts just have the father and Dzhokhar arriving, which would make sense because the State Department, in granting tourist visas, looks for family connections (such as a family) back home. But other accounts have both Anzor and his wife, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, arriving in April with either one or both boys.

Once in the United States, Anzor applied for asylum. According to his sister Maret, she helped him write the petition. (Note that there is a difference: Applicants apply for refugee status if they are outside the United States; they apply for asylum once they are in the United States or at the border.)

But in any case, a spouse and children under the age of 21 are covered by one parent’s status. The rest of the family could be brought into the United States under a policy of family reunification, as long as the petition is filed within two years of being granted asylum.

Finally, the family did not emigrate from Chechnya; they were only ethnically Chechen. Anzor apparently grew up in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, though he may have lived briefly in Chechnya in the early 1990s. Both boys also were born in Kyrgyzstan, but the family left after run-ins with government authorities and settled in a Russian region that borders Chechnya known as Dagestan. (Some accounts say Tamerlan was born in Russia, but traveled on a Kyrgyzstan passport.)

From a U.S. immigration perspective, the family came from “Russia,” not a particular part of Russia. Moreover, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” At this point, we do not know the case Anzor made in seeking asylum, but apparently it was compelling enough to be granted.

Interestingly, despite the turmoil in Chechnya, relatively few ethnic Chechens have sought refuge in the United States. Almut Rochowanski, coordinator of programs and advocacy for the Chechnya Advocacy Network, said there is no hard data, but she estimates that only about 1,000 Chechens are living in the United States. She said Chechens have preferred to settle in Europe — where there are more than 100,000 refugees — and the few who made it to the United States are rather spread out across the country.

In the case of the Tsarnaev family, there were already other relatives in the United States and Canada, which was probably the attraction.

We sought further clarification from Paul spokeswoman Moira Bagley but, as usual, did not receive a response.

The Pinocchio Test

When asking provocative questions, it is important to get the facts correct.

Paul appears to suggest that U.S. immigration officials, in granting an asylum petition from the father, could have discerned that two minor children, after living in the United States for a decade, would eventually commit a terrorist act. That would require an extraordinary amount of clairvoyance.

In any case, the key question for immigration officials was the asylum case made by their father; the minor children had nothing to do with it.

Moreover, Paul misidentified the region from which the Tsarnaev family emigrated. The boys who allegedly turned into terrorists may have been ethnic Chechens but they did not emigrate from Chechnya. Paul is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; one would expect he would know more about such elementary geography.

Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, woodland and desert (shown) $319,000 The Marine Corps produced new and markedly better camouflage patterns. But the Marines took steps to make sure they weren't copied or used by other services. One such measure: The Marines inserted small Marine Corps logos into the pattern.

Army Combat Uniform (ACU) $2.63 million The Army unveiled its own ""universal"" camouflage pattern, intended for use in all environments. But that choice was marred with shortcuts and mistakes. The Army commissioned a study of which pattern worked best, but the brass chose this pattern before that study was finished.

Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) $3.1 million Most Air Force personnel work far from the front lines. But that force has its own ""tiger stripe"" uniform. Now, Air Force personnel in Afghanistan are told to wear Army Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern camouflage instead. The Airman Battle Uniform is now prohibited for use in battle.

Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP) $2.9 million For troops in Afghanistan, the Army scrapped the pattern it had introduced in 2005 and replaced it with a new one. Now, the Army is working to replace this replacement. It is expected to present another camouflage pattern later this year. The Army estimated that switching out the uniforms cost more than $38.8 million.

Navy Working Uniform Type I $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) The Navy designed this camouflage-style uniform for settings where camouflage is not usually necessary: on Navy bases and ships. Sailors call them ""aquaflage"" or ""blueberries.""

Navy Working Uniform Type II (desert) $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) In the mid-2000s, the Navy decided it needed its own distinct uniform for fighting on land. But the Marine Corps objected, because the pattern was similar to the Marine one. Now, the Navy limits the use of this pattern: It is worn only by Special-Operations troops and Navy personnel supporting them.

Navy Working Uniform Type III (woodland) $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) This uniform features a green camouflage pattern with Navy logos. Because of the spat with the Marine Corps over the Navy's desert camouflage, some Navy forces in the Middle East have been issued these uniforms instead."

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011,"The Obama administration secretly won permission from a surveillance court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency’s use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans’ communications in its massive databases, according to interviews with government officials and recently declassified material.

In addition, the court extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years — and more under special circumstances, according to the documents, which include a recently released 2011 opinion by U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, then chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

What had not been previously acknowledged is that the court in 2008 imposed an explicit ban — at the government’s request — on those kinds of searches, that officials in 2011 got the court to lift the bar and that the search authority has been used.

Together the permission to search and to keep data longer expanded the NSA’s authority in significant ways without public debate or any specific authority from Congress. The administration’s assurances rely on legalistic definitions of the term “target” that can be at odds with ordinary English usage. The enlarged authority is part of a fundamental shift in the government’s approach to surveillance: collecting first, and protecting Americans’ privacy later.

“The government says, ‘We’re not targeting U.S. persons,’ ” said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “But then they never say, ‘We turn around and deliberately search for Americans’ records in what we took from the wire.’ That, to me, is not so different from targeting Americans at the outset.”

Read the document Declassified 2011 FISA court ruling Opinion struck down an NSA program that unlawfully gathered thousands of electronic communications between Americans.

The court decision allowed the NSA “to query the vast majority” of its e-mail and phone call databases using the e-mail addresses and phone numbers of Americans and legal residents without a warrant, according to Bates’s opinion.

The queries must be “reasonably likely to yield foreign intelligence information.” And the results are subject to the NSA’s privacy rules.

The court in 2008 imposed a wholesale ban on such searches at the government’s request, said Alex Joel, civil liberties protection officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The government included this restriction “to remain consistent with NSA policies and procedures that NSA applied to other authorized collection activities,” he said.

But in 2011, to more rapidly and effectively identify relevant foreign intelligence communications, “we did ask the court” to lift the ban, ODNI general counsel Robert S. Litt said in an interview. “We wanted to be able to do it,” he said, referring to the searching of Americans’ communications without a warrant.

Joel gave hypothetical examples of why the authority was needed, such as when the NSA learns of a rapidly developing terrorist plot and suspects that a U.S. person may be a conspirator. Searching for communications to, from or about that person can help assess that person’s involvement and whether he is in touch with terrorists who are surveillance targets, he said. Officials would not say how many searches have been conducted.

The court’s expansion of authority went largely unnoticed when the opinion was released, but it formed the basis for cryptic warnings last year by a pair of Democratic senators, Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Mark Udall (Colo.), that the administration had a “back-door search loophole” that enabled the NSA to scour intercepted communications for those of Americans. They introduced legislation to require a warrant, but they were barred by classification rules from disclosing the court’s authorization or whether the NSA was already conducting such searches.

“The [surveillance] Court documents declassified recently show that in late 2011 the court authorized the NSA to conduct warrantless searches of individual Americans’ communications using an authority intended to target only foreigners,” Wyden said in a statement to The Washington Post. “Our intelligence agencies need the authority to target the communications of foreigners, but for government agencies to deliberately read the e-mails or listen to the phone calls of individual Americans, the Constitution requires a warrant.”

Senior administration officials disagree. “If we’re validly targeting foreigners and we happen to collect communications of Americans, we don’t have to close our eyes to that,” Litt said. “I’m not aware of other situations where once we have lawfully collected information, we have to go back and get a warrant to look at the information we’ve already collected.”

The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year.

But — and this was the nub of the criticism — a warrant for each target would no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or “foreign powers.”

That is why it is important to require a warrant before searching for Americans’ data, Udall said. “Our founders laid out a roadmap where Americans’ privacy rights are protected before their communications are seized or searched — not after the fact,” he said in a statement to The Post.

Another change approved by Bates allows the agency to keep the e-mails of or concerning Americans for up to six years, with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Because the retention period begins “from the expiration date” of the one-year surveillance period, the court effectively added up to one year of shelf life for the e-mails collected at the beginning of the period.

Joel said that the change was intended to standardize retention periods across the agencies and that the more generous standard was “already in use” by another agency.

The NSA intercepts more than 250 million Internet communications each year under Section 702. Ninety-one percent are from U.S. Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo. The rest come from “upstream” companies that route Internet traffic to, from and within the United States. The expanded search authority applies only to the downstream collection.

Is it tiny Muslimses?



Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)—who has spent the weeks following the bombing arguing that Obama’s “political correctness” prevented the FBI from stopping the attacks—appeared on the Glenn Beck radio show to argue that Holder’s history of defending terrorists allowed the judge to Mirandize Tsarnaev:

GOHMERT: Think about it, when your attorney general spent more of his legal career helping terrorists than defending the country, then you know we all have certain biases and lean certain ways. Gohmert then went on to reiterate his belief that the Obama administration is guided by the Muslim Brotherhood. “[The administration] know who’s in there advising them,” Gohmert said, “either they lie under oath or they do know the extent of Muslim Brotherhood infiltration into our government.”

While addressing the FBI’s work in Boston, Gohmert said that it was “amazing” that the FBI was able to do any investigative work at all because, according to Gohmert, they are being advised by “Muslim Brotherhood members.” He said that the Obama administration is promoting “radical Islam” and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and in the US, maintaining that “Muslim Brotherhood advisers” have made it “virtually impossible to properly and adequately investigate and defend this country.”

Look, this isn't even funny at this point. We need an intervention. Somebody help this man No, I mean it. Is there a number we should be calling? Can someone check for a medical alert bracelet? Because this poor man is seeing invisible Muslims everywhere, and in every federal department He's gone past the conspiracy tubthumping of Bachmann and King—he may have even lapped a few Alex Jones theories at this point. According to him, the entire government is just riddled with secret invisible Muslims. They're everywhere. They're hiding under his office chair, they're in his cereal, they're out in the parking lot right now, letting just a tiny bit of air out of his tires each day—oh, it's hard to notice at first, but you can tell. You can tell.

I realize America doesn't have high standards for electing congresspeople. Or, for that manner, any standards at all. I realize many voters in certain southern states have, in fact, a longstanding tradition of seeing just how dumb a man they might be able to elect to office, just to see what would happen. And I realize that the Republican Party has relied on the dangers posed by purely imaginary people of all colors and persuasions for nearly all of their major policy decisions, these last two decades. But this? This is a man past his breaking point. This is a man who's about three weeks from ripping out his own fillings, claiming invisible Muslims lived inside them and were reciting the collected works of Walt Whitman every night while he was trying to sleep. Help him.

Violent and Dangerous and Petty. It's the same thing, they simply can't escape the vision of the Angry. Black. Thug. tm even when a well-dressed, well spoken, highly educated, intelligent, even tempered, considerate and more than a ton accommodating Black Man who happens to be the leader of the Free World is before them.. they still see nothing more than a Mean Little Punk.

A Muslim. A Kenyan. An America Hater, the Food Stamp President who wants everyone in the Country in the Thrall of the Federal Government as PAYBACK for Slavery - and who I guess must hate Catholics because - well - why not, right? We got 'em, why not Hate Them?

But scratch the surface of this little fantasy and it falls apart faster than a paper machete mache castle doused in liter fluid.

First of all, the Embassy isn't being ""Closed"" - it's being moved Closer to the Vatican as part of a process that was initiated By His Brother.



There are no embassies for any country in Vatican City itself — there is simply no room. All countries locate their embassies in the city of Rome. The United States has decided to move its embassy from its current location — an unremarkable converted residence — to the same compound as the U.S. Embassy to Italy. It will have it’s own separate building and a separate entrance on a different street. The new building is actually a tenth of a mile closer to the Vatican than the old one. There will be no reduction in staff or activities. ... The State Department says the move, which will actually occur in 2015, will save $1.4 million per year and allow for greater security.

Imagine that, Obama is moving the Embassy to a) Save Money and b) Improve Security. Now, why on Earth would he ever care about such things?

The second part is that the Catholic Church doesn't oppose Obamacare. They actually have enthusiastically endorsed it.



Washington, DC, September 20, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The Catholic Health Association (CHA) released a statement last week lauding the effects of Obama’s health care reform program. “Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that became effective last year have helped millions get the coverage they need,” wrote CHA President Carol Keehan.

Sr. Carol Keehan of the Catholic Health Association. “At least 500,000 young adults (ages 18-24), for example, obtained health insurance last year, a two percentage point increase that is the result of an ACA provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plan,” Keehan continued. She went on to urge lawmakers to “keep our nation’s vulnerable persons in mind” as they deliberate over fiscal policy.

Public Policy Polling conducted the new poll on behalf of a coalition that includes Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. The findings indicate that Obama gained some ground with Catholics by altering the policy. An earlier PPP poll found that 53 percent of Catholic voters approved of the White House's original mandate, which required religious employers to provide contraception coverage directly.

In fact a majority of Catholics even support the Contraceptive Policy. There is an outstanding case going to the Supreme Court over that very issue, but it's certainly not something that deservesover. It's a difference of opinion, a disagreement and in a ""Free Country"" you're supposed to be able to have those from time to time. Or so you would think.

So let's think this out, Jeb Bush actually believes it's a serious proposition that the President of these United States could have decided to pettily embarrass Catholics and damage our international standing by capriciously and with full callousness of forethought closing the Vatican Embassy (and I guess in his mind not re-opening it in a more secure location, Ever!) merely out of a Fit of Pique!.

Really?

I mean, it's not like doing such a thing could be considered as a way to make his policies more popular with Religious Organizations who object to not doing a thing while their employees and students get preventive healthcare, is it? How does this argument - even as a projection - make any damn sense at all? Is that what Jeb Bush would do if the Catholics pissed him off? Gee, thanks for the heads up.

This is the kind of thing you expect from World Net Daily. (In fact, it's their Stock-in-Trade), not from Mainstream Republicans.

But then again, they do seem to running of out the sane undeluded ones aren't they? Sadly, their delusions don't make the President look bad, it only makes them look pathetic. And Desperate.

Edward Snowden has been given asylum in Russia

Lon Snowden says he doubts his son will return to the U.S.

Edward Snowden was stuck at a Moscow airport for more than a month

MOSCOW (AP) — Four former U.S. government officials who met with former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden said Thursday that he is adjusting to life in Russia and expresses no regrets about leaking highly classified information. Separately, Snowden's father arrived to see his son.

The Americans, who once worked for the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and NSA, have criticized the U.S. government and in some cases exposed what they believed was wrongdoing in the its security agencies. They are the first Americans known to have met with Snowden since he was granted asylum in Russia in August.

In interviews with The Associated Press, they described spending the previous evening with Snowden to present him with the Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence.

""He spoke about going out and about and getting to understand Russia and its culture and the people,"" said Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive who gave inside information to a newspaper about an electronic espionage program that he saw as invasive. ""This is where he lives now, and so where you live is your home.""

Snowden's father, Lon, did not say when or where he would meet his 30-year-old son, but expressed optimism about his situation.

""You know, I have heard so many things through the media, and my assumption is certainly, given the circumstances, he's doing as well as could be expected,"" Lon Snowden told the AP shortly after he arrived in Moscow. ""He's safe and he's free, and that's a good thing.""

The elder Snowden said he doubts his son will return to the United States, where he is charged with violating the Espionage Act for disclosing the NSA's surveillance of phone and Internet usage around the world.

The four former U.S. officials refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

""For his own safety it's best that no one else knows where he actually lives,"" Drake said. ""But I believe he is making the best of his circumstances and is living as normally as possible.""

Like Snowden, Drake was indicted under the Espionage Act, but the felony charges were dropped before trial and he was convicted on a lesser charge and sentenced to one year of probation and community service.

Drake and the other Americans — Raymond McGovern, Jesselyn Radack and Coleen Rowley — said Snowden was in good spirits and still believes he did the right thing in disclosing the NSA surveillance program.

They said they saw no evidence that Snowden was under the control of Russian security services, as many in the U.S. government believe.

""He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter,"" said Radack, a former Justice Department adviser now with the Government Accountability Project. ""He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to.""

Snowden's asylum status has strained the already tense relationship between the U.S. and Russia."

Bush, on his recent trip to Africa, toured Victoria Falls, one of the seven wonders of the world. He then sat down for an interview that may qualify as the eighth.

The man who started two wars abroad and introduced a new level of hostility to domestic politics spoke with ABC News’s Jonathan Karl in Tanzania in a conciliatory and reflective manner that bore little resemblance to that of the divisive figure who left Washington in 2009.

In the segment, which aired Sunday, the 43rd president, in a striped blue polo shirt, cautioned those who have been “overly critical” of gay marriage. He defended President Obama against criticism that he hasn’t devoted much attention to Africa, and he resisted an invitation to gloat over Obama’s continuation of counterterrorism policies that he had created. Of most importance, Bush put in a plug for the comprehensive immigration legislation that is at the top of Obama’s agenda but has divided Bush’s Republican Party.

“I think it’s very important to fix a broken system, to treat people with respect and have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people,” said Bush, who failed to enact such reform.

For Bush, who has been under a self-imposed gag order for much of the time since he left office, this amounts to something of a reemergence. He’s planning to talk about immigration again Wednesday in a naturalization ceremony at his presidential center. It’s likely not a coincidence that he’s beginning to return to public view now that it’s safer to do so: More Americans are forgiving, or at least forgetting, what they didn’t like about him.

A Gallup poll last month found that for the first time in his ex-presidency (actually, the first time since 2005), a plurality of Americans have a positive view of Bush. Forty-nine percent viewed him favorably, compared with 46 percent who viewed him unfavorably. This puts him on par with Obama and is a healthy recovery from the depths of the economic collapse in March 2009, when 35 percent viewed him favorably.

It’s standard for former presidents to grow in public esteem as memories fade. In Bush’s case, the war in Iraq is over, the war in Afghanistan is winding down and the economy is finally recovering. But Bush’s rebound could be accelerated, particularly among Democrats, by the type of assist he gave Obama in the Karl interview.

That’s in marked contrast to his former understudy, Dick Cheney, who in his retirement regularly and rudely denounces Obama. As the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin reports, Cheney is now also antagonizing fellow Republicans by boosting a challenge by his daughter to Sen. Mike Enzi, a popular conservative in Cheney’s Wyoming.

Bush was all bonhomie as he sat in a shaded garden with his wife, assuring Karl that he didn’t talk substance with Obama when their Africa tours overlapped in Tanzania. “He’s busy, and I’m retired,” Bush joked. That’s long been his official line. “The only way I can really make news is either criticize the president, which I don’t want to do, criticize my own party or weigh in on a controversial issue,” he told Karl. “And I’m off the stage.”

But for a guy who’s “off the stage,” Bush had quite a few lines about the issues of the day. Earlier in his trip, Bush invoked a biblical admonition when asked whether gay marriage conflicts with Christian values: “I shouldn’t be taking a speck out of somebody else’s eye when I have a log in my own.” Bush told Karl “it’s very important for people not to be overly critical of someone else until you’ve examined your own heart.”

Karl’s interview had all the rehabilitative imagery Bush could want: clips of him in a T-shirt, painting a medical clinic in Zambia and dancing with the locals — and video of Obama asserting that Bush’s devotion to Africa has meant “millions of people’s lives have been saved.” After championing HIV treatments, Bush is now promoting cervical-cancer screening.

Bush, never one to put himself on the couch, dismissed as “absurd psycho-babble” the notion that the good works he is doing in Africa is “to make up for mistakes you made in Iraq,” as Karl put it.

But he seems to have grasped that his own place in history can be improved by generosity toward Africa — and magnanimity toward opponents. Asked by Karl about the criticism that Obama hasn’t done much for Africa, Bush disagreed, saying that Obama “cares deeply” about the continent and that his administration “has been incredibly helpful.”

With a laugh, Bush added: “It doesn’t surprise me that presidents get criticized.”

WikiLeaks hints at next move,"Story highlights Washington analysis: Nicolas Maduro is pushing for political points in Venezuela WikiLeaks fuels speculation about Edward Snowden's next move It's unclear whether Snowden has accepted any offer of asylum The trick will be avoiding the airspace of the U.S. and its allies

(CNN) —

As speculation grows over Edward Snowden’s path to freedom, WikiLeaks teased that his “flight of liberty” campaign starts Wednesday, promising further details.

But so far, WikiLeaks has not lived up to the Twitter promise to provide more details. And the questions are piling up.

Is the future of the U.S. intelligence leaker, grounded at Moscow’s airport for more than two weeks, no longer up in the air?

Not so fast.

It’s unclear whether Snowden has accepted anyone’s offer of asylum. And if he has, how does he intend to get there?

Speculation centers on Venezuela, which was the first to offer asylum. With both sides expressing interest, it only appeared to be a matter of time before it is confirmed.

Venezuela extended the asylum offer to Snowden last week, and on Monday President Nicolas Maduro received a formal asylum request from Snowden.

Just who is Edward Snowden?

There were flurries of information Tuesday after a tweet by a Russia lawmaker announced that Snowden had accepted Venezuela’s offer of asylum.

But the lawmaker who sent the tweet, Russian parliamentary spokesman Alexei Pushkov, deleted the message. WikiLeaks, which has been assisting Snowden in his asylum bid, denied the report in a Twitter post.

“The states concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes,” WikiLeaks said. “The announcement will then be confirmed by us.”

If Snowden does accept, it resolves one issue in the saga, but sets the stage for the next chapter: How will he get from Moscow to Caracas?

Creative maneuvering

The trick would seem to be avoiding U.S. airspace or the airspace of nations friendly to the United States.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who faces espionage charges, would be wise to take a chartered jet on a route that goes over water the entire time, former CIA analyst Allen Thomson told Foreign Policy.

“Leave Moscow,” he told the Foreign Policy. “Fly north to the Barents Sea, thence over to and through the Denmark Strait. Continue south, steering clear of Newfoundland until getting to the east of the Windward Islands. Fly through some convenient gap between islands and continue on to Caracas.”

Kirk Koenig, president of Expert Aviation Consulting, told CNN that such a route would probably work, as it avoids the airspace of any countries that may try to ground the plane.

“That would probably be his only choice,” he said.

Such a flight would not come cheap – about $200,000 – Koenig said.

“Where it gets more interesting is if they try to put him on an Aeroflot Russian Airlines flight nonstop to Havana, Cuba,” he said. “The smart move would be to put him there as a passenger and hope nobody notices.”

Would other countries make a commercial passenger jet land if they believe Snowden is on board? Given what happened to Bolivian President Evo Morales, it’s possible, Koenig said.

Opinion: Why we’re all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden

No place to fly

Last week, several European countries wouldn’t let Morales’ plane fly through their airspace, allegedly because of rumors that Snowden was aboard. The presidential aircraft instead made an unscheduled stop in Vienna, Austria, which became a sore spot for Morales and sparked outrage throughout Latin America.

On Tuesday, members of the Organization of American States passed a resolution condemning the incident, calling for France, Italy, Portugal and Spain to formally apologize. The United States and Canada dissented.

Security Clearance: No end in sight for NSA leak fallout

As speculation swirled about Snowden’s next move, Maduro took the United States to task in a speech to military academy graduates, accusing Washington of persecuting Morales and threatening his life.

“Under those circumstances, several Latin American countries have decided for dignity and as a clear message to the empire, that we’re not afraid of it, that the children of Bolivar do not fear the empire,” Maduro said in a speech broadcast Tuesday on Telesur, a TV network based in Caracas.

Obama administration keeps close watch

Officials in national security agencies and on Capitol Hill were watching closely Wednesday for any signs that Snowden was preparing to leave Moscow for asylum in Venezuela.

Some are questioning Maduro’s motivation, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information involved.

U.S. officials believe Maduro’s decision to offer asylum to Snowden is aimed more at boosting the Venezuelan president’s standing at home rather than engaging in any direct anti-American effort, according to an assessment by the Obama administration that the officials described to CNN.

EXCLUSIVE: An Alabama family recounted to FoxNews.com a chilling airport encounter they had last month with the man they believe went on to gun down 12 people at a Washington military facility, and said the confrontation was triggered by the hearty laugh of a 75-year-old matriarch.

“We were just laughing and talking and he came over and said we were laughing at him,” Rosalind Baugh told FoxNews.com, speaking of Aaron Alexis, the troubled former Navy Reservist and government contractor who went on a shooting spree in the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in southeast Washington Monday.

Since the shooting, in which Alexis was killed by police, several reports have surfaced about his anti-social behavior, mental problems and record of arrests for gun offenses. As soon as he was identified as the shooter, Baugh and other family members present at Norfolk Airport for the Aug. 4 incident have been reliving the frightening encounter daily.

[pullquote]

According to Rosalind Baugh, Wallis Boyd and Glynda Boyd, the incident began when Baugh laughed at an innocent joke among loved ones and the man they now believe be Aaron Alexis angrily approached the group. Things quickly escalated, with Alexis screaming profanities and motioning at his side as though he were carrying a weapon. Unable to calm the stranger down, family members called security, who spoke with Alexis in front of a terminal of terrified travelers.

“Everyone in the airport was scared, we were all scared,” Glynda Boyd told FoxNews.com.

Three days later, Alexis told police in Newport, R.I., that he believed people he had gotten into an argument with at an airport were following him and laughing at him from another room. Newport police provided the report, along with their concerns about Alexis’ mental instability, to local Navy officials. The Navy has not commented on what steps were or were not taken.

According to the Newport police report, Alexis said “while getting onto his flight from Virginia to Rhode Island he got into an altercation with an unknown party in the airport. [He] believes that the individual that he got into an argument with has sent three people to follow him and keep him awake by talking to him and sending vibrations into his body. [He] stated that he has not witnessed any of these individuals, but believes they are two black males and a black female.”

The Boyd and Baugh family, who were traveling back home to Birmingham after a family reunion in Virginia, believe they were the ""tormentors"" Alexis described. They recalled in vivid detail meeting the future killer while they were waiting in front of their gate in the Southwest terminal for a 1:30 p.m. flight. Rosalind Baugh was in her wheelchair and waiting in the escort line by the gate when boarding began.

“She laughed out loud and he thought she was laughing at him,” Rosalind’s sister in law Wallis, 74, explained to FoxNews.com.

“Rosalind was tickled at something somebody said and she was laughing and well, it was pretty loud. So then he came over and he started cursing us out,” Wallis said.

“We asked him to stop cursing in front of all those people. He was saying some bad words I wouldn’t want to say. Vile words. It was awful. It was very disrespectful and it was terrible. We really had a problem when he came over.”

Glynda, Rosalind’s niece, explained how her aunt was just sitting in her chair enjoying the company of family.

“We were just waiting at our gate and my Aunt Rosalind was sitting in her wheelchair for escort service and communicating with my uncle and my brother and were just talking and Aaron Alexis walked over to our gate and he came behind us and stopped right at us and said 'Who is that lady laughing at? Is she laughing at me? Who is she laughing at?'”

“I said, 'No, no, she doesn’t even know you. She’s just laughing,'” Glynda said.

Alexis stood by the family for another minute without saying anything and then walked away. Five minutes later, the family says, he came back.

Then he asked again, “Why is this lady laughing at me? What is she laughing at?”

Glynda Boyd said she replied to the killer, “She doesn’t even see you, she is 75 years old.”

That’s when Glynda’s brother Michael told Alexis, “hey there, this is inappropriate for you to approach us like this. You need to stop. You’re out of line. Don’t come over like this.”

Then, according to the family members, Alexis started spewing vile curse words, loudly, at them.

Airport security then came over and talked to Alexis. They said “if you say anything else and approach these people again you are not going to be getting on your flight,” Glynda explained.

After that Alexis stood by a sports bar watching television with security standing around in the area watching him and continually asking the family if they were ok.

When news broke of the shooting, along with a photo of Alexis, family members say they were stunned.

“When I first saw his face it blew me away completely. It just blew me away,” Glynda said.

“We could’ve been those killed people. We could’ve been killed.""

WASHINGTON -- Department of Defense officials told state lieutenant governors Thursday to plan for possible base closures and cutbacks in civilian work forces as sequestration budget cuts begin affecting every state.

Frank DiGiovanni, the Defense Department training readiness and strategy director, told National Lieutenant Governors Association attendees that states need strategies to brace for military spending cuts, including base personnel and contractors. Military cuts also will affect spending by civilian and uniformed personnel at businesses near military bases in every state, no matter how big the military industry, he said.

“There is a lot to be done coordinating at the state level,"" DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors. He cited Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) for assembling a group that helped prepare for potential military base cuts in the past, and for having a plan to lobby federal officials to protect military installations in his state.

DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors they also should prepare for overseas military cuts, which will shift more activity to U.S. installations. With 200,000 military personnel returning from full time duty overseas, there will be more training at bases, he said. Those personel will contribute to the local economy, but they may spark increased complaints from base neighbors about noise and traffic.

At the same time, DiGiovanni did note that there has been a greater culture of the different military services working together with the budget cuts, including at bases around the country. He said that state leaders can continue to see that going forward.

“Sequestration and this whole fiscal environment is going to require the services to work together to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""The resources they’ve had won’t be there anymore.”

Kansas is a role model in protecting the military economy, said Patrick O'Brien, director of the Defense Department Office of Economic Adjustment,. O'Brien said lieutenant governors in the past have headed state planning groups to study the impact of military bases and industries on the state economy and how to have state government serve their needs.

The lieutenant governors association has long advocated the flexible nature of state lieutenant governors' offices as a way for the officials to be involved in a variety of areas of policy, including those impacting the military and economic development."

ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Timothy Lowery went to Iraq in 2007. He came home in 2010, and started showing symptoms of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Three years later, he was dead.

This is the extent of what his family knows for certain.

But they have strong suspicions that daily exposure to burn pits — the massive, open-air ditches where the military dumped its waste and lit it ablaze — contributed to his condition.

Lowery, a plumber with one of the U.S. military's largest contractors, KBR, walked by the pits daily as he installed piping, painted runways, and otherwise worked to help keep Al Asad Airbase running. Every day, he breathed in air filled with the smoke of burning metals, chemicals, and human waste.

Across the country, other families are worried, too. Thousands of returning veterans and civilians are now attributing myriad symptoms — respiratory problems, neurological disorders, cancers and ALS — to exposure to the burn pits, which were located at dozens of bases throughout Iraq and Afghanistan.

""A lot of us got really sick from upper respiratory stuff,"" said Stacy Fogarty, an Air Force veteran who came home from Iraq with asthma and other breathing problems. ""They're doing the research right now, but my personal prediction is it's going to be like Agent Orange for this era. We just don't really know what the ramifications are yet.""

Many are trying to get the military to cover their medical costs. Others are suing KBR, which operated some of the burn pits, accusing them of dumping into them all manner of unapproved items — tires, oil, chemicals and medical waste.

For the Lowerys, the controversy has brought a fresh edge to their pain. Now, they're not sure whether his death was bad luck, or whether he spent his years overseas being slowly, steadily poisoned.

Agonizing death

Contracting ALS is, quite simply, a horrible way to die.

Over the course of months or years, the body starts to shut down one piece at a time. Motor functions are impaired and then lost. Speech gets more challenging. And eventually, the lungs give out.

It's almost always fatal; most people die in the first few years, and greater than 90 percent die within 10 years.

But the cruelest part, said Timothy Lowery's son Dylan, is that the disease leaves the brain almost completely untouched.

""All the while, you're totally of sound mind,"" said Dylan Lowery, 20, of Rochester. ""You know your surroundings. You know what's happening. ... It's just degrading.""

For Timothy Lowery, the first symptoms came when he returned to his home in Georgia in late 2010. His girlfriend and future wife Kate Lowery noticed that he had tremors in his arm, and when he tried to go back to work as a plumber in July 2011 he came home saying that he was too weak and that he wasn't capable of doing the job any more.

""I've never seen him cry before as the way he did then,"" said Kate Lowery, 49, of Hampton, Ga.

Lowery, who had lived for much of his life in Dansville, came back to the Rochester area in January 2012, hoping to find a job that he could handle. Upon arriving, family members noticed him slurring his speech.

Soon, Lowery started dragging his foot when he walked. He had trouble turning the ignition in his car. He steadfastly refused to go to a doctor. But in July 2012, his condition worsening, his sisters forced him into a car and drove him to Strong Memorial Hospital. His diagnosis came shortly afterward.

In his final months, his family started asking questions about his time overseas. The burn pits, which on Al Asad Airbase were operated by the military, were almost always active, he said. His work — 13 hours a day, every day, always outdoors — took him to every area of the base, and he walked by the burn pits regularly.

Dust and sand from the surrounding climate would mix with the smoke from the pits. The mixture was in the air all the time, and Lowery often wore goggles to keep it out of his eyes.

In October 2012, with his faculties starting to fail him completely, he moved back to Georgia to be with Kate. They got married in February, just one month before his death. He was 51 years old.

'Anything and everything'

Only one study has been done on the long-term health effects of burn pits. The study, conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 2011, could not draw any concrete conclusions about the adverse effects.

Meanwhile, returning veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have continued to assert that burn pits were the cause of their problems.

Fogarty, 27, of Greece, N.Y., served in the Air Force at Joint Base Balad in Iraq, and was responsible for dumping hospital supplies into burn pits on the base. Fogarty said that material that was considered a biohazard was disposed of elsewhere, but that everything else went into the pits, which were burning constantly.

""Whatever we had to get rid of, we burned: beds and trash, used supplies,"" said Fogarty. ""Anything and everything: there were (airplane) parts in there.""

Earlier this year, after an audit that blasted burn pit operations at Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, lawmakers moved to establish a registry for service members and veterans who were exposed to potentially toxic fumes from the pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently setting up the registry.

The lawsuits, meanwhile, have targeted KBR because the company was responsible for waste disposal and burn pit operation on about a third of the military's bases.

Fifty-seven of those suits — 44 class-actions and 13 individual suits, representing several hundred people and families — were combined into a single case in Maryland. In the suit, plaintiffs accuse KBR of negligent operation of the burn pits: using them to dispose of hazardous waste and items on ""do not burn"" lists, failing to take steps to minimize smoke from the pits, and using the pits instead of incinerators, among other allegations.

One potential witness, Rick Lamberth, a former KBR employee, testified to Congress in 2009 that he personally witnessed KBR employees dump chemical decontamination materials, biomedical waste, plastics, oil, and tires into burn pits in violation of military regulations.

Lamberth, who served 31 years in the Army Reserve and spent time in Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq in military and civilian capacities, testified that he had suffered from shortness of breath and skin rashes, and had spit up bloody mucus since returning from Iraq.

He also alleged that KBR knew that the pits were dangerous, and that management attempted to cover up such information.

""When I tried to report violations, I was told by the head of KBR's Health Safety and Environment division to shut up and keep it to myself,"" said Lamberth in 2009. ""At one point, KBR management threatened to sue me for slander if I spoke out about these violations.""

In response to the allegations that unapproved material was disposed of in the KBR-operated burn pits, a spokesman for the company said those reports are anecdotal and cannot be supported by evidence.

""We've looked extensively at our records and we clearly don't have records that would substantiate that,"" said Mark Lowes, vice president of litigation for KBR Inc.

In a phone interview earlier this week, Lowes said that the military decided what was supposed to be disposed of in the burn pits, and was regularly monitoring KBR's operations.

""They would come in and evaluate our performance,"" said Lowes. ""If we were causing a huge problem, inconsistent with what they want, they'd be chewing on us and giving us poor evaluations for what we'd done.""

The class-action lawsuit against KBR was dismissed earlier this year. The judge ruled that KBR should be afforded the same legal protection as the military. (Soldiers cannot sue the armed forces for injuries sustained while on active duty.)

Attorneys for the plaintiffs have appealed the decision."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-slams-gop-focus-benghazi-politics-195951415.html,,[],Obama slams GOP focus on Benghazi as politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans pushed ahead Monday with their investigation of the deadly assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last year as President Barack Obama asserted that GOP charges of a cover-up are baseless.

The latest Republican focus is the independent review that slammed the State Department for inadequate security at the installation before the twin nighttime attacks that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11, 2012.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the two authors of the investigation — veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to meet privately with committee staff to answer questions about their review. Democrats countered that if Congress wants to talk to them, Issa should hold a full open hearing.

Republicans insist that the Obama administration misled Congress and the American people in the immediate aftermath of the attack, trying to play down an act of terrorism that would reflect poorly on Obama weeks before the 2012 presidential election.

Emails disclosed Friday showed that State Department and other senior administration officials pushed for references to prior warnings and al-Qaida to be deleted from the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. One email suggested that Congress could use those issues as ammunition against the State Department.

At a White House news conference, Obama dismissed the GOP focus on the talking points as a politically driven ""sideshow,"" pointing out that he said ""act of terror"" on Sept. 12 and the talking points assessment was similar to the daily presidential briefing he had received.

He also noted that Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress that Benghazi was a terrorist attack with potential links to al-Qaida three days after Rice's appearance on five Sunday talk shows.

Story continues

""So if this was some effort on our part to try to downplay what had happened or tamp it down, that would be a pretty odd thing that three days later we end up putting out all the information that in fact has now served as the basis for everybody recognizing that this was a terrorist attack and that it may have included elements that were planned by extremists inside of Libya,"" the president said. ""Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days?""

While Obama did refer to Benghazi as an act of terror, the president also cited protests over an anti-Islamic video in several interviews days after the attack, as did Rice on several Sunday news shows. He said Monday that ""nobody understood exactly what was taking place during the course of those first few days.""

The emails comprising the inter-agency discussion on how to best describe the events in Benghazi were shared with Congress as a condition for allowing the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director to move forward.

The general counsel for the office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed members and staff from the Senate Intelligence panel and leadership on the emails on Feb. 15 at a session in which staff could take notes. A similar briefing took place on March 19 for the House Intelligence panel and leadership staff, according to a senior administration official.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the individual was not allow to publicly discuss the process.

New details on the emails emerged last week. Obama argued that lawmakers had reviewed them several months ago but suddenly they were treated as fresh revelations.

""There's no 'there' there,"" the president said.

At the State Department, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said her agency didn't review the talking points until the night of Friday, Sept. 14 — ""after the reference to al-Qaida had actually been removed.""

The succession of revisions to the talking points only partly backs up that statement. A sentence ascribing some of the blame for the attacks to al-Qaida was stricken at 4:42 p.m. on Sept. 14, according to documents published by ABC News. But a reference to previous attacks in the region by al-Qaida-linked extremists remained in the talking points at 6:52 p.m.

Former State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland then complained at 7:39 p.m. and the paragraph was eliminated in the next revision at 8:59 p.m.

Although the talking points were heavily edited, Rice still referred to al-Qaida and extremists when she appeared on the Sunday shows.

""It's clear that there were extremist elements that joined and escalated the violence; whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself, I think, is one of the things we'll have to determine,"" she said.

Issa has argued that Congress needs to get the facts. He wants to hear from Pickering and Mullen about their investigation and he asked that they turn over documents, communications, lists of witnesses, notes and other material by Friday.

He pointed to the testimony of three State Department witnesses last week who criticized the Accountability Review Board's work as incomplete and flawed.

""The White House and the State Department have touted the ARB's report as the definitive account of how and why the Benghazi attacks occurred,"" Issa said in separate letters to Pickering and Mullen. ""It is necessary for the committee to understand whether the criticisms of the ARB's work that we heard from witnesses on May 8, 2013 are valid.""

But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, told Issa that he should bypass private depositions from the two men and go directly to an open hearing on May 22. Issa said to Pickering and Mullen that they would work out a hearing for their public testimony at a later date.

Their blistering report found that ""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels"" of the State Department meant that security was ""inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place."" They absolved former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, faulting lower level State Department officials.

Four State Department officials were reassigned or resigned in the wake of the Pickering-Mullen report.

""We knew where the responsibility rested,"" Pickering, a career Foreign Service officer who has worked for Republican and Democratic administrations, said Sunday.

For all the Washington furor, a Pew Research Center survey out Monday found the public paid limited attention to last week's House hearing in which a State Department official who was in Tripoli described his helplessness and frustration as the assault unfolded in Benghazi.

The survey found that 44 percent of Americans said they were following the hearings very or fairly closely, about the same percentage as in late January when Clinton testified on Capitol Hill. The number is down from the 61 percent who said they were following the initial stages of the investigation in October.

The survey of 1,000 adults found a split over whether the Obama administration is being honest about the attack and how Republicans are handling the issue, with partisanship affecting opinions. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

This is a Russian spy ring that would embarrass Anna Chapman.

Justice Department prosecutors last week filed charges against what they say is a group of current and former Russian diplomats who allegedly ran a nine-year scheme that bilked $1.5 million from Medicaid, the U.S. health benefits program for the poor.

But CNN has learned that there's a spy angle to this case. Federal counterintelligence investigators say they believe some of the alleged participants in the fraud scheme were also engaged in espionage, sources tell CNN. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were on the trail of the alleged spies for some time, sources say. But in the end, the Justice Department decided to bring only the fraud charges.



There are 49 people charged in the case - 25 current and former Russian diplomats and 24 of their spouses. But only 11 of them remain in the U.S. and all have diplomatic immunity. So unless the Russian government waives their immunity - which is unlikely - they can't be arrested. Instead, the State Department is expected to seek to have them sent home.

The case comes amid some tensions in U.S.-Russian relations over a variety of issues, from Syria and Iran to the Russian asylum granted to former National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Counterintelligence officials say Russian spying activity in the U.S. is back to near Cold War levels.

In 2010, the FBI rounded up a group of Russian sleeper agents who were part of what the U.S. called the Illegals Program. Ten people who posed as academics and business people were arrested, including Anna Chapman, now 31 years old. She posed as an entrepreneur and socialite, and garnered the most attention for her glamorous looks. Vice President Joe Biden joked on a talk show that he wouldn't have sent her back to Russia.

The U.S. and Russia conducted a spy swap to resolve the issue, after the 10 spies pleaded guilty. Another alleged Russian spy in the group fled after being arrested in Cyprus. And a 12th was deported.

While the Illegals used sophisticated communications methods to avoid detection, the latest group charged is portrayed in court documents more as common fraudsters.

It couldn't be learned how many of the 49 charged last week are suspected of spying and what type of activity the FBI investigators in New York and Washington believe they were involved in. But Manhattan federal prosecutors believed they didn't have enough evidence to bring espionage charges, one source said. In any case, U.S. officials view the fraud charges as more embarrassing to the Russian government.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara accused the 49 charged in the fraud case of ""picking pockets"" in the U.S. ""Here, as alleged, a multitude of Russian diplomats and their spouses ran a scam on a health care system designed to help Americans in need,"" Bharara said.

The accused work as mission, consulate and trade representatives in New York, although one also once worked at the embassy in Washington. The Russian government normally pays for medical costs of their employees, and those employees' children aren't generally eligible for U.S. citizenship at birth.

According to prosecutors, the diplomats falsified Medicaid benefits applications, under-reporting incomes or reporting no income to qualify. While they got benefits, they had a taste for high-end shopping, spending thousands at stores such as Tiffany and Bloomingdale's.

One former Russian diplomat charged is named Timur Salomatin, who with his wife, Nailya Babaeva, applied for Medicaid pregnancy benefits in November 2010 and represented Salomatin's salary to be $3,000 a month, and later $4,400 a month. The family got almost $31,000 in fraudulent Medicaid benefits, prosecutors say. While getting Medicaid benefits last year, the couple spent $50,000 on purchases from retailers such as Apple, Prada and Bloomingdale's, prosecutors allege."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/opinion/sunday/repeal-the-authorization-for-use-of-military-force-law.html,2013-03-10 00:00:00,[],Repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Law - The New York Times,"The concern that many, including this page, expressed about the authorization is coming true: that it could become the basis for a perpetual, ever-expanding war that undermined the traditional constraints on government power. The result is an unintelligible policy without express limits or protective walls.

Last Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said the president would soon shed more light on his “targeted killing” policy. Mr. Obama needs to. In the last few weeks, confusion over these issues has been vividly on display. On one hand, the administration has said it would use lethal force only when capturing a terrorist was impossible, and it did arrest Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden who once served as a spokesman for Al Qaeda, and arraigned him on Friday in federal court in Manhattan. The Washington Post reported last week that counterterrorism officials considered using the authorization law as the basis for the government’s authority to kill Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a militant leader in Algeria and Mali, but decided it did not apply because he was not part of Al Qaeda or an associated group.

But the administration still has not fully disclosed to Congress the legal documents on which the targeted killing program is based. And in that same article, The Post said the administration was debating whether it could stretch the law to make it apply to groups that had no connection, or only slight ones, to Al Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks.

A big part of the problem is that the authorization to use military force is too vague. It gives the president the power to attack “nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”

Making the law more specific, however, would only further enshrine the notion of a war without end. And, as Jeh Johnson, then counsel to the defense secretary, said in a speech last November, “War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs.”"

(CNN) —

Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists, shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus.

The revelations from Snowden, a former NSA contractor, about the American government’s surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices.

Here are five key takeaways from the interview, the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June.

Snowden says …

1. His mission is ‘already accomplished’

“For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished. I already won,” Snowden told The Washington Post’s Barton Gellman in Moscow. “As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”

Snowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May, taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs. He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian, a British newspaper.

The ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar, with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others. Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed, and Snowden has said there’s plenty more information still to be revealed.

His actions have had clear consequences.

A review of NSA surveillance practices ordered by the White House has recommended changes to the program, including greater judicial oversight and more public transparency in the collection of data. Key American allies, like Germany and Brazil, have publicly condemned U.S. surveillance of their leaders.

“All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed,” Snowden said. “That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals.”

Gellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating, but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA’s activities had been achieved.

2. He’s become ‘an indoor cat’

Snowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government’s attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property. And he’s not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia.

Gellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow, Snowden didn’t once “part the curtains or step outside.”

Snowden, 30, described his life as that of an “indoor cat.” He said he doesn’t drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips.

“It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,” he told Gellman. “I just don’t have a lot of needs. … Occasionally there’s things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it’s really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that’s more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.”

Gellman said Snowden is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway.

He said Snowden does not want to continuing being part of the story, but wants to see his cause advance.

Snowden has had continuous access to the Internet and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis, the Post reported.

People who visit him bring him books, but he doesn’t read them, preferring to get his information from the Internet.

Gellman reported that it was unclear to what degree Snowden was under surveillance by Russian authorities, saying that “no retinue” accompanied Snowden and that he didn’t see anybody else nearby.

3. He raised flags before going public

Snowden said some other people who worked for the NSA’s surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities.

He told Gellman that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the NSA’s Technology Directorate and the NSA Threat Operations Center’s regional base in Hawaii.

His co-workers were often “astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia,” Snowden told the Post.

A lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard, Snowden said, and several asked him not to tell them any more.

“I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?’ ” he said, according to the Post.

“How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?” he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the NSA’s internal channels for disagreement.

The NSA said in a statement to the Post that it had “not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.”

4. The intelligence community’s overseers ‘elected’ him

Snowden has faced widespread criticism over his actions from Obama administration officials and members of Congress. But he told Gellman that the U.S. government left him little choice.

Asked why he felt entitled to bring the NSA’s intrusive activities to public attention, Snowden told the Post: “That whole question – who elected you? – inverts the model. They elected me. The overseers.”

He singled out the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers, both of whom have voiced criticism of his leaks.

“It wasn’t that they put it on me as an individual – that I’m uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens – as that they put it on someone, somewhere,” he said. “You have the capability, and you realize every other (person) sitting around the table has the same capability but they don’t do it. So somebody has to be the first.”

He said his aim was not to bring down the NSA, but to improve it.

“I am still working for the NSA right now,” he said. “They are the only ones who don’t realize it.”

5. Personal attacks don’t faze him

Ever since he stepped into the public eye, Snowden has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story. The real issue, he says, is the NSA’s far-reaching surveillance programs.

He maintained that stance with Gellman, saying that he’s shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the NSA.

“Let them say what they want,” he said. “It’s not about me.”

He dismissed suggestions that he’s made any deals with the governments of the countries where he’s taken refuge from U.S. authorities.

“There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,” Snowden told Gellman. “I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.”

“If I defected at all,” Snowden said, “I defected from the government to the public.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/22/Paul-Ryan-doubles-down-on-move-to-cut-pensions-for-veterans,2013-12-22 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Paul Ryan Doubles Down on Cutting Veteran Pensions,"House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has doubled down on his move to cut pensions for military veterans in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday.

In the op-ed, Ryan opens up by highlighting the CBO estimate that the deal he cut with Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) would result in at least $20 billion in deficit reduction. “The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law,” Ryan wrote. “We think it’s a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.”

As Breitbart News has reported, Ryan’s and Murray’s budget deal does not reduce the deficit. In fact, the deal raises the deficit by at least $15.5 billion because of a series of gimmicks that Ryan and Murray employed in the accounting of the deal — namely, double counting of savings like the tactic which was employed in Obamacare, and the failure to include an estimate of the interest on the borrowed money for the first couple of years of increased spending. These are only a few among a series of other misleading statements Ryan has made about the deal.

The rest of Ryan’s op-ed is devoted to defending his decision to cut $6 billion worth of military pensions. “One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees,” Ryan wrote. “The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation. But even hesitance has a cost.” Citing the rising cost per service member since 2001, he then claimed that the need for reform is “undeniable.”

Ryan cited and praised President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel for his stance on the issue as well. Ryan wrote, “Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ‘that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD’s leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we’ll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.'”

Ryan then detailed what he says the changes to military veterans’ pensions would specifically do to veterans:

Here’s what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire–regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

Ryan characterized the change as a “small adjustment” in the next paragraph, even though he admitted it could affect veterans by as much as $100,000 or more over their lifetimes, depending on when they retire.

“All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees,” Ryan wrote. “If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year–just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.” Ryan then calculated that, for a hypothetical serviceman who enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, his benefits would change under the deal from about $1.8 million to $1.7 million.

“This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees,” Ryan wrote.

Despite Ryan’s claims these cuts are a “small adjustment” for veterans, that approximately $100,000, in some parts of the country, could be a significant percentage of the entire size of a mortgage for a house. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, in October the average size of a home loan in America was $289,650. Ryan’s “small adjustment” cuts to veterans would be more than a third, then, of the average mortgage — and in many cases, more than half of these veterans’ lifetime expenses for homeownership.

The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) estimates that the cuts could mean as much as $124,000 in lost retirement income for veterans, which would be even more significant losses of opportunity in the future for veterans.

Ryan argued that the approximately $6 billion in savings that cutting the pensions for America’s military veterans would garner for the federal treasury would “go right back to the military.”

“In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom,” Ryan wrote. “The commission’s recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”

Ryan said that for America to be able to afford the best equipment on the battlefield for active duty military, these pension cuts are necessary.

“For me, there’s simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ‘disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization,'” Ryan wrote. “Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops’ combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same. Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.”

In his op-ed, Ryan did not address the proposal in the House of Representatives gaining significant attention already from Reps. Martha Roby (R-AL) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Roby’s and Fitzpatrick’s plan would restore pensions for all military veterans and offset the savings those cuts create with savings from closing a loophole allowing illegal aliens access to the Refundable Child Tax Credit. Closing that loophole would save $7 billion — more than enough to ensure that the Pentagon gets the money it needs to buy top-notch military equipment.

Since Ryan and Murray’s budget deal increases spending and increases the federal deficit, many conservatives and even mainstream Republicans wonder why veterans’ pensions should be cut when there is wasteful spending like leaving that tax credit loophole open, or many of the new details that Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) detailed in his “Wastebook,” among other examples of wasteful spending.

Last week, Ryan avoided discussing the proposal when asked by Breitbart News about it. Instead, his spokesman Kevin Seifert said Ryan supports closing that illegal alien tax credit loophole but also supports cutting military pensions. Seifert would not answer when pressed on whether Ryan would back the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan, which is a House version of a Senate amendment Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, attempted to attach to the deal but could not due to the procedural blocking of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Now that he is backing up his decision to cut veterans’ pensions, Ryan has taken a stance that is directly averse to the the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan — something that could put Ryan at odds with a majority of the House GOP conference. Including Roby and Fitzpatrick, a total of 46 House Republicans have signed on to their bill as cosponsors. Powerful committee chairmen like House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) have also cosponsored the Roby-Fitzpatrick deal. This could foreshadow a battle between House GOP power players for the future direction of the conference."

Federal investigation wrestling with Snowden%27s ability to defeat safeguards

NSA director declined to say whether it knew how many files Snowden had taken

Deputy Attorney General said NSA monitors activities of employees using programs

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government's efforts to determine which highly classified materials leaker Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency have been frustrated by Snowden's sophisticated efforts to cover his digital trail by deleting or bypassing electronic logs, government officials told the Associated Press. Such logs would have showed what information Snowden viewed or downloaded.

The government's forensic investigation is wrestling with Snowden's apparent ability to defeat safeguards established to monitor and deter people looking at information without proper permission, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the sensitive developments publicly.

The disclosure undermines the Obama administration's assurances to Congress and the public that the NSA surveillance programs can't be abused because its spying systems are so aggressively monitored and audited for oversight purposes: If Snowden could defeat the NSA's own tripwires and internal burglar alarms, how many other employees or contractors could do the same?

In July, nearly two months after Snowden's earliest disclosures, NSA Director Keith Alexander declined to say whether he had a good idea of what Snowden had downloaded or how many NSA files Snowden had taken with him, noting an ongoing criminal investigation.

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines told the AP that Alexander ""had a sense of what documents and information had been taken,"" but ""he did not say the comprehensive investigation had been completed."" Vines would not say whether Snowden had found a way to view and download the documents he took without the NSA knowing.

In defending the NSA surveillance programs that Snowden revealed, Deputy Attorney General James Cole told Congress last month that the administration effectively monitors the activities of employees using them.

""This program goes under careful audit,"" Cole said. ""Everything that is done under it is documented and reviewed before the decision is made and reviewed again after these decisions are made to make sure that nobody has done the things that you're concerned about happening.""

The disclosure of Snowden's hacking prowess inside the NSA also could dramatically increase the perceived value of his knowledge to foreign governments, which would presumably be eager to learn any counterdetection techniques that could be exploited against U.S. government networks.

It also helps explain the recent seizure in Britain of digital files belonging to David Miranda — the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald — in an effort to help quantify Snowden's leak of classified material to TheGuardian newspaper. Authorities there stopped Miranda last weekend as he changed planes at Heathrow Airport while returning home to Brazil from Germany, where Miranda had met with Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker who has worked with Greenwald on the NSA story.

Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence contractor, was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii before leaking classified documents to the Guardian and The Washington Post. As a systems administrator, Snowden had the ability to move around data and had access to thumb drives that would have allowed him to transfer information to computers outside the NSA's secure system, Alexander has said.

In his job, Snowden purloined many files, including ones that detailed the U.S. government's programs to collect the metadata of phone calls of U.S. citizens and copy Internet traffic as it enters and leaves the U.S., then routes it to the NSA for analysis.

Officials have said Snowden had access to many documents but didn't know necessarily how the programs functioned. He dipped into compartmentalized files as systems administrator and took what he wanted. He managed to do so for months without getting caught. In May, he flew to Hong Kong and eventually made his way to Russia, where that government has granted him asylum.

NBC News reported Thursday that the NSA was ""overwhelmed"" in trying to figure what Snowden had stolen and didn't know everything he had downloaded.

Insider threats have troubled the administration and Congress, particularly in the wake of Bradley Manning, a young soldier who decided to leak hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents in late 2009 and early 2010.

Congress had wanted to address the insider threat problem in the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act, but the White House asked for the language to be removed because of concerns about successfully meeting a deadline. In the 2013 version, Congress included language urging the creation of an automated, insider-threat detection program."

Lab tests still pending on substance sent to Sen. Wicker

Ricin not considered effective for mass terrorism

WASHINGTON — The FBI said Wednesday it has arrested a Mississippi man ""believed to be responsible'' for mailing letters that tested positive for poisonous ricin to President Obama, a senator and another official.

Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested at his home in Corinth, Miss., the FBI said.

Curtis is ""the individual believed to be responsible for the mailings of the three letters sent through the U.S. Postal Service which contained a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin,'' the FBI said in a statement.

The White House and Capitol Hill were on alert after initial tests Wednesday showed that suspicious letters contained ricin, a deadly toxin.

As federal authorities investigated the letters to Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., several other senators reported that they, too, had received suspicious mail. The reports prompted U.S. Capitol Police to close portions of two congressional office buildings for a brief time.

Preliminary tests on the granular substance in the letter to Obama showed evidence of ricin, but additional lab analysis is underway to confirm that finding, according to an FBI statement. Similar testing is being done on the letter to Wicker, and results can take 24-48 hours.

Both letters bore a Memphis postmark, law enforcement authorities said. In an intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press, the FBI reports that both letters say: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" Both are signed, ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" wording that candidates use at the end of their broadcast political ads.



Ricin can be deadly if ingested or inhaled, but it's generally considered ineffective as a weapon for mass terrorism because it is very difficult to put it into an airborne form.



The letters to Obama and Wicker both were intercepted at off-site screening facilities where official mail is checked for potential contaminants.

Obama was briefed on the suspicious letters Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning, said White House press secretary Jay Carney.



Both the FBI and the White House stressed that there is no indication of any connection between the letters and Monday's twin bombings at the Boston Marathon. Carney cautioned that Americans shouldn't jump to any conclusions.

""Before we speculate or make connections that we don't know … we need to get the facts,"" Carney said.

The letter to Wicker was discovered first, on Tuesday, and Capitol Police said it contained a ""white granular substance."" The letter to Obama was revealed Wednesday morning.

Another suspicious package was received Wednesday morning at the Washington offices of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., according to Shelby's spokesman Jonathan Graffeo. He said the package is being investigated by Capitol Police and it was not known if it was similar to the ones addressed to Obama and Wicker.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., issued a statement saying that a suspicious letter was received Wednesday morning at his Saginaw, Mich., field office. He said the staffer who received the letter did not open it and turned it over to authorities, who are investigating and testing the letter for toxins.

""We do not expect to learn at least a preliminary result of those tests until late tonight or tomorrow,"" Levin said in a statement. ""The staffer who discovered the letter is being kept overnight at a local hospital for precautionary reasons, but has no symptoms. We do not know yet if the letter has any connection to suspicious mail sent to other public officials.""

Also Wednesday, authorities evacuated the Phoenix office of Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., after receiving reports of suspicious letters. Flake later announced that investigators had determined that there was no threat.

All routine mail to Congress and the White House is screened off-site, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said, but those tests can produce inconsistent results. If the tests indicate the possibility of a biological agent, the material is sent to an accredited laboratory for further analysis, and only those tests can confirm the presence of a biological agent.

As news of the letters spread Wednesday, tensions ran high at the Capitol. U.S. Capitol Police alerted congressional staff just after noon that they were investigating a suspicious package in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, as well as suspicious envelopes received in upstairs offices of both the Hart building and the nearby Russell Senate Office Building. The message advised staff that they were not required to stay in their offices, but to avoid the areas where the suspicious packages were being investigated.

An announcement in the buildings just before 1 p.m. said that test results on the packages were negative and closed off areas had reopened. Scott Ongill, a Senate staffer, said such alerts are not unusual. ""There is a couple, three (alerts) a week around the Capitol campus. It's not that uncommon an occurrence. They're doing due diligence."" He said they usually end up being tourists who left something.

Ricin is derived from the same plant used to produce castor oil. Because it is not readily put in the form of an aerosol that spreads easily through the air, it is considered far less worrisome as a weapon than anthrax, the substance mailed to members of Congress in shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in an episode that killed five and sickened 17 others.

""It's high school chemistry to make it, but it's not a serious bio threat,"" said Randall Larsen, former executive director of the WMD Commission, which was set up by Congress to investigate threats posed by weapons of mass destruction. ""You won't find bio-terror experts getting all upset by ricin. It's usually (used by) nut jobs doing something to try to get attention from people.""

Michael Osterholm, a former bioterrorism adviser to the George W. Bush administration who heads the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, called the interception of the ricin letters ""a success story.""

""It's a horrible situation that it happened but it's a success that it was found,"" Osterholm said. ""The ability to identify ricin in a letter was not in place before 2001. The U.S. mail is being tested for things like this. This was not a letter that got opened and someone said, 'Oh my gosh.'""

Handling a letter would be unlikely to give someone a lethal dose of ricin, Osterholm says. The poison is most dangerous when inhaled; getting it on one's fingers wouldn't pose that sort of risk. However, if someone is poisoned with ricin, there is no treatment and it can kill in one to three days.

Human trafficking issue is gaining political steam

Activism on the rise to combat problem

Modern-day slavery is being battled in several states

A wave of efforts to stop human trafficking has spread across the country as lawmakers and others look to combat the problem through law, policy, and grass-roots activism.

Although approaches vary, advocates say more must be done to stop the crime, dubbed ""modern-day slavery"" and defined by the State Department as the recruitment, transportation or harboring of people by means of deception or coercion. Victims, often mentally and physically abused, can be forced into prostitution, unfair working conditions, or other exploitative situations.

""Consciousness and outrage have reached a different level because of the perverseness but also the impact of human trafficking,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. ""People understand that everyone has a responsibility to fight human trafficking and every individual can have an impact.""

Cases of traffickers recruiting students at U.S. schools, selling sex online and in hotels, and operating slave enterprises alongside everyday life has led to increased awareness.

Two lawmakers in Maryland this month announced plans to toughen state laws on trafficking this year. In doing so, they joined a long list of people around the country working to make the crime in the United States a central topic of 2013.

Blumenthal and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, launched the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking in November and sponsored a bill that later became law to prevent federal contracts from going to companies that benefit from forms of trafficking. The law aims to hold contractors responsible by requiring them to notify the Inspector General if they receive ""credible evidence"" that a subcontractor has engaged in trafficking.

This week, Blumenthal and Portman also led a successful Senate vote to allow child victims of sex trafficking to receive help under the Violence Against Women Act. The House will now need to agree to that amendment.

Meanwhile, the bipartisan caucus will hold its first meeting this month. Blumenthal hopes the group will lead to more legislation, tougher enforcement of existing laws, and additional supportive services for victims.

The federal government hopes to become a model for change following announcements by President Obama last year about several new initiatives aimed at ending trafficking nationwide, Blumenthal said. The efforts include the first-ever assessment of the problem in this country and a $6 million grant to build solutions.

In Maryland, state Delegate Kathleen Dumais introduced a bill this month that would allow authorities to seize the assets of suspected traffickers and confiscate them if they are convicted. Delegate Susan Lee plans to introduce a bill that would increase the penalty for abducting someone under 16 for sexual exploitation from a misdemeanor to a felony.

Detective Thomas Stack of the Montgomery County police department says criminals are moving girls from states like California, Pennsylvania and New York into Maryland's massage parlors, brothels and hotels near Interstate 95, the Eastern Seaboard's busiest north-south corridor.

""Traffickers are no different than criminal enterprises and organized crime,"" he said, adding that last year, authorities rescued 36 juveniles involved in prostitution. ""They (traffickers) are making tremendous amounts of money, and they get to keep it, even if we catch them and they are convicted.""

Other initiatives aim to combat the problem.

The American Bar Association is training lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals to recognize signs that a defendant may be a trafficking victim and plans to encourage states to adopt uniform laws against the crime, said Laurel Bellows, the organization's president.

The group held a training session in Chicago last year and will host training in San Diego and Washington this year. Several schools, including Georgetown University, the University of Kansas and the University of Southern California, hosted conferences last month on the subject, inviting experts and victims to speak.

Everyday citizens such as Erin Giles, editor of End Sex Trafficking, have helped publish books on the topic, while celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith, head of Don't Sell Bodies, have started organizations.

Longtime activists such as Andrea Powell, executive director of Fair Girls, a non-profit group based in Washington, have redoubled their efforts by expanding operations and seeking more funding. For Powell, this year's focus will be on starting an office in Baltimore and getting specialized victim housing as well as passing laws that prohibit minors from being charged with prostitution, she said."

People are jumpy these days.

Social media and the stock market went wild, briefly, on Tuesday when this (hacked) Associated Press tweet appeared around 1 p.m.: ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.""

The AP took down its Twitter account and quickly announced it had been hacked.

The FBI is investigating the incident, said bureau spokeswoman Jenny Shearer.

Rest assured, there was no attack on the White House — and aides reported that President Obama was busy at work.

""The president is fine,"" spokesman Jay Carney said. ""I was just with him.""

A group of hackers loyal to embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad claimed responsibility for the hoax, tweeting out: ""Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.""

The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 128 points in seconds after the report. It recovered just as quickly when the report was found to be false.

The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on the incident, as did the New York Stock Exchange.

The incident took place eight days after the Boston Marathon bombings.

In a statement, the Associated Press said, ""The AP twitter account has been hacked. A tweet about an attack at the White House is false. We will advise on acct. status.""

The AP confirmed that its Twitter account has been suspended, and ""it was working to correct the issue.""

(Note: This tweet drew instant suspicion from journalists. The Associated Press style is to never refer to ""Barack Obama."" It is always ""President Barack Obama."" The service also normally capitalizes the word ""BREAKING"" when news happens.)

The wire service said its mobile Twitter account was also broken into, and all of its accounts have been shut down.

The Pentagon sent out an email suggesting the Apr. 23 meeting with Weinstein in the Pentagon was a one-time event, saying only, “Weinstein requested, and was granted, a meeting at the Pentagon [on] April 23, with the Air Force Judge Advocate General and others, to include the Deputy Chief of Chaplains, to express his concerns of religious issues in the military.”

However, this was not a single meeting. Instead it was part of a relationship that began one month after Barack Obama was sworn in as president. And it goes much higher up the military food chain than was reported last week: Weinstein met with a four-star general who was the highest-ranking officer in the United States Air Force.

The New York Times reported on Mar. 1, 2009, in a story entitled, “Questions Raised Anew About Religion in Military,” that Weinstein met with the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Norton Schwarz, on Feb. 24, 2009. The story noted this was the first time Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) had “gotten an audience with a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”

Weinstein had sued the Defense Department during the Bush administration as part of his anti-Christian crusade, so Pentagon top brass knew exactly who he was and what he was about when the new Obama administration met with him in 2009. This means he had been fully-vetted when the Obama-Hagel Defense Department decided to meet with him again on Apr. 23, 2013, to discuss how to stop evangelizing (that is, Christian proselytizing) within the military.

The Bush administration had fought Weinstein, saying that any instances of senior officers pressuring subordinates on religious matters were “not systematic problems, but isolated instances.” And biblical Christians fully object to any coercion, since evangelism is about people embracing the Christian faith wholeheartedly and sincerely, which no person could ever force upon another. It’s a matter of the heart, between every human being and their creator.

By contrast, while the Bush administration fought Weinstein, the Obama administration has embraced this anti-Christian activist.

The NYT story gives a laundry list of Weinstein and MRFF’s grievances against the Defense Department during the Bush administration, including a, “ceremony that began and ended with a Christian prayer…the appearance of uniformed officers at religious events, [and] displays of crucifixes at military chapels…”.

The story indicates that “Christian prayers” are prayers offered “in Jesus’ name.” It goes without saying that whenever anyone prays, they pray according to their own religious faith. (For example, you’re not likely to find a Muslim imam offering a Jewish prayer.) It’s just as common to hear a Christian mention Jesus in a prayer as it is to find a Muslim invoking the name of Mohammed.

It’s also no surprise that troops might be wearing their uniforms when they attend church services. Again, the Constitution does not forbid such things, since those troops have the right to peacefully practice and express their personal faith just like any other American.

But the fact that Weinstein has become an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon is evidence of how hostile an environment parts of the Defense Department are becoming to Christian service members under this administration, and possibly devout adherents of other peaceful faiths as well.

Article I of the Constitution empowers Congress to set the rules of conduct and discipline within the military, and Congress must do so now to protect the rights of our troops to live and share their faith.

The amendment, introduced by Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), co-sponsored by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) and over 30 other bipartisan members, would substantially curtail the NSA's domestic spying.

The amendment [pdf] basically defunds the NSA's dragnet collection of every bit of metadata on all phone records as well as other bulk records that have not yet been revealed. The amendment still would allow the NSA to collect information under the original intent—and understanding—of the law, that is information actually related to actual investigations.

The NSA and its supporters are, of course, fighting back. They've introduced a second amendment intended to peel support away from the Amash amendment. What this second amendment, from Rep. Richard Nugent (R-FL), does is to pretend that it will withhold funding for bulk collection, but it actually just reiterates what's already in the law, and it just reiterates the status quo.

Meanwhile, NSA chief Keith Alexander is lobbying House members in a

""top secret,"" ""emergency"" meeting to fight the Amash amendment.



NSA head Gen. Keith Alexander scheduled a last-minute, members-only briefing in response to the amendment, according to an invitation distributed to members of Congress this morning and forwarded to HuffPost. ""In advance of anticipated action on amendments to the DoD Appropriations bill, Ranking Member C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of the House Intelligence Committee invites your Member to attend a question and answer session with General Keith B. Alexander of the National Security Agency,"" reads the invitation. The invitation warned members that they could not share what they learned with their constituents or others. ""The briefing will be held at the Top Secret/SCI leveland will be strictly Members-Only,"" reads the invite.

So Alexander is personally lobbying, and making the meeting ""top secret,"" to make all these members of Congress—whose law his agency has been shamelessly flouting—feel invested in the system and feel important. Despite the panic Alexander is trying to foment in the House, the Amash amendment would not curtail the NSA's ability to conduct surveillanceInstead, it would try to force the agency to adhere to the law as it stands today.

This is the first vote, potentially as soon as Wednesday, the Congress is taking on the NSA's dragnet surveillance program. It's the first chance for members of Congress to tell the NSA to abide by existing law.

Please join with Daily Kos and RootsAction to urge your representative to vote in favor of the Amash amendment to begin curtailing the NSA domestic spying program."

Former Vice President Dick Cheney revives a dispute with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in an upcoming documentary, criticizing his former President George W. Bush administration colleague for rebuffing him on a decision that Cheney said believed have returned the nation to Iraq War-era levels of greatness.

In an interview given for the Showtime documentary, ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" which is set to air on March 15, Cheney spoke about the administration's deliberations over how to handle reports that Syria was developing a nuclear reactor in 2007.

Cheney wanted to bomb the site. Rice opted for a diplomatic route that involved taking the issue before the United Nations. The reactor was eventually destroyed by an Israeli air strike. Here's what Cheney said of the incident in the film, via Foreign Policy.

I thought [destroying the reactor] would reassert the kind of authority and influence we had back in '03 when we took down Saddam Hussein and eliminated Iraq as a potential source of WMD. Condi was on the wrong side of all those issues so we had significant issues.

As The New York Times reported, Cheney staked out this position before in his 2011 autobiography, ""In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir,"" recalling that he was the ""lone voice"" in favor of military action.

FP reached out to Rice, who defended the eventual outcome of the internal dispute.

""The situation turned out exactly how it should have,"" she told FP.

Cheney and Rice have publicly butted heads over Bush-era disagreements in the past. A passage of Cheney's ""In My Time"" claimed that Rice had ""tearfully admitted"" to the vice president that she had been wrong to urge Bush to apologize over false allegations about Iraq's attempts to develop weapons of mass destruction.

Rice pushed back on Cheney's claims at the time.

""It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?"" Rice said. ""I would never -- I don't remember coming to the vice president tearfully about anything in the entire eight years that I knew him."""

Snowden, a Hawaii resident who was interviewed by the U.K. newspaper in his hotel room in Hong Kong where he is hiding, said he has no regrets about going public—even if he never sees his family again.

""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things,"" Snowden said. ""I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under. ... I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.""

In a statement, Booz Allen confirmed Snowden ""has been an employee of our firm for less than 3 months"":

News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm. We will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter.

The White House declined to comment on the identification of the NSA leaker, according to a press pool report.

Snowden said he decided to leave his family, girlfriend and a comfortable, $200,000-a-year salary behind, and flew to Hong Kong on May 20. He said he chose China because ""they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent.""

The newspaper said it revealed Snowden's identity at his request, but that he is concerned it will become a distraction. ""I don't want public attention because I don't want the story to be about me,"" Snowden said. ""I want it to be about what the U.S. government is doing.""

Story continues

Snowden said he realizes the government will come after him the same way it did with Bradley Manning, the former U.S. soldier who is currently on trial, accused of providing thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks.

""All my options are bad,"" Snowden said. ""I could be rendered by the CIA. I could have people come after me. Or any of the third-party partners.""

Snowden said he's left his hotel room just three times in three weeks and is paranoid he's being watched.

""We have got a CIA station just up the road—the consulate here in Hong Kong—and I am sure they are going to be busy for the next week,"" he continued. ""And that is a concern I will live with for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be.""

Snowden said he ""carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal. Transparency is.

""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,"" he added. ""The only thing I can do is sit here and hope the Hong Kong government does not deport me. ... My predisposition is to seek asylum in a country with shared values. The nation that most encompasses this is Iceland. They stood up for people over Internet freedom. I have no idea what my future is going to be.""

A spokesman for National Intelligence Director James Clapper did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.

Last week, Clapper blasted the disclosure of the classified program, saying it had already done ""grave damage.""

Before Snowden's identity was revealed, Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, and Senate Intelligence Committee chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that those who leaked information about the NSA surveillance program should be charged with a crime.

""I absolutely think they should be prosecuted,"" Rogers said.

""I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,"" Snowden wrote in a note accompanying the first set of documents, according to the Guardian.

Snowden said he thought about disclosing the program sooner but was hopeful the election of President Barack Obama would change things. But ""[Obama] continued with the policies of his predecessor,"" Snowden said.

Last week, the president defended the NSA program as essential to national security.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society. And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity.""

Snowden, who enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003 hoping to fight in the Iraq War only to be discharged after breaking his legs in a training accident, told the Guardian, ""We have to decide why terrorism is a new threat. There has always been terrorism.""

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul said he would seek a Supreme Court challenge to the surveillance program.

""I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies: Ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,"" Paul said. ""If we get 10 million Americans saying we don’t want our phone records looked at, then maybe someone will wake up and something will change in Washington.""

Meanwhile, a petition urging the Obama administration to pardon Snowden was posted to the White House website on Sunday afternoon.

""Edward Snowden is a national hero and should be immediately issued a full, free, and absolute pardon for any crimes he has committed or may have committed related to blowing the whistle on secret NSA surveillance programs,"" the petition read.

By Sunday night, the Twitter hashtag ""#IStandWithEdwardSnowden"" was trending in the United States."
http://news.yahoo.com/officials-suspect-described-plot-miranda-013406616.html,,[],Officials: Suspect described plot before Miranda,"BOSTON (AP) — The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional right to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, U.S. officials said Wednesday.

Once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his rights on Monday, he immediately stopped talking, according to four officials of both political parties who were briefed on the interrogation but insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private.

After roughly 16 hours of questioning, investigators were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, the four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him.

It is unclear whether any of this will matter in court since the FBI says Tsarnaev confessed to a witness and U.S. officials said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene.

But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering.

Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email, ""This remains an ongoing investigation and we don't have any further comment.""

Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said.

The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough.

Story continues

The U.S. officials who discussed the terrorist database and other details of the investigation are in addition to those who discussed the Miranda warning. They were close to the investigation and insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt.

Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as ""two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.""

Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.

Dzhokhar's public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a ""true angel,"" and an aunt has insisted he's not guilty.

Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as ""close-controlled,"" meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.""

Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.

The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.

Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, ""I'm not going to talk about that.""

Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.

""Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him."" Schwartz said. ""And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn't change anything for me.""

The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia.

In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information.

Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade.

While in the U.S., the brothers received welfare benefits.

The Office of Health and Human Services in Massachusetts confirmed a Boston Herald report Wednesday that Tamerlan, his wife and daughter had received welfare benefits up until last year, when he became ineligible based on family income.

The state also says Tamerlan and his brother received welfare benefits as children through their parents while the family lived in Massachusetts.

Neither was receiving benefits at the time of the bombing.

At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing.

Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting.

""The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK,"" Biden said. ""When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye.""

The vice president also sounded a defiant note.

""The purpose of terror is to instill fear,"" he said. ""You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.""

In another milestone in Boston's recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed.

""I don't think there's going to be a sense of normalcy for a while,"" Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. ""There are scars here that will be with us for a long time.""

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-expected-announce-hagel-brennan-appointments-1-p-141546121--politics.html,,[],"Obama nominates Hagel for Defense, Brennan for CIA","President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Republican former Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to be defense secretary, and top White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be CIA director. Obama pressed the Senate to confirm them quickly, warning ""we don't like to leave a lot of gaps"" in senior national security posts.

""Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve,"" the president said in a ceremony in the White House's East Room, flanked by the former lawmaker, Brennan, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and acting CIA director Michael Morell.

Obama's announcement was his latest move to round out his second-term Cabinet, following his nomination of Democratic Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. He is also expected to name a new treasury secretary soon to replace the departing Timothy Geithner.

With both Hagel and Brennan expected to face a fight in the Senate, the president used his remarks to squeeze wary lawmakers.

“I hope that the Senate will act on these confirmations promptly. When it comes to national security, we don’t like to leave a lot of gaps between the time that one set of leaders transitions out and another transitions in,"" Obama said. “So we need to get moving quickly on this.”

Republican resistance to Hagel had been building before the official announcement. And even as Obama spoke, Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will vet Hagel's nomination, said he had ""serious concerns about positions"" his former colleague ""has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years.""

Hagel, who earned two Purple Hearts in Vietnam and still carries shrapnel in his chest, would be the first former enlisted soldier to head the Pentagon. But his nomination has drawn fire from Republican senators, who point to his votes against sanctions on Iran and complaints about the pro-Israel ""Jewish lobby.""

Story continues

Hagel has also moved to defuse objections from the gay and lesbian community over remarks he made in 1998, when he criticized James Hormel, President Bill Clinton's choice for ambassador to Luxembourg, for being ""openly, aggressively gay."" He apologized last week, calling the remark ""insensitive.""

White House officials expect a confirmation fight—but say it is one they will ultimately win. They predict that Hagel, who served two terms in the Senate and left office in January 2009, will face tough questions about administration plans for implementing spending cuts at the Pentagon, the increasingly tense standoff over Iran's nuclear program and the looming troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.

After voting in favor of the Iraq War in late 2002, Hagel infuriated conservatives by turning sharply against then-President George W. Bush's troop ""surge."" His outspoken criticisms drew fire from then-Vice President Dick Cheney.

""Let's say I believe firmly in Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican,"" Cheney told Newsweek in an interview. ""But it's very hard sometimes to adhere to that where Chuck Hagel is involved.""

Obama paid tribute to Hagel’s military service, and underlined that the former lawmaker knows that war is “something we only do when it’s absolutely necessary."" And he stressed that Hagel “represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in Washington” and predicted he would “speak his mind” from the Pentagon.

Hagel did not address criticisms of his approach to Israel in his remarks at the White House—but had aimed to refute them in an exclusive interview with his hometown Lincoln Journal Star. He insisted that foes of his nomination had “completely distorted” his record and that he had always shown “unequivocal, total support for Israel.”

There is ""not one shred of evidence that I'm anti-Israeli, not one (Senate) vote that matters that hurt Israel,"" he said.

Brennan's nomination to succeed retired Gen. David Petraeus—who left the CIA in November after admitting to an extramarital affair with his biographer—is not expected to face serious opposition. The meatiest parts of his confirmation hearings will likely take place behind closed doors, such as potentially sharp questions from liberal senators over Obama's controversial program of assassinating suspected extremists with drone strikes. Those attacks are deeply unpopular overseas, where they have been blamed for civilian casualties and tarred as violations of national sovereignty. But criticisms will likely focus more on the president's policies than on Brennan's general qualifications for the job.

Few aides, if any, better reflect Obama’s embrace of controversial Bush-era national security policies. After winning the White House in 2008, the president considered Brennan to head the CIA, but Brennan withdrew his name from consideration when it became apparent that his service under Bush had rendered him unconfirmable. Liberal groups had accused him of failing to stop the “enhanced interrogation techniques” that fit international definitions of torture, like waterboarding. In 2012, that connection is apparently no longer a disqualifier.

At the ceremony, the president highlighted Brennan's leadership of the war on al-Qaida and paid tribute to his work ethic: ""I'm not sure he's slept in four years.""

Brennan underlined that he was ""neither a Republican nor a Democrat,"" and vowed to ensure that the CIA ""has the tools it needs"" while pursuing ""a full and open discourse"" with Congress on intelligence activities.

Obama’s decision to go with Hagel comes after the White House backed off a confirmation battle last month over U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who was widely seen as the president’s favorite to succeed Clinton. Administration officials assessed that Rice could not be confirmed after centrist Republican Sen. Susan Collins came out against her.

Hagel's biggest obstacle is likely to be his comment, in a 2006 interview, that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here"" and his follow-up remark that ""I'm not an Israeli senator. I'm a United States senator."" Some of the former lawmaker's critics have suggested that those words mark him as hostile to Israel.

Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman said in a statement released Monday that he hoped Hagel would “clarify and explain his comments about the ‘Jewish Lobby’ that were hurtful to many in the Jewish Community” and address “concerns” about his approach to Israel.

Still, Foxman said: “Sen. Hagel would not have been my first choice, but I respect the president’s prerogative.”

Democrats have 55 votes in the Senate (including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine). Republicans have 45. Sixty are needed for confirmation.

Panetta and Morell both spoke at the event and warmly endorsed their would-be successors. Panetta brought down the house with a quip about his plans to leave public service after a half-century to spend more time with his family and his walnut farm where, he says, he'd be ""dealing with a different set of nuts.""

The Arizona Republic

About 125 people attended the meeting with Sen. John McCain in Phoenix

He had a second meeting the same day in Tucson%2C will have another Friday in Prescott%2C Ariz.

Full Senate vote on a Syria resolution is expected next week%3B House timing less certain

PHOENIX — Sen. John McCain felt the heat of opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria during a town hall meeting here that exposed the emotions and ethic and religious tensions connected to the crisis in the Middle East.

During his opening remarks to the more than one-hour session Thursday, McCain, R-Ariz., had just begun to say that he was against ""having a single American boot on the ground"" in the Syrian civil war when war opponents shouting ""not good enough"" and ""not good enough at all"" interrupted.

""You don't respect our view! We didn't send you to get war for us. We sent you to stop the war,"" one man yelled from the audience of about 125 people.

Throughout the meeting, critics of the plan to strike Syria told McCain that the United States shouldn't get involved when Syria's neighbors are refusing ""to lift a finger"" to help, that the U.S. public is against a new war, and that the U.S. has domestic priorities to focus on instead of an attack. One noted that Saddam Hussein's Iraq used chemical weapons in the 1980s without a similar response from the United States.

The crowd waved signs with messages such as ""Don't Bomb Syria!!!"" and ""Shame on McCain!"" The scene was largely repeated later Thursday at a second town hall meeting in Tucson, Ariz., although a few Syrian-Americans argued for intervention, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

President Barack Obama has asked Congress to authorize a limited military strike against Syria in response to the administration's conclusion that Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his own people.

As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, McCain voted Wednesday to support a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria. The full Senate is expected to vote next week; House timing is less certain.

""First of all, I understand your skepticism,"" McCain told the at-times hostile crowd in Phoenix, which leaned strongly against attacking Syria. ""I understand your concern about the United States of America getting involved in another conflict the way that we got involved in Iraq, telling the American people that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason to commit our American blood and treasure, and it turned out it was not true.""

However, McCain said the situation is serious because it is clear that Assad's regime used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people.

""I'm sure that all of you have seen those graphic and terrible pictures on television, of those children's bodies stacked up,"" McCain said. ""It breaks our heart to see that kind of thing happening to innocent women and children.""

McCain emphasized that no one contemplates American troops on the ground in Syria because Congress wouldn't agree to it and the American public wouldn't stand for it.

To the point about Syria's neighbors, McCain said some of them ""are the only ones right now ... that are providing weapons to the (opposition) Free Syrian Army.""

Unless the U.S. acts, Assad would get ""a green light to use chemical weapons again,"" and Iran and North Korea also would be emboldened, he said. Doing nothing could lead to bigger problems for the U.S. in the future.

""There's no good option here. If I had a good option for you, I would tell you exactly what it is,"" McCain said.

But Jumana Hadeed, a Syrian-American who lives in Phoenix, said the best option is ""diplomacy and negotiation, not bombs.""

Hadeed told McCain that an 18-year-old cousin of hers was killed 10 days ago ""by the so-called rebels and al-Qaeda,"" adding that foreign fighters are streaming into Syria. But she warned against U.S. intervention.

""Enough is enough. We do not want another engagement in the Middle East,"" she said. ""Whether you like Bashar Assad or not — I am not a fan, either — but at least he has a secular government going on over there.""

After the town hall meeting, which will be repeated Friday in Prescott, Ariz., McCain told members of the media that he is listening to his constituents. He said some in the audience support intervention in Syria and ""there's passion on both sides.""

As McCain was speaking to reporters, one Assad critic from Chandler, Ariz., who identified himself only as ""Ra'ed"" urged him to make the point that Assad was responsible for American military deaths in Iraq.

McCain called on Obama to better communicate to the American people why the action against Syria is necessary.

""I think that it's clear that the American people are frustrated by Iraq, and understandably so,"" McCain said. ""I think they're very reluctant for what may appear to be further American involvement that would endanger any American boot on the ground. And I think that the president of the United States, speaking from the Oval Office, can provide the American people with the assurance that is necessary. And the president is the only person who can do that.""

McCain grew impatient with a journalist who asked a question suggesting that he had made up his mind on Syria.

""Do you think I would be having a town hall meeting if I had my mind totally made up? Do you?"" McCain responded. ""Well, you're asking a dumb question. You're really asking dumb questions."""

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor now in Moscow.

Instead, this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.

In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the State Department from allowing Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, to build about half a dozen of these structures, known as monitor stations, on United States soil, several American officials said.

They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry, the officials said. These monitor stations, the Russians contend, would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of Moscow’s version of the Global Positioning System, the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks."

Unfortunately, not enough members of Congress performed due diligence before they approved the war.

Here are some key questions which President Obama has yet to answer in the call for congressional approval for war against Syria. This article is a call for independent thinking and congressional oversight, which rises above partisan considerations.

The questions the Obama administration needs to answer before Congress can even consider voting on Syria:

Claim #1. The administration claims a chemical weapon was used.

The UN inspectors are still completing their independent evaluation.

Who provided the physiological samples of sarin gas on which your evaluation is based? Were any other non-weaponized chemical agents discovered or sampled?

Who from the United States was responsible for the chain of custody?

Where was the laboratory analysis conducted?

Were U.S. officials present during the analysis of the samples? Does your sample show military grade or lower grade sarin gas?

Can you verify that your sample matches the exact composition of the alleged Syrian government composition?



Further reading: Brown Moses blog; McClatchy News report; Global Research report.

Claim #2: The administration claims the opposition has not used chemical weapons.

Which opposition?

Are you speaking of a specific group, or all groups working in Syria to overthrow President Assad and his government?

Has your administration independently and categorically dismissed the reports of rebel use of chemical weapons which have come from such disparate sources as Russia, the United Nations, and the Turkish state newspaper?

Have you investigated the rumors that the Saudis may have supplied the rebels with chemicals that could be weaponized?

Has the administration considered the ramifications of inadvertently supporting al Qaeda-affiliated Syrian rebels?

Was any intelligence received in the last year by the U.S. government indicating that sarin gas was brought into Syria by rebel factions, with or without the help of a foreign government or intelligence agents?

Further reading: Global Research report; Wall Street Journal article; Reuters story; Zaman story (in Turkish -- see Google translate from Turkish to English); Atlantic Sentinel story; AP story

Claim #3: The administration claims chemical weapons were used because the regime's conventional weapons were insufficient

Who is responsible for the conjecture that the reason chemical weapons were used against the Damascus suburbs is that Assad's conventional weapons were insufficient to secure ""large portions of Damascus""?

Claim #4: The administration claims to have intelligence relating to the mixing of chemical weapons by regime elements

Who saw the chemical weapons being mixed from August 18th on?

Was any warning afforded to the Syria opposition and if not, why not?

If, on August 21st a ""regime element"" was preparing for a chemical weapons attack, has an assessment been made which could definitively determine whether such preparation (using gas masks) was for purpose of defense, and not offense?

Further reading: McClatchy report; Brown Moses blog



Claim #5: The administration claims intelligence that Assad's brother ordered the attack

What is the type of and source of intelligence which alleges that Assad's brother personally ordered the attack?

Who made the determination that Assad's brother ordered the attack, based on which intelligence, from what source?

Further reading: here

Claim #6: The administration claims poison gas was released in a rocket attack

Who was tracking the rocket and the artillery attack which preceded the poison gas release?

Did these events occur simultaneously or consecutively?

Could these events, the rocket launches and the release of poison gas, have been conflated?

Based upon the evidence, is it possible that a rocket attack by the Syrian government was aimed at rebels stationed among civilians and a chemical weapons attack was launched by rebels against the civilian population an hour and a half later?

Is it possible that chemical weapons were released by the rebels -- unintentionally?

Explain the 90-minute time interval between the rocket launch and chemical weapon attacks.

Has forensic evidence been gathered at the scene of the attack which would confirm the use of rockets to deliver the gas?

If there was a rocket launch would you supply evidence of wounds from the rockets impact and explosion?

What is the source of the government's analysis?

If the rockets were being tracked via ""geospatial intelligence,"" what were the geospatial coordinates of the launching sites and termination locations?

Further reading: FAIR.org report

Claim #7: The administration claims 1,429 people died in the attack

Secretary Kerry claimed 1,429 deaths, including 426 children. From whom did that number first originate?

Further reading: McClatchy report



Claim #8: The administration has made repeated references to videos and photos of the attack as a basis for military action against Syria

When and where were the videos taken of the aftermath of the poison gas attack?

Further reading: FAIR.org report

Claim #9: The administration claims a key intercept proves the Assad regime's complicity in the chemical weapons attack

Will you release the original transcripts in the language in which it was recorded as well as the translations relied upon to determine the nature of the conversation allegedly intercepted?

What is the source of this transcript? What was the exact time of the intercept? Was it a U.S. intercept or supplied from a non-U.S. source?

Have you determined the transcripts' authenticity? Have you considered that the transcripts could have been doctored or fake?

Was the ""senior official,"" whose communications were intercepted, a member of Assad's government?

How was he ""familiar"" with the offensive? Through a surprised acknowledgement that such an attack had taken place? Or through actual coordination of said attack? Release the transcripts!

Was he an intelligence asset of the U.S., or our allies? In what manner had he ""confirmed"" chemical weapons were used by the regime?

Who made the assessment that his intercepted communications were a confirmation of the use of chemical weapons by the regime on August 21st?

What is the source of information that the Syrian chemical weapons personnel were ""directed to cease operations""?

Is this the same source who witnessed regime officials mixing the chemicals?

Does the transcript indicate whether the operations they were ""directed to cease"" were related to ceasing conventional or chemical attacks?

Will you release the transcripts and identify sources of this claim?

Do you have transcripts, eyewitness accounts or electronic intercepts of communications between Syrian commanders or other regime officials which link the CW attack directly to President Assad?

Who are the intelligence officials who made the assessment -- are they U.S. intelligence officials or did the initial analysis come from a non-U.S. source?

Claim #10: The administration claims that sustained shelling occurred after the chemical weapons attack in order to cover up the traces of the attack

Please release all intelligence and military assessments as to the reason for the sustained shelling, which is reported to have occurred after the chemical weapons attack.

Who made the determination that was this intended to cover up a chemical weapon attack? Or was it to counterattack those who released chemicals?

How does shelling make the residue of sarin gas disappear?

Story highlights Syria says chemical weapons resolution applies to all parties U.S., Russia warn of consequences if Syria does not abide to resolution Kerry says world community imposing binding obligation on Syria Another body agrees to fast-track Syria entry into Chemical Weapons Convention

(CNN) —

The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons – or face consequences.

“Today’s resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability,” Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.

The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials said left at least 1,400 people dead.

The resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States.

The 15-member Security Council met shortly after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, voted to fast-track Syria’s addition to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such weapons.

For nearly two years, the U.N. Security Council had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to Syria’s civil war. Russia and China repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to October 2011 that condemned President Bashar al-Assad’s government and called for him to step down.

The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a “red line” with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.

Syria announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement.

A binding obligation

Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of al-Assad to get rid of its stockpile.

“This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable,” said Kerry.

If the resolution succeeds, the world “will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on Earth, eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on Earth,” Kerry said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, “will stand ready to take action” if the resolution needs enforcement.

By agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal, “Damascus has shown its readiness to cooperate,” said Lavrov.

Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons.

Inspectors return to Syria

U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use – some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels.

U.N. inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh in August, but have not explicitly said who was responsible.

The al-Assad government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most Western leaders.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands. That group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes.

“We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria,” OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan.

The OPCW agreed to an “accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014,” it said in a statement. Inspections in Syria will begin Tuesday.

“The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction, which will be set by the council by 15 November,” the organization said.

Obama: ‘Very hopeful’

Obama, speaking before the votes, said he was “very hopeful” about the developments, but warned much work remains to be done.

“I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there’s still fighting going on the ground,” Obama said.

Obama said the threat of U.S. military power pushed Syrian leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution “not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action.”

The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday.

The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, the group may opt for a “quick and dirty” program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn’t destroy them, the official said.

U.S. official: Syrian CW list more complete than anticipated

’Not a license to kill’

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his country is willing to transport and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, although only as part of an international coalition.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier in September took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria.

Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in the piece, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran’s nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism.”

In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting.

“As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns,” he said. “A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others. This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons.”

Syria submits ‘initial disclosure’ of chemical weapons program

’No meaningful enforcement mechanisms’

Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war.

“This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality,” John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. “It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime’s noncompliance.”

The pair said al-Assad’s forces will continue to “use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons” on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.

Panetta is lifting the military’s official ban on women in combat, which will open up hundreds of thousands of additional front-line jobs to them, senior defense officials said Wednesday.

The groundbreaking decision overturns a 1994 Pentagon rule that restricts women from artillery, armor, infantry and other such combat roles, even though in reality women have frequently found themselves in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan; according to the Pentagon, hundreds of thousands of women have deployed in those conflicts. As of last year, more than 800 women had been wounded in the two wars and more than 130 had died.

Defense officials offered few details about Mr. Panetta’s decision but described it as the beginning of a process to allow the branches of the military to put the change into effect. Defense officials said Mr. Panetta had made the decision on the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Women have long chafed under the combat restrictions and have increasingly pressured the Pentagon to catch up with the reality on the battlefield. The move comes as Mr. Panetta is about to step down from his post and would leave him with a major legacy after only 18 months in the job."

As President Obama’s administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Sunstein’s post was considered one of the most powerful in Washington, given its ability to shape how laws were implemented.

Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama’s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is currently Obama’s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for “overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.” In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo-”independent” advocates to “cognitively infiltrate” online groups and websites — as well as other activist groups — which advocate views that Sunstein deems “false conspiracy theories” about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens’ faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists.

What was left out of that little biography is Sunsteins advocation for some rather creepy stuff as reported by a little known reporter Glenn Greenwald in 2010:This is where I would normally comment about the recent rash of posters defending these violations of privacy labeling everything as 'Greenwaldian' or 'conspiracy theories'... but no, I wont do that.

Instead here is a link to that paper and some more that is in it:



He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called “independent” credible voices to bolster the Government’s messaging (on the ground that those who don’t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false “conspiracy theories,” which they define to mean: “an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.”

""Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.""

they suggest that ""government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,"" further warning that ""too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, ""might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.""

From Wikipedia It gets worse.

The authors declare that there are five responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: ""We can readily imagine a series of possible responses.



1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help."" However, the authors advocate that each ""instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).""

Counterspeech. Orwell'ian eh?

Sunstein also helped develop the theory of availability cascade, which when applied to his views on infiltrating social-media, should be of some interest to Dailykos users, who recognize familiar behavior:



An availability cascade is a self-reinforcing cycle that explains the development of certain kinds of collective beliefs. A novel idea or insight, usually one that seems to explain a complex process in a simple or straightforward manner, gains rapid currency in the popular discourse by its very simplicity and by its apparent insightfulness. Its rising popularity triggers a chain reaction within the social network: individuals adopt the new insight because other people within the network have adopted it, and on its face it seems plausible. The reason for this increased use and popularity of the new idea involves both the availability of the previously obscure term or idea, and the need of individuals using the term or idea to appear to be current with the stated beliefs and ideas of others, regardless of whether they in fact fully believe in the idea that they are expressing. Their need for social acceptance, and the apparent sophistication of the new insight, overwhelm their critical thinking."

Will: Obama talks himself into trouble with Syria,"Barack Obama’s foreign policy dream — cordial relations with a Middle East tranquilized by “smart diplomacy” — is in a death grapple with reality. His rhetorical writhings illustrate the perils of loquacity. He has a glutton’s, rather than a gourmet’s, appetite for his own rhetorical cuisine, and he has talked America to the precipice of a fourth military intervention in the crescent that extends from Libya to Afghanistan.

Characterizing the 2011 Libyan project with weirdly passive syntax (“It is our military that is being volunteered by others to carry out missions”), he explained his sashay into Libya’s civil war as preemptive: “I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action.”

With characteristic self-satisfaction, Obama embraced the doctrine “R2P” — responsibility to protect civilians — and Libya looked like an opportunity for an inexpensive morality gesture using high explosives.

Last August, R2P reappeared when he startled his staff by offhandedly saying of Syria’s poison gas: “A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.” The interesting metric “whole bunch” made his principle mostly a loophole and advertised his reluctance to intervene, a reluctance more sensible than his words last week: Syria’s recidivism regarding gas is “going to require America’s attention and hopefully the entire international community’s attention.” Regarding that entirety: If “community” connotes substantial shared values and objectives, what community would encompass Denmark, Congo, Canada, North Korea, Portugal, Cuba, Norway, Iran, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Yemen?

Words, however, are so marvelously malleable in the Obama administration that the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “coup” (“a change in the government carried out violently or illegally”) somehow does not denote what happened in Egypt. Last week, an Obama spokesman said: “We have made the determination that making a decision about whether or not a coup occurred is not in the best interests of the United States.” So convinced is this White House of its own majesty and of the consequent magic of its words, it considers this a clever way of saying the law is a nuisance.

Section 508 of the Foreign Assistance Act forbids aid to “any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup” until the president determines that “a democratically elected government” has been restored. Secretary of State John Kerry was perhaps preparing to ignore this when he said something Egypt’s generals have not had the effrontery to claim — that the coup amounted to “restoring democracy.”

Perhaps Section 508 unwisely abridges presidential discretion in foreign policy, where presidents arguably deserve the almost unfettered discretion they, with increasing aggressiveness, assert everywhere. And perhaps if Obama were not compiling such a remarkable record of indifference to law, it would be sensible to ignore his ignoring of this one.

But remember Libya. Since the War Powers Resolution was passed over Richard Nixon’s veto in 1973, presidents have at least taken care to act “consistent with” its limits on unilateral presidential war-making. Regarding Libya, however, Obama was unprecedentedly cavalier, even though he had ample time to act consistent with the Constitution by involving a supportive Congress. As Yale Law School’s Bruce Ackerman then argued:

“Obama has overstepped even the dubious precedent set when President Bill Clinton bombed Kosovo in 1999. Then, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel asserted that Congress had given its consent by appropriating funds for the Kosovo campaign. It was a big stretch, given the actual facts — but Obama can’t even take advantage of this same desperate expedient, since Congress has appropriated no funds for the Libyan war. The president is simply using money appropriated to the Pentagon for general purposes to conduct the current air campaign.”

Obama is as dismissive of “red lines” he draws as he is of laws others enact. Last week, a State Department spokeswoman said his red line regarding chemical weapons was first crossed “a couple of months ago” and “the president took action” — presumably, announcing (non-lethal) aid to Syrian rebels — although “we’re not going to outline the inventory of what we did.”

The administration now would do well to do something that the head of it has an irresistible urge not to do: Stop talking.

If a fourth military intervention is coming, it will not be to decisively alter events, which we cannot do, in a nation vital to U.S. interests, which Syria is not. Rather, its purpose will be to rescue Obama from his words.

According to USA Today’s immigration beat writer Alan Gomez, NIF is planning to organize the fly in with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy.

“The fly-in is being organized not by conservative groups, but organizations that have focused on legalizing millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally and changing the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers,” Gomez wrote on Monday. He noted that the 300 activists for an immigration grand bargain were looking to make what he described as a “conservative pitch” for amnesty.

Gomez noted NIF’s Executive Director, Ali Noorani, who “has advocated for changes in immigration law to help legal and undocumented immigrants for three decades,” claimed “the broad collection coming to Washington represents ‘the conservative base of the Republican Party.'”

The event will take place on Oct. 28, coinciding with President Barack Obama’s and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s renewed push against House Speaker John Boehner for amnesty. Now that Obama, Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are publicly pushing for amnesty after many mainstream media outlets declared it dead earlier this year, Soros’ groups are trying to make it appear as though conservatives support immigration legislation like the Senate-passed “Gang of Eight” bill. Ultimately, the left’s goal is to get the House to pass a series of piecemeal immigration bills and then combine them with the Senate bill in a conference committee.

Soros is heavily involved in funding the lobbying for amnesty. After Breitbart News exposed NIF for being Soros-funded while running a campaign to make it appear as though evangelicals support granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, Noorani admitted his group accepts funding from Soros. Noorani denies that the funding was being used for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), a project that his group runs the operations of, but admits that millions of NIF’s dollars come from Soros and that about 10 percent of its budget this year comes from the leftwing billionaire.

Soros is also intimately connected to Facebook’s Zuckerberg’s FWD.us push for amnesty. Zuckerberg hired Soros’ former chief financial strategist Stanley Druckenmiller. Druckenmiller served as Soros’ chief strategist for more than a decade.

Mitt Romney’s top 2012 campaign donor, Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Singer, also funds NIF, as Breitbart News has reported."

Guardian%3A Obama asked for potential cybertargets

Cyberdefense a priority%2C U.S. government official says

Pentagon revising rules for cyberweapons

WASHINGTON – In a secret directive issued last year, President Obama ordered the government to draw up potential overseas cybertargets in the event the United States would be required to launch its own cyberattacks, according to a published report.

The Guardian newspaper in London published the directive, which was issued by the president last October. USA TODAY could not independently confirm the authenticity of the directive.

Last October, the White House released talking points about the directive, mostly pertaining to improving cooperation between industry and government to defend against cyberattacks.

Friday, a National Security Council spokeswoman did not confirm the contents of the memo, which The Guardian published on its website but said the directive was part of Obama's effort to make cyberdefense a priority.

""This directive establishes principles and processes for the use of cyberoperations so that cyber-tools are integrated with the full array of national security tools we have at our disposal,"" Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman, said in a statement.

The U.S. government has said it has developed offensive and defensive capabilities, and the order appears to be an effort to establish ground rules for their use.

It comes as the Pentagon is revising its own ""rules of engagement"" for using cyber-weapons.

The directive says the United States would seek approval from other countries if the cyber-operation would impact networks within their borders. The order as published by The Guardian says that by drawing up potential targets in advance, the United States will be better positioned to strike quickly if called upon to do so."

Resignation, coming less than two years after his confirmation, could signal a coming shakeup of the national security team.

President Obama will nominate the former GOP senator to be secretary of defense.

President Obama will nominate the former GOP senator to be secretary of defense.

President Obama plans to nominate former senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam War veteran, to be secretary of defense, according to a person close to the process and a senior administration official.

The White House informed the Hagel camp over the weekend that Obama intends to announce the nomination Monday. The administration said early Monday that the president also would nominate counterterrorism adviser John Brennan as the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Hagel’s successful nomination would add a well-known Republican to the president’s second-term Cabinet at a time when he is looking to better bridge the partisan divide, particularly after a bitter election campaign.

But the expected nomination has drawn sharp criticism in recent weeks, particularly from Republicans, who have questioned Hagel’s commitment to Israel’s security.

The choice sets up a confirmation fight of the sort that Obama appeared unwilling to have over Susan E. Rice, his preferred pick for secretary of state. Rice pulled out of consideration for that job last month after facing sharp Republican criticism about her characterization of the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

In an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called Hagel’s selection an “in-your-face nomination.”

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Hagel’s record would be given a fair shake in the Senate if he is nominated. McConnell stopped short of saying whether he would support his former colleague.

“He’s certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.” He added: “The question we’ll be answering, if he’s the nominee, is: Do his views make sense for that particular job? I think he ought to be given a fair hearing, like any other nominee. And he will be.”

The Hagel nomination will begin what White House officials have said will probably be a busy week of announcements about who will fill Obama’s second-term Cabinet and senior staff positions.

The president returned Sunday from a curtailed holiday in Hawaii and will begin making final personnel decisions that were delayed by the year-end negotiations with Congress over taxes and spending cuts.

Despite the opposition to a Hagel nomination that has arisen on Capitol Hill, a senior administration official said Sunday that the White House expects him to receive the support of Democrats, as well as many Republicans who served with him.

“Having a name floated and having one officially put forward are two different things,” the official said.

Hagel, who was twice awarded the Purple Heart for wounds suffered in Vietnam, served in the Senate for two terms, ending in 2009.

He was an outspoken and often independent voice as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, breaking with many in his party to sharply criticize the management of the Iraq war after he initially supported the U.S.-led invasion.

“A lot of Republican opposition is rooted in the fact that he left his party on Iraq,” the senior administration official said. “And we think it will be very hard for Republicans to stand up and be able to say that they oppose someone who was against a war that most Americans think was a horrible idea.”

Hagel also has been a strong advocate for veterans, an issue that Obama has spoken about frequently as tens of thousands of U.S. troops return from battlefields after more than a decade of war. The administration official said Hagel, as a result, is “uniquely qualified” to help wind down the war in Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and make budget decisions to support the returning troops.

Some of the recent criticism directed at Hagel has focused on his mixed record over the imposition of sanctions on Iran. As a senator, Hagel opposed several bills to impose unilateral sanctions on Iran. But he also supported measures to put in place sanctions as part of multinational efforts, and he endorsed labeling Iran a state sponsor of terrorism.

Hagel’s record has raised concern among some of Israel’s supporters in the United States, who fear that he may not be sufficiently committed to that country’s security.

But his defenders point to his record as a senior senator on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he voted for nearly $40 billion in military aid to Israel over his tenure.

Obama, who worked with Hagel on nuclear nonproliferation issues and other foreign policy matters in the Senate, has vowed to prevent Iran from using its uranium-enrichment program to develop a nuclear weapon.

Obama has worked to tighten both U.S. and international sanctions to pressure Iran into giving up the effort, moves that Hagel has supported in recent interviews. The Iranian government has said that it is pursuing nuclear power, not weapons.

A network of supporters

Since leaving office, Hagel has served as co-chairman of Obama’s intelligence advisory board. Hagel has advised the president to open talks with Hamas, the armed Palestinian movement that does not recognize Israel’s right to exist. He also has complained about the influence that Israel’s supporters exert on members of Congress, telling writer Aaron David Miller in an interview for his 2008 book that “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.”

“If Hagel is nominated, it is very difficult to imagine a circumstance in which I could support his nomination,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said on “Fox News Sunday.”

But Hagel has many supporters, including former ambassadors, senators and secretaries of state who value his experience and independence.

A network of supporters has rallied in recent weeks to defend Hagel’s record as the criticism has grown. The supporters also said privately that they expect him to receive strong public backing from many Republicans and Democrats alike once the nomination is official.

Writing last week in the Wall Street Journal, Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, called Hagel “a statesman,” adding that “America has few of them.”

Hagel, 66, would be taking over the Pentagon at a time of budget cuts and a changing mission after two long wars. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is retiring to his home in California. Hagel would become Obama’s third defense secretary; Robert M. Gates, a member of the George W. Bush administration, was retained in the post until 2011.

If confirmed, Hagel would be the second Republican in Obama’s Cabinet, after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

“As a transit passenger he is still in the transit hall [of the airport],” Putin said at a news conference in neighboring Finland, where he was on an official visit. “Our special services have never worked with Mr. Snowden and they are not working [with him] today.”

He noted that Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States, and “we can extradite some people only to states with which we have corresponding agreements.”

He added: “On the territory of the Russian Federation, Mr. Snowden has committed no crimes, thank God. Mr. Snowden is a free man and the sooner he chooses his final destination the better both for him and for us.”

Snowden, who is wanted by the United States for leaking classified documents while working as a contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency, flew from Hong Kong to Moscow on Sunday and hasn’t been seen since. He was presumed to have been en route to Ecuador via Cuba, but he was not seen on a flight from Moscow to Havana on Monday.

With speculation running wild about his whereabouts, including a theory that he might have flown to Minsk, Belarus, Putin appeared to have put an end, for the moment, to that part of the international spy mystery.

In addressing the question of whether Russia should hand Snowden over to U.S. authorities, Putin cited the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Sweden in a sex case. Assange has been given asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

“Assange as well as Snowden consider themselves human rights activists and claim that they are struggling for [free] spreading of information,” said the Russian president, who has exerted ruthless control over information and media in Russia. “I am asking myself a question whether such people should be extradited to be put in prison.

“In any case,” he added, in a typically colorful aphorism, “I would prefer not to deal in these matters because it is like shearing a pig – lots of screeching but little wool.”

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia has “nothing to do with either Mr. Snowden or his relations with the U.S. justice or his movements around the world.”

(CNN) —

Two years after the end of the Iraq war, the U.S. State Department confirmed this week that it is providing the fragile country with sophisticated weapons and drones. Iraq needs help fighting against a growing and serious threat – al Qaeda.

For those who don’t avidly follow the complicated machinations of the globe’s top terror group, this could be confusing.

Hasn’t the line for years from the U.S. government and its allies been that al Qaeda is on the run, that its fiercest fighting ability has been weakened by U.S. strikes?

That truth is far more complex, of course. The terror group’s manpower has increased in recent years, it has gained control of more territory in North Africa and the Middle East and is taking a different approach to death, according to top lawmakers privy to high-level intelligence and experts who have observed al Qaeda’s activities since September 11.

A stake in Yemen

While al Qaeda suffered significant setbacks after Navy SEALs shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, and drone strikes have taken out top terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the terror group and its close allies have rebounded in Yemen, the Sinai region of Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and parts of east and west Africa, among other places.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, headquartered in Yemen, is particularly concerning.

CNN has learned of recent intercepts of messages among senior al Qaeda operatives in Yemen, but the messages don’t name specific targets. One source told CNN that the chatter suggested “active plotting.”

“There are multiple indications that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is plotting attacks both within Yemen, against U.S. and Western structures and overseas,” said Seth Jones, an analyst at Rand Corp. The Yemeni group is already notorious for sending an operative on board a flight into the United States on Christmas day in 2009 with explosives in his underwear.

Al Qaeda in Yemen “are still capable of conducting attacks” and particularly adept at “taking down aircraft,” Jones said.

Al Qaeda: We’re sorry about Yemen hospital attack

The U.S. has been fighting back, but not every strike has been successful. This month a drone failed to kill an al Qaeda planner believed to be behind a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa. Instead, the drone hit a wedding party, Yemeni officials said.

A powder keg in Syria

Al Qaeda-linked militants have established a formidable foothold in the complicated civil war in Syria.

There are up to 11,000 foreign fighters from 74 nations in the conflict that has raged since April 2011, according to the December report from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalism (ICSR).

The majority have traveled from other Arab countries, creating a significant risk of blowback when these fighters return home.

“The concern is that the al Qaeda networks of the future are being created in this jihadist melting pot,” said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has specialized for years in studying al Qaeda.

READ MORE: Cruickshank: Concerns over al Qaeda’s resurgence

An increasing number of them are from Europe – approaching two thousand, according to the ICSR, an unprecedented number, according to experts.

The United States and its allies fear that those fighters will be able to more easily launch attacks in their homelands or against Western targets, said Cruickshank.

“Syria is now the fuel for the jihadist movement and some of the most experienced operatives from Pakistan and Iraq have relocated there,” he said. “Syria has helped al Qaeda rebuild its operations in the Arab world, which has always been its intention anyway.”

READ MORE: Al Qaeda-linked group strengthens hold in northern Syria

Cruickshank saiid it’s especially scary to consider that al Qaeda members in Syria could receive training in the terror group’s traditionally sophisticated bomb-making and detonating courses.

Consider that the Boston Marathon bombing utilized what are considered low-grade explosives, he said. Al Qaeda generally sets the bar higher for destruction on par with the London attacks in the summer of 2005.

“It’s possible that new recruits could get training like what we saw al Qaeda in Pakistan giving – showing people how to make high-explosive bombs made of chemicals bought at beauty or home goods stores and detonate them.” Cruickshank said. “All they would need to do is return to Europe, buy what they need to and carry out an attack.”

Flashpoint partners, a U.S outfit that tracks jihadist websites, provided the terror analyst with an al Qaeda video that emerged on Christmas day. It features the Boston bombing and also the slaying of a London soldier in May of this year.

The Christmas Day-published video is an updated English language version of al Qaeda’s central video “You are Only Responsible for Yourself” which was first issued in June 2011. That video featured senior al Qaeda leaders including Ayman al Zawahiri and American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn.

It calls for al Qaeda sympathizers to take things into their own hands and launch attacks in the West.

Both attacks are called models for the future.

An elusive peace in Iraq

Syria borders Iraq. Though the causes of violence in Iraq are many-fold, al Qaeda’s presence there, aided by Syria’s weakened state, is being felt among the fragile nation’s law enforcement and civilian population. Between January and November 2013, more than 7,000 Iraqi civilians were killed, including 952 Iraqi Security Forces, according to the United Nations.

April 2013 was Iraq’s deadliest month in five years.

Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. That has led to sectarian violence – constant bombings and various smaller attacks. Al Qaeda is targeting Shiites in an attempt to plunge the country into another civil war and hopes to carve out a larger zone of territory under their control on either side of the Syria-Iraq border, Cruickshank says.

Smaller bursts of violence are the hallmark of al Qaeda’s new approach to terrorism, according to the chairs of the Senate and House intelligence committees who appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” in early December.

CNN’s Candy Crowley asked House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers if he thought Americans were safer in 2013 than they were a few years ago.

He insisted they’re not, and that U.S. intelligence and security officials are having a tougher time than ever before trying to stop so many smaller-scale plots.

But does that translate into a threat specifically in the U.S.? To Rogers, it does.

“All of them have at least some aspiration to commit an act of violence in the United States or against Western targets all around the world,” he said.

However, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said earlier this month that the data on al Qaeda-linked or influenced militants indicted in the United States suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years.

At least for the moment, “these al Qaeda groups in Syria and Iraq are completely focused on overthrowing the Assad regime (in Syria) or attacking what they regard as the Shia-dominated government of Iraq. And, at least so far, these groups have shown no ability to attack in Europe, let alone in the United States,” he said in a column published on CNN.com.

Bergen: Are we hyping the terror risk?

The new Al Qaeda

What motivates al Qaeda’s newest members?

Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Crowley she thought there is still a pervasive belief among extremists that a caliphate – an Islamic state governed strictly by Sharia, or Islamic, law – is possible and should be fought for.

“I think there is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist, jihadist, Islamic community,” she said. “And that is that the west is responsible for everything that goes wrong…I see more groups, more fundamentalists, more jihadists more determined to kill to get to where they want to get.”

Cruickshank points to the disappointment many young men felt over what they perceive as a failed Arab Spring revolution.

(Al Qaeda is still mostly comprised of younger men, though women are taking backseat support roles, he added.)

In 2011, tens of thousands of protesters staged a revolution in Egypt that unseated longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. Mohamed Morsy, then a Muslim Brotherhood leader, was elected president in the country’s first democratic election in 2012. He was deposed by the military last summer.

This week Egypt’s military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group. On Thursday, dozens of members of the Islamist party were arrested and their property seized, authorities said.

“The great hope of the Arab Spring was that it would liberate the political system. But instead it resulted in increased repression against Islamists,” Cruickshank said. “For a lot of young men going into Syria, in some respect, it’s a reaction to that feeling.”

“They see the Egyptian and Syrian government as tarred with the same brush. They see those governments as blocking the true flourishing of Islam.”

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry made explicit the administration's renewed attempts to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and Palestine Saturday as the United States begins to assume a more muscular role in talks.

At the Brookings Institution's annual Saban Forum on Middle East issues and U.S.-Israeli relations, Obama and Kerry each spoke about a budding interim deal that would work towards a two-state solution.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Peace is possible today,"" declared Kerry, who just returned this week from his eighth trip to the region. There, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who remain ""as determined as ever"" to negotiate a peace deal, he said.

We are ""closer than ever"" to realizing a two-state solution, he added.

""I think it's possible in the next several months to arrive at a framework that does not address every single detail, but gets us to a point where everybody recognizes better to move forward than move backwards,"" Obama told Haim Saban, an Israeli-American media mogul who hosted the president for a public Q&A.

""I think that we're now at a place where we can achieve a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians are living side-by-side in peace and security, but it's going to require some very tough decisions,"" he continued.

Some very tough decisions that make up the bulk of negotiations from here on. As Kerry pointed out, the basic outline of a deal has been clear all along: It must deal with borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and end of claims.

But reaching a consensus on those issues will take a lot of work, and Obama reminded his audience that there is only so much the U.S. can do.

""The only way this is going to be resolved is if the people of Israel and the Palestinian people make a determination that their futures and the futures of their children and grandchildren will be better off with peace than with conflict,"" he said. ""The U.S. can be an effective facilitator of that negotiation and dialogue. We can help to bridge differences and bridge gaps. But both sides have to want to get there.""

One aspect of that facilitation was an extensive security plan written by American military commanders for their Israeli counterparts. Headed by retired four-star Gen. John Allen, whose last assignment was as top brass in Afghanistan, the in-depth analysis reports on how Israel can maintain its security in a two-state solution - a concern that has impeded negotiations in the past.

On the Palestinian side, both Obama and Kerry made assurances not only that their most basic demands would be met, but also that a new Palestine could emerge, one that was a true partner to Israel.

""Israel and Jordan must know that they will have a reliable and responsible neighbor, not a failed state between them,"" said Kerry.

Obama went into further detail, discussing an interim deal that would initially only include the West Bank, not Gaza. Once Gazans saw the success, he argued, they would push for their own peace.

""If there is a model where young Palestinians in Gaza are looking and seeing that in the West Bank, Palestinians are able to live in dignity, with self-determination, and suddenly their economy is booming and trade is taking place... that’s something that the young people of Gaza are going to want,"" he said.

For all the talk of meeting Israel and Palestine's needs, though, Obama and Kerry seemed clear-eyed about the challenges ahead, including a transition period where Israel might have to yield some of its security demands and Palestine might be required to show restraint and patience.

But four months into a nine-month deadline set by Kerry, Israelis and Palestinians have little tangible progress. At least now, they also have what looks like increased attention from Washington.

The Coast Guard was called. Onlookers remained at a distance for safety. And the answer surprised everyone.

As first reported by the Florida Keys Keynoter, it turns out the bright orange, 20-foot long, missile-shaped object was a $570,000 Air Force drone that had been shot down during a training mission in January -- 800 miles away, near Tyndall Air Force base in the Florida Panhandle.

""As soon as we heard, we had people on the way,"" Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told the Keynoter, explaining that the Air Force would repair and reuse the drone.

According to an official fact sheet, the BQM-167 drone is ""a high-performance, remotely-controlled subscale aerial target used to provide a threat-representative target drone to support the Air-to-Air Weapon System Evaluation Program and other Air Force and Department of Defense air-to-air test and evaluation programs.""

NBC News reports that Tyndall airmen have launched BQM-167s about 600 times since 2007, according to Wilkins, initially losing 16 of them at sea. Of the missing, nine were later recovered.

The others, like the Keys drone, presumably slipped into currents in the Gulf of Mexico and headed to sea.

""You would think that they would have awesome beacon tracking or at least GPS enabled on the thing,"" Roger Grimes, one the boaters who radioed the Coast Guard, told the Keynoter.

And who can blame South Floridians for being cautious? In 2011, a live Navy mine washed ashore in Miami Beach, causing the bomb squad to evacuate the sand.

A month later, a Miami Gardens family found a live grenade in their backyard.

UPDATE, Friday noon: Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told HuffPost that the drones used for live fire exercises -- including the one that floated to the Keys -- are equipped with a tracking beacon.

But batteries don't last forever, he said, and the drone's GPS can be ""thwacked"" out of service when struck by an anti-drone practice missile traveling at several thousand miles per hour.

Though boats are pre-positioned to retrieve the drones after an exercise, weather doesn't always cooperate with a safe recovery.

""For us to recover these we have to have weather that is acceptable risk,"" Wilkins said, ""because we have to put a diver in the water to hook up the drone and get it on the back of the boat.""

Wilkins told HuffPost the Air Force has been using the types of drones launched for live fire exercises since the 1950s, and his unit will attempt to retrieve a fallen drone three days in a row before damage from prolonged exposure usually sinks them.

Sweeping government efforts to stop attacks are backfiring abroad and infringing on basic rights at home.

CIA drone strikes are killing scores of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen. The National Security Agency is eavesdropping on tens of millions of phone calls worldwide — including those of 35 foreign leaders — in the name of U.S. security.

And the Department of Homeland Security is using algorithms to “prescreen” travelers before they board domestic flights, reviewing government and private databases that include Americans’ tax identification numbers, car registrations and property records.

Will we create a Minority Report-style Department of Precrime next?

Obama administration officials have a duty to protect Americans from terrorism. But out-of-control NSA surveillance, an ever-expanding culture of secrecy and still-classified rules for how and when foreigners and even Americans can be killed by drone strikes are excessive, unnecessary and destructive.

Twelve years after September 11, 2001, the United States’ obsession with al Qaeda is doing more damage to the nation than the terrorist group itself.

Two new reports issued this week by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch detailed dozens of civilian deaths caused by drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. Classified documents obtained by the Washington Post suggest that CIA officials who carry out the strikes make little effort to track civilian deaths.

“There is a lot more pressure building” on President Barack Obama, Sarah Holewinski, head of the Center for Civilians in Conflict, a group pushing for greater transparency in drone strikes, told me this week. “He’s going to have to look at these legal questions.”

Documents leaked by whistleblower Edward J. Snowden emerged this week, revealing NSA phone monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 35 unidentified heads of state, and 70 million calls in France.

The extent of the surveillance is sparking widespread indignation and endangering joint counter-terrorism operations among Germany, France and the United States.

“The perception here is of a United States where security has trumped liberty,” New York Times columnist Roger Cohen wrote from Berlin on Thursday, “intelligence agencies run amok (vacuuming up data of friend and foe alike), and the once-admired ‘checks and balances’ built into American governance and studied by European schoolchildren have become, at best, secret reviews of secret activities where opposing arguments get no hearing.”

There is a serious terrorist threat to the United States. The administration is under enormous pressure to prevent attacks. But there are ways to safeguard the United States without sparking such a serious backlash abroad and at home.

Holewinski called on the Obama administration to implement its promise to move command of drone operations from the CIA to the American military. She said the shift, which Obama announced this spring, is going “very, very slowly.”

Military control is one step toward a key goal: greater transparency in countries where drone strikes are enormously unpopular. Keeping the drone strikes as a covert CIA-run program makes accountability and determining the true number of civilian deaths impossible, she said.

If strikes are commanded by the military and disclosed publicly, reports of civilian casualties could be investigated under military law and compensation paid to victims — as now happens in Afghanistan.

Holewinski also urged the administration to disclose targeting rules that it has refused to make public. How are civilians defined? And how are civilian casualties assessed? What is the legal definition of an individual who can be targeted?

She credited the administration for a decrease in drone strikes since Obama promised one in May. But, she insisted, the targeting process needs to be far more transparent.

Inside the United States, meanwhile, press reports emerged on Monday that the Transportation Security Administration is expanding its prescreening of airline passengers to include government and private databases that contain employment information, property records and physical characteristics.

Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which opposes this prescreening, said many Americans do not grasp the current scale of domestic government data mining.

“The average person doesn’t understand how much intelligence-driven matching is going on and how this could be accessed for other purposes,” she said. “There’s no meaningful oversight, transparency or accountability.”

One critic called the new TSA program “a ‘pre-crime’ assessment every time you fly.”

A bipartisan proposal to rein in government surveillance unveiled last month by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a good start. The measure would end the bulk collection of American’s communications records; limit Washington’s ability to obtain information from Google and other online providers, and make the secret court that oversees U.S. surveillance operations far more transparent.

After months of promising change, Obama should back the senators’ proposal. He should also enact Holewinski’s recommendations for making drone strikes more transparent.

Terrorists already know that the United States monitors phone calls and emails worldwide. They already masquerade as civilians in areas where drones operate. Making drone strikes, NSA surveillance and TSA screening more transparent will build trust at home and solidify counter-terrorism cooperation abroad.

If there is one ideal that Obama needs to embrace, it’s transparency. It is a strength, not a weakness.

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-exclusive-accusations-dog-russian-081242871.html,,[],AP Exclusive: Accusations dog Russian copter deal,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials insisted a top-secret Pentagon study proved the need to buy Russian helicopters for Afghanistan's security forces. But the study actually recommended an American-made rotorcraft, according to unclassified excerpts obtained by The Associated Press.

The excerpts show the U.S. Army's workhorse Chinook, built by Boeing Co. in Pennsylvania, was ""the most cost-effective single platform type fleet for the Afghan Air Force over a 20-year"" period.

The finding has triggered allegations the Defense Department misled members of Congress and improperly cut U.S. companies out of competing for a contract that has swelled to more than $1 billion.

More than two years since DOD announced it was acquiring Russian Mi-17 helicopters, a veil of secrecy still obscures the pact despite its high-dollar value, the potential for fraud and waste, and accusations the Pentagon muffled important information.

The unprecedented arms deal also serves as a reminder to a war-weary American public that Afghanistan will remain heavily dependent on U.S. financial support even after its combat troops depart.

Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 GOP leader, said DOD ""repeatedly and disingenuously"" used the 2010 study to justify the Russian helicopter as the superior choice for the Afghans.

Congress only recently received a copy of the document.

""So why are we buying Russian helicopters when there are American manufacturers that can meet that very same requirement?"" Cornyn asked.

As recently as September, Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter cited the study in a letter to House members defending the Mi-17 decision. Carter left his job last week.

Last year, Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's top acquisition official, and policy chief James Miller pointed to the study in a written response to questions posed by Cornyn.

Just a few weeks after the secret study was completed, Army Secretary John McHugh wrote in a 2011 memo ""that the Mi-17 stands apart"" when compared with other helicopters.

Story continues

The Pentagon denies it misled Congress.

A senior department official said the study was focused on long-term requirements and not the immediate needs of the Afghan military, which were best met by the Mi-17. Also, U.S. commanders in Afghanistan wanted the Russian helicopter because it is durable, easy to operate and the Afghan forces had experience flying it, according to the official, who was not authorized to be identified as the source of the information.

The war in Afghanistan, now in its 13th year, has been full of paradoxes.

What was once President Barack Obama's ""war of necessity"" has become a race for the exits. Hopes of eradicating the Taliban and transforming Afghanistan into a viable state have been dialed down. U.S. combat forces are scheduled to depart by the end of next year, leaving the Afghans responsible for ensuring the country doesn't collapse into the pre-Sept. 11 chaos that made it a terrorist haven.

There's no dispute that heavy-duty helicopters capable of quickly moving Afghan troops and supplies are essential to accomplishing that mission. But the decision to acquire them from Russia has achieved the rare feat in a deeply divided Congress of finding common ground among Republicans and Democrats.

Why, lawmakers from both political parties have demanded, is the U.S. purchasing military gear from Russia? After all, Russia has sold advanced weapons to the repressive government in Syria and Iran, sheltered NSA leaker Edward Snowden and been criticized by the State Department for adopting laws that restrict human rights.

On top of all that, corruption is rampant in Russia's defense industry, heightening concerns that crooked government officials and contractors are lining their pockets with American money.

""We're not dealing with a corrupt system. Corruption is the system,"" said Stephen Blank, a Russia expert at the American Foreign Policy Council, a Washington think tank. ""This is not a world we're familiar with.""

Overall, 63 Mi-17s are being acquired through the 2011 contract. It was awarded without competition to Russia's arms export agency, Rosoboronexport, even though the Pentagon condemned the agency after Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces used Russian weapons to ""murder Syrian civilians.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a high-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the arrangement has put American taxpayers in the intolerable position of subsidizing a company complicit in the atrocities occurring in Syria.

""The lack of straightforward information from the Pentagon on the ability of American-made helicopters to meet the mission in Afghanistan is but another factor severely undermining their credibility and justification for pursuing this sorely misguided procurement,"" DeLauro said.

No Pentagon official was made available to speak on the record for this story.

The AP also requested in late October that the department release unclassified portions of the 2010 study and other records supporting the decision to buy Mi-17s instead of Chinooks or other helicopters. The department provided only a one-page summary of a report that provided no new information.

Afghanistan's mountainous terrain demands a helicopter capable of operating in the most rugged conditions at altitudes well in excess of 15,000 feet. The Mi-17 met all these requirements, Carter and other U.S. military officials told lawmakers in correspondence and in testimony.

But so could the heavyweight Chinook. The Boeing helicopter is larger than its Russian counterpart, carries up to a 26,000 pound payload, which is twice as much as the Mi-17, and can operate at nearly the same high altitude.

The armed Mi-17s being purchased for Afghanistan from Rosoboronexport will replace older and less capable Mi-17s that the U.S. and other countries had purchased from brokers and contractors through the open market and then donated or loaned to the Afghans.

The fact that the Afghan forces had years of experience flying the Mi-17 figured prominently in the Pentagon's decision.

Carter and other U.S. defense officials contended that adding the Boeing helicopter to the mix would unnecessarily burden the Afghans with having to learn how to operate and maintain an unfamiliar helicopter.

The 2010 study ""specifically analyzed the opportunity for DOD to provide a U.S. alternative to the Mi-17 for Afghanistan,"" according to the excerpts.

It outlined a transitional approach in which Chinooks being retired from the U.S. military's fleet would be available in late 2013 to be refurbished and then replace older Mi-17s in the Afghan fleet, according to the excerpts. A combination of Mi-17s and renovated Chinooks, known in the Army's nomenclature as the CH-47D, could work as well.

The 2010 study advised proceeding cautiously. Shifting too quickly away from the Mi-17s already in use could undermine progress made in training the Afghan air force, the excerpts said. But it recommended a plan for converting the Afghan forces from a ""pure"" Mi-17 fleet to one that uses U.S. helicopters.

The Chinook option never materialized.

An extensive analysis of both helicopters concluded that a refurbished Chinook would cost about 40 percent more overall to buy and maintain than the Mi-17, said the senior defense official.

That's hard to fathom.

Boeing executives informed congressional staff during a meeting held in late September that the cost of a refurbished CH-47D would be in the $12 million to $14 million range, according to a person knowledgeable about the discussion but not authorized to be identified as the source of the information.

That would make an overhauled Chinook $4 million to $6 million less than what the department is currently paying for Mi-17s, according to figures compiled by the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, the Pentagon office that fills urgent requests for equipment from battlefield commanders.

Boeing spokesman Andrew Lee referred questions about Chinook costs to the Defense Department.

The figures also show the average cost of each new Mi-17 has increased with each successive order — from $16.4 million to $18.2 million. The Pentagon has assured Congress that the prices were ""fair and reasonable,"" and in line with what other countries have paid.

But an internal Defense Contract Audit Agency document shows that the department could not conduct a comprehensive cost comparison because Rosoboronexport wouldn't allow U.S. auditors to look at its books.

Army negotiators omitted a provision standard in government contracts that permits pricing reviews. In examining the contract, the audit agency noted that Rosoboronexport ""is arguably an agent or instrumentality of a foreign government and is therefore exempt from most cost accounting standards.""

Rosoboronexport's director general, Anatoly Isaykin, said in statement late last month that his agency was ""completely transparent"" in negotiating Mi-17 prices with the U.S. He provided no details on costs or any examples of transparency.

""In our opinion, this contract is most acceptable to the U.S. Department of Defense in terms of quality/price ratio,"" Isaykin said.

The roots of Rosoboronexport's involvement reach back to 2010 when the U.S. and Russia were engaged in high-stakes diplomacy aimed at fulfilling Obama's goal to reset relations between the two former Cold War foes.

Dmitry Medvedev was Russia's president, not Vladimir Putin, and the talks resulted in agreements to expand cooperation on global security issues and strengthen economic ties.

Among the breakthroughs: The U.S. terminated penalties against Rosoboronexport that the Bush White House had imposed in 2006 after the State Department determined the export agency had provided Iran and Syria sensitive military technology. The sanctions had barred the U.S. government from entering into any contracts with Rosoboronexport. Russia agreed to support a U.N. resolution to punish Iran over its nuclear program.

Headquartered in Moscow, Rosoboronexport is the only Russian agency authorized to export and import military hardware. The agency is controlled in turn by Russian Technologies, a state holding company that includes the country's top arms manufacturers. The chief executive of Russian Technologies is Sergei Chemezov, a longtime confidant of Putin, who returned to the Russian presidency last year.

U.S. officials long have known corruption in Russia's defense industry is widespread.

William Burns, then the U.S. ambassador to Russia, wrote in a 2007 classified cable later published by the Wikileaks website that ""it is an open secret that the Russian defense industry is an important trough at which senior officials feed, and weapons sales continue to enrich many.""

Nothing has changed, but figuring out who is personally profiting is nearly impossible, said Russia expert Clifford Gaddy.

Only a small circle of investigators close to the Kremlin know who is involved in various schemes.

""Since the information they have is one of the most powerful instruments Putin has to control the individuals who run Russia on a day-to-day basis, they protect that information,"" said Gaddy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ""Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.""

With the penalties lifted against Rosoboronexport, Russia's ministry of foreign affairs wasted little time informing U.S. officials that new Mi-17s could be purchased only through the arms export agency because the helicopters were military gear intended for another country's armed forces.

After lengthy deliberations, the U.S. agreed. Pentagon officials no longer would permit third parties to acquire Mi-17s. They would deal with Rosoboronexport directly.

Last month, the Pentagon changed its mind. After re-evaluating, officials decided to cut 15 copters out of the 78 they had planned to buy from Moscow. Isaykin, Rosoboronexport's director general, said the decision won't hurt the export agency's bottom line.

""Rosoboronexport's order book is sufficient to ensure the steady utilization of Russian defense industrial complex's production capacities, especially in the helicopter sector, for the next three-four years,"" he said.

The move was a bittersweet victory for the program's opponents.

""There was no redeeming value, no redeeming feature to this sale,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. ""An inferior product bought with American taxpayer money from a Russian export agency that was unconscionably selling to Assad. If you made it up, no one would believe it.""

Holder's March 4 letter was disclosed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who had asked whether the Justice Department believed President Barack Obama had the legal authority to order a targeted strike against an American citizen located within the United States.

The Obama administration, Holder said, rejected the use of military force where ""well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat."" But in theory, it'd be legal for the president to order such an attack under certain circumstances, Holder said.

""The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no president will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.

""For example, the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001,"" Holder continued, referring to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Holder said he would ""examine the particular facts and circumstances"" if such an emergency were to arise.

Paul, who had threatened to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director over secrecy about the U.S. drone program, said in a statement that Holder's ""refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening -- it is an affront the Constitutional due process rights of all Americans."" Holder's letter was first reported by Adam Serwer of Mother Jones.

Holder is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a Justice Department oversight hearing on Wednesday morning. Earlier in the day, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the administration had agreed to allow members of the committee to see all of the Office of Legal Counsel memos relating to the targeted killing of American citizens."

This is from an article they published on Sunday, August 18, 2013:

U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya’s Benghazi in 2012 when Islamist gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate during a protest by a mob angry over a film they said insulted the Prophet Mohammad.

This claim, first made by then-US Ambassador Susan Rice on all Sunday morning shows, has been debunked many times. Here are a few examples:

October 9, 2012 – Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy said the attacks in Benghazi were a coordinated terrorist attack. They were planned and organized.

October 27, 2012 – Libyan witnesses said it was an organized attack.

December 19, 2012 – Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Accountability Review Board released their report on Benghazi and never mentioned a protest or the YouTube video.

March 6, 2013 – Documents turned over by the administration show the Libyan officials knew an attack was going to happen and warned Washington, D.C.

May 8, 2013 – During the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Benghazi, Gregory Hicks testified the YouTube video was a non-issue in Libya. He said he was embarrassed and stunned when he saw Rice claim there was a protest over the video.

August 6, 2013 – CNN airs a Benghazi special and it also destroys the YouTube/protest narrative. Erin Burnett reported US Ambassador Christopher Stevens had to change his running route because terrorists posted it on the internet. He knew and warned DC many times an attack was going to happen. He requested extra security many times.

The YouTube video had nothing to do with the Benghazi attack. There was not a protest in Benghazi."
http://news.yahoo.com/immigration-debate-clears-procedural-senate-hurdle-201715813.html,,[],Immigration debate clears procedural Senate hurdle,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In Spanish and English, the Senate pushed contentious immigration legislation over early procedural hurdles with deceptive ease on Tuesday as President Barack Obama insisted the ""moment is now"" to give 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally a chance at citizenship.

Despite the lopsided votes, Republicans served notice they will seek to toughen the bill's border security provisions and impose tougher terms on those seeking to gain legal status. ""This bill has serious flaws,"" said their party leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, one of several who noted pointedly that the 60-vote majority they will demand for passage is hardly assured.

Even before the first proposed changes were considered, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, outlined the complicated state of play for a measure that he helped draft as a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" and now seeks to alter. With changes to tighten control of the U.S.-Mexican border, he said, about half of the Senate's 46 Republicans are prepared to vote to create the pathway to citizenship that is backed by most or all of the 54 lawmakers aligned with the Democratic majority.

At the White House, Obama said repeatedly the current immigration system is broken, for the foreign-born who live in the United State legally and illegally alike.

Referring to the 11 million currently in the country unlawfully, he said, ""Yes, they broke the rules; they didn't wait their turn. They shouldn't be let off easy. They shouldn't be allowed to game the system. But at the same time, the vast majority of these individuals aren't looking for any trouble. They're just looking to provide for their families, contribute to their communities. ""

At its core, the bill sets out a 13-year journey to citizenship for the millions of immigrants who arrived in the United States illegally through the end of 2011 or who overstayed their visas. That journey would include paying fines and back taxes and other measures. The bill also requires a tighter border to prevent future illegal immigration.

Story continues

Other key provisions would create a new program for low-skilled workers to enter the country and expand the number of visas for high-skilled who are particularly in demand in technology firms. The bill also jettisons a decades-old system that favors family ties over education, job skills and other factors in prioritizing prospective legal immigrants.

Obama didn't say so, but the legislation is likely his best hope of achieving a second-term landmark domestic accomplishment.

Numerous Republicans hope to use the issue to repair their party's image among Hispanic voters, a growing portion of the electorate in key states, and a group that polls show gave Obama 71 percent of its votes last year. But the GOP is divided, with tea party-backed lawmakers and other conservatives resisting anything that smacks of amnesty or otherwise seems to permit legalization without assuring the long border with Mexico in particular is virtually closed to future unlawful immigration.

""Of all of the issue swirling around this bill the path to citizenship for those who are here illegally is the single most divisive issue,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican elected to his first term last fall. ""And that is the issue on which the Obama White House and Senate Democrats insist, and by insisting on that division I believe they by design destine this bill to be voted down.""

In the Capitol, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., chose to deliver a speech on the immigration measure in Spanish. He said it was appropriate to do so since the language ""has been spoken in this country since Spanish missionaries founded St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. Spanish is also spoken by almost 40 million Americans who have a lot at stake in the outcome of this debate,"" he said in an English translation provided by his office.

Taken together, the two procedural votes had the effect of placing the bill formally before the Senate and open for amendments. Both drew more than 80 votes, reflecting a bipartisan desire to have the debate that now is expected to consume three weeks.

Substantively, an early skirmish took shape over a proposal by Cruz' fellow Texan, Sen. John Cornyn. It would permit the legalization process to begin, but require several changes before anyone currently in the country illegally could receive a green card that confers permanent legal residence.

Those changes include apprehension of at least 90 percent of those seeking to cross into the United States at every segment of the Southern border, implementation of a biometric exit system at all air and sea ports of entry and a nationwide E-Verify system to check the legal status of prospective employees.

Democratic supporters of the legislation have deemed Cornyn's plan a ""poison pill,"" designed to wreck the bill's chances for passage instead of enhance them. But the Texan told reporters he had some leverage to force changes, if nothing else.

""I think if they had 60 votes to pass a bill out of the Senate they probably wouldn't be talking to me. And they are,"" Cornyn said of majority Democrats.

As the Senate embarked on a debate expected to last for weeks, Speaker John Boehner said he hoped companion legislation could clear committee in the House by the end of the month.

In an ABC interview, the Ohio Republican sidestepped when asked if he is prepared to support a pathway to citizenship for those living in the country illegally. ""A lot of these big questions will be decided on the House floor,"" he said.

In the Senate, McConnell sounded a similar note.

""The Gang of Eight has done its work,"" he said, referring to the four senators from each party that crafted the basic bill. ""Now it's time for the Gang of 100 to do its work.""

In February 2013, Dotcom, creator of online storage locker Mega and its ill-fated predecessor MegaUpload, announced that his company was going to launch an encrypted email service. Then the declaration had the weight of history behind it: Dotcom himself was arrested in 2012 on piracy charges in New Zealand based on information gathered illegally by the New Zealand government at the behest of U.S. authorities. (A New Zealand judge later ruled the search warrants invalid.)

Now, in the wake of yet more government spying revelations and the loss of other encrypted options, Mega CEO Vikram Kumar reminded ZDNet's Rob O'Neill that Mega is still committed to building an encrypted email service. According to Kumar, Mega is ""doing some hugely cutting-edge stuff.""

Kumar's statement has generated a lot of attention on tech blogs across the web -- not all of it complimentary. Evan Dashevsky of TechHive called the rumored email service just the latest resume padding in Dotcom's ""history of troublemaking."" But Lauren Hockenson of Gigaom remarked that Dotcom was really going all-in on privacy. In addition to filling the void left by other shutdown services, she wrote, he's also ""creating a VC [venture capital] firm that brings up encryption-focused companies.""

Admittedly, the news seems far more exciting in the current context than it was when Dotcom first announced he was building encrypted email in February. Back then, the world was awash in encrypted email services: Tormail; Silent Mail; Lavabit, Snowden's reported service. Now those services are gone, and Lavabit's webpage bears a warning from Ladar Levinson, its founder: ""Without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.""

Mega's email service, if it comes to fruition, might tempt many of the privacy-conscious now bereft of a satisfactory alternative. Since his unfortunate brush with spying, Dotcom has started making a name for himself as an encryption advocate. Mega calls itself ""the Privacy Company"" and automatically encrypts every file uploaded to it.

In a January interview with the English-language TV station Russia Today, Dotcom spoke strongly about online privacy. ""My goal is, within the next five years, I want to encrypt half of the Internet,"" he said. ""Just reestablish a balance between a person -- an individual -- and the state.""

And true to the advice of Levinson, Mega's servers aren't hosted in the United States. The storage service is currently based in New Zealand. If that country's surveillance policies become too invasive, Dotcom told TorrentFreak, he'll move his company's infrastructure to Iceland."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: The price Gina Gray paid for whistleblowing,"President Obama, in his news conference this month, said that Edward Snowden was wrong to go public with revelations about secret surveillance programs because “there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.”

This is a common refrain among administration officials and some lawmakers: If only Snowden had made his concerns known through the proper internal channels, everything would have turned out well. The notion sounds reasonable, as do the memorandums Obama signed supposedly protecting whistleblowers.

But it’s a load of nonsense. Ask Gina Gray.

Gray is the Defense Department whistleblower whose case I have been following for five years. She was the Army civilian worker who, before and after her employment, exposed much of the wrongdoing at Arlington National Cemetery — misplaced graves, mishandled remains and financial mismanagement — and she attempted to do it through the proper internal channels. Pentagon sources have confirmed to me her crucial role in bringing the scandal to light.

For her troubles, Gray was fired. The Pentagon’s inspector general recommended corrective action to compensate Gray.

According to documents just obtained by Gray’s lawyer, Mark Zaid, Army Secretary John McHugh rejected the inspector general’s suggestion. McHugh wouldn’t offer Gray anything because she was on “probationary status at the time of her termination.”

Gray, who worked in Iraq as an Army contractor and Army public affairs specialist, is now unemployed and living in North Carolina.

“I went all the way up the channels,” Gray told me on Tuesday. “This is what happens when you do that.”

In response to my inquiries to the Pentagon, an Army spokesman, Col. David H. Patterson Jr., issued a statement saying that Gray’s status as a whistleblower was limited and that her firing was unrelated. “We consider the matter closed,” he said, calling the Army’s position “validated” by a federal court’s “dismissal of Ms. Gray’s lawsuit — with prejudice.”

The lawsuit was dismissed this week — because Gray dropped it. She could no longer afford the legal fees.

Sadly, Gray’s case is emblematic of the way this administration has handled whistleblowers. Obama came into office pledging transparency and professing admiration for government workers who expose abuses. But his administration has pursued more cases under the 1917 Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined (including the prosecution of National Security Agency workers who tried to register their objections through “proper” channels). And the alleged intimidation of would-be whistleblowers goes beyond those involved in sensitive intelligence. For example, diplomat Gregory Hicks told a House committee that he was demoted because he gave congressional investigators a description of the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, that was at odds with the official version of events.

Gray’s ordeal began in April 2008 after I covered the Arlington funeral of an officer killed in the Iraq war. While there, I observed a dispute between Gray and deputy superintendent Thurman Higginbotham, the man later at the center of the Arlington scandals. Higginbotham was trying to prevent reporters from observing the burial, in violation of the family’s wishes and Arlington’s regulations — and Gray, though new on the job, told him he was wrong.

Ann Telnaes animation: President Obama insists he would have implemented more NSA oversight even without Edward Snowden’ s leaks. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Gray registered her objections internally — but loudly. She refused to sign off on a report to the Army secretary’s office that was a whitewash of the way burials were handled at Arlington because, she said, her higher-ups were violating Defense Department regulations. She began to learn of other misdeeds by Arlington management and attempted to let military officials know; in June 2008, according to one of Gray’s legal filings, she told the commanding general of the Military District of Washington about “major problems” at the cemetery, involving fraud, mismanagement and broken regulations.

Two days later, she was fired.

A 2010 report by the Pentagon’s inspector general designated Gray as a whistleblower and concluded that, contrary to regulations, Arlington management “elected to terminate her, rather than make a reasonable effort to address public affairs policy issues that she raised” or to “document performance deficiencies that ANC management later claimed formed the basis for Ms. Gray’s termination.”

After her firing, Gray passed along information about mismanagement at Arlington to three congressional offices, all of which received false assurances from the Army that everything was under control. Gray eventually provided her findings to reporters and to the inspector general, leading to the ouster of the Arlington management.

Snowden’s case is quite a bit different, and murkier; his dalliances with China and now Russia raise questions about his motives. But Gray’s case shows that Snowden was correct about one thing: Trying to pursue the proper internal channels doesn’t work.

If the Obama administration wants whistleblowers to take the “proper” route, it needs to protect them when they do.

Why not pitch reality show with a Kardashian: Project Runway, where object is to get on one

Ecuador, Venezuala still asylum possibilities. Choose Venezuela: great beaches, B&Bs

Obeidallah: Take a page from Clapper, who misled Congress under oath: Just say you're sorry

Edward Snowden , you need help! And I'm here for you. I enjoy offering people suggestions -- which you may even be aware of if you read my e-mails when you were working at the NSA.

I don't know where you thought you'd end up after disclosing classified documents detailing our government's surveillance program, but I doubt you thought you'd be roaming the halls of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport checking out the wide range of restaurants there -- the Russian cuisine at ""Mama Rashas;"" maybe the Burger King or the restaurant in Terminal D called, ""Hippopotamus"" -- which, I think you'll agree, is a horrible name for a place that serves food.

It must drive you crazy to know that the airport even offers a fear-of-flying treatment center for people afraid to fly while you are still begging for just a seat in coach. I know you grow bored browsing for hours at the duty-free shop, wishing you had a plane ticket so you could at least buy tax-free caviar or vodka.

So Edward, I want to propose some creative suggestions that you may find helpful.

Dean Obeidallah

1. If you can't get out of airport, pitch a reality show about being stuck there. It could be an international version of ""Project Runway"" -- how to get on one. How hard could it be to get a Kardashian to sign on?

2. At this writing, you have applied for asylum in -- depending on whom you ask -- 21 countries . WikiLeaks claimed Friday that you have applied to six additional unidentified countries, and the Venezuelan president said that he was ready to take you, according to reports. Bolivia appears to be following suit. That would be a break, because with some of these other nations you clearly have no shot. It's not unlike when I was graduating high school with mediocre grades and applied to Harvard. Barring a clerical error, I was not getting in and I'd say it's the same for you. So say goodbye to countries like Germany, Italy, and Spain.

But it appears you've got ""safety school"" nations: Venezuela, Bolivia, maybe Ecuador. You may end up getting into several, but which do you pick?

Here's my take. Forget legal issues, like extradition treaties. What will really matter to your quality of life is what people have said about those two countries on Expedia.com and Trip adviser.

For example: Sure, Ecuador offers a quaint old section of its capital, Quito, which does look picturesque. But Venezuela offers more. For starters, TripAdvisor tells us about a great selection of bed-and-breakfasts in Caracas, the best rated being the Beuenavista Inn. People noted online that it's ""nice and cozy,"" close to the airport and has free Wi-Fi -- which, word has it , is something you would really treasure. And I'll bet you could get a great deal on Priceline for this place.

And listen, the city has terrific restaurants, with many raves for the Maute Grill -- a steakhouse with an extensive late-night menu, for those sleepless nights spent looking over your shoulder. Also if you get bored in Caracas, there are always the beautiful beaches of Playa el Aguan where few will recognize you because everyone looks different with their clothes off.

JUST WATCHED What will Edward Snowden do next? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What will Edward Snowden do next? 01:53

But don't limit youself! Why not consider asylum in a few countries you have not applied to yet? For example: Egypt. Sure it seems a bit unstable now but who will notice you entering? Plus, I'm friendly with comedian/talk show host Bassem Youssef, the ""Jon Stewart of Egypt."" No promises, but I think I can get you on his show.

There's also Turkmenistan -- J-Lo just sang there last week, so apparently they will allow anyone enter the country.

3. Another option: Return to America and face the criminal charges against you. You could possibly win the case or be offered an acceptable plea deal.

Or you can follow the lead of James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. When Clapper was questioned under oath by Congress in March about whether the National Security Agency collects ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans,"" he answered ""no...not wittingly."" Obviously the documents you leaked show that Clapper was being less than fully honest with Congress.

BUT, this week he defended his misleading answer to Congress by stating: ""My response was clearly erroneous - - for which I apologize.""

So just say you're sorry. It seems to have worked out well for Clapper, because congressional leaders are not calling for him to be criminally prosecuted. Instead, they are just focused on pursuing you for revealing details about the spying program that Clapper was hiding from Congress.

So, Edward, you have a lot of options. Give it some thought. Maybe while enjoying some ""pan seared pot stickers"" at the T. G. I. Friday's in Terminal F.

But don't take too long, because I sense that you're just like the friend you let stay on your couch while he gets his life in order. Soon the Russians will soon want you to crash somewhere else."

As President Obama’s administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Sunstein’s post was considered one of the most powerful in Washington, given its ability to shape how laws were implemented.

Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama’s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is currently Obama’s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for “overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.” In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo-”independent” advocates to “cognitively infiltrate” online groups and websites — as well as other activist groups — which advocate views that Sunstein deems “false conspiracy theories” about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens’ faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists.

What was left out of that little biography is Sunsteins advocation for some rather creepy stuff as reported by a little known reporter Glenn Greenwald in 2010:This is where I would normally comment about the recent rash of posters defending these violations of privacy labeling everything as 'Greenwaldian' or 'conspiracy theories'... but no, I wont do that.

Instead here is a link to that paper and some more that is in it:



He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called “independent” credible voices to bolster the Government’s messaging (on the ground that those who don’t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false “conspiracy theories,” which they define to mean: “an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.”

""Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.""

they suggest that ""government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,"" further warning that ""too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, ""might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.""

From Wikipedia It gets worse.

The authors declare that there are five responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: ""We can readily imagine a series of possible responses.



1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help."" However, the authors advocate that each ""instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).""

Counterspeech. Orwell'ian eh?

Sunstein also helped develop the theory of availability cascade, which when applied to his views on infiltrating social-media, should be of some interest to Dailykos users, who recognize familiar behavior:



An availability cascade is a self-reinforcing cycle that explains the development of certain kinds of collective beliefs. A novel idea or insight, usually one that seems to explain a complex process in a simple or straightforward manner, gains rapid currency in the popular discourse by its very simplicity and by its apparent insightfulness. Its rising popularity triggers a chain reaction within the social network: individuals adopt the new insight because other people within the network have adopted it, and on its face it seems plausible. The reason for this increased use and popularity of the new idea involves both the availability of the previously obscure term or idea, and the need of individuals using the term or idea to appear to be current with the stated beliefs and ideas of others, regardless of whether they in fact fully believe in the idea that they are expressing. Their need for social acceptance, and the apparent sophistication of the new insight, overwhelm their critical thinking."

The call-records program is not surveillance.

This program has played a role in stopping roughly a dozen terror plots.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will soon consider legislation to add public reporting requirements and more court review.

The NSA call-records program is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight. Above all, the program has been effective in helping to prevent terrorist plots against the U.S. and our allies. Congress should adopt reforms to improve transparency and privacy protections, but I believe the program should continue.

The call-records program is not surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor do the records include names or locations. The NSA only collects the type of information found on a telephone bill: phone numbers of calls placed and received, the time of the calls and duration. The Supreme Court has held this ""metadata"" is not protected under the Fourth Amendment.

This program helps ""connect the dots"" — the main failure of our intelligence before 9/11. Former FBI director Robert Mueller and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that if this program existed before 9/11, it likely would have identified the presence inside the U.S. of hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar.

The NSA uses these records to identify connections between known and suspected terrorists (as well as terror conspirators and supporters). The overwhelming majority of records are never reviewed before being destroyed, but it is necessary for the NSA to obtain ""the haystack"" of records in order to find the terrorist ""needle.""

Only a strictly limited number of NSA analysts (among the thousands of professionals at the agency) may search the phone records database and only after articulating a specific reason that must be approved by a senior official. Those decisions are reviewed regularly by the Justice Department, Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, which imposes strict privacy protections.

To be effective, the NSA must be able to conduct these queries quickly, without regard to which phone carrier a terrorist or conspirator uses. And the records must be available for a few years — longer than phone companies need them for billing purposes.

Since its inception, this program has played a role in stopping roughly a dozen terror plots and identifying terrorism supporters in the U.S. Given the threats we face from al-Qaeda and others, we need all legal tools at our disposal.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will soon consider legislation to add public reporting requirements and more court review, and to codify existing procedures into law. I hope this will restore public confidence to a program that continues to protect the homeland from terrorism.

Kerry now claims credit for Syria weapons proposal,"Secretary of State John Kerry's seemingly casual proposal for the Assad regime to turn over its chemical weapons has within 24 hours become the de facto policy of the Obama administration, and is now being heralded by Kerry as the ""ideal way"" to defuse the stand-off between the United States and Syria.

But a look at the administration's statements shows that the plan has undergone an incredible evolution.

Just one day ago, Kerry mentioned the idea in response to a question about what Bashar Assad could do to avert an attack

""He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week,"" Kerry said. He then immediately splashed water on the notion: ""But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.""

His aides swiftly set about to walking the remark back, describing Kerry's comment as merely a ""rhetorical argument.""

Yet on Tuesday morning -- after the Russians had co-opted the idea and formally presented it to the Syrian government -- Kerry was claiming full credit for the plan during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee.

""Yesterday, we challenged the regime to turn (its chemical weapons) over to the secure control of the international community so that they can be destroyed,"" Kerry said.

He added, ""Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging,"" claiming the ""credible threat"" of military action is what brought the Assad regime to its knees.

Several U.S. officials echoed Kerry on that point, claiming Assad would not be willing to negotiate if it weren't for the imminent threat of a U.S. missile strike.

But the notion that Kerry had deliberately opened the door to the chemical weapons turn-over plan raised doubts.

""We still don't know exactly how this plan came about,"" Fox News contributor Byron York said.

Whatever the origin of the plan, it was taking off on Tuesday even as Kerry and others pressed Congress to continue debating a resolution authorizing military force, and even as President Obama prepared to address the nation Tuesday night.

After the Russian government proposed having the Assad regime turn over its chemical weapons, the Syrian foreign minister said his government would accept the plan.

U.S. officials continue to voice doubts about the idea, but are opening the door to pursuing the ""diplomatic track.""

""We're waiting for that proposal, but we're not waiting for long,"" Kerry said Tuesday.

He said Obama would take a ""hard look"" at the plan.

""It has to be swift. It has to be real. It has to be verifiable,"" Kerry said.

The deliberation comes as Congress considers a resolution to authorize the use of force. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid postponed a test vote originally expected for Wednesday, but Congress could still consider it later in the week.

Kerry urged lawmakers to keep debating, claiming that Washington needs to keep the pressure on Syria while the new proposal is considered."

USA TODAY

Six senators%2C five Republicans and one Democrat%2C announce they oppose Syria resolution

President%27s effort to sway Congress loses steam before his prime-time address Tuesday

Sen. Harry Reid delays test procedural vote that had been planned for Wednesday

WASHINGTON — President Obama's push for congressional approval for military airstrikes in Syria ran aground Monday, forcing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to delay a procedural vote as opposition builds among senators in both parties.

Six senators, including five Republicans and one Democrat, announced Monday they would vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force -- a strong indication that the administration's efforts to build bipartisan support have been ineffective.

The Senate was scheduled to vote Wednesday on a procedural motion to begin formal debate on the resolution, but Reid announced late Monday the vote would be delayed in order to buy the president more time to make his case to senators and the public.

""What we need to do is make sure the president has the opportunity to speak to all 100 senators and all 300 million American people before we do this,"" Reid said.

The delay also came amid reports that Russia was seeking a deal with Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Obama said in television interviews Monday such a deal could circumvent the need for U.S. military intervention, but senators had not been briefed on the development and expressed skepticism.

""I have no idea what's going on. It'd be great if the Russians could convince Assad to turn over his chemical weapons to the international community. That'd be a terrific outcome. I just am very dubious and skeptical,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Comments made Monday in London by Secretary of State John Kerry describing the military effort as ""unbelievably small"" also rankled lawmakers. Graham said Kerry ""undercut everything the president has been doing for the last couple of days"" to build support.

The rapid clip of senators announcing their opposition on Monday raised serious doubts that the president would be able to muster the necessary support in either the House or Senate. The GOP-led House is not likely to take up a resolution unless the Senate can pass it first. A final Senate vote was expected this weekend, but Reid's decision to delay the formal debate puts the schedule in flux.

Five GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming all announced opposition Monday, as did Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.

Briefings by top administration officials and a weekend conversation with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel were not enough to sway Alexander. ""I see too much risk that the strike will do more harm than good by setting off a chain of consequences that could involve American fighting men and women in another long-term Middle East conflict,"" he said.

Heitkamp was the latest in a string of Democratic senators from conservative states to come out in opposition, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Heitkamp and Manchin are working on an alternative resolution that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin turning over its chemical weapons before authorizing U.S. military action.

Two Democratic senators, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, declared their support. However, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who voted for the resolution in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned Monday that he preferred pursuing diplomatic solutions.

The opposition underscored the uphill battle Obama faces on Capitol Hill to rally around his foreign policy agenda. The president will visit separately with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans on Tuesday before his prime-time television address.

Graham, who supports the resolution, said he believed it could still pass the Senate: ""If the president does a good job tomorrow night, yes."""

The Pentagon has in recent days stepped up planning for potential military intervention in the Syrian civil war, specifically because of growing evidence the regime may have used chemical weapons, CNN has learned.

""There is intensified planning in the works as more precise information comes in on the Syrian regime's potential use of chemical weapons and the body of evidence grows,"" a senior administration official said.

The official, who has direct knowledge of the effort, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.

If President Barack Obama were to order action, it could involve thousands of U.S. troops. But all of the options face serious military challenges.



The official said it's not likely to involve troops on the ground in Syria. Two other officials say the most likely options would be using cruise missiles based at sea and fighter jets to try to destroy chemical sites or the headquarters of Syrian military elements linked to them.

But even that type of option has grown increasingly complex in recent weeks as the Syrian regime has moved chemical stockpiles around the country.

""We have to now assume they are going to continue to do so,"" the official said, noting that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey has already told Congress the military could not secure the entire chemical stockpile because it does not know where it's all located.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other senior civilian officials at the Pentagon have sought updated military options in the last few weeks as suspicions and intelligence grew that the Syrian regime had used sarin gas on its own people.

The official said Obama so far has not asked for those options, but the Pentagon was moving ahead to be prepared.

""As the situation in Syria becomes more grave and as we are increasingly concerned about chemical weapons use in Syria, it's the responsibility of the U.S. military to prepare detailed options,"" the official said.

Hagel told reporters on Monday that he would not speculate any options regarding Syria.

The updated planning is separate from recent discussions with Congress several weeks ago about options for Syria, the official said.

There are also specific new discussions with Israel, Turkey and Jordan about what the official called the ""realities of the conflict.""

These discussions center around what to do if chemical weapons become a risk to their populations and also what immediate actions would have to be taken if the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were to suddenly fall.

The new planning, he said, is an effort to ""align"" military capabilities with various options and scenarios that could likely emerge.

But he also emphasized it also involves looking at more direct U.S. military involvement in providing humanitarian relief for the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees now in Jordan and Turkey.

A previously announced deployment of some personnel from the First Armored Division headquarters to Jordan is part of this stepped up planning effort."

May Not Comply with Congressional Subpoena on Benghazi,"Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the State Department has not decided if it will comply with a congressional subpoena demanding documents related to the crafting of Benghazi talking points for Susan Rice.

Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) sent a five-page letter on Tuesday explaining why he as chair of the Oversight Committee issued the subpoena and what documents he expects to be delivered by June 7th.

Issa is requiring the release of more emails between top Administration officials regarding Benghazi talking points given to Ambassador Susan Rice before her appearance on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the Benghazi attack. The Congressman claims that the emails previously given to the House committee were “incomplete” and noted these documents were released to the press five days before they were given to Congress.

Asked about the State Department’s response to the letter, Psaki praised the “unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress” on the issue of Benghazi. “But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress,” Psaki added. The Spokeswoman said that the Department is “taking stock” and “determining the next appropriate steps.”

“You haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?” a reporter asked Psaki. “That’s correct,” she responded.

Read the transcript and watch the video below:

QUESTION: New topic? Yesterday, Chairman Issa sent a letter to Secretary Kerry and issued a subpoena for documents relating to the development of the talking points used by Susan Rice and communications between 10 current and former State officials. Do you have a reaction? Has he responded? And does the Department intend on complying with the – I believe it’s June 7th deadline for supplying these documents? MS. PSAKI: Well, let me just remind everyone since given the opportunity that we have demonstrated unprecedented – an unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging now in nearly 40 hearings, briefing members of staff, and – members and staff – and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees. On this specific issue, you’ll recall that a hundred pages of documents on the talking points were released just weeks ago. They were inclusive of the emails around this issue, and from our perspective, the CIA-led interagency process, as we now know through which these talking points were developed, has been thoroughly addressed publicly. But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress, and we are taking stock of this recent subpoena and determining the next appropriate steps. QUESTION: Since a hundred pages of emails were actually sent to them and everybody observed it, and in fact, there was a lot of backtracking on initial content and so on, what else – what is being subpoenaed? MS. PSAKI: I encourage you to ask Chairman Issa that question. QUESTION: Has the Secretary responded? MS. PSAKI: No. I just said we’re determining the next appropriate steps. QUESTION: So just a quick follow-up to that just for clarity. So when you say you’re determining the next appropriate steps, you haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena? MS. PSAKI: That’s correct. But we have provided, just as a reminder, of course, a hundred pages of documents on the talking points that this is regarding.

Pollak'],"Left Targets Cruz, Conservatives–but Case Against Hagel Stronger than Ever","Decrying yesterday’s filibuster of the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense, the White House and the media have decided to target his critics, especially Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Yet they should welcome the extension of debate, which provides an opportunity for Senators who once expressed concerns, such as Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to revisit their conclusions in light of new information.

The case for Hagel remains exceedingly weak. Some Democrats claim that he has the necessary qualifications to lead the Pentagon, but not even the Obama-friendly Politico supports that argument, noting Jan. 31 that Hagel’s main qualification was “politician.” Hagel’s supporters keep citing his admirable military record, but it is not a qualification for a primarily civilian post which requires an intimate knowledge of defense policy.

Hagel, by his own admission, does not know much about the Department of Defense. During his two terms in in the Senate, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. He has some broad views about how the country’s defenses ought to change, but these are shifting, and vague. He has argued both for and against defense cuts, for example, and does not understand the defense sequester.

The case against Hagel, on the other hand, grows stronger every day. From a left-wing point of view, his weaknesses were obvious from the start. He had expressed hostile views toward gays and supported “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He had led the fight to block climate change from moving through the Senate, and would now be stepping in to lead a Pentagon that has committed in recent years to the use of green fuels and technology.

Hagel also had subscribed to the slate of socially conservative views demonized by the Democrats as a “war on women,” such as opposition to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The Armed Services Committee also quietly examined criticisms about how Hagel had dealt with allegations of sexual harassment among members of his staff–a bad sign when the military is trying to stamp out such abuse.

For Democrats, an additional irritation was that Hagel’s nomination sent a signal that the party still lacked the self-confidence to run the Pentagon. As Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote in December:

Hagel is a Republican who voted for all of George W. Bush’s pet wars….And yes, while he has reneged on his past support for our nation’s disastrous wars, there are plenty of good qualified Democrats who weren’t idiotic enough to support them in the first place. It’s time for Democrats to embrace the fact that yes, they know what the hell they’re doing on matters of national security.

The only case for Hagel, from a left-wing perspective, was that the “neoconservatives”–i.e. those who favored a dominant military, an assertive foreign policy, and a strong U.S.-Israel alliance–were opposed to him. Hagel’s nomination offered the anti-war movement, especially its anti-Israel elements, a chance to shift the debate in their favor.

The Obama administration worked hard to prevent Democrats from defecting, sending Hagel to consult with Schumer and to write regretful letters to the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), expressing regret for having used such phrases such as “Jewish lobby” and reassuring her of his commitment to carry out President Barack Obama’s policies, with which his own previous views were in apparent conflict on a variety of subjects.

But the administration could not head off Republican queries, especially as more new information about Hagel’s past positions, much of it unearthed by the conservative new media, began to surface. Even the mainstream media began to take a skeptical view, with editorials opposing Hagel in both the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.

The principal worry was Hagel’s views on Iran. Not only had Hagel opposed the use of military force, if necessary, to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but he had also opposed the use of sanctions. He had also advocated “engaging” the Tehran regime, which to this day shows no interest in direct talks. Hagel’s appointment was therefore a sign of weakness in opposing Iran–the worst possible signal at the worst possible time.

Hagel’s views on Israel were also troubling–not least because of their implications for the American military. He had opposed designating Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a terror group, and advocated U.S. talks with Hamas in Gaza. He also denounced Israel’s war of self-defense against Hezbollah in 2006, calling it “disproportionate” and equating it with terror against Israeli civilians, undermining the basis of the U.S. war against terror.

Much controversy centered around Hagel’s use of the term “Jewish lobby,” a misnomer that implies Jewish control over U.S. foreign policy, and which was in vogue among the extreme left at the time as a scapegoat for the war in Iraq. Hagel now says that he misspoke, but new allegations that he claimed in 2007 that Israel controlled the U.S. State Department reinforce worries that he may have entertained antisemitic bias.

Perhaps the most self-destructive position Hagel had previously adopted was support for global nuclear disarmament, including the specific idea that the U.S. should begin to disarm unilaterally if necessary. In his confirmation hearing, Hagel attempted to deny that he had endorsed that view, but patient cross-examination by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) demonstrated that Hagel had, in fact, affixed his name to that radical suggestion.

The most recent nuclear test by North Korea, the ongoing atrocities by a Syrian regime that Hagel once suggested the U.S. should court, the continued belligerence of Iran and persistent terrorism by Hamas are all evidence that Hagel’s views on defense and foreign policy were naive at best, and dangerous at worst. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) also took Hagel to task for his strident opposition to the successful surge in Iraq.

In his confirmation hearing, Hagel not only failed to defend his views, but failed to show familiarity with the official policies of the administration he hoped to enter, mistakenly referring to a policy of “containment” with Iran and describing the Tehran regime as a “legitimate” government. Having failed to demonstrate that his recent shifts on several issues were sincere, he meekly asserted that his own views on policy would not matter.

The problem with Hagel’s performance at the hearing was not just that he stumbled, but that he dissembled, making a number of assertions that were shown to be untrue. Hagel also failed to provide more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given in previous years, and explained that he had “given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there.”

Yet in the days that followed, several speeches emerged about which Hagel had not informed the committee, including some within the five-year timeframe that members of the committee had requested. Hagel and the Obama administration maintained that these speeches had been “informal,” but the fact that Hagel spoke extemporaneously did not make the speeches any less official, as video of one such speech confirmed.

Hagel also refused to provide complete information about possible sources of possible foreign income over the past five years, particularly indirect compensation he may have received through organizations or funds with which he has been affiliated. The Atlantic Council, which he chairs, is known to have accepted large donations from the Hariri family, which is active in Lebanese politics and supportive of the Hamas organization.

After missing the deadline that Senators had imposed for disclosure, Hagel provided a list of foreign government and corporate donors to the Atlantic Council. He refused to provide additional information, saying he could not force other organizations to do the same. Democrats charged that Republicans were holding Hagel to an unprecedented standard; Republicans cited Democrats’ own demands that Henry Kissinger provide a list of his firm’s clients when he was nominated to the 9/11 commission, as well as the case of Hillary Clinton, who released a list of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation.

It was Hagel’s refusal to come clean–and his evident attempts to evade transparency–that ultimately united the Republican caucus in the Senate behind a filibuster, including some members who had initially expressed strong reservations about using the tactic.

The resulting delay will provide the Senate with several more days in which to consider Hagel’s candidacy, and for the White House to consider other options. The very fact that Hagel’s nomination has proved so divisive, and has exposed so many weaknesses in the nominee, is itself an argument for withdrawal. In a time of rising threats and looming budget challenges, the Pentagon will not be served by a perception of weak leadership.

Any one of the many factors above should, by itself, have disqualified Hagel from even being considered for the post. But President Obama has thrown out the rules many times before in his quest to transform America. Hagel is, in a sense, the Obamacare of Cabinet nominations: a deeply problematic policy choice that may have the votes to pass but lacks broad public support and may ultimately cost far more than advertised.

The Republican filibuster may hold; it may not. But if even a few Democrats make the right choice–the kind of well-considered choice made by moderate Sen Susan Collins (R-ME), for example–then Hagel’s nomination will collapse on the merits. If they are honest with themselves, Democrats must admit that they would not even think about confirming Hagel except for the fact that Obama has staked his political capital on it.

The left’s attacks on Sen. Cruz, on conservative media, and on pro-Israel activists may serve the president’s political interests. He relishes opportunities to paint the opposition as intransigent. Yet the Hagel nomination is a good example of why the filibuster is necessary as a restraint on the majority, a way to help it correct its mistakes before they become irrevocable.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution Friday calling on President Barack Obama to recommend an alternative location for the upcoming September G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, should Russia continue to provide shelter for National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The resolution also states that Russia is damaging its relations with the United States and should immediately hand Snowden over to American authorities so he can stand trial. Snowden faces charges of espionage for releasing classified information on the NSA's broad surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June.

After initially hiding out in Hong Kong, Snowden headed for Moscow where he has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, though President Vladimir Putin has said the whistle-blower is expected to leave the country as soon as he can.

Graham has been at the forefront of lawmakers urging the Russian government to extradite Snowden, going so far as to suggest the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi should be boycotted if Russia grants Snowden asylum. The White House declined to speculate on Graham's idea; House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the South Carolina senator was ""dead wrong.""

Graham and Schumer recently strengthened their bipartisan relationship while working together on comprehensive immigration reform. The duo has also introduced a media shield law to protect reporters from leak investigations by the Justice Department. Whether they have support for their latest measure on Snowden remains unclear, but the senators issued a statement Friday citing the Russian government's recent actions in Iran and Syria as additional reason to penalize it.

""On multiple fronts, Russia is becoming one of the bad actors in the world,"" said Graham. ""Russia continues to provide cover to the Iranian nuclear program and sell sophisticated weapons to the Assad regime in Syria to butcher tens of thousands of its own citizens. For Russia to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden on top of all this would do serious damage to our relationship. It is past time we send a strong message to President Putin about Russia's actions and this resolution will help accomplish that goal.""

""Time and time again. President Putin is too eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States -- whether it is arming the murderous Assad regime in Syria, supporting Iran's nuclear development or now providing shelter and Russian state protection to Edward Snowden,"" said Schumer. ""Enough is enough. It's time to send a crystal clear message to President Putin about Russia's deplorable behavior, and this resolution will do just that."""

Now, in response to broad dissatisfaction with the hidden bureaucracy directing lethal drone strikes, there is an interest in applying the model of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court — created by Congress so that surveillance had to be justified to a federal judge — to the targeted killing of suspected terrorists, or at least of American suspects.

“We’ve gone from people scoffing at this to it becoming a fit subject for polite conversation,” said Robert M. Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas. He said court approval for adding names to a counterterrorism kill list — at least for American citizens abroad — “is no longer beyond the realm of political possibility.”

A drone court would face constitutional, political and practical obstacles, and might well prove unworkable, according to several legal scholars and terrorism experts. But with the war in Afghanistan winding down, Al Qaeda fragmenting into hard-to-read offshoots and the 2001 terrorist attacks receding into the past, they said, it is time to consider how to forge a new, trustworthy and transparent system to govern lethal counterterrorism operations."

Instead, they have got themselves all steamed up and snarling about heinous, impeachable offenses that are figments of their imaginations.

The latest round of House hearings about the Benghazi incident provides a perfect example of how American politics has been warped and gummed up by bombastic, partisan extremism. A cool, methodical inquiry could well uncover serious mistakes and provide remedies so that future incidents can be thwarted before more American diplomats are killed in the line of duty. But the current generation of Republican lawmakers does not know how to do cool. Hot rhetoric more suited to a Glenn Beck tirade seems to be the only way they know how to communicate.

A prime example is Rep. Steve King of Iowa. On Wednesday, he said he did not know “what took place, and who was where doing what and why,” yet he declared, “I believe that it’s a lot bigger than Watergate, and if you link Watergate and Iran-Contra together and multiply it times maybe 10 or so, you’re going to get in the zone where Benghazi is.”

Yup, King does not actually know any details, but he is sure Benghazi is vastly bigger than the two biggest political scandals of the last 40 years. Either King does not really have a clue what Watergate and Iran-Contra were all about or he simply thinks if he really, really believes, wishes upon a star, picks a crop of four-leaf clovers and asks Santa, he and his party will luck into a scandal big enough to topple a president they despise.

That seems to be what Mike Huckabee is praying for. On Monday, the former preacher and presidential candidate said on his radio show, “I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term. I remind you, as bad as Watergate was, because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die.”

Of course, none of these folks were calling for impeachment of President George W. Bush in 2001 when he and his top advisors ignored warnings of an impending attack and 3,000 people died on the morning of Sept. 11. That was a failure that went right to the top. Whatever lack of foresight there may have been at Benghazi, it pales in comparison to 9/11. With Benghazi, the fault appears to lie with mid-level bureaucrats (and perhaps with a myopic Congress that saw no need to provide adequate funding for State Department security).

It is a fever dream for Republicans to think they can bring down President Obama with this pipsqueak of a scandal. Possibly, though, they could do some harm to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the strongest Democratic prospect for the 2016 presidential election. A smartly targeted investigation might do that.

More likely, though, Republicans will continue to overreach and come off looking like hyper-partisan, blustering witch hunters."

“All in all this has been a tough week, but we have seen the character of our country once more,” the president said from the White House briefing room.

The president was already facing pressure from some members of Congress to hold the suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as an enemy combatant. The president did not address these concerns in his remarks.

Obama kept his comments brief, leaving it to law enforcement to explain to the public the murky and confusing chain of events that kept Boston on edge – and in some cases on lockdown – up until Friday evening. Obama said the nation is “in debt” to police at all levels, who he said responded with “professionalism and bravery over five long days.”

As the suspect is treated and brought into custody, Obama acknowledged investigators still have much work to do and said the victims “deserve answers.” Three people died and dozens were injured in the Boston Marathon bombing Monday.

“We will determine what happened. We will investigate any association that these terrorists may have had,” Obama said.

Obama spoke after the weeklong hunt for the attackers ended with one suspect killed by police and another brought into custody late Friday.

The harrowing search for the surviving suspect lasted the entire day Friday, as law enforcement locked down several neighborhoods in the Boston suburbs – acting on a flurry of tips and going house to house looking for Tsarnaev.

Onlookers broke out in applause after the suspect was taken away in an ambulance, following a tense police standoff. His older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a chaotic chase and confrontation overnight after they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer and carjacked an SUV.

The surviving brother is said to be injured and is being treated at a local hospital. Authorities will now ramp up the effort to determine whether the brothers were part of a broader plot and whether either or both of them got overseas training. The radicalized Muslims are said to be ethnic Chechens from Dagestan, a Russian region that borders Chechnya.

Obama did not reveal much additional detail in his remarks. But lawmakers made clear that in the weeks ahead, they will have questions for the administration about what could have led to the attack and how such a deadly assault can be prevented in the future. Chechnya is known for containing a virulent element of Islamic radicalism, but to date the region – which for years has been fighting Russia for independence – has not been known to have an interest in exporting terror to America.

“While we have made it more difficult for terrorists to carry out attacks from overseas, the attack on the Boston Marathon is indicative of the shift in terrorists' tactics in recent years to inspire people who are living in the United States to strike,” Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. “While several plots of this nature have been thwarted, this is the first to succeed. … In the coming weeks the Homeland Security Committee will begin to ask how this happened, and how we can prevent it from happening again.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., both argued that the suspect should be held as an “enemy combatant” for intelligence gathering purposes. In a statement, they said “the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent.” They said he could be held as a combatant “not entitled to Miranda warnings.”

There are a host of unanswered questions about the suspects’ motivations and possible training.

Fox News has learned that the older brother traveled to Russia, including Chechnya, in early 2012 and returned in July. His suspected YouTube site, which included radical jihadi videos, was launched the following month.

The FBI also acknowledged that they were asked to look into the older brother by a foreign government two years ago over his possible extremist ties. The FBI said they fully “scrubbed” him and interviewed him but “did not find anything.”"

The report suggests that merely meeting the modest requirements necessary to get a license -- passing a written exam and driving test -- could improve road safety and help reduce the several thousand fatalities that occur in the state each year.

“If you don’t hold people accountable to acceptable standards, then we get people that aren’t prepared and don’t have the skill set,” said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.

The recently released DMV report is the agency’s first significant analysis of unlicensed drivers in 15 years and adds fuel to the debate over whether illegal immigrants should be eligible for licenses.

Immigrant rights groups say that granting such licenses would reduce fatalities and costly uninsured motorist claims. Insurance companies paid out $634 million in claims for collisions related to uninsured motorists in 2009, according to the most recent data from the state.

It “really goes against public safety because the current law forces people who would otherwise be properly licensed to drive without one,” said Angela Sanbrano, board president for the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles.

Critics, however, argue that giving licenses to undocumented immigrants merely rewards illegal activity.

“One study shouldn’t trump the obvious -- if you don’t want illegal aliens in the country, why do you want to encourage them to be on the roads?” said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform. “It just defies common sense.”

The DMV report looked at 23 years of data on fatal accidents. Its conclusions were similar to the last such report in 1997, which looked at accident data from 1987 to 1992. The latest report was also the first analysis since a 1994 change in the state law that required all licensed drivers show proof of legal residency, which significantly increased the number of unlicensed drivers.

Rough estimates put the number of unlicensed drivers at about 2 million, compared with the approximately 24 million licensed drivers.

Many of the unlicensed motorists say they would get licenses if they could.

Maria Galvan, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant in Los Angeles, said she has little choice but to drive to work, pick up groceries and take her daughters to school.

“We need driver’s licenses to be comfortable and be trusted and follow the law,” Galvan said.

Repeated legislative efforts to allow illegal immigrants to get driver’s licenses have been met with stiff resistance.

Former Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) tried unsuccessfully nine times to get a law passed.

But the political winds may be changing.

Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law allowing some illegal immigrants who qualify for a new federal work permit program to get driver’s licenses.

Los Angeles City Councilman Ed Reyes said it was time to offer that opportunity to all illegal immigrants in California.

“No matter who is behind the wheel, they need to be prepared and understand the rules of the road,” Reyes said. “That’s a significant issue when you live in a city that has a culture driven by cars.”

Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville) introduced a bill last week that would provide driver’s licenses to anyone who can show they pay taxes, regardless of their immigration status.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck and L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca said last year that they were in favor of such a measure.

Supporters point out that granting licenses to illegal immigrants also could reduce the number of hit-and-run accidents. Unlicensed drivers leave crash scenes at significantly higher rates than licensed drivers, according to a 2011 national report from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.

“I suspect that the reason people hit-and-run is they are afraid of the consequences,” said Izen, the police union president. “Maybe if they had a driver’s license, they wouldn’t run.”

There is budding support in the U.S. for expanding the pool of licensed drivers.

In Illinois, a bill to allow special licenses for illegal immigrants passed the state Legislature this week, and Gov. Pat Quinn has pledged to sign it. Washington and New Mexico already have similar laws.

But Dane, of the immigration-reform group said the effects of granting licenses go beyond just allowing people to legally drive. Licenses provide a legal foothold for residency, he said. They add another benefit that legitimizes the presence of illegal immigrants.

“It’s a gold-plated membership card into society,” Dane said.

The report also has added to the controversy over the Los Angeles Police Commission’s policy change last year that eased car impound rules on unlicensed drivers.

Unlicensed drivers stopped over minor traffic infractions no longer have their cars automatically impounded for 30 days. If the driver can show that he or she has auto insurance, valid identification and no previous citations for unlicensed driving, the car will be released.

The L.A. police union filed suit to block the policy change last year, saying it would put dangerous drivers back on the road sooner. The new DMV research proves their point, Izen said.

“It is our hope that in the new year, the DMV study will be the impetus for city officials to revisit this issue and show that they are serious about putting public safety first,” he said.

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request, he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do.

“Before I get to the bill, I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation,” Schumer said.

But, after Schumer made that plea, he commented on immigration reform, including the specific Gang of 8 bill, in the context of the Boston terror attacks.

“In general, we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here, has their fingerprints, photos, et cetera, background checks,” Schumer said.

“In addition, both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country,” Schumer added. “If there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made, I’m committed to making them.”

Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.

“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration, particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week,” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm, so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”"

(CNN) – Despite signs from House Republicans they'll oppose any immigration measure that includes a pathway to citizenship, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remained optimistic Tuesday that a bill overhauling the nation's immigration laws could pass the lower chamber.

Speaking on CNN's ""New Day,"" the California Democrat said Republicans looking to improve their electoral outlook among Latino voters will ultimately line up behind a bill that creates a fairer system for people who want to come to the United States.



""One of the reasons this bill is a priority for the Republicans in Congress and especially in the Senate is because in the last election, Hispanic voters went 70% for President Obama,"" Pelosi told CNN's Kate Bolduan. ""That sent an eloquent message to them that if they wanted to be relevant as they went down the road, they had to attract Hispanic voters, and not only Hispanic but other immigrant voters to our country.""

The Senate passed a key test vote on a border security amendment Monday to a larger bipartisan immigration reform bill supporters hope to approve by the end of the week. The 67-27 vote needed at least 60 votes to move forward.

Backers of the bill were hoping to win about 70 votes to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum for the larger proposal as it nears final passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate and heads to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives.

In that chamber, a separate bipartisan group has been working on drafting immigration reform legislation, yet some Republicans have labeled any pathway to citizenship as ""amnesty,"" and vowed to oppose it.

But Pelosi predicted Tuesday that pressure to become more attractive to Latino voters would outweigh GOP opposition to the bill.

""Now they've had an epiphany on the subject…hopefully, they'll urge the Senate, the House Democrats and the House Republicans, to work together to get a bill,"" Pelosi said.

Rand Paul for highlighting an important issue by using his prerogative as a U.S. senator to launch a good, old-fashioned filibuster on John Brennan’s nomination for CIA director.

As I’ve written previously, it seemed earlier that he might be off on a couple of points of constitutional law. In the rarest of circumstances, a President has power, under Article II of the Constitution, to launch a military strike on American soil–but only if that American citizen has taken up arms against his country and poses an imminent threat to American lives. He must be, legally, a military target. And it must be a situation so urgent–a Jack Bauer-type scene from 24–that there isn’t even time for federal agents to get into place to capture the terrorist.

But his overall point is correct: We are witnessing repeated power grabs by an Imperial President. And he is correct that, when non-combatants are involved (American citizens who may sympathize with terrorists but are not involved in actual or imminent attacks on our fellow citizens or homeland) the Bill of Rights applies with full force, and no President can step outside the court system under those circumstances.

But it’s different where combatants are concerned. A man who takes up arms against this country–not as a criminal but as a warrior–becomes a military target if, and only if, he is actually engaged in operations against America.

Last night, Paul made follow-up comments suggesting that, if the U.S. citizen in question actually posed an imminent threat to American lives, a President could take whatever actions were necessary to stop him. If so, we’re all on the same side of this debate.

It also must be noted that it’s hard to conceive of how such an imminent threat could happen on American soil. It happens in James Bond movies, but unless the traitor has a remote-controlled guided missile, he must approach some populated area before he can cause harm. If he’s close enough to set off a bomb, he’s probably close enough for police and federal agents to intercept him.

But enough people are supporting Rand Paul that it’s important to pick out a couple points on the margins. Most of what Paul is saying is right, but it’s worth noting where he’s saying something that many of his supporters are not, or saying something that’s wrong.

First, Paul acknowledged that the military can act in a war zone, and that we’re in war zones overseas. Some of Paul’s supporters are holding onto the idea that there has not been a legal war since World War II, and that both wars in the past quarter-century (in Iraq and Afghanistan) are unconstitutional.

Evidently, Paul disagrees (and rightly so), since a war zone only exists in a war. Not only that, but Paul sponsored legislation to de-authorize the war overseas. To end a war means that there is one currently underway, and to attempt to rescind Congress’ authorization for war means that Congress had previously authorized war, pursuant to the Declare War Clause of the Constitution.

Second, Paul said today, “I personally don’t think it would be very hard to try someone for treason.” Actually, it is extremely hard to convict someone of treason. The Constitution requires two eyewitness to the treasonous act. If you have an American-born terrorist in a foreign land, like Anwar Al-Awlaki who was hiding in Yemen and launching terrorist attacks, we could go for many years and never have eyewitnesses.

Sometimes traitors cannot be successfully convicted of treason and, ironically, it’s for a reason Rand Paul supports. It’s so no President could even try to get his political opponents convicted of treason as a trumped up charge. You must have people who actually saw the traitor take up arms against this country or directly aid those who did.

Third, Paul also referenced people who “denounced their citizenship” still deserving all the constitutional protections. Although many rights extend to all persons, whether citizens or foreigners, the United States can deal with enemies who are not citizens in a much deadlier fashion than citizens.

If someone has denounced their citizenship, then they are no longer American. It’s unclear from his comments whether Paul realizes that, or perhaps merely mispoke. It’s likewise unclear whether he recognizes the distinction between military operations and law enforcement, and between domestic and foreign operations. We’ll probably learn those things in the coming days.

But one of his points is so true it bears repeating: How do we end this war? Is this perpetual war, covering the entire globe? The Constitution gives Presidents broad powers to win a war. The idea of Presidents permanently claiming this power against an undefined enemy and then exerting those powers on our home soil is a profoundly disturbing thought — one that can endanger liberty itself for all Americans.

I’m not sure any of us know the perfect way out of that situation, though I’m sure we’re going to debate our options.

And that’s because Rand Paul was willing to actually follow through with a filibuster, and because many other senators committed to the Constitution–including other young and recent additions to the Senate, like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz–are backing that play as well.

So the Senate might have moved a step back in the direction of deserving the title of the world’s greatest deliberative body.

Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight

The program was used to stop ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, Sen. Feinstein says

Critics say it's overreach, with Al Gore calling it ""obscenely outrageous""

Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?

That's the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans' phone records.

FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian , published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was ""very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate.""

The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.

When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, ""It was like, 'Oh, God, not one more thing ... where we're trying to protect America and then it looks like we're spying.'""

An author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.""

""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder.

But not everyone in the nation's capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a ""three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years"" -- so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it's helped to disrupt ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, she said.

""It is lawful,"" the California Democrat insisted. ""It has been briefed by Congress.""

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that ""this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop"" and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama ""put in place a stronger regime of oversight"" when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring ""we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.""

JUST WATCHED Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA 01:56

""That is his top priority,"" Earnest said of domestic security. ""But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.""

What's been happening, and for how long?

In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.

""Verizon's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,"" the company said at the time

Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.

The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring ""originating and terminating"" phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.

The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company's website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed ""millions of U.S. customers of Verizon"" were affected by the collection of information ""regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.""

In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications ""or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.""

An Obama administration official said any such order would relate ""exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.""

This kind of information ""allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,"" the unnamed official said in a statement to media.

Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.

Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying ""they contain numerous inaccuracies."" Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program ""cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.""

In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it ""will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.""

Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren't terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.

""There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy.

""It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer.""

Al Gore: 'Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous'

This group is hardly alone.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it ""beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.""

The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as ""the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.""

Many in President Barack Obama's own party spoke forcefully against it as well.

Three Democratic representatives -- John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is ""highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the"" Patriot Act.

""(The revelations) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,"" they wrote.

Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as ""the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking.""

One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.

""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.

Senator says ending program would be 'catastrophic'

Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.

""Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,"" said Feinstein.

Her intelligence committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather ""significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.""

Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that's linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number.

""It's not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers,"" Fuentes explained on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.""

Rep. Lindsey Graham said that, as a Verizon customer, ""it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number."" The South Carolina Republican said he's confident the government won't monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their ""number pops up on some terrorist's phone.""

""The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic,"" he said."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/politics/mccain-to-block-new-term-for-joint-chiefs-chairman.html,2013-07-19 00:00:00,"['Thom Shanker', 'Jeremy W. Peters']",McCain to Block New Term for Joint Chiefs Chairman,"WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain said Thursday that he intended to block President Obama’s nomination of Gen. Martin E. Dempsey to another two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. McCain made his announcement after he and the general had a testy exchange over whether the Obama administration was doing enough to assist the Syrian rebels.

“I’m actually going to put a hold on General Dempsey until General Dempsey responds to legitimate questions,” Mr. McCain said just two days after he helped negotiate a deal to ease the Senate confirmation process for Mr. Obama’s nominees.

Asked whether he would place the hold only after the Armed Services Committee forwarded the nomination to a vote by the full Senate, Mr. McCain responded tersely, “Before, after and during.”

“I want to see him answer the question,” he added. A vote by 60 senators can overcome a hold.

The confirmation battle grew out of a debate over whether the United States military should be ordered to more aggressively support Syrian rebels to oust the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including combat action like establishing a no-fly zone. Mr. McCain, who has called for American military intervention in the Syrian civil war, traveled to Syria in late May to meet with the rebel forces. It was the first time that a United States senator had traveled to Syria to meet with the rebels since the conflict erupted two years ago."

The Transportation Security Administration has delayed a policy change that would have allowed passengers to carry small folding knives onto planes.

In a letter Monday to employees, TSA chief John Pistole said he decided to maintain, at least temporarily, a post-9/11 ban on knives after meeting with an aviation security panel. The policy change allowing knives had been scheduled to take effect Thursday.

Pistole’s letter did not say whether or when he might reconsider lifting the knife ban. Still, he defended easing the ban, saying the bombings at the Boston Marathon underscore the need for TSA to focus on more serious threats such as explosives.

Opponents of allowing knives on planes attributed Pistole’s reversal to “a huge backlash” from flight attendants, airline executives and lawmakers. Since Pistole announced his plans to allow knives, the TSA chief has even been pressured by the families of 9/11 survivors to reconsider.

TSA officials said Pistole made the decision Monday to consider the comments and suggestions of a panel of 27 aviation experts, including airline and airport executives, pilots, flight attendants and families of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

“So we can incorporate their input and to continue training requirements nationwide, I have decided to temporarily delay implementing the prohibited items changes,” he said in a letter to TSA workers.

The proposed policy change, announced last month, would have allowed passengers to carry folding knives with blades 2.36 inches or shorter and less than a half-inch wide, as well as pool cues, ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks, golf clubs and novelty-size bats.

Until further notice, the items remain banned from the cabins of commercial planes.

According to a survey of about 1,800 Americans released Monday, about 73% said they do not want knives in airplane cabins.

In a statement Monday, a coalition of flight attendants said it would continue to pressure Pistole to keep knives off planes.

“The United States has banned all knives from commercial flights since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for good reason: Knives were the terrorists’ weapons of choice in bringing down four jetliners and murdering thousands of Americans,” the group said in a statement.

Congressman Ed Markey (D-Mass), who has spoken out against allowing knives on planes, called the delay “a victory for the passengers, pilots, flight attendants and law enforcement officers who would have immediately been at risk of a knife attack.”

A retired airline pilot who flew commercial planes for 34 years said allowing knives on planes is a bad idea.

“A knife is a weapon, and why make others think we are softening our position?” said Barry Schiff, an aviation safety expert and retired captain for TWA.

Even though pilots are now locked in the cockpit behind metal doors, terrorists could use knives to threaten flight attendants or passengers as a way to force the pilots to open the cockpit doors, Schiff said.

“We’ve done pretty well without knives, and my thought, personally, is to keep them out,” he said.

Marco Rubio as he pressed her on past comments suggesting the U.S. should apologize for its ""sins.""

The Florida Republican repeatedly asked Power for examples of crimes ""committed or sponsored"" by the United States.

Her response was that ""the United States is the greatest country on earth"" and she ""would never apologize for America.""

Rubio, pausing, said: ""So your answer to whether we committed or sponsored crimes is that the United States is the greatest country on earth.""

Power ultimately did not say whether she thought the U.S. has committed crimes. Instead, she cited ""mistakes"" like the abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. She also cited her past criticism of the Clinton administration's inaction with regard to the Rwandan genocide.

Power made the disputed comments in a 2003 New Republic magazine article, saying American foreign policy needs a ""historical reckoning"" which would entail ""opening the files"" and ""acknowledging the force of a mantra we have spent the last decade promoting in Guatemala, South Africa, and Yugoslavia.""

Though she did not revisit those themes during her hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she was apparently referring to past U.S. support for oppressive regimes. The comments angered some lawmakers, though, since she also seemed to draw a comparison to Nazi Germany.

She said: ""Instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa would enhance our credibility by showing that American decision-makers do not endorse the sins of their predecessors. When (German Chancellor Willy) Brandt went down on one knee in the Warsaw ghetto, his gesture was gratifying to World War II survivors, but it was also ennobling and cathartic for Germany. Would such an approach be futile for the United States?""

At her hearing on Wednesday, Power backed off some of her prior comments.

Asked by Rubio if she would have said the above passage differently if given the chance, she said, ""indeed.""

She also distanced herself from past remarks in which she recommended the U.S. send a ""mammoth protection force"" to bring order to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

""I have disassociated myself from those comments many times,"" she said, describing it as a ""remarkably incoherent response"" to a question she shouldn't have answered.

Mostly, senators at the confirmation hearing on Wednesday voiced support for Power.

Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said any criticism means ""you must be doing something right.""

""I don't believe that anyone can question your credentials,"" he said.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said her propensity for making bold comments could help at the United Nations. ""I think the U.N. could use a lot more blunt and outspoken,"" he said.

Power's opening statement expressed strong support for Israel and strong criticism of the way the U.N. works.

She said the U.S. ""has no greater friend in the world than"" Israel and slammed the U.N. General Assembly and Human Rights Council for its obsession with passing anti-Israel resolutions.

""I will stand up for Israel and work tirelessly to defend it,"" she said.

She also scorched the U.N. Security Council for its dawdling on Syria as the Assad regime commits ""atrocities"" against its people.

She described the U.N. response as a ""disgrace that history will judge harshly.""

Power is a former White House adviser and journalist/author who has written extensively about human rights abuses and genocide. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her 2002 book on genocide called ""A Problem from Hell."" She also advised Obama during the 2008 presidential primary campaign.

If confirmed, Power would replace former ambassador Susan Rice at the U.N."

At the time, more than 100 teams of U.S. analysts were scouring Iraq for snippets of electronic data that might lead to the bomb-makers and their hidden factories. But the NSA director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, wanted more than mere snippets. He wanted everything: Every Iraqi text message, phone call and e-mail that could be vacuumed up by the agency’s powerful computers.

“Rather than look for a single needle in the haystack, his approach was, ‘Let’s collect the whole haystack,’ ” said one former senior U.S. intelligence official who tracked the plan’s implementation. “Collect it all, tag it, store it. . . . And whatever it is you want, you go searching for it.”

The unprecedented data collection plan, dubbed Real Time Regional Gateway, would play a role in breaking up Iraqi insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices by late 2008. It also encapsulated Alexander’s controversial approach to safeguarding Americans from what he sees as a host of imminent threats, from terrorism to devastating cyberattacks.

In his eight years at the helm of the country’s electronic surveillance agency, Alexander, 61, has quietly presided over a revolution in the government’s ability to scoop up information in the name of national security. And, as he did in Iraq, Alexander has pushed hard for everything he can get: tools, resources and the legal authority to collect and store vast quantities of raw information on American and foreign communications.

Caption The National Security Agency, which is embroiled in controversy over its digital surveillance operations, has a long and storied history. It recently celebrated its 60th anniversary by releasing archive photos. The National Security Agency was established Nov. 4, 1952. But its lineage dates to World War I, when the Army began gathering information from foreign radio messages. During World War II, cryptologists used electromechanical devices, known as a bombe, to break German encryption in the 1940s. National Security Agency Wait 1 second to continue.

His successes have won accolades from political leaders of both parties as well as from counterterrorism and intelligence professionals who say the NSA chief’s efforts have helped foil dozens of terrorist attacks. His approach also has drawn attack from civil rights groups and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. One Democrat who confronted Alexander at a congressional hearing last month accused the NSA of crossing a line by collecting the cellphone records of millions of Americans.

“What authorization gave you the grounds for acquiring my cellphone data?” demanded Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), waving his mobile phone at the four-star general.

****

New details of the spy agency’s vast reach were brought to light last month by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information on government programs that sweep up “metadata” on phone calls and e-mails by Americans. Those revelations in turn have spotlighted the role played by Alexander, the NSA’s avuncular leader and, by all accounts, a driving force behind a post-Sept. 11, 2001, quest to transform an agency inundated by the data revolution into one that can exploit it to defend the nation.

As portrayed by supporters, Alexander is animated by a spymaster’s awareness of serious, overlapping threats arrayed against the United States. They include foreign and homegrown terrorists. They also include a host of adversaries who are constantly probing the country’s cyberdefenses, looking for opportunities to steal secrets or unleash mayhem by shutting down critical infrastructure. Like many national security officials of his generation, Alexander’s sensibilities were shaped by a series of painful intelligence lapses leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks.

To some of Alexander’s most vociferous critics, Snowden’s disclosures confirm their image of an agency and a director so enamored of technological prowess that they have sacrificed privacy rights.

“He is absolutely obsessed and completely driven to take it all, whenever possible,” said Thomas Drake, a former NSA official and whistleblower. The continuation of Alexander’s policies, Drake said, would result in the “complete evisceration of our civil liberties.”

Alexander frequently points out that collection programs are subject to oversight by Congress as well as the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, although the proceedings of both bodies are shrouded in secrecy. But even his defenders say Alexander’s aggressiveness has sometimes taken him to the outer edge of his legal authority.

Some in Congress complain that Alexander’s NSA is sometimes slow to inform the oversight committees of problems, particularly when the agency’s eavesdroppers inadvertently pick up communications that fall outside the NSA’s legal mandates. Others are uncomfortable with the extraordinarily broad powers vested in the NSA chief. In 2010, he became the first head of U.S. Cyber Command, set up to defend Defense Department networks against hackers and, when authorized, conduct attacks on adversaries. Pentagon officials and Alexander say the command’s mission is also to defend the nation against cyberattacks.

“He is the only man in the land that can promote a problem by virtue of his intelligence hat and then promote a solution by virtue of his military hat,” said one former Pentagon official, voicing a concern that the lines governing the two authorities are not clearly demarcated and that Alexander can evade effective public oversight as a result. The former official spoke on the condition of anonymity to be able to talk freely.

Alexander himself has expressed unease about secrecy constraints that he says prohibit him from fully explaining what the NSA does. But just as in Iraq, he remains fiercely committed to the belief that “we need to get it all,” said Timothy Edgar, a former privacy officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and at the White House.

“He certainly believes you need to collect everything you can under the law,” Edgar said, “and that includes pushing for pretty aggressive interpretations of the law.”

Alexander maintained in a speech last month that he is mindful to “do everything you can to protect civil liberties and privacy.”

He then added a warning: “Everyone also understands,” he said, “that if we give up a capability that is critical to the defense of this nation, people will die.”

The NSA’s 5,000-acre campus at Fort Meade in suburban Maryland contains more than 1,300 heavily guarded buildings and an array of computers and gadgetry sometimes described as “the most wonderful electronic toybox in the world.” But even before his arrival there in 2005 as director, Alexander was regarded as a leading apostle for harnessing technology’s awesome power in the service of national security.

In the mid-1990s, he had pioneered work in battlefield visualization — helping the soldier see on a laptop screen where friendly and enemy forces were on a detailed terrain map. He later led the push for technological innovation as head of the Army’s Intelligence and Security Command.

At the NSA, he has presided over the agency’s physical expansion while moving quickly to speed up the collection, analysis and sharing of massive amounts of raw data.

In the process, the West Point graduate has risen to become arguably the most powerful U.S. general most Americans have never heard of — or at least not until the Snowden affair propelled him into the public spotlight. He runs the nation’s largest, costliest and most secretive intelligence agency — an organization whose very existence was not officially acknowledged in its early years. The NSA holds primacy over all electronic eavesdropping overseas, from routine spying on foreign governments to sweeping up communications between terrorists overseas. Most of it is now done through hacking into networks in other countries.

Three years ago, Alexander’s responsibilities ballooned with his appointment to lead the Pentagon’s U.S. Cyber Command.

Even close allies have fretted about the concentration of so much responsibility — not to mention influence — in a single individual. Some worry that the job was tailored to the skills of one man and not to the mission itself.

“Where do you find another person like General Alexander who possesses the intel qualifications to run NSA and the operational experience to command” the military’s cyber operations, said retired Lt. Gen. Robert J. Elder, who launched the Air Force’s first cyber command in 2007.

No one questions Alexander’s qualifications for the dual role. With a trio of master’s degrees in electronic warfare, physics and national security strategy, the Syracuse, N.Y., native is endowed with technical smarts and ambition as well as a folksy, even goofy, charm that can disarm critics.

He routinely makes references — in speeches and in person with colleagues — to his four daughters and his 14, soon-to-be 15, grandchildren, including how the youngest, a toddler, Skypes with Grandma.

In January, he was on a cybersecurity panel in Munich when someone brought up Twitter’s announcement that 250,000 of its accounts had been hacked. “I didn’t do it,” Alexander said. “I was here. I have an alibi.” Then, turning to a fellow panelist, an official from the Chinese tech company Huawei, he quipped: “Do you?”

Last summer, Alexander waded into the lion’s den when, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt, he delivered a keynote address at the Def Con hackers convention in Las Vegas and mugged for the cameras. At the time, he told the crowd that “the story that we [at the NSA] have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely false.”

That line irked lawmakers who were aware of the NSA’s secret collection of phone data. And this year, after Snowden’s revelations, Def Con organizers said federal officials were not welcome at the event.

Alexander’s outsize commitment to his mission has propelled him to seek new capabilities with an impatience that has sometimes rankled superiors, while also raising concerns about privacy and how far he wants to push into offensive uses of cybertools. Alexander has argued for covert action authority, which is traditionally the domain of the CIA, individuals familiar with the matter say.

He has been credited as a key supporter of the development of Stuxnet, the computer worm that infected Iran’s main uranium enrichment facility in 2009 and 2010 and is the most aggressive known use to date of offensive cyberweaponry. U.S. officials have never publicly acknowledged involvement in what has been described by experts as the first known, industrial-scale cyberattack on a sovereign nation, one that is estimated to have set back Iran’s uranium production by as much as a year.

Alexander also pushed hard for expanded authority to see into U.S. private sector networks to help defend them against foreign cyberattacks.

Quiet concerns also have been voiced by some of the private companies that would potentially benefit from government protection against cyberattack.

At a private meeting with financial industry officials a few years ago, Alexander spoke about the proliferation of computer malware aimed at siphoning data from networks, including those of banks. The meeting was described by a participant who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussion was off the record.

His proposed solution: Private companies should give the government access to their networks so it could screen out the harmful software. The NSA chief was offering to serve as an all-knowing virus-protection service, but at the cost, industry officials felt, of an unprecedented intrusion into the financial institutions’ databases.

The group of financial industry officials, sitting around a table at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, were stunned, immediately grasping the privacy implications of what Alexander was politely but urgently suggesting. As a group, they demurred.

“He’s an impressive person,” the participant said, recalling the group’s collective reaction to Alexander. “You feel very comfortable with him. He instills a high degree of trust.”

But he was proposing something they thought was high-risk.

“Folks in the room looked at each other like, ‘Wow. That’s kind of wild.’ ”"

Kelly (R-PA): Consultants 'Drinking Brandy and Smoking Cigars' Wrote Senate Immigration Bill,"Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News he is confident House Republicans as a whole will stop the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, and take up an alternative aimed at securing the border before handling anything else.

“I can’t say exactly what’s going to happen in the future, but based on what I know now and based on what I know about leadership, I would say that we’re not going to see this thing get watered down [to get a version of it passed],” Kelly said. “Our conference is a very strong and independent conference.

“Sometimes folks get upset about that and I know why they do. But on the other hand, these folks I serve with are very principled and I don’t think they’re going to yield anything because they were promised a certain process was going to take place. I don’t think the Speaker was going to promise that if he wasn’t going to live up to it. I have a lot of respect for him, but he’s made commitments and I’ve never yet seen him break away on a commitment. I see him remain pretty strong.”

Kelly said that members of Congress should have learned from the 1986 amnesty that border security needs to come before legalization. He added that Congress should have learned from Obamacare that massive pieces of legislation, like this 1,200-page immigration bill, should not be rushed through to passage.

“If we did not learn anything from 1986, if we didn’t learn anything from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that big pieces of legislation shoved through in a hurry are dangerous, they are dangerous for people,” Kelly said.

“I’m disappointed in the Senate. I’m disappointed in our colleagues in the Senate for doing what they did. I think they really made it look like they tried to put it in the House to position it as ‘these Republicans are going to try to hold it up.’ The Speaker has said that we will break this into smaller pieces. We will have a heavy debate, not a conversation–that’s ridiculous–there’s going to be a heavy debate and we’re going to look at it. And I still, I can’t imagine anybody looking at this piece that came out of the Senate and saying ‘you know, I feel pretty good about this.’ If I’m one of the four and a half million [legal immigrants] standing in line, waiting in line and who played by the rules, I’m not feeling very good about it. I’m not feeling very good about this at all.”

Kelly said he thinks much of the misconception about what may or may not happen in the House moving forward is contrived by pundits, especially the common theme that assumes House Republicans will cave and pass a bill like the Senate one. “The pundits say ‘oh no, they’ll cave, they’ll give in to pressure, they’ll do this, they’ll do that, because they know if they don’t they won’t win the next election,'” Kelly said. “I don’t buy that. We lost the last election because we didn’t have enough of our people come out and vote.”

Kelly added: “You and I both know a lot of this stuff comes from these people sitting around drinking brandy and smoking cigars and have never been a part of this but are actually trying to drive opinion and drive policy,” Kelly said. “They say ‘this is the way it’s got to be or it can’t float.'”

“‘Well, you’ve never been in a boat. How do you know what makes it float?'”

“These people are wrong as much as they’re right but they don’t get held accountable for the things that they do that are wrong,” Kelly said."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Sunday that Chuck Hagel will likely be confirmed as U.S. secretary of defense when Congress returns from recess next week.

""I'm confident that Senator Hagel will probably have the votes necessary to be confirmed as secretary of defense,"" McCain said of President Obama's choice to head up the Pentagon during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

McCain is one of 40 Republican senators who voted to delay a vote on Hagel's confirmation last week. Republicans said they held up the vote in order to have more questions answered about Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, as well as about the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya last September.

McCain said Sunday that he believed the 10-day recess was long enough to get adequate answers from the White House, but that he would not vote in favor of confirming his former colleague.

""No, I don't believe he's qualified, but I don't believe we should hold up his confirmation any further,"" McCain said. ""I think it's a reasonable amount of time to have questions answered.""

Last week, McCain acknowledged that Republican opposition to Hagel's confirmation stemmed partially from his criticism of former President Bush over the Iraq War.

""There's a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush mercilessly, at one point said he was the worst president since Herbert Hoover, said the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War, which is nonsense, and was anti his own party and people,"" McCain said during a Thursday interview with Fox News. ""You can disagree, but if you're disagreeable, people don't forget that.""

On Sunday, however, McCain denied that his opposition to Hagel is politically charged.

""99 percent of it has to do with the positions Senator Hagel has taken,"" he said.

The Senate is expected to take a final vote on Hagel's confirmation next week, following the President's Day holiday."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

After my election, I have more flexibility.""

-- Barack Obama to Dmitry Medvedev, March 26, 2012

The puzzle of the Chuck Hagel nomination for defense secretary is that you normally choose someone of the other party for your Cabinet to indicate a move to the center, but, as The Washington Post editorial board points out, Hagel's foreign policy views are to the left of Barack Obama's, let alone the GOP's. Indeed, they are at the fringe of the entire Senate.

So what's going on? Message sending. Obama won re-election. He no longer has to trim, to appear more moderate than his true instincts. He has the ""flexibility"" to be authentically Obama.

Hence the Hagel choice: Under the guise of centrist bipartisanship, it allows the president to leave the constrained first-term Obama behind and follow his natural Hagel-like foreign policy inclinations. On three pressing issues in particular:

(1) Military Spending

Current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in August 2011 that the scheduled automatic $600 billion defense cuts (""sequestration"") would result in ""hollowing out the force,"" which would be ""devastating."" And strongly hinted that he might resign rather than enact them.

Asked about Panetta's remarks, Hagel called the Pentagon ""bloated,"" and needing ""to be pared down.""

Just the man you'd want to carry out a U.S. disarmament that will shrink America to what Obama thinks is its proper size on the world stage, i.e. smaller. The overweening superpower that Obama promiscuously chided in his global we-have-sinned tour is poised for reduction, not only to fund the bulging welfare state but to recalibrate America's proper role in the world.

(2) Israel

The issue is not Hagel's alleged hostility but his public pronouncements. His refusal to make moral distinctions, for example. At the height of the second intifada, a relentless campaign of indiscriminate massacre of Israelis, Hagel found innocence abounding: ""Both Israelis and Palestinians are trapped in a war not of their making.""

This pass at evenhandedness is nothing but pernicious blindness. Just last month, Yasser Arafat's widow admitted on Dubai TV what everyone has long known -- that Arafat deliberately launched the intifada after the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in July 2000. He told his wife to stay in the safety of Paris. Why, she asked? Because I'm going to start an intifada.

In July 2002, with the terror still raging, Hagel offered further exquisite evenhandedness: ""Israel must take steps to show its commitment to peace."" Good God. Exactly two years earlier Israel had proposed an astonishingly generous peace that offered Arafat a Palestinian state -- and half of Jerusalem, a previously unimaginable Israeli concession. Arafat said no, made no counteroffer, walked away and started his terror war. Did no one tell Hagel?

(3) Iran

Hagel doesn't just oppose military action, a problematic option with serious arguments on both sides. He actually opposed any unilateral sanctions. You can't get more out of the mainstream than that.

He believes in diplomacy instead, as if talk alone will deter the mullahs. He even voted against designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.

Most tellingly, he has indicated that he is prepared to contain a nuclear Iran, a position diametrically opposed to Obama's first-term, ostensibly unalterable opposition to containment. What message do you think this sends the mullahs?

And that's the point. Hagel himself doesn't matter. He won't make foreign policy. Obama will. Hagel's importance is the message his nomination sends about where Obama wants to go. The lessons are being duly drawn. Iran's official media have already cheered the choice of what they call this ""anti-Israel"" nominee. And they fully understand what his nomination signals regarding administration resolve about stopping them from going nuclear.

The rest of the world can see coming the Pentagon downsizing -- and the inevitable, commensurate decline of U.S. power. Pacific Rim countries will have to rethink reliance on the counterbalance of the U.S. Navy and consider acquiescence to Chinese regional hegemony. Arab countries will understand that the current rapid decline of post-Kissinger U.S. dominance in the region is not cyclical but intended to become permanent.

Hagel is a man of no independent stature. He's no George Marshall or Henry Kissinger. A fringe senator who left no trace behind, Hagel matters only because of what his nomination says about Obama.

However the Senate votes on confirmation, the signal has already been sent. Before Election Day, Obama could only whisper it to his friend Dmitry. Now, with Hagel, he's told the world."

Their arrests were announced as federal authorities unsealed documents in Manhattan federal court accusing the men of participating in a conspiracy that began in 2005 and continued through much of last year. NASA computers were among those infected by what was labeled the Gozi virus.

The NASA breach occurred from Dec. 14, 2007, to Aug. 9, 2012, when about 190 agency computers were infected with the virus, according to court documents. Between May and August last year, they said, the infected computers sent data without the user's authorization, including login credentials for an eBay account and a NASA email account, details of visited websites and the contents of Google chat messages.

Other destructive viruses and malicious software, including Zeus Trojan, SpyEye and BlackEnergy, were distributed through the network, according to a criminal complaint filed against Mihai Ionut Paunescu, also known as ""Virus.""

Paunescu is a Romanian national residing in Bucharest. According to court papers, Romanian organized crime investigators have been conducting their own probe of him that included court-authorized surveillance of his cellphone communications over the last year.

The document said Paunescu set up online infrastructure that allowed others to distribute the damaging programs, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses and affecting well over a million computers worldwide.

The Gozi virus was designed in 2005 and distributed beginning in 2007, when it was secretly installed onto each victim's computer in a manner that left it virtually undetectable by antivirus software, the complaint said.

FBI agent M. Kathryn Scott wrote in the complaint charging Paunescu with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion that some information about the virus came through the cooperation of a Gozi virus distributor who pleaded guilty to various fraud and computer intrusion charges and was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement officials in the hopes of receiving leniency at sentencing.

Paunescu was arrested in Romania. Deniss Calovskis was arrested in Latvia, where he is a citizen and resident, on charges including bank fraud conspiracy. Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national, was arrested in New York on various charges, including bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy.

It was not immediately clear who would represent the defendants in court.

A charging document against Kuzmin accused him of designing the Gozi virus beginning in 2005 as a way to steal the personal bank account information of individuals and businesses in a widespread way.

It said he hired a programmer to write it and began in 2006 to rent the virus to others for a weekly fee, advertising it on Internet forums devoted to cybercrime and other criminal activities. In 2009, according to the document, Kuzmin was approached by others who wanted to acquire the source code so they could attack computers and steal money from bank accounts in the United States and in particular European countries. The document said Kuzmin offered the code to other groups of people for $50,000 plus a guaranteed share of future profits.

According to court documents, Calovskis had training and expertise in computer programming when he was hired by a co-conspirator to upgrade the virus with new code that would deceive victims into divulging additional personal information, such as mother's maiden names. Federal authorities sought at least $50 million from Calovskis, an amount of money they said was obtained through the conspiracy."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/senators-agree-on-blueprint-for-immigration.html,2013-01-28 00:00:00,['Julia Preston'],Senators Agree on Blueprint for Immigration,"Among the plan’s new proposals is the creation of a commission of governors, law enforcement officials and community leaders from border states that would assess when border security measures had been completed. A proposal would also require that an exit system be in place for tracking departures of foreigners who entered the country through airports or seaports, before any illegal immigrants could start on a path to citizenship.

The lawmakers intend for their proposals to frame the debate in the Senate, which is expected to take up immigration this spring, ahead of the House of Representatives. Compared with an immigration blueprint from 2011 that White House officials have said is the basis for the president’s position, the senators’ proposals appear to include tougher enforcement and a less direct path for illegal immigrants than Mr. Obama is considering.

In a parallel effort, a separate group of four senators will introduce a bill this week dealing with another thorny issue that is likely to be addressed in a comprehensive measure: visas for legal immigrants with advanced skills in technology and science. The bill, written primarily by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, would nearly double the number of temporary visas, known as an H-1B, available each year to highly skilled immigrants. It would also free up more permanent resident visas, known as green cards, so those immigrants could eventually settle in the United States and go on to become citizens.

In a sign of the rapidly changing mood in Washington on immigration, the two groups of senators and the White House have been vying in recent days to see who would unveil their proposals first.

Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat who was one of those negotiating the comprehensive principles, said the senators finally agreed that any legislation should include a pathway to citizenship.

“First of all, Americans support it, in poll after poll,” said Mr. Menendez, who was interviewed along with Mr. McCain by Martha Raddatz on Sunday. “Secondly, Latino voters expect it. Thirdly, Democrats want it. And fourth, Republicans need it.”"

Hackers have figured out how to exploit Java to install malicious software enabling them to commit crimes ranging from identity theft to making an infected computer part of an ad-hoc network of computers that can be used to attack websites.

""We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,"" the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team said in a posting on its website late on Thursday.

""This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered,"" the agency said. ""To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, disable Java in Web browsers.""

Oracle declined on Friday to comment on the warning.

Java is a computer language that enables programmers to write software utilizing just one set of code that will run on virtually any type of computer, including ones that use Microsoft Corp's Windows, Apple Inc's OS X and Linux, an operating system widely employed by corporations.

Computer users access Java programs through modules, or plug-ins, that run Java software on top of browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.

The U.S. government's warning on Java came after security experts warned on Thursday of the newly discovered flaw.

It is relatively rare for government agencies to advise computer users to completely disable software due to a security bug, particularly in the case of widely used programs such as Java. They typically recommend taking steps to mitigate the risk of attack while manufacturers prepare an update, or hold off on publicizing the problem until an update is prepared.

In September, the German government advised the public to temporarily stop using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to give it time to patch a security vulnerability that opened it to attacks.

Java is so widely used that the software has become a prime target for hackers. Last year Oracle's Java surpassed Adobe Systems Inc's Reader software as the most frequently attacked piece of software, according to security software maker Kaspersky Lab.

Java was responsible for 50 percent of all cyber attacks last year in which hackers broke into computers by exploiting software bugs, according Kaspersky. That was followed by Adobe Reader, which was involved in 28 percent of all incidents. Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer were involved in about 3 percent of incidents, according to the survey.

The Department of Homeland Security said attackers could trick targets into visiting malicious websites that would infect their PCs with software capable of exploiting the bug in Java.

It said an attacker could also infect a legitimate website by uploading malicious software that would infect machines of computer users who trust that site because they have previously visited it without experiencing any problems.

They said developers of several popular tools, known as exploit kits, which criminal hackers use to attack PCs, have added software that allows hackers to exploit the newly discovered bug in Java to attack computers.

Security experts have been scrutinizing the safety of Java since a similar security scare in August, which prompted some of them to advise using the software only on an as-needed basis.

At the time they advised businesses to allow their workers to use Java browser plug-ins only when prompted for permission by trusted programs such as GoToMeeting, a Web-based collaboration tool from Citrix Systems Inc.

Java suffered another setback in October when Apple began removing old versions of the software from Internet browsers of Mac computers when its customers installed new versions of its OS X operating system. Apple did not provide a reason for the change and both companies declined to comment at the time.

Adam Gowdiak, a researcher with Polish security firm Security Explorations, told Reuters he believes that Oracle fails to properly test its software fixes for security flaws. ""It's definitely safer for users to stay away from Java 'til Oracle starts taking security seriously,"" he said.

The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address

It was addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans

An envelope that tested positive for the deadly poison ricin was intercepted Tuesday afternoon at the U.S. Capitol's off-site mail facility in Washington, congressional and law enforcement sources tell CNN.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was told the letter was addressed to the office of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer.

However, the FBI said additional testing is needed as field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results.

""Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,"" according to the bureau. ""Those tests are in the process of being conducted and generally take from 24 to 48 hours.""

A law enforcement source said more tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides.

Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters after a briefing for lawmakers that a suspect has already been identified in the incident, but a knowledgeable source said no one was in custody Tuesday night.

Wicker, the junior senator from Mississippi, has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.

Postal workers started handling mail at a site off Capitol Hill after the 2001 anthrax attacks that targeted then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, among others. Senators were told the post office would be temporarily shut down ""to make sure they get everything squared away,"" McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon.

""The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,"" she said. Members will be warning their home-state offices to look out for similar letters, she added.

A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed.

It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction.

Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later.

Wicker, 61, was first appointed by former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to the U.S. Senate in December 2007 after the resignation of then-Sen. Trent Lott. He was then elected to the seat in 2008 and won re-election in 2012 to a second term.

Before joining the Senate, he was a U.S. representative in the House from 1995 to 2007. Before that, he served in the Mississippi Senate."

Chuck Hagel if he is nominated as expected to be the next secretary of Defense was made clear Sunday as conservatives denounced his anticipated selection and painted the Vietnam veteran as out of step with mainstream foreign policy views.

Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted that Hagel would be “the most antagonistic secretary of Defense toward the state of Israel in our nation’s history” and called his pick by President Obama an “in-your-face nomination.” Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, describing the choice as “very peculiar,” said on “Fox News Sunday” that Hagel did not have “a particularly distinguished record.” And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while promising that Hagel would get a “fair hearing,” said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would get “tough questions” in a confirmation process.

Hagel, although a Republican, is viewed with suspicion by many in his party for past comments he has made calling on Israel to negotiate with Palestinians and for his opposition to some sanctions aimed at Iran. Since his possible nomination was floated late last year, he has come under fierce attack by conservatives.

He also has been criticized on the left for a remark he made in 1998 calling a Clinton administration ambassadorial nominee “openly, aggressively gay.” Hagel recently apologized for the comment, pledging his support for lesbian and gay military families.

The dissent over his pick does not appear to have dissuaded Obama from selecting Hagel to succeed current Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. While White House officials said Friday afternoon that the president hadn’t yet formally offered the job to Hagel, others familiar with the process said that the announcement could come as soon as Monday.

Hagel is a former two-term senator from Nebraska and an Army veteran who was awarded two Purple Hearts for wounds received in Vietnam. In the Senate, he initially voted to give the George W. Bush administration authority to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but later harshly criticized the conduct of both wars, irritating fellow Republicans and making him popular with Democrats critical of those wars.

Critics have pounced on his calls for direct negotiations with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that the U.S. and Israel refuse to deal with directly, and his votes against some Iran sanctions.

And Hagel rankled many with comments he made in a 2006 interview with former State Department Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller in which he said that the “Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Congress, in a reference to AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups.

“Quite frankly, Chuck Hagel is out of the mainstream of thinking I believe on most issues regarding foreign policy,” Graham said on CNN, adding that, “this an in-your-face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel.”

Miller, who had interviewed Hagel for a book he was writing on the Mideast peace negotiations, wrote recently that attempts to use his comment about the “Jewish lobby” to paint Hagel as anti-Semitic were “shameful and scurrilous.” He noted that in the same interview Hagel also stressed “shared values and the importance of Israeli security.”

Supporters say Hagel showed his support for Israel by voting repeatedly to provide it with military aid and by calling for a comprehensive peace deal with the Palestinians that should not include any compromise regarding Israel’s Jewish identity and that would leave Israel “free to live in peace and security.”

They note that he also supported three major Iran sanctions bills: the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1998, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 and the Iran Freedom Support Act of 2006.

When Hagel left the Senate four years ago, McConnell praised his “clear voice and stature on national security and foreign policy,” ABC’s George Stephanopoulos reminded the Senate minority leader on “This Week.”

But McConnell declined to reiterate that view Sunday.

“He’s certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years,” he said. “The question we will be answering, if he’s the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job? I think he ought to be given a fair hearing, like any other nominee, and he will be.”

In 2007, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged that many of Hagel’s dire predictions about the Iraq war had come true. He praised Hagel at an Omaha fundraiser as “one of the premier foreign policy voices” and “one of the giants in the United States Senate.”

Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) worked with Hagel for years on efforts to ease the embargo against Cuba and promote trade policies to help Midwestern farmers. He tolerated playful ribbing from Hagel when the University of Nebraska beat Kansas schools in football.

Now, McCain says he worries about his fellow Republican’s “worldview.” McConnell said, “I’m going to take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years and review that … in terms of his qualifications to lead our nation’s military.” And Roberts has said flatly that he won’t back his onetime friend for the Pentagon post, citing “a lot of concern about Chuck.”

Several factors are behind the opposition to Hagel, including the anger he caused among many Republicans by criticizing the George W. Bush administration’s Iraq policies and by endorsing some Democrats for office.

At least in public, the opposition to his nomination has focused on remarks he’s made on Israel and Iran, particularly one 2006 interview in which he said the “Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” in Congress. Critics have objected to his referring to the lobbying as “Jewish” rather than “pro-Israel.”

Supporters note that Israeli leaders haven’t voiced any such worries about Hagel, who has often called Israel “a close friend and ally.” They say he’s been the victim of a U.S. political landscape that has become not only more partisan but less tolerant of criticism of Israel. Particularly on the Republican side of the aisle, unwavering support for Israeli policies has become a litmus test over the last decade.

“The debate about the U.S. relationship with Israel has certainly moved to the right,” said Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who served alongside Hagel in the Senate until 2001. “You could oppose settlements in the 1990s,” he said, referring to Israelis building on land beyond Israel’s 1968 borders. “Not anymore.”

A review of Hagel’s history shows a worldview, particularly on the Middle East, that does not fit easily into current political divisions.

Shaped by a tour in Vietnam — where mine explosions left him with burns and shrapnel lodged in his chest — Hagel, 66, has long been a reliable if sometimes blunt voice for caution in using military force. He has called for engaging with America’s enemies instead of isolating them and for a healthy but restrained defense budget.

He first ran for the Senate in 1996 on a pledge to increase defense spending, which had been cut sharply after the end of the Cold War. By the time he ran for his second term, defense spending had begun to soar in the buildup after the Sept. 11 attacks. In recent years he’s called the Pentagon budget “bloated.”

Hagel had been in the Senate barely a year when, during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing in 1998, he cited a “perception in the Arab world that we’ve tilted way too far toward Israel in the Middle East peace process.”

But at the same time he was building ties to Israeli leaders. In December 2000, a surge of deadly violence threatened President Clinton’s bid to seal an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in the final weeks of his presidency. At the request of the incoming Bush administration, Hagel carried an urgent message to Israeli leaders.

In a private meeting at the Israeli defense ministry, Hagel assured embattled Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Bush would support the peace deal if he signed it. It was a crucial promise from the American president-elect, who was then little known in the Middle East. In the end, Palestinian opposition killed the peace bid.

Martin Indyk, then-U.S. ambassador to Israel and the only other person in the meeting, said Hagel was “very sensitive, sympathetic and most of all supportive. He helped to calm Barak.”

In recent years, Hagel has rejected unilateral sanctions against Iran, arguing that they only inflame anger in the Muslim world, but has said he supports sanctions imposed in concert with U.S. allies. He has argued against military action to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon but, in a September opinion article in the Washington Post, called for “keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force.”

That skepticism about sanctions has a long history with Hagel. In 2001, he was one of two senators to vote “no” on renewing unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran and Libya.

“Somebody has to give another point of view here,” Hagel said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in which he questioned whether the sanctions worked.

But at the same hearing, he invoked Israel’s needs, saying, “I don’t think you bring more security to Israel by this kind of policy — which, again, unless you can tell me otherwise, has not produced any results.”

Advertisement

In a 2006 speech at the Brookings Institution, Hagel criticized U.S. boycotts of talks with Hamas, Iran, Syria and other foes, saying that approach impeded efforts to end crises in the region.

“I don’t know how the world has gotten better” by the U.S. refusal to talk, he said. “Things have gotten worse by any measure. And so it tells me that we’d better take some serious review of our current policy.”

Many of Hagel’s words echo those of Obama, who, like many Israeli military leaders, is said to be reluctant to launch a military strike on Iran. Obama has imposed tough sanctions on Iran but resisted more severe measures pushed by some in Congress because they could weaken a broad coalition of nations — including China — that backs the measures currently in place.

Hagel’s supporters say that in his two terms in the Senate — he now serves as chairman of the Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes multilateralism — he was a consistent realist.

“The principles he came away with from Vietnam are still there,” said Charlyne Berens, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln journalism professor who wrote a 2006 biography on Hagel. “He’s been saying these things for more than a decade.”

He was thinking about running for president, and he put on his blog the next day six points of the speech, question-and-answer session.

I got a letter back from Senator Hagel, in response to my question, did you say that and do you believe that? And, the letter says he did not recall saying that. He disavowed that statement.

(CNN) —

In one move Wednesday, President Barack Obama managed to reshape his national security team, bring longtime confidante Susan Rice to the White House and annoy Republican critics of the U.N. ambassador.

Obama announced in the White House Rose Garden that Rice, who got caught up in political controversy over the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack, will replace the retiring Tom Donilon in the influential foreign policy post of national security adviser.

Donilon will step down in July following this weekend’s meetings between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president also said he would nominate Samantha Power of the National Security Council to succeed Rice at the United Nations.

By choosing two women known as advocates for human rights, including the NATO-led intervention in Libya with U.S. support, Obama signaled a potentially more robust foreign policy in his second term.

At the same time, his decision to make Rice the head of his national security team angered Republicans who are demanding further details on what they believe was a politically motivated effort by the administration to downplay the Benghazi attack in the middle of last year’s election campaign.

While Obama made no direct reference to the politics of the announcement, he praised Rice for being “fearless, tough” and a great patriot who champions justice and human dignity.

“I’m absolutely thrilled she’ll be back at my side, leading my national security team for my second term,” Obama said with a smiling Rice at his side.

Rice became the focus of Republican criticism after the terrorist attack last September 11 on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Five days after the assault that came on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks, Rice appeared on Sunday news shows to say it was a spontaneous development during a protest, rather than a terrorist strike.

She had been considered a top contender to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the start of Obama’s second term, but Republican opposition over the erroneous CIA talking points she had delivered forced her to withdraw her name from consideration in December.

Biden on Susan Rice: She speaks for the president

Obama ultimately nominated former U.S. Sen. John Kerry for the post.

As national security adviser, Rice will play a key role in developing and guiding the administration’s foreign policy.

Unlike a Cabinet post, the appointment requires no Senate confirmation, allowing Obama to avoid a showdown with Republicans in giving a new job to one of his most public foreign policy voices during the 2008 presidential campaign.

Rice also has been a deputy secretary of state and was previously considered a possible candidate for the national security adviser job when Obama appointed Donilon.

She said Wednesday that she was “humbled” to serve as Obama’s national security adviser and thanked the president for his confidence in her.

Mindful of the need to work with the various government, law enforcement and military entities involved in national security, she declared her admiration for “the exemplary work done every day by our colleagues at State, Defense, the intelligence community and across the government” to keep the nation safe.

To columnist and CNN Contributor John Avlon, Obama’s choice of Rice and Power showed the freedom he felt now that he won the last election of his career last year.

“Susan Rice is not on the Republicans’ Christmas card list, but this appointment, which doesn’t need Senate confirmation, is being read as a slap in the face,” Avlon said. “President Obama says he doesn’t much care. He is rewarding Susan Rice for her loyalty to his administration and moving her into the White House. She can have more influence now than she ever did on White House policy.”

He called it a “fascinating, decisive move” by a president “who is apparently liberated by a second term, who is not worried about burning bridges with Republicans and Congress who are already his critics.”

Republicans immediately criticized Obama’s choice, with conservative GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeting: “Judgement is key to national security matters. That alone should disqualify Susan Rice from her appointment.”

Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a leading Republican voice on foreign policy, tweeted that he disagreed with Obama’s appointment but added that he would “make every effort to work” with Rice on important issues.

In a statement later Wednesday, McCain expressed support for Power, calling her “well-qualified” for the job as U.N. ambassador and saying he hoped the Senate would act quickly on her nomination.

Power worked for Obama’s campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Clinton – the other leading Democratic contender at the time – as a “monster.”

She is senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president. Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda.

Avlon called Obama’s move “a coalescing within the Obama administration” by promoting “two women who are in policy terms not that far from their Republican critics. “

“The president is circling the wagons, appointing stronger supporters from his inner circle. That’s what second-term presidents do,” Avlon said, adding “these are actually strong, confident moves in a Democratic foreign policy that believes in humanitarian intervention.”

Now, he said, the roles of Rice and Power raise “real questions about what the administration will do going forward in Syria,” where critics at home and abroad contend the Obama administration has failed to intervene as needed.

Obama called himself “wistful” to be losing Donilon, the former deputy national security adviser who Obama picked to replace retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones in October 2010. Donilon was heavily involved in the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011, as well as the administration’s strategic shift of foreign policy focus to Asia.

Donilon, who also was chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Clinton administration, is married to Cathy Russell, whom Obama recently nominated to be the State Department’s ambassador at large for global women’s issues.

The president lauded Donilon’s commitment, including in-person briefings almost every day in recent years on a portfolio that covered “literally the entire world.”

“I’m personally grateful for your advice, for your counsel, most of all for your friendship,” Obama said, adding that “a president can’t ask for anything more” than the contributions and service of Donilon.

When he finished, the two men shook hands and embraced.

President Obama refers to Boston bombing as an act of terrorism

Obama says agents don%27t know who carried out the attack or why

The FBI and other agencies briefed Obama on Tuesday

President Obama, who declared the Boston Marathon bombings ""an act of terror"" on Tuesday, will visit the city on Thursday to attend a memorial service for the victims and survivors.

Obama plans to make remarks ""at an interfaith service dedicated to those who were gravely wounded or killed in Monday's bombing,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

The announcement came hours after Obama said the FBI is investigating the Boston Marathon bombings as an ""act of terrorism,"" but that the perpetrators and motives remain a mystery.

""What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack or why,"" Obama said during brief remarks at the White House. ""Whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.""

The president said ""clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation,"" but he said investigators will learn what happened and why: ""We will find whoever harmed our citizens, and we will bring them to justice.""

Obama, who had held off using the term ""terrorism"" in brief remarks on Monday night, spoke again Tuesday morning after being briefed by FBI Director Robert Mueller and other officials about what he called a ""heinous and cowardly"" crime.

""Given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism,"" Obama said. ""Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.""

In addition to Mueller, the president was briefed by Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and White House counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco.

FULL TEXT: President Obama's remarks

During the conference, Obama heard about the FBI's ""close coordination with state and local law enforcement in Boston,"" as well as the Department of Homeland Security's work with ""state and local partners across the country to share information, including any additional security steps state and local law enforcement may take,"" according to a White House readout.

The Boston bombing killed at least three people and injured more than 170 others.

""Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston,"" Obama said, pointing out that the death toll includes an 8-year-old boy.

Regardless of who carried out the attack, Obama said, ""the American people refuse to be terrorized.""

The president spoke of the ""heroism and kindness and generosity and love"" of those who rushed to help in the aftermath of the twin bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. He cited ""exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets.""

He added: ""So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil, that's it. Selflessly. Compassionately. Unafraid.""

While vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice, Obama said authorities don't know whether the attack was carried out by a group or an individual or individuals, or what the motive might have been.

""So everything else at this point is speculation,"" he said.

Shortly before his remarks, Obama ordered flags at the White House and other government buildings be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims of Monday's attack.

The flag-lowering is ""a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013,"" Obama said in a proclamation."

Law enforcement agencies in Southern California have reported few similar problems -- until now.

In the last several days, there have been several reports of such group crime waves in South L.A., Hollywood, San Bernardino and Victorville. Long Beach police are bracing for another one Friday.

These so-called bash mobs of “flash mob” crime waves are organized through social media and have been a problem in Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington. In April, 28 Chicago youths were arrested on suspicion of attacking pedestrians along the city’s famed Magnificent Mile. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation in May enacting stiffer penalties for people who text or use social media to organize mob attacks.

Long Beach police warned in a statement that participants could face severe penalties.

“The mere participation in such an event can result in felony charges including conspiracy, and are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison,” according to the statement.

Police said they feared bash mob organizers planned to hit Long Beach at 2 p.m.

Long Beach experienced such a gathering July 9, when more than 100 people descended on stretches of downtown in an organized, sudden crime rampage.

On Monday, a group of unruly young people broke off from hundreds gathered for a Trayvon Martin prayer vigil and rushed into a Wal-Mart on Crenshaw Boulevard, where they tossed merchandise and tried to break into a jewelry display case.

In Hollywood on Tuesday night, a flash mob of thieves rushed down Hollywood Boulevard, stealing phones, knocking over tourists and vandalizing shops, according to police, who said it may have been related to the George Zimmerman verdict. Twelve people — 11 juveniles and one 18-year-old -- were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

On Wednesday night in Victorville, authorities arrested 17 people after a group allegedly tried to force its way into the Mall of Victor Valley.

USA TODAY

Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suffered multiple serious injuries before his capture, including a skull fracture and a gunshot to the face, according to newly unsealed court documents.

The 19-year-old was caught in a shootout with police four days after the April 15 bombings, yet managed to escape in a car. He was captured the next day while hiding in a boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown, Mass.

His 27-year-old brother, Tamerlan, was killed during the earlier confrontation with police.

The pair were being sought in connection with the bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15 that killed three people and injured more than 250.

Details of the younger Tsarnaev's injuries were contained in testimony given shortly after his arrest by Stephen Ray Odom, a trauma surgeon who treated Tsarnaev at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The transcript of his testimony was ordered unsealed Monday.

""He has multiple gunshot wounds, the most severe of which appears to have entered through the left side inside of his mouth and exited the left face, lower face,"" Odom said, according to the transcript.

""This was a high-powered injury that has resulted in skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, the lateral portion of his C1 vertebrae, with a significant soft-tissue injury, as well as injury to the pharynx, the mouth, and a small vascular injury that's been treated,"" he testified.

Odom also treated Tsarnaev for several days after he was taken to the hospital.

""He has multiple gunshots (sic) wounds to the extremities that have been treated with dressing to the lower extremities; and in the case of his left hand, he had multiple bony injuries as well that were treated with fixation and soft-tissue coverage, as well as tendon repair and vascular ligation,"" Odom told the court.

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a “boundless global war” but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks.

He said America was at a “crossroads” and should no longer see it as a “self-defeating” perpetual fight, but one that must at some point end, “like all wars.”

Obama said “the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat,” but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers. He also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats, and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas.

Obama: U.S. will keep deploying drones – when they are only option

He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sought to calm criticism around his administration’s investigation of national security leaks.

Obama, ‘troubled’ by leak investigations, asks for review

He even paused his prepared remarks to take on a woman in the audience from “Code Pink” who interrupted him several times in open disagreement.

Obama interrupted

“I think that the, and I’m going off script as you might expect here …. the voice of that woman is worth paying attention to,” Obama said to applause. “Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said and obviously she wasn’t listening to me in what I said but these are tough issues and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong.”

Here are five things we learned from the speech:

1. Using drones are OK, but…

The Obama administration for the first time revealed Wednesday that drones had killed four American citizens since 2009. Obama used the speech to more definitively explain the U.S. policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use.

Still, he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists, and added that Americans overseas who wish to do the United States harm were fair game, in the most extreme cases.

“When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America – and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot – his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,” Obama said.

He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden, but added that “to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties.”

Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress.

CNN’s senior political analyst Gloria Borger says Obama defends the use of drones.

“But he also really acknowledged that it can be overused, even by a president, and that you cannot just depend on drones for your national security.”

2. I wasn’t kidding about closing Gitmo…

When he was first elected in 2008, Obama vowed to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Gitmo.

But in the years since, Congress has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical. And, as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment, the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility.

But that changed Thursday.

“The original premise for opening GTMO – that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention – was found unconstitutional five years ago,” said Obama. “In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.”

He called on Congress to “lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO,” appointed a special envoy to “achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries,” and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, where 56 of Gitmo’s 86 detainees are from.

3. No leaks, but there’s that freedom of the press thing…

Obama has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his Justice Department where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at The Associated Press and a Fox News reporter was labeled in a Justice Department affidavit as “potentially being an ‘aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator’” to the crime of disclosing secret information.

Justice Department tracked Fox News reporter’s e-mail, movements

So he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions.

“As commander-in-chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field,” Obama said. “But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.”

“Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,” he added.

He vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters.

4. A new term brings a new policy

Obama clearly used the speech to redefine U.S. policy on the so-called “war on terror,” acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil, the threats have moved.

“Now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience to draw from, now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today’s threats, and how we should confront them.”

“From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation – and world – that we leave to our children,” Obama said.

“I was listening to a president who was saying to us, ‘Let’s get beyond where we were when I first took office, and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since I’ve been president of the United States,’” said CNN’s senior political analyst Gloria Borger. “He said, ‘We must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us.’”

But Obama will face opposition as he attempts to shift U.S. policy.

“Both on drones and on Guantanamo, he’s going to get some pushback,” said Borger.

5. Free speech also means ‘you listen’

A loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech, calling on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay facility. But the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted.

“You are commander-in-chief – you can close Guantanamo today,” she yelled. “It’s been 11 years!”

Obama stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back. “This is part of free speech, is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak, alright?” Obama said.

The woman was identified as Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the protest group Code Pink and was later escorted out of the building and released.

Later, he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience.

“Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school, immigrants coming to our shores, fans taking in a ballgame, a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street, a citizen shouting their concerns at a president,” he concluded.

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Confidential report lists U.S. weapons system designs compromised by Chinese cyberspies,"Designs for many of the nation’s most sensitive advanced weapons systems have been compromised by Chinese hackers, according to a report prepared for the Pentagon and to officials from government and the defense industry.

Among more than two dozen major weapons systems whose designs were breached were programs critical to U.S. missile defenses and combat aircraft and ships, according to a previously undisclosed section of a confidential report prepared for Pentagon leaders by the Defense Science Board.

Experts warn that the electronic intrusions gave China access to advanced technology that could accelerate the development of its weapons systems and weaken the U.S. military advantage in a future conflict.

The Defense Science Board, a senior advisory group made up of government and civilian experts, did not accuse the Chinese of stealing the designs. But senior military and industry officials with knowledge of the breaches said the vast majority were part of a widening Chinese campaign of espionage against U.S. defense contractors and government agencies.

The significance and extent of the targets help explain why the Obama administration has escalated its warnings to the Chinese government to stop what Washington sees as rampant cyber­theft.

In January, the advisory panel warned in the public version of its report that the Pentagon is unprepared to counter a full-scale cyber-conflict. The list of compromised weapons designs is contained in a confidential version, and it was provided to The Washington Post.

Some of the weapons form the backbone of the Pentagon’s regional missile defense for Asia, Europe and the Persian Gulf. The designs included those for the advanced Patriot missile system, known as PAC-3; an Army system for shooting down ballistic missiles, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD; and the Navy’s Aegis ballistic-missile defense system.

Also identified in the report are vital combat aircraft and ships, including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ship, which is designed to patrol waters close to shore.

Also on the list is the most expensive weapons system ever built — the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is on track to cost about $1.4 trillion. The 2007 hack of that project was reported previously.

China, which is pursuing a comprehensive long-term strategy to modernize its military, is investing in ways to overcome the U.S. military advantage — and cyber-espionage is seen as a key tool in that effort, the Pentagon noted this month in a report to Congress on China. For the first time, the Pentagon specifically named the Chinese government and military as the culprit behind intrusions into government and other computer systems.

As the threat from Chinese cyber-espionage has grown, the administration has become more public with its concerns. In a speech in March, Thomas Donilon, the national security adviser to President Obama, urged China to control its cyber-activity. In its public criticism, the administration has avoided identifying the specific targets of hacking.

But U.S. officials said several examples were raised privately with senior Chinese government representatives in a four-hour meeting a year ago. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed meeting, said senior U.S. defense and diplomatic officials presented the Chinese with case studies detailing the evidence of major intrusions into U.S. companies, including defense contractors.

In addition, a recent classified National Intelligence Estimate on economic cyber-espionage concluded that China was by far the most active country in stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies.

The Chinese government insists that it does not conduct ­cyber-

espionage on U.S. agencies or companies, and government spokesmen often complain that Beijing is a victim of U.S. cyberattacks.

Obama is expected to raise the issue when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in California.

A spokesman for the Pentagon declined to discuss the list from the science board’s report. But the spokesman, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said in an e-mail, “The Department of Defense has growing concerns about the global threat to economic and national security from persistent cyber-intrusions aimed at the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and commercial data, which threatens the competitive edge of U.S. businesses like those in the Defense Industrial Base.”

The confidential list of compromised weapons system designs and technologies represents the clearest look at what the Chinese are suspected of targeting. When the list was read to independent defense experts, they said they were shocked by the extent of the cyber-espionage and the potential for compromising U.S. defenses.

“That’s staggering,” said Mark Stokes, executive director of the Project 2049 Institute, a think tank that focuses on Asia security issues. “These are all very critical weapons systems, critical to our national security. When I hear this in totality, it’s breathtaking.”

The experts said the cybertheft creates three major problems. First, access to advanced U.S. designs gives China an immediate operational edge that could be exploited in a conflict. Second, it accelerates China’s acquisition of advanced military technology and saves billions in development costs. And third, the U.S. designs can be used to benefit China’s own defense industry. There are long-standing suspicions that China’s theft of designs for the F-35 fighter allowed Beijing to develop its version much faster.

“You’ve seen significant improvements in Chinese military capabilities through their willingness to spend, their acquisitions of advanced Russian weapons, and from their cyber-espionage campaign,” said James A. Lewis, a cyber-policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Ten years ago, I used to call the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] the world’s largest open-air military museum. I can’t say that now.”

The public version of the science board report noted that such cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage could impose “severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat.” Those consequences could include severed communication links critical to the operation of U.S. forces. Data corruption could misdirect U.S. operations. Weapons could fail to operate as intended. Planes, satellites or drones could crash, the report said.

In other words, Stokes said, “if they have a better sense of a THAAD design or PAC-3 design, then that increases the potential of their ballistic missiles being able to penetrate our or our allies’ missile defenses.”

Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight, made a similar point. “If they got into the combat systems, it enables them to understand it to be able to jam it or otherwise disable it,” he said. “If they’ve got into the basic algorithms for the missile and how they behave, somebody better get out a clean piece of paper and start to design all over again.”

The list did not describe the extent or timing of the penetrations. Nor did it say whether the theft occurred through the computer networks of the U.S. government, defense contractors or subcontractors.

Privately, U.S. officials say that senior Pentagon officials are frustrated by the scale of cybertheft from defense contractors, who routinely handle sensitive classified data. The officials said concerns have been expressed by Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman, as well as Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency.

“In many cases, they don’t know they’ve been hacked until the FBI comes knocking on their door,” said a senior military official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “This is billions of dollars of combat advantage for China. They’ve just saved themselves 25 years of research and development. It’s nuts.”

In an attempt to combat the problem, the Pentagon launched a pilot program two years ago to help the defense industry shore up its computer defenses, allowing the companies to use classified threat data from the National Security Agency to screen their networks for malware. The Chinese began to focus on subcontractors, and now the government is in the process of expanding the sharing of threat data to more defense contractors and other industries.

An effort to change defense contracting rules to require companies to secure their networks or risk losing Pentagon business stalled last year. But the 2013 Defense Authorization Act has a provision that requires defense contractors holding classified clearances to report intrusions into their networks and allow access to government investigators to analyze the breach.

The systems on the science board’s list are built by a variety of top defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. None of the companies would comment about whether their systems have been breached.

But Northrop Grumman spokes­man Randy Belote acknowledged the company “is experiencing greater numbers of attempts to penetrate its computer networks” and said the firm is “vigilant” about protecting its networks.

A Lockheed Martin official said the firm is “spending more time helping deal with attacks on the supply chain” of partners, subcontractors and suppliers than dealing with attacks directly against the company. “For now, our defenses are strong enough to counter the threat, and many attackers know that, so they go after suppliers. But of course they are always trying to develop new ways to attack.”

The Defense Science Board report also listed broad technologies that have been compromised, such as drone video systems, nanotechnology, tactical data links and electronic warfare systems — all areas where the Pentagon and Chinese military are investing heavily.

“Put all that together — the design compromises and the technology theft — and it’s pretty significant,” Stokes said."

(CNN) - The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said the threat of terrorism overseas is ""getting worse, not better.""

""I personally see it spreading like a spiderweb, like a wildfire, through Northern Africa and the Middle East,"" Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union.""



""As that threat increases overseas, so too does it increase to the homeland - and that's my basic concern as Homeland chairman, is to keep that threat outside the United States.""

Leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees told CNN earlier this month on “State of the Union” that terrorists have gained ground in the past two years and that the U.S. is not any safer than it was at the outset of 2011. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, agreed that the Obama administration has lost ground in the ongoing battle with global terrorism.

McCaul said that though policies put in place as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks have prevented a similar large-scale event on U.S. soil, President Barack Obama is pushing a false narrative about the nation's safety in the world.

""When the President of the United States talks about the, downgrades the threat, his narrative is that al Qaeda is on the run, and since bin Laden has been killed the threat is no longer existing - I think is a false narrative and premise because, as we see this threat all throughout northern Africa, as we saw Egypt fall, Libya, now Syria is a great culmination of the Sunni-Shia conflict.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Feinstein’s and Rogers' comments surprised him but acknowledged that low-level attacks by lone-wolf actors, like the Boston Marathon bombing, are still ""very threatening.""

But is the U.S. more effective now at keeping terrorism off its shores?

""I think we are better now than we have ever been, but we are never going to be 100% safe,"" Schiff said, pointing to the ongoing conflict in Syria, a country that he said has become a ""magnet"" for those looking to join Jihad.

McCaul agreed: ""I think Syria is now the training ground for the world. … These rebel forces are more of a threat than anything.""

Answering questions by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer before an audience at the Aspen Security Forum, Mattis said he found it inexplicable that the plot was dealt with as a law enforcement matter with no clear diplomatic or military response.

Iran was under Mattis’ purview at Central Command. Asked afterward whether he presented military options to the White House that were rejected, he said his advice would remain confidential.

In May, Manssor Arbabsiar, an Iranian American used-car salesman from Texas, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to plotting to hire assassins from a Mexican drug cartel to murder Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the U.S. at the behest of a cousin in Iran. The cousin, Gholam Shakuri, was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, which is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

Mattis said the plot was orchestrated “at the highest levels” of the Iranian government.

He criticized the fact that the U.S. announced the plot to the public by having Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. detail criminal charges. “Why wasn’t the secretary of State, secretary of Defense up at the microphone, not making any threats, just saying, we’ll be back?” he said.

The response was not adequate, he said. “I don’t know why [it] wasn’t dealt with more strongly.”

An Obama administration spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and potential 2016 presidential candidate, said roughly 95 percent of the bill is in “perfect shape” and that the full chamber debates are off to a good start.

However, he expressed concerns about whether the legislation ensures adequate border security and said Americans have “valid issues” about the matter.

""The vast majority of Americans, the vast majority of conservative Republicans, are prepared to support immigration reform, but only if we can ensure that we're not going to have another wave of illegal immigration in the future,"" he told ABC’s “This Week.""

He declined to say whether he would vote for the measure unless changes are made.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who also helped write the bipartisan immigration bill, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that conservatives trying to block the measure will doom the party and all but guarantee a Democrat will remain in the White House after the 2016 elections.

""After eight years of President Obama's economic policies, and quite frankly foreign policy, people are going to be looking around,"" he said. ""But if we don't pass immigration reform, if we don't get it off the table in a reasonable, practical way, it doesn't matter who you run in 2016. We're in a demographic death spiral as a party and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community in my view is pass comprehensive immigration reform. If you don't do that, it really doesn't matter who we run.""

A Democrat also involved in crafting the bill, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, went a step further by predicting on CNN’s “State of the Union” that ""there'll never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party"" if immigration overhaul fails to pass.

The Senate last week overcame a procedural hurdle in moving forward on the first immigration overhaul in a generation.

Lawmakers from both parties' voted to begin formal debate on a proposal that would give an estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally a long and difficult path to citizenship.

The legislation also creates a low-skilled guest-worker program, expands the number of visas available for high-tech workers and de-emphasizes family ties in the system for legal immigration that has been in place for decades. It also sets border security goals that the government must meet before immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are granted any change in status.

In addition to tougher border-security measures, Republicans are demanding stricter standards for who qualifies for government programs such as Social Security and health care.

Rubio is trying to balance concerns from his party's conservative flank that has great sway in picking a nominee with the political attempt to win over Hispanic and Asian American voters who overwhelmingly favored President Obama's re-election in 2012.

Further complicating Rubio's presidential aspirations, the Republican-led House is considering its own version of immigration proposals that more closely follow their own perspective, which hews toward Tea Party principles.

In 2012, Obama won re-election with the backing of 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 73 percent of Asian voters. A thwarted immigration overhaul could send those voting blocs more solidly to Democrats' side in future elections. That has led some Republican lawmakers to support immigration reform, but the party's conservative base still opposes any legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living here illegally.

Democrats are well aware of the numbers.

""I would tell my Republican colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, that the road to the White House comes through a road with a pathway to legalization,"" Menendez said. ""Without it, there'll never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party.""

Snowden remains trapped in a diplomatic no-man’s land at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, lacking documents that would allow him to enter Russia or travel to a country willing to damage relations with Washington to give him refuge.

The 30-year-old former contract worker for the National Security Agency has been on the run for more than a month since telling journalists about massive U.S. efforts to track telephone conversations and Internet traffic around the world.

Snowden lost what was probably his best shot for reprieve on Thursday, when minor parties in Iceland’s parliament proposed granting Snowden immediate citizenship. That would have allowed him, once provided with a passport by the Icelandic Embassy in Moscow, to fly to Reykjavik and shelter in the chilly Nordic nation to evade extradition to the United States for prosecution on espionage charges.

But the proposal by the liberal Left-Green, Pirate and Brighter Future parties fizzled, with only six of the parliament’s 63 members expressing support, the Russia Today network reported. The legislature then recessed for the summer.

Before Friday’s announcement of additional asylum bids, WikiLeaks had reported that Snowden had appealed to 21 countries for political asylum. He subsequently withdrew the request to settle in Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s condition that he refrain from leaking information about U.S. surveillance practices that are “aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners.”

None of the other 20 states identified by WikiLeaks has offered Snowden refuge. Most have evaded a formal response because their asylum laws require an application to be made in person on national soil. Others, such as U.S. allies France, Germany, Poland and India, have denied him entry.

WikiLeaks, the secret-revealing website that has been aiding Snowden in his efforts to dodge U.S. extradition, announced via Twitter on Friday that six more countries had been approached.

“Edward #Snowden has applied to another six countries for asylum. They will not be named at this time due to attempted U.S. interference,” WikiLeaks tweeted.

The freedom-of-information crusaders were apparently referring to reports of U.S. pressure being applied to countries to which Snowden had previously appealed for asylum. Four U.S.-allied states -- France, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- denied airspace entry Tuesday to a plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales because they had been informed that Snowden might be on board with the leftist leader, who as headed home to La Paz after a meeting in Moscow.

Snowden has been in the Sheremetyevo transit area for 13 days. Foreign journalists have been searching the publicly accessible areas of the airport between arrival gates and passport control but none have reported any encounter with the fugitive. That suggests he is in a secure area under watch by Russian border guards -- and probably security and intelligence officials keen to learn more about the secret data he reportedly carried in with him on four computers.

(Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images)

Rattled lawmakers in both parties applauded President Obama’s decision to shutter two dozen U.S. diplomatic posts across the Middle East and North Africa this weekend, calling the threat of a fresh terrorist attack credible, specific and the most alarming in years.

The State Department extended the closure of 19 embassies, consulates and smaller diplomatic posts through Saturday “out of an abundance of caution,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a written statement Sunday. Several other posts, including embassies in Kabul and Baghdad, will reopen Monday.

Lawmakers who had received intelligence briefings joined a parade of security experts and administration officials in warning Sunday of the seriousness of the threat, which appears to emanate from a particularly dangerous and active al-Qaeda franchise in Yemen.

Neither the location nor the target of a potential attack is known, “but the intent seems clear,” Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on ABC’s “This Week”: “The intent is to attack Western, not just U.S., interests.”

The Obama administration ordered the posts closed and issued a global travel warning to Americans on Friday, after U.S. intelligence agencies picked up communications among known terrorists discussing “certain dates” and being “specific as to how enormous it was going to be,” Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said on the same show. King serves on the House intelligence and homeland security committees.

Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on the show that “operatives” may already be “in place” for what “high-level” al-Qaeda members are calling “a major attack.”

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, compared the intercepted “chatter” to data picked up before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“This is the most serious threat that I’ve seen in the last several years,” Chambliss said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Pressed for details, he added: “What we have heard is some specifics on what’s intended to be done and some individuals who are making plans, such as we saw before 9/11. Whether they are going to be suicide vests that are used, or whether they’re planning on vehicle-borne bombs being carried into an area, we don’t know. But we’re hearing some kind of that same chatter that we heard pre-9/11.”

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed that view, saying, “The administration’s call to close these embassies . . . was actually a very smart call.” That’s particularly true, he said, in light of what Republicans view as the administration’s failure to respond to threats last year to the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

“I’m glad to see that in this case they’re taking this very seriously,” McCaul said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Security forces closed roads, erected extra blast walls and increased patrols Sunday near some of the affected embassies and consulates, according to the Associated Press. They include posts in Yemen and Egypt, which were ordered to remain closed through the coming week. In Washington, analysts at the CIA, the National Counterterrorism Center and other agencies continued to pore over signals, intercepts and other data, searching for clues.

“The intelligence community continues to look for additional information to provide better insight and more specificity with regard to the existing threat,” a senior U.S. intelligence official said.

The State Department has told Americans abroad to take extra precautions throughout the month, warning that terrorists have in the past attacked subways, railways, planes, boats “and other tourist infrastructure.” On Saturday, Interpol, the France-based international police agency, issued a global security alert, saying it suspects al-Qaeda involvement in several recent prison breaks — including in Iraq, Libya and ­Pakistan — “which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals.”

Interpol noted that the heightened security fears coincide with the final days of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that Chambliss said “is always an interesting time for terrorists.” This week is also the anniversary of the simultaneous 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and in Dar es ­Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people. And the Sept. 11 anniversary is just a few weeks away.

In addition, the head of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, recently posted videos on jihadist Web sites saying that now is the time to retaliate for U.S. drone strikes in Yemen and Afghanistan, lawmakers said. The al-Qaeda franchise in Yemen, which has targeted Americans in recent years, is a likely choice to wreak such revenge. The group asserted responsibility for the failed Christmas Day 2009 attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit.

“Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is probably the biggest threat to the homeland. They’re the al-Qaeda faction that still talks about hitting the West and hitting the homeland. . . . So we are on a high state of alert,” McCaul said, adding that the threat is “very imminent.”

But McCaul, a former federal prosecutor who handled terrorism cases in Dallas, said the good thing about the State Department’s decision to issue alerts is that “you let them know that you know . . . and they oftentimes back down.”

The warnings of a possible terrorist plot come at an opportune time for the National Security Agency, which has recently come under fire after the disclosure of surveillance programs that critics say threaten the privacy of millions of U.S. citizens. Lawmakers confirmed that the NSA was instrumental in teasing out information about the latest threat.

King, a frequent critic of the Obama administration, dismissed suggestions that the White House could be exaggerating the security threat to deflate the NSA’s critics.

“It’s absolutely crazy to say there’s any conspiracy here. . . . The government would have been totally negligent if it had not taken the actions taken,” King said.

“I’m a Republican. I’ve had problems with the administration on different issues,” he said. “But what they are doing now is what has to be done.”

Washington (CNN) - President Obama is expected to nominate former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel as the next Defense Secretary, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The nomination is likely to occur early next week, other sources told CNN.

The White House told some senior members of Congress to expect the tapping of Hagel, according to a knowledgeable source. Another source with knowledge of the nomination called it ""locked down.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Some in the defense industry were told to expect the Hagel nomination as early as Monday, one source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.

A Republican, Hagel represented the state of Nebraska in the US Senate from 1997 until January 3, 2009 when he retired.

The White House has previously said that the president has made no final decisions. One source told CNN Thursday that the president was ""mulling"" over appointments in Hawaii this week.

A White House source told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the president ""has not offered the job to anyone.""

In an interview that aired on NBC December 30, Obama allowed he had not then made a decision on who to nominate, but said in making the choice his ""number one criteria will be who's going to do the best job in helping to secure America.""

""I've served with Chuck Hagel. I know him. He is a patriot,"" Obama said on ""Meet the Press. ""He is somebody who has done extraordinary work both in the United States Senate. Somebody who served this country with valor in Vietnam. And is somebody who's currently serving on my Intelligence Advisory Board and doing an outstanding job.""

His comments came as Hagel has undergone criticism from high-profile figures in Washington and other groups taking issue with some of his past positions–namely, his former opposition to sanctions against Iran and comments he made that led some pro-Israel lobbyists to argue he was not supportive of the Jewish state. He was also not in favor of the surge of troops in Iraq pushed by the Bush administration.

""A lot of Republicans and Democrats are very concerned about Chuck Hagel's position on Iran sanctions, his views toward Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, and that there is wide and deep concern about his policies,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Sunday on Fox News.

The source with knowledge of the nominations adds that White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew is likely to be nominated as Treasury Secretary, perhaps as early as next week. This source says that while Lew is expected to be confirmed, there is some consternation in the business community about Lew, who is known as a ""numbers guy"" but has ""little or no market and business experience.""

The administration is believed to be searching for a person with business expertise to run the Commerce Department, but there seems to be no first-in-line name circulating at this point. Gene Sperling is expected to stay as Director of the National Economic Council.

Former Washington state governor Christine Gregoire, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm are also being considered for cabinet posts.

But The Washington Post reports that the NSA accesses data as it moves between centers

Alexander didn't appear to address that specific claim

The NSA later denies using the technique to ""collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data""

The National Security Agency doesn't have access to servers run by Internet giants Google and Yahoo, its chief said in a pushback to a Washington Post report that the U.S. spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text, video and audio records every day.

But Gen. Keith Alexander's comments at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday don't appear to address the substance of the newspaper's allegations -- that the NSA has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by U.S. law and court oversight.

Asked about the report by a Bloomberg Television reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference, Alexander denied breaking into servers or databases run by Internet companies.

""Not to my knowledge,"" he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases.

""It would be illegal for us to do that. So, I don't know what the report is,"" Alexander said. ""But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.""

However, the allegations published by The Post -- based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- aren't that the NSA has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies.

Instead, the newspaper -- citing the Snowden documents and unnamed ""knowledgeable officials"" -- reported that the NSA gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world.

According to The Post, the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters found a way to exploit a weakness in Internet architecture to copy data as it moves from the public Internet into data centers maintained by the companies.

The agency then uses custom-built software to decode the companies' internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect, the newspaper reported.

The material collected under the program -- code-named MUSCULAR -- includes e-mail addressing information, as well as ""content such as text, audio and video,"" according to The Post.

The agency's Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top-secret January 9, 2013, accounting on which The Post's report is based, according to the newspaper.

In a statement, the NSA said ""the assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection is also not true.""

""NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons,"" the agency said.

It's unclear how much of the material collected involves what the NSA calls ""U.S. persons,"" a category that includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the United States.

But unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court, surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards, The Post reported.

The report raised concerns from Google and Yahoo, with the Internet behemoths saying they never gave the NSA permission to access communication links to their servers.

""We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency,"" said Yahoo spokeswoman Sarah Meron.

Google has ""long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links,"" said David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer.

""We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.""

The newspaper report emerged a day after Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, testified before a House committee reviewing the agency's surveillance activities.

The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, came after a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens."

A likely possibility: An increase in a passenger security fee that industry lobbyists warn could add to the price of plane tickets.

Lawmakers face a January 15 deadline if they want to replace some of the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. But that will require making other spending cuts or raising revenue to preserve the sequester's intended savings.

Airline advocates argue that an increase in the security fee to reduce deficits would do nothing to strengthen airport security or speed up long security lines.

Right now the passenger security fee per ticket is $2.50 for each leg of a trip. But the total fee to get to a destination is capped at $5.

Say you book a nonstop roundtrip to Chicago. You pay $2.50 on the way out and $2.50 on the way back. If you booked flights with stopovers each way, you'd pay $5 on the way out and $5 for your return home.

If Congress goes ahead with a hike in user fees, political analysts and the airline industry expect lawmakers would double the security fee to $5 per trip each way. That would effectively double the fee for nonstop flights, but leave the fee for multi-leg trips unchanged.

Related: Airlines rake in $27 billion in customer fees

It's not clear how much of the increase would be passed on to fliers.

""Each airline will take a different approach. It will manifest [either] as the passenger pays, the airline pays or a little bit of both,"" said Sean Kennedy, senior vice president for global government affairs at the trade group Airlines for America.

Doubling the passenger security fee for nonstop flights could raise about $13 billion over the next decade if it went into effect immediately, or $11 billion if it started in 2015, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

But that would only make up for some of the budget cuts that lawmakers are seeking to replace.

That's why analysts expect that negotiators also may propose hikes in other user fees, as well as an increase in broadband spectrum sales, and higher federal worker retirement contributions, among other measures.

Raising users fees gives both parties a political out.

The Republicans can say that they guarded against any tax increases because higher user fees simply count as more revenue -- i.e., not an actual income tax increase on wages or investments.

And Democrats can say that they avoided deeper cuts in domestic programs as well as changes to Medicare and Social Security."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/02/25/is-president-obama-willing-to-draft-women-like-julia/,2013-02-25 00:00:00,['Maggie Gallagher'],Is President Obama willing to draft women like 'Julia'?,"The Obama administration framed its decision to put women into combat as a matter of choice and fairness. “Not everyone is going to be able to be a combat soldier,” outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said, “but everyone is entitled to a chance.”

But there is little about war that is either about choice or fairness.

Here’s a big question President Obama ought to face head on: Is he willing to draft ""Julia"" on an equal basis with John and if not, why not? (""Julia"" was the Obama campaign's fictional construct of the average American woman, whose support they sought.)

[pullquote]

Because President Obama has just single-handedly gutted the legal rationale for excluding women from the draft.

In 1981, the Supreme Court upheld a males-only draft registration law for one reason alone: “Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft.”

That law excluding women from the draft is now a sitting duck, bereft of any legal legs to stand on unless President Obama steps forward to provide a new rationale.

Will Obama moms put up with the prospect that their daughters could be sent to war involuntarily, just like men? Will anyone put the question to them or to President Obama in a politically effective way?

Congress must use its power to find out the truth about women in combat. Three questions must be raised, and the data collected to answer them:

1. What is the cost to military effectiveness of sending women into combat?

2. What is the cost to the taxpayer per successful woman recruit compared to male combat troops?

3. Finally, what is the cost to the physical and mental health of young women themselves, compared to male soldiers?

Even with sharply lowered physical standards for women in the Army, for example, women’s failure, injury, and attrition rates are much higher than men’s. (Meaning that the cost of recruiting one female soldier is much higher). Women soldiers also have higher rates of hospitalization for mental disorders and also higher rates of evacuation from the field for psychiatric reasons, a 2011 review of the medical literature by Dr. Fatma Batuman and colleagues showed.

And then there’s the fact that at least one out of ten active-duty women soldiers is pregnant, unintentionally each year. A 2013 study by Kate Grindlay and Daniel Grossman found that almost 11 percent of women soldiers said they had been pregnant unintentionally in the past year.

If one out of ten men were unavailable for combat each year because of an unexpected medical condition, our military would literally be decimated.

The taxpayers, meanwhile, bear an unequal burden in hiring women soldiers who serve less time, sustain more injuries, and are much more likely to be non-deployable.

What about the cost to young women themselves? After ten years in combat-exposed service, the Pentagon should have hard data but if so it is not releasing it.

Women soldiers express the most concern.

Listen hard to Marine Capt. Katie Petronio, who was deployed twice under combat conditions with the engineering corps in Iraq and Afghanistan. “My main concern is a question of longevity,” she wrote in the Marine Corps Gazette, “At the beginning of my tour in Helmand Province, I was physically capable of conducting combat operations for weeks at a time.”

However, “By the fifth month into the deployment, I had muscle atrophy in my thighs that was causing me to constantly trip and my legs to buckle with the slightest grade change. My agility during firefights and mobility on and off vehicles and perimeter walls was seriously hindering my response time and overall capability. It was evident that stress and muscular deterioration was affecting everyone regardless of gender; however, the rate of my deterioration was noticeably faster than that of male Marines and further compounded by gender-specific medical conditions.”

Petronio lost 17 pounds and is now infertile.

This happened even though she was carrying a fraction of the physical load men carried.

For ""Julia’s"" own sake, as well as for the sake of our national defense and our taxpayers, Congress should demand accountability on the costs of this new experiment: the costs to the military first and foremost, the costs to the taxpayers, and finally, the costs to the women themselves.

If young women are assuming greater risk to their health or their children by volunteering for combat duty (or military service) compared to male soldiers, they ought at least to know it.

All of these inquiries need to feed into a fourth question which President Obama must be called on to answer:

Is he willing to draft ""Julia"" or not? If not, why not?

The Supreme Court will want to know."

Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight

The program was used to stop ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, Sen. Feinstein says

Critics say it's overreach, with Al Gore calling it ""obscenely outrageous""

Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?

That's the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans' phone records.

FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian , published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was ""very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate.""

The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.

When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, ""It was like, 'Oh, God, not one more thing ... where we're trying to protect America and then it looks like we're spying.'""

An author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.""

""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder.

But not everyone in the nation's capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a ""three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years"" -- so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it's helped to disrupt ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, she said.

""It is lawful,"" the California Democrat insisted. ""It has been briefed by Congress.""

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that ""this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop"" and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama ""put in place a stronger regime of oversight"" when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring ""we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.""

JUST WATCHED Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA 01:56

""That is his top priority,"" Earnest said of domestic security. ""But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.""

What's been happening, and for how long?

In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.

""Verizon's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,"" the company said at the time

Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.

The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring ""originating and terminating"" phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.

The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company's website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed ""millions of U.S. customers of Verizon"" were affected by the collection of information ""regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.""

In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications ""or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.""

An Obama administration official said any such order would relate ""exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.""

This kind of information ""allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,"" the unnamed official said in a statement to media.

Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.

Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying ""they contain numerous inaccuracies."" Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program ""cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.""

In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it ""will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.""

Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren't terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.

""There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy.

""It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer.""

Al Gore: 'Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous'

This group is hardly alone.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it ""beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.""

The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as ""the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.""

Many in President Barack Obama's own party spoke forcefully against it as well.

Three Democratic representatives -- John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is ""highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the"" Patriot Act.

""(The revelations) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,"" they wrote.

Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as ""the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking.""

One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.

""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.

Senator says ending program would be 'catastrophic'

Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.

""Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,"" said Feinstein.

Her intelligence committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather ""significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.""

Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that's linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number.

""It's not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers,"" Fuentes explained on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.""

Rep. Lindsey Graham said that, as a Verizon customer, ""it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number."" The South Carolina Republican said he's confident the government won't monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their ""number pops up on some terrorist's phone.""

""The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic,"" he said."

Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a subcommittee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, has re -filed a resolution to form such a select committee. Only Speaker John Boehner can allow the formation of a House Select Committee.

Other Republicans were unsure of their support for a select committee. “You know, I don’t think so. We’re still under the review of our committee right now, so we’re still conducting our investigation. We haven’t finished it yet. I’m not exactly sure where the foreign affairs committee is yet, but I know they are still doing their review,” said Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, when Breitbart News asked if he would support Wolf’s effort.

Wolf sent a “dear colleague letter” to Republican House members on Friday asking for their support for his resolution. Wolf expressed the necessity for the select committee so that Benghazi survivors could have a venue to put forth their accounts without risking their jobs or face prosecution from the Justice Department.

Boehner and Rogers are both part of Congress’ “super 8,” both parties’ top leadership in the upper and lower chambers. They, as well as chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, are all privy to classified information about the Benghazi attack.

Rogers also disagreed with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) regarding Paul’s assertion that the CIA annex in Benghazi was a site that Americans were running guns to “out of Libya into Turkish hands.”

“We have looked at all of that. I can find no information that substantiates that, but if it were there, I would want to find it,” Rogers said.

On January 24, Speaker Boehner told conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, regarding Paul’s remarks, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, both told Breitbart News they knew nothing about the gunrunning from the CIA annex to which Paul was referring.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said in November that he did not find it necessary for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi attack after Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) had announced the need for one.

The three senators, who are all part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a statement on Monday threatening to place a hold on John Brennan, Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director, if the administration did not release more information about the Benghazi attack.

The statement included a litany of what remains known and unknown about the attacks, as well as contradictory statements made by administration officials in congressional testimony.

Senators are expected to vote on Brennan’s nomination in committee on Tuesday."

While President Obama has made no secret of his desire to withdraw American troops as rapidly as possible, the plans for a postwar American presence in Afghanistan have generally envisioned a residual force of thousands of troops to carry out counterterrorism operations and to help train and equip Afghan soldiers.

In a conference call with reporters, the deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes, said that leaving no troops “would be an option that we would consider,” adding that “the president does not view these negotiations as having a goal of keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan.”

Military analysts have said it is difficult to conceive of how the United States might achieve even its limited post-2014 goals in Afghanistan without any kind of troop presence. That suggests the White House is staking out a negotiating position with both the Pentagon and with Mr. Karzai, as he and Mr. Obama begin to work out an agreement covering the post-2014 American role in Afghanistan."

Manning faces up 90 years in prison for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks

Army psychologist testified Manning struggles with his gender identity

A U.S. soldier%2C Manning was working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010

FORT MEADE, Maryland (AP) — U.S. soldier Bradley Manning took the stand Wednesday during his sentencing hearing for leaking classified material to WikiLeaks and apologized for hurting the United States and others.

Manning gave an unsworn statement, which means he cannot be cross-examined by prosecutors. He began with an apology.

""I'm sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that it hurt the United States,"" he said.

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for leaking the information while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010.

He said he understood what he was doing and the decisions he made. However, he said he did not believe at the time that leaking the information would cause harm.

Earlier, an Army psychologist said Manning's private struggle with his gender identity in a hostile workplace put incredible pressure on the soldier.

Manning eventually came out to Capt. Michael Worsley and e-mailed the therapist a photo of himself wearing a wig of long, blond hair and lipstick. The photo was attached to a letter titled ""My problem,"" in which Manning describes his issues with gender identity and his hope that a military career would ""get rid of it.""

Worsley testified at Manning's sentencing hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore. He said the soldier had little to no support base.

""You put him in that kind of hyper-masculine environment, if you will, with little support and few coping skills, the pressure would have been difficult to say the least,"" Worsley said. ""It would have been incredible.""

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010. His lawyers contend that Manning showed clear signs of deteriorating mental health that should have prevented commanders from sending him to a war zone to handle classified information.

Manning sat and listened attentively to the psychologist who had treated him, smiling occasionally. But his face tightened when Worsley talked about how guarded and hesitant Manning had been in Iraq to talk about his gender identity.

Worsley's testimony described some military leaders as lax at best and obstructionist at worst when it came to tending to troop mental health.

He said some in Manning's brigade ""had difficulty understanding"" recommendations the doctor would make regarding the needs of some soldiers.

""I questioned why they would want to leave somebody in a position with the issue they had,"" Worsley said of troubled soldiers.

Navy Capt. David Moulton, a psychiatrist who spent 21 hours interviewing Manning at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., after his arrest, testified as a defense witness that Manning's gender identity disorder combined with narcissistic personality traits, post-adolescent idealism and his lack of friends in Iraq caused him to reasonably conclude he could change the world by leaking classified information.

""He became very enthralled with this idea that the things that he was finding were injustices that he felt he morally needed to right,"" Moulton said.

He said Manning was struggling to balance his desire to right wrongs with his sense of duty to complete his Army tasks and his fear of losing his GI benefits and the opportunity to attend college.

""His decision-making capacity was influenced by the stress of his situation for sure,"" Moulton said. ""He was under severe emotional stress at the time of the alleged offenses.""

The soldier was set to take the stand in his own defense later Wednesday. His sister and aunt are also on the defense witness list.

At least 46 international journalists and 78 spectators were in attendance. Many spectators wore black ""truth"" T-shirts.

Most reporters watched a closed-circuit feed of the hearing in a nearby building. Other closed-circuit feeds were available to overflow spectators in a trailer outside the courthouse and another nearby building.

Security was tight. Barricades surrounded the courthouse, and those entering the courtroom or any of the viewing areas were scanned for metal objects and had their belongings meticulously searched."

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai met Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

President Obama moved Friday toward a faster reduction of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and laid the groundwork with Afghan President Hamid Karzai for a small troop presence in the country after the American mission formally ends there in 2014.

Obama and Karzai, leaders who have often been at odds in recent years, brought into sharper focus the American endgame for its longest war. Appearing after a series of morning meetings, the two outlined steps to wind down the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan over the next two years, a show of unity that excluded any talk of new ambitions.

Speaking at the White House, Obama said Afghan forces would take the lead in securing the country this spring, several months ahead of what had been planned at a NATO summit last year.

Karzai also clarified his intention to eliminate a key obstacle to preserving some U.S. forces in Afghanistan beyond 2014, pledging to “go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan.” Obama’s inability to reach an immunity agreement, which protects U.S. forces from foreign prosecution, prevented him from keeping any troops in Iraq.

Although Obama did not say explicitly that the accelerated transition would allow him to more quickly pull the remaining 66,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, he made clear that the “nature of our work” in the country after nearly a dozen years of war would soon change.

“We achieved our central goal, or have come very close to achieving our central goal, which is to de-capacitate al-Qaeda, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can’t attack us again,” Obama said. “At the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought.”

The faster shift to a mostly advisory and training role will likely energize those within the White House, particularly among Obama’s civilian advisers, who have argued for a faster drawdown than some generals have recommended.

Obama will soon receive from Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a recommended schedule for troop reductions over the next two years. The U.S. president’s meetings with Karzai came as he prepares to set the final withdrawal timeline in the coming weeks and to discuss with the Afghan leader how he intends to do so.

Obama has ranked ending the war in Iraq and winding down the even-longer conflict in Afghanistan as key foreign policy achievements during his first term. Senior administration officials say bringing the war to a “responsible end,” as Obama said several times on Friday, is a top priority as he begins his second term.

His recent selection of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam veteran, as defense secretary underscores Obama’s intention to focus less on fighting new battles in Afghanistan than on bringing home and caring for U.S. troops, many of whom have served several tours.

Asked Friday whether the human and financial cost of the Afghanistan war had been worth it, Obama recalled the 3,000 Americans who were “viciously murdered” by al-Qaeda, as well as the Afghans who were “brutalized” by the Taliban that controlled the country at the time.

“Have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not,” Obama said. “ This is a human enterprise, and, you know, you fall short of the ideal.”

But, he continued, “Have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States? We have achieved that goal.”

Obama said any U.S. mission in Afghanistan beyond 2014 would focus solely on counterterrorism operations and training Afghan security forces, whose progress he described optimistically on Friday.

Obama would not specify how many troops he may leave in Afghanistan to accomplish those tasks, but he said it will be “a very limited mission, and it is not one that would require the same kind of footprint, obviously, that we’ve had over the last 10 years in Afghanistan.”

Within the White House, some officials are pushing to keep a force as small as 2,500 past 2014, far lower than the 10,000 to 30,000 that some U.S. officials and NATO allies were discussing as recently as a year ago. And Obama’s positive public assessment Friday will likely make it far more difficult for military officials to make the case for a more gradual drawdown than the White House wants.

Afghan forces have taken the lead in security operations in most of the country already, but Obama’s emphasis on the faster transition Friday suggested that he intends to use the shift to withdraw forces on an accelerated timeline. He called the spring transfer of responsibilities “a historic moment and another step toward full Afghan sovereignty.”

Karzai has complained frequently that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan threatens his country's independence, often drawing the anger of Obama and his senior advisers in doing so.

But unlike Iraq, Afghanistan has few natural resources and little national wealth, giving Karzai a greater incentive to push for an immunity agreement that would help keep U.S. troops and assistance in his country after 2014. On Friday, Karzai cited Turkey and Germany — two NATO countries that host large U.S. military bases — as possible post-war models for the U.S.-Afghan relationship.

Obama and Karzai hope to have the security agreement, including the immunity guarantee, finalized by November. That would help formalize the U.S. presence in Afghanistan before that country’s next presidential election, expected in the spring of 2014. The issue of American troops could become a feature of that campaign and complicate security negotiations if they have not concluded by then.

Asked on Friday how many U.S. forces should remain after 2014, Karzai said that is “an issue for the United States,” suggesting he would not negotiate vigorously over the number Obama settles on.

“Numbers are not going to make a difference to the situation in Afghanistan,” Karzai said. “The broader relationship will make a difference in Afghanistan and the region.”

Karzai and Obama said they had discussed the Afghan president’s efforts to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban, a process the White House refers to as “reconciliation.” The leaders agreed on allowing the Taliban to open an office in Qatar, where Karzai said direct peace talks with Afghan government negotiators will be held.

But Obama noted several times that the war is incomplete — both on the battlefield and in building a stable country.

As U.S. forces leave, Obama emphasized that he expects Afghan leaders to protect the rights of women to participate in public life in a Muslim nation where many are still forced to wear restrictive burqas and have limited avenues to education and jobs.

“The single-best indicator, or one of the single-best indicators, of a country’s prosperity around the world is how does it treat its women,” he said. “Does it educate that half of the population? Does it give them opportunity? When it does, you unleash the power of everyone, not just some.”"

The “Elder of Ziyon” blog has compiled a list of those to be released–and their victims. Here is a sample:

Atiyeh Salem Musa: killed Isaac (Aizek) Rotenberg, 67, Holocaust survivor, 1994 Isaac Rotenberg was born to Natan and Miriam Rotenberg in Poland on 15 March 1927. A selektzia was held in his city following the outbreak of the Second World War, and his family was sent to the Sobibór extermination camp. With the exception of him, his younger brother, and his sister, his entire family perished. He was taken with his brother to a labor camp. When a revolt broke out, the two succeeded in escaping the camp, but they lost track of each other in the ensuing commotion. Isaac then made his way to the forest and joined the partisans. In April 1947, Isaac reached the Land of Israel. He joined the IDF the next year, and fought in the War of Liberation in the north, near Kibbutz Manara. Isaac was married to Riva, and they had two children, Tzipora and Pinhas. He worked as a plasterer, and was a founder of the city of Holon. Upon reaching retirement age, he decided to continue working a few hours per day to keep himself busy. On 29 March 1994, during the Passover holiday, as Isaac was hunched on his knees, fixing a floor in his workplace in Petah Tikva, two of the Arab laborers on site attacked him and struck the back of his neck with axes. He was critically wounded, and entered a coma. Two days later, on 31 March, he died.

Hosni Faregh Sawalha–murder of Baruch Heisler, 24, 1990 On 2 December 1990, Yaacov missed his ride to his yeshiva [religious seminary] and instead boarded bus 66 from Petah Tikva to Tel Aviv. Three Arab terrorists boarded at the Pardes Katz stop, and immediately thereafter, at the junction of Ben Gurion Road and Jabotinsky Road in Ramat Gan, began stabbing passengers. Baruch Yaacov was murdered; three others were injured.

Esmat Omar Mansour–accessory to murder of Haim Mizrahi, 1993 Hayim Mizrahi was born to Mazal and Pinhas Mizrahi on 8 December 1963. He grew up in Bat Yam and Holon with his sisters, Margalit and Asnat, and his brother, Itzik. As a child, Hayim belonged to the junior league soccer team of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Following is army service, he became religious, moved to Beit El, and married Iris. On Friday, 29 October 1993, Hayim went to buy eggs from an Arab-owned farm near his home, as he was wont to do. He was greeted by terrorists who attacked him and fled in his vehicle after wounding him and stuffing him into the trunk. The terrorists proceeded to murder Hayim, then burned and abandoned the vehicle north of Ramallah. Hayim was 30 at the time of his death. He was put to rest in Holon Cemetery. Hayim was survived by his pregnant wife, his parents, his sisters, and his brother. Half-a-year after his murder, his daughter, Tehilla, was born.



Obama and Kerry insisted on the release of the terrorists and murderers, and Israel–fearful of losing U.S. support at the UN and against Iran–complied. That is the heavy price demanded by an administration that prides itself as tough on terrorists–while arming them and Syria and releasing them in Israel.

President Obama met with his National Security Council on Saturday to review the Boston Marathon bombings and discuss the way forward.

""The president commended the work that was done to pursue justice in the Boston Marathon bombing, and underscored the need to continue gathering intelligence to answer the remaining questions about this terrorist attack going forward,"" said a White House statement.

The Situation Room conference took place as suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remained hospitalized in Boston after he was caught Friday; a second suspect, brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a police shootout earlier.

In remarks Friday night at the White House, Obama vowed to get to the bottom of the reasons for the Boston attack. He also urged Americans to be patient, making apparent references to reports that the suspect are Muslim and have ties to the troubled Russian republic of Chechnya.

""It's important that we do this right,"" Obama said. ""That's why we have investigations. That's why we relentlessly gather the facts. That's why we have courts. And that's why we take care not to rush to judgment -- not about the motivations of these individuals; certainly not about entire groups of people.""

A White House readout:

""President Obama convened the National Security Council in the Situation Room (on Saturday) from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. to review the events in Boston.

""The president was updated by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Monaco, National Security Adviser Donilon, Attorney General Holder, FBI Director Mueller, and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano on the apprehension of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the related investigation.

""He was also briefed by the leadership of the intelligence community, including DNI Clapper and Director Brennan, about our ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and protect the American people.

""The president commended the work that was done to pursue justice in the Boston Marathon bombing, and underscored the need to continue gathering intelligence to answer the remaining questions about this terrorist attack going forward.

""As he did last night, the president also expressed appreciation for the efforts made by state and local officials, and law enforcement, in Boston and Massachusetts. Vice President Biden joined the meeting via video-conference."""

(CNN) —

A federal judge said Monday that he believes the government’s once-secret collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional, setting up likely appeals and further challenges to the data mining revealed by classified leaker Edward Snowden.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of metadata – phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content – apparently violates privacy rights.

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,” said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Leon’s ruling said the “plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,” adding “as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury.”

He rejected the government’s argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades.

Leon also noted that the government “does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”

However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.

A Justice Department spokesman said Monday that “we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found,” but said the ruling is being studied.

Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a critic of the NSA data mining, said Leon’s ruling showed that “the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records conflicts with Americans’ privacy rights under the U.S. Constitution and has failed to make us safer.”

He called on Congress to pass legislation he proposed to “ensure the NSA focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent Americans.”

Explosive revelations earlier this year by Snowden, a former NSA contractor, triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

Snowden’s revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance.

In a statement distributed by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first reported the leaks, Snowden said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that Americans deserved a judicial review.

“Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many,” according to Snowden, who is living in Russia under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the United States.

Greenwald said the judge’s ruling vindicates what Snowden did.

“I think it’s not only the right, but the duty of an American citizen in Edward Snowden’s situation to come forward, at great risk to himself, and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal,” the journalist told CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” Monday night.

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for “foreign intelligence purposes.”

Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government.

Leon’s ruling comes as the Obama administration completes a review of NSA surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks.

CNN’s Jake Tapper reported Monday that tech company executives would meet with President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Obama plans to sit down with Tim Cook of Apple and Eric Schmidt of Google, as well as executives from Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix , Etsy, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Zynga, Sherpa Global, Comcast, LinkedIn and AT&T, a White House official said.

Some of those companies issued a joint letter last week calling on the government to change its surveillance policies in the wake of the Snowden revelations.

Last month, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition, which was filed by the Electronic Information Privacy Center. Prior lawsuits against the broader NSA program also have been unsuccessful.

Days after the Snowden disclosure in June, some Verizon customers filed legal challenges in the D.C. federal court.

The left-leaning American Civil LIberties Union also filed a separate, pending suit in New York federal court.

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests– wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States.

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government’s ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.

In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate that it’s “relevant” to an international terrorism investigation.

However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: “A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.”

In defending the program, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that “15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations.”

Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon, were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses.

The revelations of the NSA program and the inner workings of the FISC court came after Snowden leaked documents to the Guardian newspaper. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then Russia to escape U.S. prosecution.

The case is Klayman v. Obama (13-cv-881).

In 2008, the N.S.A.’s Middle East and North Africa group set about updating its Sigint collection capabilities. The “ambitious scrub” of selectors — essentially search terms — cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency’s Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day.

The reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement, opening the way for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, the report said.

And in a note that may comfort computer novices, the N.S.A. Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software: The computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses, a rather fundamental flaw. “Over 500 messages in one week did not come in,” the report said about one target.

Those are daily course corrections. Whether the Snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain. Joel F. Brenner, the agency’s former inspector general, says much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a naïveté about the realpolitik of spying. “The agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it’s supposed to do,” he said.

But Mr. Brenner added that he believes “technology has outrun policy” at the N.S.A., and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed, “routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.”

Another former insider worries less about foreign leaders’ sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. William E. Binney, a former senior N.S.A. official who has become an outspoken critic, says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like Brazil’s president or the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “That’s pretty much what every government does,” he said. “It’s the foundation of diplomacy.” But Mr. Binney said that without new leadership, new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of “turnkey totalitarianism” — the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public.

“I think it’s already starting to happen,” he said. “That’s what we have to stop.”

Whatever reforms may come, Bobby R. Inman, who weathered his own turbulent period as N.S.A. director from 1977 to 1981, offers his hyper-secret former agency a radical suggestion for right now. “My advice would be to take everything you think Snowden has and get it out yourself,” he said. “It would certainly be a shock to the agency. But bad news doesn’t get better with age. The sooner they get it out and put it behind them, the faster they can begin to rebuild.”"

William Swenson's courage and award him the country's highest military decoration.

But beyond the pageantry is a convoluted tale not told in the official Army narrative detailing Swenson’s heroics when he and his troops were ambushed in Afghanistan more than four years ago.

Even as Swenson receives his Medal of Honor, a Pentagon investigation is unfolding into why the former Army officer’s award nomination once vanished. It has been alleged that military brass may have derailed the approval process because Swenson pointed blame at superiors in the aftermath of the costly battle.

“It’s crazy,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who pushed for the investigation. “The last thing you should have is a politicized Medal of Honor process.”

Being candid about the battle put Swenson’s nomination in the cross hairs, Hunter said.

“He came out and was honest about what happened,” Hunter told Yahoo News. “He was critical as an officer in the Army should be. You’re not supposed to be a robot; you’re supposed to voice your opinions, especially when things go tactically wrong.”

2009 Battle of Ganjgal

Swenson, a Seattle native on his second tour in eastern Afghanistan, was an embedded adviser mentoring members of the Afghan National Security Forces. On the morning of Sept. 8, 2009, he and other U.S. trainers were leading a team of Afghan soldiers and police on foot for a peacekeeping mission into the rural community of Ganjgal when they were surprised by 60 well-armed Taliban insurgents.

A fierce firefight ensued, but the coalition task force was outgunned and quickly surrounded. The battle ultimately claimed the lives of five Americans and 10 of their Afghan counterparts. Seventeen others were wounded. The Army says the bloodshed would have been worse if not for Swenson’s gallantry.

“In seven hours of continuous fighting, Swenson braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy’s main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners,” according to a written Army account.

Story continues

But during the battle, Swenson also repeatedly radioed superiors at a nearby base to request air and artillery support to rescue pinned-down troops. Subsequent investigations determined that three Army officers rejected many of Swenson’s pleas and failed to notify higher commands that troops were under fire.

Swenson didn’t hold back when interviewed by military investigators. According to stories by McClatchy Newspapers and the Military Times, he blasted the U.S. commanders in Afghanistan for their rules of engagement, charging that they put political reasons of trying to minimize civilian casualties ahead of U.S. concerns.

According to documents reviewed by the Military Times, Swenson asked why he was “being second-guessed by [higher-ups] or somebody that's sitting in an air-conditioned” tactical operations center. “Why [the] hell am I even out there in the first place?” he said. “Let’s sit back and play Nintendo.”

“I’m not a politician. I’m just the guy on the ground asking for that ammunition to be dropped because it is going to save lives,” he said, according to a transcript obtained by McClatchy Newspapers.

According to reports, two Army officers were given written reprimands for their “negligent” leadership, which contributed “directly to the loss of life which ensued.”

Swenson, now 34, left the Army in February 2011 and is back living in Seattle. “My forced early retirement,” he recently told the Washington Post. But Swenson hasn’t spoken publicly about the battle of Ganjgal or the delay with his Medal of Honor nomination. He did not return a message from Yahoo News.

The Lost Nomination

Shortly after Ganjgal, Swenson and Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer were both nominated for their valiant acts during the battle. Suspicion grew when Obama awarded Meyer the Medal of Honor on Sept. 15, 2011, but there was no mention of Swenson’s nomination, which Rep. Hunter says was nowhere to be found for 19 months.

Even Meyer spoke out. According to the Military Times, Meyer wrote the senior officer on the White House National Security Council and described Swenson as “the centerpiece for command and control in a raging firefight that never died down.""

The Army says approving a nomination packet – which includes dozens of supporting documents that must be vetted by top commanders, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense before submission to the president for a final decision – can take up to three years.

“In Swenson's case, an official investigation determined his packet was lost as a result of high turnover within the organization recommending the award,” Army spokesperson Tatjana Christian told Yahoo News by email last week. “The nomination packet was subsequently re-created and forwarded for review. The Army is reviewing ways to ensure this type of injustice does not happen again.”

[SLIDESHOW: Photos of Capt. Swenson in Afghanistan]

But stories by McClatchy Newspapers’ Jonathan Landay cast doubt on the Army’s explanation that the Swenson nomination was merely misplaced.

McClatchy, which obtained memos from the Army’s internal probe, reported that investigators discovered there was an attempt to reduce Swenson’s original nomination to a lesser award before it vanished. That would have been in violation of Army and Defense Department regulations, since only the president has the authority to downgrade a Medal of Honor nomination.

Retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan in the summer of 2010, told a McClatchy reporter in August 2012 that he had “no recollection of seeing” Swenson’s packet. But the Army found Petraeus signed Swenson’s Medal of Honor packet on July 28, 2010, McClatchy reported. Yahoo News emailed Petraeus, who did not answer questions about the alleged discrepancy.

Army investigators also discovered that Swenson’s original nomination was one of two Medal of Honor packets received at U.S. command headquarters in Afghanistan on May 19, 2010. The separate packet (unrelated to Ganjgal) was logged and tracked concurrently with Swenson’s, but didn’t disappear.

The Army’s now-closed internal investigation “did not reveal any suspected criminal activity,” McClatchy reported.

Still Seeking Answers

“A Medal of Honor packet doesn’t get lost unless somebody wants it to get lost,” war historian Doug Sterner told Yahoo News.

Sterner, a longtime curator of a military valor awards database, said the Swenson Medal of Honor wouldn’t have happened without the McClatchy reporting, and pressure from Rep. Hunter’s office.



“It’s one that could have gotten tragically swept under the carpet of our broken awards system,” Sterner said.

An inspector general’s office that handles cases involving top military and civilian defense officials is now investigating the alleged mishandling of the Swenson nomination. The Department of Defense did not reply to messages from Yahoo News seeking comment.

Hunter, a Marine officer before entering politics, wants the inspector general investigation to go beyond Swenson’s case. Like Sterner, he believes the process has become bureaucratic, and that too few awards have been issued during the global war on terror.

“I shouldn’t have to write letters,” said Hunter, who has never met Swenson. “The IG shouldn’t have to investigate. This process should be aboveboard and transparent. It shouldn’t take four years. That’s absolutely ridiculous.”

Swenson will be the 13th service member awarded the Medal of Honor from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the first Army officer to earn the medal since the end of the Vietnam War.

On hand to witness the occasion will be the family of Army Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, Swenson’s close friend and battle buddy.

Westbrook was shot several times at Ganjgal. He was bleeding on the battlefield until Swenson charged through enemy fire to render him first aid. Helmet cameras worn by incoming pilots captured video of Swenson helping Westbrook aboard a medevac helicopter and stopping to kiss his friend’s forehead before returning to the battle. Sgt. Westbrook made it to Walter Reed military hospital in Maryland, where he died 29 days later.

“I thank him for that time that I got to spend with my husband,” his widow, Charlene Westbrook, said. “I thank Will for that.”

Westbrook said her husband would have been proud of Swenson’s Medal of Honor, but not the process it took to finally get invited to the White House.

“I sincerely don’t believe that the Department of the Army lost, misplaced, or whatever they want to call it,” she said. “They didn’t want it to come out or what? That’s what happened. That’s the truth. They ignored their calls.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The U.S. military has yet to finalize where it will base the next fighter jet, the F-35

The Air National Guard has flown planes out of Burlington for more than 60 years

But some Vermont resident are vocally opposed to housing the new jets in their state

SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Plans on where to base the U.S. military's next-generation fighter jet, the F-35, concern people in communities from California to Florida to Maine who worry the aircraft are too loud.

In Vermont, where the Air National Guard has flown planes from Burlington International Airport for more than 60 years, opponents are especially vocal. But in other communities, even some long accustomed to the roar of military aircraft, the noise of the F-35 has been an issue.

South Burlington City Council President Rosanne Greco, a retired Air Force officer, said she favored bringing the F-35 to her community until she read the draft environmental impact statement released last spring.

The F-35s ""will have incredibly significant negative impact on up to 10,000 people who will be unfortunate enough to be in the noise contour zone that the federal government deems unsuitable for residential use,"" Greco said. ""For me it's become a clear-cut analytical choice. The facts say this is harmful to our environment.""

The report, she said, considers exposure to average aircraft noise greater than 65 decibels (about the sound of a vacuum cleaner about three feet away) ""not considered suitable for residential use."" Another section discusses the potential long-term health impacts of exposure to aircraft noise.

The plane's supporters say Greco is exaggerating the number of people who would be affected by the noise contour zone. And they believe she and others are cherry-picking information from the report without providing its full context. There is a section of the report that discusses long-term health effects, for example, but it concludes there aren't any significant health impacts.

The Air Force already has chosen where it will base the F-35s, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, for training. The next step is to decide where to base the first operational planes, those that would be ready for war.

""Vermont is the most vocal, but Vermont is the preferred alternative for the Guard unit,"" Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. ""But it's the not the only alternative.""

Plans are to base 18 to 24 of the new aircraft in South Burlington by 2020. The military's final decision on the first round of operational bases is expected next spring.

How much louder the planes are than other aircraft is debatable. Opponents cite Air Force charts indicating the F-35 can be at least twice as loud as the F-16 now flown out of Vermont. Others say that's an unfair comparison because measuring sound involves everything from how the planes are flown to weather conditions, the time of day and how long people are exposed.

F-35 supporters in Vermont say the opponents — who have a Facebook page and a separate website — are a small group of activists who number maybe 300. The city of South Burlington, home to the airport, opposes the planes, mostly because of the noise.

Gov. Peter Shumlin and the state's congressional delegation favor bringing the F-35 to Vermont. There are three pro-F-35 Facebook pages and one business group has collected almost 11,000 signatures in support.

If the 18-plane option for Vermont is chosen, considered most likely, the F-35 isn't expected to bring new jobs to the area but it would guarantee about 1,100 well-paying jobs already here. Six additional planes would add about 250 more jobs.

If the Vermont Guard isn't chosen, Col. David Baczewski, commander of the Vermont Guard's 158th fighter wing and a veteran F-16 pilot, said there would be no immediate impact on the current F-16 operations in Burlington.

He said he worries that if the Department of Defense orders another round of base closings, Vermont could be forced to compete against other guard units to keep its role as a front-line fighter base.

""I'd rather separate myself from the pack, be the leading-edge, top fighter wing that we are (and) get named (to fly) the F-35 right off the bat and secure the future,"" Baczewski said.

Noise concerns have followed the F-35 since it first began flying. Pegged at about $130 million each for the Air Force version, it is the military's most expensive procurement program ever. The F-35 is designed to be the nation's supersonic and most advanced fighter through mid-century, with different models for the Air Force, Navy and Marines.

Despite its cost and noise concerns, there is no other alternative as the plane, nicknamed the Lightning II, is intended to replace fighter planes mostly designed in the 1970s.

In California, the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar is slated to get F-35s in several years, but environmental groups have already questioned the potential impact on endangered species. Neighbors have said they don't want the plane rattling their windows.

Noise concerns also have been raised in Arizona, where the Marines and Air Force are basing F-35s in Yuma and Phoenix, about 185 apart.

In Florida's Panhandle, an area long-accustomed to the sounds of military aircraft, a lawsuit by the city of Valparaiso in part over noise concerns prompted the Air Force to change the Eglin Air Force Base runways the F-35s would use, in most instances, to avoid flying over the city.

Air Force and Marine pilots at Eglin began F-35 training missions last March. Since then F-35 pilots have flown about 600 sorties, with about 2 percent generating noise complaints, a number the base considers small.

Some of the complaints come on days the F-35s are not flying, said base spokesman Mike Spaits.

""We empathize with their plight, but the reality is there does seem to be some level of hysteria involved with the noise complaints on the F-35,"" he said.

Maine is home to one of the Northeast's largest aerial training areas, the 4,000-square-mile Military Operation Area Condor, which extends into northern New Hampshire. Concerns about the noise of the F-35 play into long-running mistrust among some in Maine about low-level military training flights.

Current plans call for the F-35 to be operated above 7,000 feet over Maine, but there are special low-level corridors.

Some Maine residents seem resigned to the prospect that the louder F-35s will be operating over Maine, said Tom Mauzaka, a retired Air Force colonel, who lives in the western Maine town of Strong.

""This plane is loud,"" said Mauzaka. ""It would be loud at 7,000 feet.""

Little, if any, opposition has come from the other two Air Guard bases seen as suitable for operating the F-35s, Jacksonville, Fla., Air National Guard base and McEntire Joint National Guard Base in Eastover, S.C. But in another area of South Carolina, plans to base the F-35 at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort have brought complaints about potential noise.

Back in Vermont, Winooski Mayor Michael O'Brien, whose city is about a mile from the north end of the runway, traveled to Eglin Air Force Base last month with Shumlin and other officials to listen to the F-16 and F-35 fly over, one after another.

Winooski opposes basing the F-35 at the South Burlington airport if the planes are significantly louder than the F-16s. O'Brien said he was at one end of an Eglin runway while the different planes went over in a number of different configurations.

""They are both loud, but it was hard to really get a handle on just how much louder,"" O'Brien said. ""It didn't blow my socks off, the difference."""

(CNN) —

Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?

That’s the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans’ phone records.

FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter – revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon – when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel’s chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was “very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate.”

Reports: U.S. spy agencies mined Internet data

The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.

When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, “It was like, ‘Oh, God, not one more thing … where we’re trying to protect America and then it looks like we’re spying.’”

What does the Verizon order mean for me?

An author of the Patriot Act – the legislation used to justify the program – added he is “extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.”

“These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,” Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder.

But not everyone in the nation’s capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a “three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years” – so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it’s helped to disrupt “terrorist plots” on U.S. soil, she said.

“It is lawful,” the California Democrat insisted. “It has been briefed by Congress.”

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that “this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop” and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama “put in place a stronger regime of oversight” when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring “we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.”

“That is his top priority,” Earnest said of domestic security. “But … we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.”

What’s been happening, and for how long?

In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.

“Verizon’s wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,” the company said at the time.

Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper’s story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.

The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring “originating and terminating” phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.

7 things to know

The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company’s website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed “millions of U.S. customers of Verizon” were affected by the collection of information “regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.”

In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications “or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.”

An Obama administration official said any such order would relate “exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.”

This kind of information “allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,” the unnamed official said in a statement to media.

Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors – something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.

Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies – among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple – to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying “they contain numerous inaccuracies.” Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program “cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.”

In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks – saying it “will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.”

Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren’t terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.

“There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,” said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy.

“It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer.”

Opinion: NSA’s phone snooping a different kind of creepy

Al Gore: ‘Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous’

This group is hardly alone.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it “beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.”

The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as “the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.”

Many in President Barack Obama’s own party spoke forcefully against it as well.

Three Democratic representatives – John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia – said the program is “highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the” Patriot Act.

“(The revelations) confirm our fears – that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,” they wrote.

Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as “the kind of government overreach I’ve said Americans would find shocking.”

One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.

“Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?” the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.

Senator says ending program would be ‘catastrophic’

Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.

“Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,” said Feinstein.

Her intelligence committee’s ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather “significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.”

Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that’s linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number.

“It’s not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers,” Fuentes explained on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.”

Rep. Lindsey Graham said that, as a Verizon customer, “it doesn’t bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.” The South Carolina Republican said he’s confident the government won’t monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their “number pops up on some terrorist’s phone.”

“The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic,” he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-obama-preparing-name-comey-fbi-231838985.html,,[],AP sources: Obama preparing to name Comey to FBI,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is preparing to nominate former Bush administration official James Comey to head the FBI, people familiar with the decision said Wednesday.

Three people with knowledge of the selection said Obama planned to nominate Comey, who was the No. 2 in President George W. Bush's Justice Department. The three people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the selection ahead of Obama's announcement, which was not expected immediately.

Comey became a hero to Democratic opponents of Bush's warrantless wiretapping program when Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it. Bush revised the surveillance program when confronted with the threat of resignation by Comey and current FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is stepping down in September.

Comey's selection was first reported by NPR and was not expected to be announced for several days at least. Senate confirmation will be needed.

The change in leadership comes as the FBI and Justice Department are under scrutiny for their handing of several investigations. Obama has ordered a review of FBI investigations into leaks to reporters, including the secret gathering of Associated Press phone records and emails of a Fox News reporter. And there have been questions raised about whether the FBI properly responded to warnings from Russian authorities about a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. The agency, meanwhile, is conducting a highly-anticipated investigation into the Internal Revenue Service over its handling of conservative groups seeking tax exempt status.

Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation.

Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the same sensation as drowning.

Story continues

Earlier in his career, Comey served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, one of the nation's most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines of terrorism, corporate malfeasance, organized crime and the war on drugs.

As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. military personnel.

Comey led the Justice Department's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities, focusing on crimes committed with guns.

He was general counsel at Connecticut-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates from 2010 until earlier this year, when he left and became a lecturer and researcher at Columbia Law School.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had not heard from the White House about Comey's nomination, but that he was concerned about Comey's hedge fund connections.

""If he's nominated, he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry,"" Grassley said. ""The administration's efforts to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal, and his agency would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues.""

Comey was at the center of one of the Bush administration's great controversies — an episode that focused attention on the administration's controversial tactics in the war on terror.

In stunning testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought Bush's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft.

Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality.

Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time.

The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said.

""I couldn't stay if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the Department of Justice had said had no legal basis,"" Comey told the Senate panel.

A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later.

The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, who was the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House chief of staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general.

Comey testified that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital.

When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment.

Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said.

""I was angry,"" Comey told the panel. ""I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general.""

The White House will argue that its solution for illegal immigrants is not an amnesty, as many critics insist, because it would include fines, the payment of back taxes and other hurdles for illegal immigrants who would obtain legal status, the officials said.

The president’s plan would also impose nationwide verification of legal status for all newly hired workers; add visas to relieve backlogs and allow highly skilled immigrants to stay; and create some form of guest-worker program to bring in low-wage immigrants in the future.

A bipartisan group of senators has also been meeting to write a comprehensive bill, with the goal of introducing legislation as early as March and holding a vote in the Senate before August. As a sign of the keen interest in starting action on immigration, White House officials and Democratic leaders in the Senate have been negotiating over which of them will first introduce a bill, Senate aides said.

“This is so important now to both parties that neither the fiscal cliff nor guns will get in the way,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat who is a leader of the bipartisan discussions."

He served as station chief in Saudi Arabia and in a variety of posts, including deputy executive director, during the Bush administration.

His tenure at the agency during Bush's presidency drew criticism from liberals when Obama considered naming him CIA director after the 2008 election. Brennan denied being involved in what the government called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" during the Bush administration, but still withdrew his name from consideration.

In a letter to Obama at the time, Brennan said he was ""a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration, such as the pre-emptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics, to include waterboarding."" Many people consider waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods to be torture.

White House officials say they don't expect Brennan to face similar trouble this time around given his four years of service in the Obama administration.

However, Brennan's nomination will likely put a spotlight on the administration's controversial drone program. Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge the highly secretive targeted killing operations."

At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.

The 19-year-old had been pulled over for failure to use his turn signal, but the fact that he is an undocumented immigrant landed him in a detention center in rural Georgia.

Hernandez was certain that deportation proceedings would follow soon, and was mulling over it when a guard brought some news: He was being released.

“I was walking and I was thinking, this is a joke. They probably got confused with another guy or something,” Hernandez said.

More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.

The package of forced budget cuts, known as sequestration, will mean $85 billion of government-wide cuts.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) decision to move detainees to less costly supervision options was met with backlash from Republicans who accuse the Obama administration of using scare tactics to win a political battle.

Jason Evans/CNN Miguel Hernandez was released from an immigration detention center in Georgia as federal budget cuts loomed.

“It’s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said. “By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.”

But the White House had no input on the plan, spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday.

The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN. The move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take budget cuts into consideration, the official said.

An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as “several hundred.” The population of immigration detainees is currently about 30,700.

Those who have been released are non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories, ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said.

“Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released,” she said.

Another ICE official reiterated that all of those released remain in deportation proceedings, released on an order of supervision.

Some of those released will be on intensive supervision, such as ankle monitors, while others will just have weekly check-ins with an ICE officer, the official said.

Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can’t know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts. But he does fit the category of minor offenders, and was released at the same time as dozens of other detainees.

Those being released alongside Hernandez on Sunday were confused about what was happening. Some detainees who had bonds as high as $25,000 were being told they were bonded and released.

Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.

Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez. He has been waiting for his court date to be mailed to him.

Another congressman, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote a letter to ICE Director John Morton demanding accountability.

He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person’s detention.

“This decision reflects the lack of resource prioritization within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is indicative of the department’s weak stance on national security,” McCaul said.

Planning for the detainee release began last Thursday, a senior administration official told CNN.

Hernandez said he doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about.

“I don’t know why this affects them – I’m not a criminal,” he said.

But will any of the reform plans that include a ""pathway to citizenship"" for illegal immigrants solve the problem? I voted for President Barack Obama twice and I support the DREAM Act. But as a former foreign service officer who has issued thousands of visas to immigrants who played by the rules, I believe there are several things Americans need to know before they decide where they stand on immigration reform.

It's not just 11 million people. A substantial percentage of illegal immigrants are here alone, and once they get green cards, they will be able to petition for their wives and children to join them in the U.S. And if they become U.S. citizens, they will also be able to petition for their siblings and parents. Those migrants, in turn, can petition for their relatives and so on. Not all of the immigration preference categories are immediate, but within 10 to 15 years, legalizing 11 million migrants could result in possibly 30 million new arrivals.

Shadowy people aren't going to ""come out of the shadows."" One of the primary justifications for the so-called path to citizenship is that it's unwise for us to have people living here who might want to do us harm and not know who they are. But the notion that criminals or terrorists will come forward and submit to a series of government background checks is fanciful.

Jobs Americans won't do? Proponents of an amnesty for illegal immigrants often claim illegal immigrants do tough, low-paying jobs that Americans and legal immigrants won't do. This notion is flawed now but will be demonstrably false after an amnesty. Illegal immigrants are currently limited to working for employers who pay in cash and don't ask questions, but with an amnesty, they'll be competing for jobs in the mainstream labor market with less educated Americans, who are already struggling with wage stagnation and a tight labor market.

Affirmative action. Once immigrants from Latin America and Africa have legal status, they'll benefit from affirmative action programs. A 2009 Pew Research poll revealed that just 22 percent of white Americans support giving preferential treatment to minorities to redress discrimination. And I suspect that a huge majority of Americans would oppose allowing preferences in employment or college admission for illegal immigrants.

We already have guest worker programs that don't work. The Senate plan calls for more guest workers with the hollow promise that employers will be able to petition for them only if they can demonstrate that Americans are ""unavailable or unwilling"" to fill the positions. We already have the H-2A visa, a numerically unlimited guest worker program for farm workers, the H-2B visa for unskilled workers, the H-1B visa for high-skilled workers and a host of other visa opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs and even religious workers. Employers know how to game the system to create a phony case that American workers are unavailable. The new system will only intensify the ""in-sourcing"" trend where U.S. employers import cheaper guest workers for jobs they can't outsource.

Strain on social services. Legalizing millions of mostly poor people, many of whom have no job security or health insurance, will put a strain on already strapped social services agencies. A study by the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that 57 percent of immigrant households (legal and illegal) used at least one welfare program in 2009. Illegal immigrants aren't eligible for most benefits, but once this group has legal status, they'll be eligible for the full range of benefits.

A surge of document and identity fraud. Amnesty applicants will have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops to secure green cards, and those who don't qualify will scramble to create a paper trail to meet the requirements.

Half the problem won't be addressed. Up to half of all illegal immigrants in the U.S. are visa overstays. Most abuse tourist visas, but the Senate plan won't fix the overstay problem. The framework calls for an entry-exit system, but it doesn't specify how overstays will be located and removed. In 2012, about 75 percent of all tourist visa applicants were approved, and in Mexico the figure was 90 percent. Even if the border is secured, rampant abuse of temporary visas will continue as long as lax visa issuance is the norm.

Amnesty beneficiaries won't be ""joining the back of the line."" The plan refers to a ""line"" even though no such thing exists. In most cases, migrants qualify to live here based on a family relationship or a job. The Senate plan speciously claims that illegal immigrants won't receive their green cards until ""every individual who is already waiting in line for a green card ... has received their green card.""

When an American citizen files a petition for a foreign sibling to join him in the U.S., for example, the average wait time for that migrant to get a green card is 12 to 14 years. No serious plan is going to ask amnesty beneficiaries to wait a decade or longer to get a green card.

The plan will vindicate those who broke the law. I had the pleasure of issuing immigrant visas to applicants who jumped through all of the hoops and waited years in their home countries to come to the U.S. legally. Any plan that provides the same prize to those who flouted the law is a mistake. The message to the hundreds of millions around the world who aspire to live in the U.S. will be clear: Those who broke the law still got green cards. Their decision to come illegally will be perceived as a smart one in their home countries, which will only encourage more illegal immigration.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/06/IRS-Official-Lois-Lerner-Wants-Immunity-to-Testify-Before-Congress,2013-07-06 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],IRS Official Lois Lerner Wants Immunity to Testify Before Congress,"On Tuesday, William W. Taylor III, attorney for Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the Tea Party targeting scandal who invoked her Fifth amendment rights before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 22, set forward his client’s hard line conditions to return and testify openly before the committee.

“They can obtain her testimony tomorrow by doing it the easy way … immunity. That’s the way to resolve all of this,” he told Politico.

Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was unimpressed. “We hope she comes in and gives us the truth and answers questions. If that doesn’t happen, then you cross the next bridge. … If she says, ‘No, I’m going to come in and assert my Fifth Amendment rights again and not going to speak,’ then you think about what the other options are.”

Legal experts have debated whether Ms. Lerner waived her fifth amendment rights when she delivered an opening statement declaring her innocence prior to invoking those rights. On June 28 in a 22-17 party line vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ruled that she did waive her Fifth amendment rights with that opening statement.

Should Ms. Lerner continue to insist that she will not testify without full immunity, the next step in this battle of wills and legal tactics could be a vote by the full House of Representatives to determine if Ms. Lerner is in contempt of Congress. If the full House determines she is in contempt, a criminal rather than civil charge, Ms. Lerner could face jail time.

Ms. Lerner’s attorney appears unphased by the possibility his client could face contempt charges. “[N]obody likes to be held in contempt of Congress, of course, but the real question is one that we’re fairly confident about, and I don’t think any district judge in the country would hold that she waived.”

Should the House hold Ms. Lerner in contempt, it would be the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, an employee of the Department of Justice, to prosecute the case. Since Attorney General Eric Holder, who runs the Department of Justice, has already experienced his own difficulties surrounding his testimony before the House of Representatives, it is unlikely, though not impossible, that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would pursue prosecution of any contempt charges coming out of the House.

The penalty for contempt of Congress is a fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail."

The U.S. Navy entered the 22nd century on Saturday.

In Newport News, Virginia, the Navy christened its newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford.

This nuclear-powered ship is the first of a new class of at least 10 carriers that the Navy expects will be steaming the seas, protecting the United States well into the next century.

The Ford itself is projected to stay in service until 2057.

This carrier is state-of-the-art in naval architecture, according to news releases from the Navy and the shipbuilder.



For example, the Ford will use electromagnetic force, similar to how modern roller coasters are propelled, to catapult planes off the deck instead of the pressurized steam used in today's fleet.

The arresting gear that grabs planes when they land will be software-controlled, with the goal being less wear and tear on the planes.

'Son of a Blackbird': Plan for new spy plane

The ship looks much like the current Nimitz-class carriers. It's roughly the same length, width and weight.

But the island - the superstructure that rises above the flight deck - is skinnier, taller and set farther aft on the ship, allowing for more flight-deck operations and plane maintenance. It's also part of the reason the Ford will be able to carry more warplanes and launch 25% more air missions per day than the current carriers in the fleet, according to the Navy.

Below the waterline its four 30-ton propellers will be driven by two newly-designed nuclear reactors.

The planes that will eventually be jumping off its deck in the decades ahead haven't even been designed yet. It remains to be seen if those planes have pilots or will be controlled by operators with computers who will ""fly"" the aircraft from the safety of a remote location.

This new class of carriers is designed with built-in flexibility to accommodate future Navy decisions about aircraft and missions.

And it's designed to do all this on the cheap. Most of the lights in the ship will use high-efficiency bulbs that will last twice as long between changes. And the ship is designed to require 30% less maintenance over its lifespan.

Bigger, lighter, deadlier! Navy launches new stealth destroyer

Finally and most importantly, because of designed efficiencies, it'll put to sea with 1,000 fewer sailors and Marines than a Nimitz-class carrier. Over the life of the Ford, the efficiency of the ship, the Navy said, will save $4 billion.

The ship is named after President Gerald R. Ford who served on the carrier USS Monterey during World War II and who later became President when Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

""It's very fitting that our next carrier, a ship that will calm the unknown crises of the future by its very presence offshore, will be named for President Gerald Ford,"" Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said at the ship's keel-laying.

The push to name the ship after Ford began years ago and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld actually told Ford about the ship's name months before Ford's death in 2006, making the new carrier one of the few Navy ships named after a living person.

""How fitting it will be that the name Gerald R. Ford will patrol the high seas for decades to come, in the defense of the nation he loved so much,"" Rumsfeld said at Ford's funeral.

Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, had the honor of breaking the traditional bottle of champagne on the ship's bow as it is launched.

Capt. John F. Meier has already been named as the ship's first commanding officer. He will be responsible for monitoring the final months of construction and likely be onboard when the Ford goes on its first sea trials.

""I'm thrilled to be here,"" Meier said in a Navy release last summer. ""I couldn't ask for a better assignment or a greater honor.""

But as the Navy launches its newest carrier, not all is well in the land of flattops.

Just last month, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, conceded that because of budget issues the Navy may have to reconsider how many aircraft carriers it will keep in the fleet

""You have to go where the money is, and carriers and air wings are quite expensive,"" Greenert said, according to a Virginia newspaper, the Daily Press. ""I'd hate to say it is inevitable, but we have to look very hard at it."""

By Sharon Bernstein

SACRAMENTO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A group of Republican California lawmakers is breaking with their party's skepticism over immigration reform and asking the U.S. Congress to give immigrants a path to citizenship to help their state's heavy dependence on migrant labor for agriculture and construction.

Flanked by representatives of the state's agricultural, construction and restaurant industries, 16 Republican state senators and assembly members joined a national push to demand a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

""We're assembled today to call upon the House of Representatives to take immediate action to reform our broken immigration system,"" said State Senator Anthony Cannella, who represents Salinas and for years was a lone Republican voice in favor of reform. ""Congress must deal with immigration directly, and in a compassionate and practical manner.""

Cannella was one of 15 lawmakers who signed a letter released Thursday asking the state's Congressional delegation to ""act on reform this year to put this challenge behind us."" A sixteenth lawmaker, state Senator Andy Vidak of Bakersfield, sent his own letter.

A landmark immigration overhaul passed by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate in June includes a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants currently living illegally in the United States, but it faces scant chance of passage in its current form in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

The California lawmakers calling for an overhaul - who comprise nearly half of the Republican delegation to the state legislature - are pushing back against the party's national leaders for a variety of reasons. The state relies heavily on its agricultural, construction and hospitality businesses, all of which depend on immigrant labor.

The state's demographics also work against a highly conservative approach to immigration: A recent study showed that 7 percent of California's population, or about 2.6 million people, are living in the country illegally.

The California Republican party has suffered years of damage politically from prior efforts to crack down on illegal immigration to the state, including backing a 1994 ballot initiative that would have denied public education, health care and other services the undocumented.

Simply calling on Congress to pass reform would not erase all those years worth of mistrust and animosity, but it is the right thing to do, Cannella said.

'REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT YOU'

Republican State Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who represents parts of San Diego County, said he wanted to send Latinos the message that his party understands their concerns.

""To the Spanish speakers of California: Republicans care about you,"" Chavez said, before reading somewhat haltingly from a statement in Spanish.

Failing to address immigration reform would have economic implications as well as political ones, said Robert Lapsley, president of the Business Roundtable of California, who also spoke at the event.

""If we don't get this done, it's going to impact our entire economy,"" Lapsley said.

Throughout the nation in recent months, representatives of industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor have been lobbying Republican representatives to support reform.

In Minnesota, business executives have peppered Republican U.S. Representative John Kline with questions on immigration at several private events, said Bill Blazar, a vice president at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.

In Colorado, a group of six business executives who collectively donated nearly $500,000 to Republicans in the 2012 election wrote a letter in July to the state's four Republican House members last month urging them to support changes in immigration laws.

In Arizona, where state law requires police to question those they stop and suspect of being in the country illegally about their immigration status, business leaders have argued that a hard-line stance is not the political winner it once was.

In California, the farm, hospitality and construction businesses could not survive ""without the hard work and skill provided by immigrant communities,"" said State Senator Tom Berryhill, a fourth-generation farmer and the son of a former Secretary of Agriculture.

""For Congress to put off once again enacting a policy that allows a reasonable path to citizenship for a group of people that contribute so much to the California economy is just wrong,"" said Berryhill, who represents parts of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.

Chuck Hagel as the country’s next defense secretary by saying he is “superbly qualified” but criticized his Republican Party, which has largely being critical of Hagel.

“Most of the national security community that I know -- many secretaries of defense, ambassadors -- think Hagel is a solid guy,” Powell said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “He speaks his mind, is a good supporter of Israel, but he's not reluctant to disagree when appropriate … He’ll do a great job.”

Hagel was under fire on several fronts even before he was officially nominated Monday by President Obama, in part for once saying “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” on Capitol Hill.

Powell, a four-star general who served in the George W. Bush administration, said the former Nebraska senator should instead have said the “Israeli lobby.”

He called Hagel “a very, very strong supporter of the state of Israel,” but said that doesn’t mean one must agree with “every single position that the Israeli government takes.”

Still, Republicans continued Sunday to express concern about Hagel, who must face Senate hearings and confirmation to get the Cabinet post.

New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte told “Fox News Sunday” that she is “very troubled” about Hagel’s foreign policy views but remains undecided.

Other concerns about Hagel include whether he would support a military strike against Iran if the country continues to pursue making a nuclear weapon, and his views on gays, following a comment he made in the 1990s for which he has apologized.

In addition, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox's ""Weekend Live ANHQ"" on Sunday that Hagel was ""the most antagonistic senator"" of his time.

And Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said he thinks the bigger issue of Hagel's ""overall temperament"" will come up during the confirmation hearings.

The Republican senator told ABC's ""This Week"" the real issue is whether Hagel is ""suited"" to run a big government department such as the Pentagon. He also said he thinks there are a ""number of staffers who are coming forth now just talking about the way (Hagel) has dealt with them.""

Powell, who voted twice for Obama, said he is still a Republican, but said the party “has an identity crisis” and some factions have a “dark vein of intolerance.”

“They still look down on minorities,” he said.

Powell also said the party’s more recent shift to the right has resulted in “losing campaigns” and “will be in trouble” if it doesn’t change along with the country’s shifting demographics to appeal more to minorities and immigrants.

“You can’t keep saying no immigration policy … it makes it hard for minorities to vote,” he said."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/new-york-times-obama-syria_n_3949419.html,2013-09-18 00:00:00,['Senior Media Reporter'],"New York Times Editors, Columnists Met With Obama During Syria Push","NEW YORK -- In his new book, The Message, MSNBC.com editor Richard Wolffe describes how the Obama White House grew frustrated in 2011 with The New York Times after some negative editorials ran in the paper. President Barack Obama ended up calling Andy Rosenthal, the paper’s editorial page editor, and a couple weeks later Rosenthal and the Times editorial board went to the White House for an off-the-record meeting with the president.

But that wasn’t the last time Obama met with Times editorial board members. On Aug. 29, the president again sat down for an off-the-record discussion with Rosenthal and some members of the editorial board, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat also attended, but editors for the paper's news pages did not.

The meeting came amid the White House’s push for military intervention in Syria, one of the topics discussed that day. The Times editorial board hadn't explicitly come out for or against a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad before the meeting, and soon after the paper still expressed concerns about the administration taking action without congressional approval and broad international support.

On Aug. 26, The Times editorial board had stressed that the White House should try exhausting diplomatic efforts before striking Syria. The paper noted that while “Assad’s use of chemical weapons surely requires a response of some kind, the arguments against deep American involvement remain as compelling as ever.”

Two days later, The Times editorial board wrote that more answers were needed from the administration on Syria. ""Obama has yet to spell out how that response would effectively deter further use of chemical weapons,"" the paper said.

On the afternoon of Aug. 30, Secretary of State John Kerry made the case that Syria had used chemical weapons, signaling that U.S. retaliation for crossing a ""red line"" drawn by Obama could be imminent. But the Times still seemed unconvinced that immediate action was the best course.

In an editorial posted online Aug. 30 and in the next day's paper, Times editors wrote that “even in the best of circumstances, military action could go wrong in so many ways; the lack of strong domestic and international support will make it even more difficult.”

The Times also noted that Obama's “approach on Syria now seems wholly at odds with the strong position” he took as a candidate in 2007. Obama had told the Boston Globe at the time that “the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”

On the evening of Aug. 30, Obama reportedly decided to seek congressional approval for a strike during a talk with chief of staff Denis McDonough. He announced his decision publicly the following day.

Rosenthal did not respond to requests for comment about the Aug. 29 meeting and a Times spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of that gathering or the the 2011 meeting reported by Wolffe.

“We did meet with the Obama White House about two years ago and that meeting was off the record,” a Times spokeswoman said. “We met with them again recently under the same restriction, which we intend to honor.”

Throughout his presidency, Obama has held off-the-record meetings with prominent news anchors, columnists and commentators, including Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein, MSNBC host Ed Schultz and Arianna Huffington, president, chair and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group.

But the Obama White House has long seemed particularly interested in getting its point of view across in the Times, and the president has said he reads all the paper's columnists. In April, a former adviser said the Times is the only paper Obama reads.

In his book, Wolffe describes how after each negative Times editorial, ""the president would summon his communications team to discuss the critical coverage."" He also included a 2011 anecdote about the White House communications team wondering whether calling Rosenthal through the Times' directory would lead to an announcement over the paper's general PA system. (It wouldn’t.)

The anecdote is surprising given that Rosenthal has spoken in the past about the Obama White House's efforts to reach out to him.

In March 2009, Rosenthal told this reporter that he had already received “more unsolicited offers for participation from the Obama people in 45 days” than during the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency."

Kerry kicked off his Asian tour Friday

Threats of missile tests from North Korea loom



His trip coincides with disclosure of a new U.S. intelligence report

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in South Korea on Friday on an unusual diplomatic journey, traveling directly into a region bracing for a possible North Korean missile test and risking that his presence alone could spur Pyongyang into another headline-seeking provocation.

In a news conference in Seoul, Kerry said North Korea would not be accepted as a nuclear power and that the current rhetoric from the nation is ""unacceptable.""

""The U.S. will defend its allies if necessary,"" Kerry said. He said that the U.S. was prepared to engage in talks with North Korea but only if the nation was serious about denuclearization.

Kerry was kicking off four days of talks in East Asia amid speculation that the North's unpredictable regime would launch a mid-range missile designed to reach as far as the U.S. territory of Guam. Kerry also planned to visit China and Japan.

Kerry said that China has the ability to make an enormous difference to the situation by applying pressure to Pyongyang.

North Korea often times its provocations to generate maximum attention, and Kerry's presence in Seoul will provide plenty of that, even if the United States is engaged in intense diplomacy with China, the North's benefactor, in an effort to lower tensions. Another dangerous date on the calendar is April 15, the 101st birthday of North Korea's deceased founder, Kim Il Sung.

Kerry's trip coincides with the disclosure of a new U.S. intelligence report that concludes North Korea has advanced its nuclear knowhow to the point that it could arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. The analysis, disclosed Thursday at a congressional hearing in Washington, said the Pentagon's intelligence wing has ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles but that the weapon would be unreliable.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said afterward that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" at the congressional hearing.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said he concurred with Little and noted that the report alluded to at the hearing was compiled by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency and was not an assessment by the entire U.S. intelligence community. ""Moreover, North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile,"" he said.

President Barack Obama on Thursday urged calm, calling on Pyongyang to end its saber-rattling while sternly warning that he would ""take all necessary steps"" to protect American citizens.

Kerry's trip marks his first foray to the Asia-Pacific as America's top diplomat, spearheading the effort to ""pivot"" U.S. power away from Europe and the Middle East and toward the world's most populous region and fulcrum of economic growth.

And it comes on the heels of months of provocative action and warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang, including talk of nuclear strikes against the United States — however outlandish analysts consider such threats. No one is discounting the danger entirely after tests of a nuclear device and ballistic missile technology in recent months.

Kerry's trip was planned well in advance of the latest danger to destabilize the Korean peninsula: North Korea's apparent preparations for another missile test in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The crisis clearly has overtaken the rest of his Asian agenda.

The Obama administration believes North Korea is preparing for another missile test, said a senior State Department official traveling with Kerry on the plane to Seoul. ""We will show to our allies that we are prepared and we will defend them,"" the official said.

To mitigate the threat, however, Kerry is largely depending on China to take a bigger role in pressuring North Korea to live up to previous agreements to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It's a strategy that has worked poorly for the U.S. for more than two decades.

Beijing has the most leverage with Pyongyang. It has massively boosted trade with its communist neighbor and maintains close military ties. And the U.S. believes the Chinese could take several specific steps to show North Korea it cannot threaten regional stability with impunity.

These include getting China to cut off support for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, said the State Department official and another senior administration official, though they rejected that the U.S. was seeking a commercial embargo against the North.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about Kerry's meetings in advance.

Neither could say, however, whether Pyongyang under its enigmatic young leader, Kim Jong Un, was actually listening at this point. One of them stressed that he ""wouldn't say there is no conversation between them,"" but declined to describe the level and impact of Chinese-North Korean contacts.

Kim's actual control of the country also is unclear, the official added. Now 29 or 30, the basketball devotee and product of a Swiss boarding school inherited power from his late father, Kim Jong Il, some 16 months ago and has seemed to lead his country on an increasingly reckless path toward possible confrontation.

That has led many observers and policymakers abroad to devote increasing time toward analyzing what little information they have on Kim to figure out how he can be mollified without being rewarded.

http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/12/05/why-obama-cant-use-iphone/,2013-12-05 00:00:00,[],Why Obama can't use an iPhone,"Why can't President Barack Obama use an iPhone?

""I'm not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone,"" Obama told a White House audience Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse. Instead, the news agency said, Obama has to stick to his BlackBerry, a valued brand in Washington due to its strict security controls and strong encryption.

That's not the entire story, however. BlackBerrys also offer a high level of organizational control and security that few other smartphones can match.

Command and control

Obama's model almost certainly sends and receives all its email and instant messages through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), an in-house email forwarder controlled by the user's organization. Each BlackBerry-issuing organization can set its own security rules and procedures, and you can assume that the White House's would be pretty tough.

Consumer BlackBerrys, in contrast, send and receive messages through the BlackBerry company's own servers, which are fairly secure, but out of the White House and National Security Agency's controls — and, because BlackBerry is a Canadian company, often outside of the United States as well.

MORE: 7 Best Smartphones on the Market Now

Most iPhones and Android phones route email and instant messages through each message service's own servers — Apple for iCloud and Messages, Google for Gmail and Google Talk, Yahoo for Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger — rather than through any single central control point.

Numerous reports from 2009 indicated that some months after taking office as president, Obama received a customized BlackBerry 8830 World Edition smartphone from BlackBerry maker Research In Motion. (The Waterloo, Ontario, company has since changed its name to BlackBerry.)

The handset reportedly incorporated voice-encryption software developed by the National Security Agency. Since Obama's phone is apparently one of a kind, there's a good chance that even more secure hardware-based encryption is also onboard.

Between his inauguration and the delivery of his custom BlackBerry, multiple reports indicated Obama may have used the military-grade Sectera Edge smartphone made by General Dynamics, though we couldn't find any photos of him using one.

Photo evidence

There are, however, dozens of photos from Obama's first term showing him checking email on what appears to be a BlackBerry 8830, and one from a trip abroad that shows him speaking into a BlackBerry Curve 8900. An Associated Press photo from Obama's second inauguration in January 2013 shows him checking messages on what looks like a flatter-bodied, later-model BlackBerry Q10.

Obama reportedly uses an email address known only to a dozen or so close aides and family members. Other reports state that each incoming email message is manually screened for malware and malicious links.

What few photos show is Obama actually speaking on a BlackBerry. Instead, when the president has been photographed speaking on a cellphone outside the White House or his presidential limousine, he's almost always using a flip or slider feature phone, possibly belonging to an aide or campaign worker.

It may be that the president isn't allowed to speak on his BlackBerry outside of controlled environments. BlackBerry voice calls are normally handled by regular cellular carriers, not a BES, but the White House and presidential limousine may have their own cellular networks.

As for feature phones, those relatively primitive models are more difficult to infect with malware or spyware than more sophisticated smartphones.

While the president may be forbidden from handling an iPhone, he does have an iPad, reportedly given to him personally by then- Apple chief Steve Jobs. It's a safe bet that iPad connects only to the White House Wi-Fi network."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/opinion/sunday/close-the-nsas-back-doors.html,2013-09-22 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],Close the N.S.A.’s Back Doors - The New York Times,"In 2006, a federal agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, helped build an international encryption system to help countries and industries fend off computer hacking and theft. Unbeknown to the many users of the system, a different government arm, the National Security Agency, secretly inserted a “back door” into the system that allowed federal spies to crack open any data that was encoded using its technology.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, make clear that the agency has never met an encryption system that it has not tried to penetrate. And it frequently tries to take the easy way out. Because modern cryptography can be so hard to break, even using the brute force of the agency’s powerful supercomputers, the agency prefers to collaborate with big software companies and cipher authors, getting hidden access built right into their systems.

The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica recently reported that the agency now has access to the codes that protect commerce and banking systems, trade secrets and medical records, and everyone’s e-mail and Internet chat messages, including virtual private networks. In some cases, the agency pressured companies to give it access; as The Guardian reported earlier this year, Microsoft provided access to Hotmail, Outlook.com, SkyDrive and Skype. According to some of the Snowden documents given to Der Spiegel, the N.S.A. also has access to the encryption protecting data on iPhones, Android and BlackBerry phones.

These back doors and special access routes are a terrible idea, another example of the intelligence community’s overreach. Companies and individuals are increasingly putting their most confidential data on cloud storage services, and need to rely on assurances their data will be secure. Knowing that encryption has been deliberately weakened will undermine confidence in these systems and interfere with commerce."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-iran-more-getting-bomb-084042446--politics.html,,[],Obama: Iran 'year or more' from getting bomb,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama says U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran is still ""a year or more"" away from producing a nuclear weapon, an assessment he acknowledged was at odds with Israel.

""Our estimate is probably more conservative than the estimates of Israeli intelligence services,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press.

The president spoke to the AP on Friday, four days into the partial shutdown of the federal government. He reiterated his opposition to negotiating with House Republicans to end the shutdown or raise the nation's debt ceiling.

""There are enough votes in the House of Representatives to make sure that the government reopens today,"" he said. ""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat.""

The start of the shutdown coincided with the opening of sign-ups for the insurance exchanges at the heart of Obama's health care law. Some House Republicans are seeking changes to the law in exchange for reopening the government.

The rollout of the insurance exchanges has been shaky, with government-run websites plagued by glitches. Despite the problems, Obama told frustrated Americans they ""definitely shouldn't give up.""

""Folks are working around the clock and have been systematically reducing the wait times,"" he said.

Obama blamed the error messages and long wait times on public interest that exceeded the government's expectations. However, he said he didn't know how many people had so far managed to sign up for insurance.

Administration officials have said they do not plan to release real-time data on the number of people enrolling, though some states running their own exchange websites are doing so.

The federal gateway website was taken down for repairs over the weekend, again hindering people from signing up for insurance.

On other points, Obama:

—Contrasted his tenure as a senator with the current crop of first-term Republican senators, saying he ""didn't go around courting the media"" or ""trying to shut down the government"" while he was in the Senate.

Story continues

—Said he's considering keeping some American forces in Afghanistan after the war formally ends in late 2014, if an agreement can be reached with the Afghan government. He tried to do the same in Iraq but was unable to reach an agreement with its government.

—Suggested that the owner of the Washington Redskins football team consider changing its name because, the president said, the current name offends ""a sizable group of people.""

Obama's comments on Iran came amid signs that long-standing tensions between the U.S. and Tehran might be easing. In late September, Obama spoke by phone with President Hassan Rouhani, Iran's new, more-moderate sounding leader. The 15-minute call marked the first direct exchange between U.S. and Iranian leaders in more than 30 years.

""Rouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world,"" Obama said. ""And so far he's been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?""

But Obama said Rouhani is not Iran's only ""decision-maker. He's not even the ultimate decision-maker,"" a reference to the control wielded by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Given the supreme leader's broad influence, some countries, most notably Israel, have questioned whether Rouhani actually represents real change in Iran or just new packaging of old policies.

Khamenei said Saturday that he supported Rouhani's outreach to the West, but at the same time called the U.S. government ""untrustworthy, arrogant, illogical and a promise-breaker,"" according to comment summarized on his website.

Obama also put distance between U.S. and Israeli assessments of when Iran might have the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Israeli officials have said Iran is just months away from having the capacity and knowledge to build a bomb, while Obama said Tehran was a year or more away.

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni played down the differences.

'The question isn't the timetable the question is how we get that result,"" Livni told Israel's Channel 10 TV.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif disputed Obama's comments, repeating Iran's claims that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.

The U.S. and Israel contend that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, while Tehran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes.

On domestic issues, Obama said he would be willing to negotiate with Republicans on health care, deficit reduction and spending — but only if House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, holds votes to reopen the government and increase the nation's borrowing limit.

The Treasury Department says the nation will hit its borrowing limit around Oct. 17. Obama didn't specifically rule out taking action on his own if Congress fails to increase the debt ceiling, but said he doesn't expect to get to that point.

Obama, who successfully ran for president as a first-term senator, also spoke critically about first-term Republican senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas, who have been leading efforts to shut the government if Republicans can't extract concessions from the White House.

The president said that when he was in the Senate, he ""didn't go around courting the media. And I certainly didn't go around trying to shut down the government.""

""I recognize that in today's media age, being controversial, taking controversial positions, rallying the most extreme parts of your base, whether it's left or right, is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention and raise money,"" he said. ""But it's not good for government.""

On the 12-year war in Afghanistan, Obama said he would consider keeping some American forces on the ground after the conflict formally ends next year, but acknowledged that doing so would require an agreement from the Afghan government. He suggested that if no agreement can be reached, he would be comfortable with a full pullout of U.S. troops.

""If in fact we can get an agreement that makes sure that U.S. troops are protected, makes sure that we can operate in a way that is good for our national security, then I'll certainly consider that,"" he said. ""If we can't, we will continue to make sure that all the gains we've made in going after al-Qaida we accomplish, even if we don't have any U.S. military on Afghan soil.""

All U.S. forces left Iraq at the end of 2011 after no deal could be reached to keep some there longer.

Obama, an avid sports fan, also weighed in on the controversy surrounding the Redskins as the name of Washington's NFL football team. The name has faced a new barrage of criticism for being offensive to Native Americans.

The president said he doesn't think Redskins' fans mean any offense by using the name. But he added: ""If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, that was offending a sizable group of people, I'd think about changing it.""

The testing is designed to help the Federal Aviation Administration meet a 2012 congressional mandate to open the skies to remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, by 2015.

Disappointed California officials were at a loss to explain their failure to land a test site, though some suggested the state didn’t do enough to win in the fierce nationwide competition. The state lost out to Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Virginia and — adding salt to the wound — longtime rival Texas.

California was the only state with two groups submitting bids — one based in Ventura County and the other in Kern County.

“How California was left off the list, I haven’t got a clue,” said Bill Buratto, who, as president and chief executive of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. helped pitch a bid for a test site in California. “It would seem to me that the FAA would look favorably on California.”

California was thought to be a front-runner, given its rich aerospace history and the presence of major military drone makers, such as AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of Poway, and Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which build drones in Palmdale. Many of the military’s newest drones take to the skies for the first time at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.

The FAA has estimated that 7,500 small drones could be aloft within five years, with industry officials predicting they could be used for such things as spotting wildfires, scouting film locations and delivering pizza.

In a conference call with reporters, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency considered a number of factors such as geographic and climatic diversity, availability of ground infrastructure, the types of proposed research and the volume of air traffic near the test sites.

Asked about the decision to reject the California proposals, he declined to say what was lacking in the losing bids. He said there would be no comment from the government until FAA officials can debrief the unsuccessful bidders.

“What we were really looking for was how do we select six that give us the broadest base of different airspace configurations, different traffic configurations and different climates,” Huerta said.

Although the test site designation offered no federal money, groups in 24 states competed for it. The groups saw it as an opportunity to generate jobs from a burgeoning industry — and a matter of prestige.

Some states allocated money to promote their bids.

Brook Taylor, spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said the governor’s military council offered its strong support and the state worked directly with both applicants to strengthen their bids.

Winners were ecstatic. Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) said the designation would “put our state on the world map when it comes to this exciting emerging technology.’' Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, in a tweet, called the selection a “historic moment” for his state.

The competition was smart on the government’s part, because it raised awareness about the emergence of commercial drones and built coalitions between state and local politicians to push the technology forward, said Peter W. Singer, author of “Wired for War,” a book about robotic warfare.

“It’s a huge step for the advancement of the industry,” Singer said. “It makes the future of the technology and the political, legal and ethical questions all the more real.”

Drones, which have played an increasing role in military combat around the world, have also begun to take on new commercial roles, often going where it’s too dangerous for a pilot in a cockpit.

They have helped measure radiation in the wake of the meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, penetrated the eyes of hurricanes to gather scientific data and helped firefighters see hot spots during wildfires. The FAA has also allowed limited surveillance uses for a few police agencies.

Currently, drones are not allowed to fly in the U.S. except with special permission from the FAA. The agency said there are 545 active certifications for such flights, many involving educational and scientific uses.

As drone technology becomes more advanced, demand has increased from police agencies and others for using drones. Oil and gas companies want to utilize them to keep an eye on their pipelines. Farmers in Japan already use small drones to spray their crops with pesticides. The idea of using drones as transport vehicles has been discussed as a way to deliver tacos and Domino’s pizza.

This month, online retail giant Amazon.com unveiled a plan to use small drones to deliver packages weighing no more than 5 pounds into customers’ hands in half an hour or less. It was the first time that a big-name retailer offered a compelling vision for using the technology.

Although drone technology has evolved, many questions remain, including safety and privacy concerns. The FAA has said that remotely piloted aircraft aren’t allowed in national airspace on a wide scale because they don’t have an adequate “detect, sense and avoid” technology to prevent midair collisions.

The test sites will work toward accomplishing that goal, which had been a concern of the Air Line Pilots Assn., the world’s largest pilot union that represents nearly 50,000 pilots. The group said drones should be integrated into national airspace only after it could be shown that the aircraft, pilots and operators meet the same high standards as other commercial aircraft operations.

The Assn. for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone trade group, has long touted the economic benefits of the proliferation of the technology. The association issued a study last year that found, as a result of the existing aerospace infrastructure in the state, California is positioned to create more than 12,000 jobs and realize an economic impact of $2.39 billion in just the first three years after integration.

There are other hurdles as well. The prospect of robotic aircraft flying over communities has generated cries of spies in the skies — and prompted legislation from city halls to Congress to restrict their operations.

The FAA said Monday that test-site operators will be required to obey laws protecting an individual’s right to privacy. But ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump said that the FAA’s requirement that test sites have privacy policies was not enough.

“Someday drones will be commonplace in U.S. skies and, before that happens, it’s imperative that Congress enact strong, nationwide privacy rules,” she said.

Selected as the test site operators were the University of Alaska, which will work with groups in Hawaii and Oregon to conduct testing in those states too; Griffiss International Airport in upstate New York; North Dakota’s Department of Commerce; Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi; and Virginia Tech, which also will be testing with groups in New Jersey.

The first testing site is expected to be up and operating in 180 days.

Edward Snowden is Obama’s turning point. While Obama was at the Brandenburg Gate delivering a speech to a mere 4,000 Germans, part-time computer programmer Edward Snowden made off with some of the most highly classified US intelligence documents, supposedly because he was disappointed in President Obama.

Snowden then leaked the goods to the Washington Post and Britain’s Guardian newspapers, and began a hide-and-seek game that has taken him to Hong Kong and Russia so far, and perhaps to Cuba and Ecuador next. Even if the information Snowden released is something the American people need to know, the way he did it belies his claim to be a hero. Whistle-blowers and patriots don’t go to these countries, spies and traitors do. And when they go they have to pay the price of admission -- by turning over information that country wants.

After Snowden arrived in Hong Kong, the Chinese government claimed the US was hacking into text messages on Chinese cellphones. That was music to their ears, since the single most contentious issue between the US and China today is cyberhacking. I was in China last month and met with the vice foreign minister. He bristled when I asked him about China’s cyberspying and cybertheft and claimed China was the victim of US cyberattacks. Now he’s got Snowden’s “proof” to back up that claim.

China might have been content to let Snowden stay in Hong Kong, but the minute the US charged him with espionage and asked China to extradite him home, they sent him packing to Moscow. Their excuse? The US didn’t fill out the paperwork request properly.

So, off to Moscow! The Russians claim to have had no advance notice of Mr. Snowden’s arrival, which is hard to believe since Russia imposes a complicated visa process on anyone hoping to visit, even if they only touch down in transit. They’ve also refused Obama’s extradition request, saying it’s none of Moscow’s business. So much for that reset with Russia. So much for President Obama’s goodwill gesture canceling the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. So much for his offer to cut the US nuclear arsenal unilaterally. Putin is thumbing his nose at us while palming that Super Bowl ring he ‘borrowed’ from the New England Patriots owner.

Two of the world’s most powerful countries have just humiliated the United States of America and our President has offered lame excuses that rank right up there with “the dog ate my homework.” An NSC spokeswoman said the US had registered strong objections to Chinese and Russian authorities. Too bad they don’t care. Even worse, we aren’t likely to do anything about it.

The immediate damage of Snowden’s actions is that he has likely turned over highly classified information to our two greatest competitors. But the long-term damage is incalculable. This may start with the Chinese and Russians thumbing their noses at us, it will soon be the Irans and Venezuelas of the world, and eventually even the Cubas and Ecuadors.

And President Obama is strangely silent, or busy making speeches about climate change.

Some of us have been warning for years that “leading from behind” will have grave consequences. Now we have demonstrable evidence that if you try to lead from behind, eventually the guys up front will stop looking back for instructions."

Washington (CNN) – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. John McCain engaged in quiet negotiations over the weekend and got close to averting the so-called nuclear option over a dispute surrounding President Obama's nominees, but they failed to seal the deal, sources in both parties tell CNN.

“The door opened a crack,” according to a senior Democratic source.



McCain told Reid he found the six GOP senators needed to join Democrats in breaking filibusters of the nominations, giving Democrats a key part of what they want: approval of Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

McCain told Reid that in exchange, the president would have to agree to withdraw two nominees for the National Labor Relations Board whom Mr. Obama had put in office by recess appointment, Sharon Block and Richard Griffin. Republicans disputed those appointments, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.

The NLRB, which hears and rules on labor disputes, is one of the most politically polarized institutions in Washington.

According to sources in both parties, Reid told McCain he couldn’t go along with the idea because they could not find replacements willing to go through what will surely be a politically rough nomination for an NRLB term that would be up in 2014.

Still, sources in both parties say this could be the seeds of a deal to avert the nuclear option – a Democratic threat to get around GOP filibusters by changing the Senate rules for seven Obama nominees, and allow them to be approved by a simple majority.

Keith Alexander says the NSA doesn't break into Google, Yahoo databases But The Washington Post reports that the NSA accesses data as it moves between centers Alexander didn't appear to address that specific claim The NSA later denies using the technique to ""collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data""

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency doesn’t have access to servers run by Internet giants Google and Yahoo, its chief said in a pushback to a Washington Post report that the U.S. spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text, video and audio records every day.

But Gen. Keith Alexander’s comments at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday don’t appear to address the substance of the newspaper’s allegations – that the NSA has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by U.S. law and court oversight.

Asked about the report by a Bloomberg Television reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference, Alexander denied breaking into servers or databases run by Internet companies.

“Not to my knowledge,” he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases.

“It would be illegal for us to do that. So, I don’t know what the report is,” Alexander said. “But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.”

However, the allegations published by The Post – based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden – aren’t that the NSA has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies.

Instead, the newspaper – citing the Snowden documents and unnamed “knowledgeable officials” – reported that the NSA gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world.

According to The Post, the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters found a way to exploit a weakness in Internet architecture to copy data as it moves from the public Internet into data centers maintained by the companies.

The agency then uses custom-built software to decode the companies’ internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect, the newspaper reported.

The material collected under the program – code-named MUSCULAR – includes e-mail addressing information, as well as “content such as text, audio and video,” according to The Post.

The agency’s Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top-secret January 9, 2013, accounting on which The Post’s report is based, according to the newspaper.

In a statement, the NSA said “the assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons’ data from this type of collection is also not true.”

“NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons,” the agency said.

It’s unclear how much of the material collected involves what the NSA calls “U.S. persons,” a category that includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the United States.

But unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court, surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards, The Post reported.

The report raised concerns from Google and Yahoo, with the Internet behemoths saying they never gave the NSA permission to access communication links to their servers.

“We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency,” said Yahoo spokeswoman Sarah Meron.

Google has “long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links,” said David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer.

“We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.”

The newspaper report emerged a day after Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, testified before a House committee reviewing the agency’s surveillance activities.

The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, came after a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

USA TODAY

Hong Kong Police Commissioner%3A The case will be dealt with according to the law

It is not known if the U.S. government has made a formal extradition request to Hong Kong

Hong Kong legislators said Saturday that the Chinese government should make final decision on extradition

Federal authorities have charged a former defense contractor with espionage and theft in connection with the disclosure of details about two secret surveillance programs managed by the National Security Agency, a government official confirmed Friday.

The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that the charges against Edward Snowden were filed in a sealed complaint released late today and that authorities were seeking the cooperation of Hong Kong officials to assist in his detention.

It is not known if the U.S. government has made a formal extradition request to Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong government had no immediate reaction to the charges against Snowden. Police Commissioner, Andy Tsang, when was asked about the development, told reporters only that the case would be dealt with according to the law, AP reports.

The charges against Snowden were first reported Friday by The Washington Post.

Snowden, who turned 30 on Friday, has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged to the Post and the Guardian newspapers earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

The news came hours after the Guardianreported that Britain's GCHQ spy agency had secretly tapped into the fiber-optic cables that carry the world's phone calls and Internet traffic and is sharing information with the NSA.

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

The one-page complaint -- marked ""UNDER SEAL"" -- was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, which the Post said has ""a long track record in prosecuting cases with national security implications.""

The formal charges, which were filed June 14, are unauthorized communication of national defense information; willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person; and theft of government property.

The espionage charge carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.

The United States has an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and Snowden could fight extradition if he is arrested. But, as the Post pointed out, the treaty has an exception for political offenses, and espionage ""has traditionally been treated as a political offense.""

The Post writes:

Snowden's defense team in Hong Kong is likely to invoke part of the extradition treaty with the United States, which states that suspects will not be turned over to face criminal trial for offenses of a ""political character.""

Snowden could also remain in Hong Kong if the Chinese government decides that it is not in the defense or foreign policy interests of the government in Beijing to have him sent back to the United States for trial.

Snowden could also apply for asylum in Hong Kong or attempt to reach another jurisdiction and seek asylum there before the authorities in Hong Kong act.

Snowden told the Guardian that Hong Kong provided him the ""cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained.""

The British returned the former colony to China in 1997. Although it has own legal system, Hong Kong ultimately answers to the national leadership in Beijing.

According to AP. Hong Kong legislators said Saturday that the Chinese government should make the final decision on whether Snowden should be extradited to the United States

A prominent former politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, said he doubted whether Beijing would intervene at this stage.

""Beijing would only intervene according to my understanding at the last stage. If the magistrate said there is enough to extradite, then Mr. Snowden can then appeal,"" he said.

Lee said Beijing could then decide at the end of the appeal process if it wanted Snowden extradited or not.

On Wednesday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that his organization was helping Snowden to try to broker asylum in Iceland because of the country's values, including protecting Internet freedom.

Were he to apply for asylum in Hong Kong, Snowden would not be given preferential treatment, an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees told the South China Morning Post.

Hong Kong's government and residents have been unsettled by Snowden's claims that since 2009 the NSA has been attacking computers belonging to Hong Kong officials, universities, businesses and students.

Hundreds turned out to protest the alleged surveillance, which the territory's leaders said last week they would be investigated.

""The government will follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated,"" said C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's chief executive.

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-reveals-more-secrets-court-111216859.html,,[],NSA reveals more secrets after court order,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has given up more of its surveillance secrets, acknowledging that it was ordered to stop scooping up thousands of Internet communications from Americans with no connection to terrorism — a practice it says was an unintended consequence when it gathered bundles of Internet traffic connected to terror suspects.

One of the documents that intelligence officials released Wednesday came because a court ordered the National Security Agency to do so. But it's also part of the administration's response to the leaks by analyst-turned-fugitive Edward Snowden, who revealed that the NSA's spying programs went further and gathered millions more communications than most Americans realized.

The NSA declassified three secret court opinions showing how it revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that one of its surveillance programs may have collected and stored as many as 56,000 emails and other communications by ordinary Americans annually over three years. The court ruled the NSA actions unconstitutional and ordered the agency to fix the problem, which it did by creating new technology to filter out buckets of data most likely to contain U.S. emails, and then limit the access to that data.

The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, released the information Wednesday ""in the interest of increased transparency,"" and as directed by President Barack Obama in June, according to a statement accompanying the online documents.

But it wasn't until the Electronic Freedom Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group that sued for the release of one of the documents, disclosed the court order that Obama administration officials also acknowledged that the release was prodded by the group's 2012 lawsuit.

The court opinions show that when the NSA reported its inadvertent gathering of American-based Internet traffic in September 2011, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ordered the agency to find ways to limit what it collects and how long it keeps the material.

Story continues

In an 85-page declassified FISA court ruling from October 2011, U.S. District Judge James D. Bates rebuked government lawyers for repeatedly misrepresenting the operations of the NSA's surveillance programs.

Bates wrote that the NSA had advised the court that ""the volume and nature of the information it had been collecting is fundamentally different than what the court had been led to believe,"" and went on to say the court must consider ""whether targeting and minimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amendment"" prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.

""This court is troubled that the government's revelations regarding NSA's acquisition of Internet transactions mark the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program,"" Bates added in a footnoted passage that had portions heavily blacked out.

Bates also complained that the government's submissions make clear that the NSA was gathering Internet data years before it was authorized by the USA Patriot Act's Section 702 in 2008.

The NSA had moved to revise its Internet surveillance in an effort to separate out domestic data from its foreign targeted metadata — which includes email addresses and subject lines. But in his October 2011 ruling, Bates said the government's ""upstream"" collection of data — taken from internal U.S. data sources — was unconstitutional.

Three senior U.S. intelligence officials said Wednesday that national security officials realized the extent of the NSA's inadvertent collection of Americans' data from fiber optic cables in September 2011. One of the officials said the problem became apparent during internal discussions between the NSA and Justice Department officials about the program's technical operation.

The problem, according to the officials, was that the top secret Internet-sweeping operation, which was targeting metadata contained in the emails of foreign users, was also amassing thousands of emails that were bundled up with the targeted materials. Because many web mail services use such bundled transmissions, the official said, it was impossible to collect the targeted materials without also sweeping up data from innocent domestic U.S. users.

Officials said that when they realized they had an American communication, the communication was destroyed. But it was not clear how they determined to whom an email belonged and whether any NSA analyst had actually read the content of the email. The officials said the bulk of the information was never accessed or analyzed.

As soon as the extent of the problem became clear, the officials said, the Obama administration provided classified briefings to both Senate and House intelligence committees within days. At the same time, officials also informed the FISA court, which later issued the three 2011 rulings released Wednesday — with sections blacked out — as part of the government's latest disclosure of documents.

The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so by name.

The documents were declassified to help the Obama administration explain some of the most recent disclosures made by The Washington Post after it published classified documents provided by Snowden, the former NSA systems analyst.

But the FISA court's classified rulings have also been at issue in a year-old lawsuit filed against the government by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The release Wednesday of the FISA opinion, two other 2011 rulings and a secret ""white paper"" on the NSA's surveillance came less than two weeks after a federal judge in Washington gave government lawyers a time extension in order to decide which materials to declassify. The EFF had been pressing for a summary judgment that would have compelled the government to release the secret FISA rulings, and the government's most recent extension expired Wednesday, the day it released the once-secret FISA court rulings.

""This was all released in response to the court's orders,"" said Mark Rumold, an EFF attorney involved in the litigation.

A senior administration official acknowledged Wednesday that some of the documents released were in response to the lawsuit, while others were released voluntarily. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the release with a reporter by name.

The documents were posted later in the day on a new website that went live Wednesday afternoon. The front page of the site said it was ""created at the direction of the president of the United States (and) provides immediate, ongoing and direct access to factual information related to the lawful foreign surveillance activities carried out by the U.S. intelligence community.""

These interceptions of innocent Americans' communications were happening when the NSA accessed Internet information ""upstream,"" meaning off fiber optic cables or other channels where Internet traffic traverses the U.S. telecommunications system.

The NSA disclosed that it gathers some 250 million Internet communications each year, with some 9 percent from these ""upstream"" channels, amounting to 20 million to 25 million emails a year. The agency used statistical analysis to estimate that of those, possibly as many as 56,000 Internet communications collected were sent by Americans or people in the U.S. with no connection to terrorism.

Under court order, the NSA resolved the problem by creating new ways to detect when emails by people within the U.S. were being intercepted and separated those batches of communications. It also developed new ways to limit how that data could be accessed or used. The agency also agreed to only keep these bundled communications for possible later analysis for a two-year period, instead of the usual five-year retention period.

The agency also, under court order, destroyed all the bundled data gathered between 2008, when the FISA court first authorized the collection under Section 702 of the Patriot Act, and 2011, when the new procedures were put in place.

The court signed off on the new procedures.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the program is specifically to gather foreign intelligence, not spy on Americans.

""The reason that we're talking about it right now is because there are very strict compliance standards in place at the NSA that monitor for compliance issues, that tabulate them, that document them and that put in place measures to correct them when they occur,"" Earnest said.

Sources voiced concern about the decision to the Investigative Project on Terrorism, which issued a report Wednesday on the under-the-radar announcement -- which was first made by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano after meeting in January with her Saudi counterpart. According to the IPT, this would be the first time the Saudi government has been given such a direct role in fast-tracking people for entry into the United States.

""I think you have radical Wahhabism in certain elements in Saudi Arabia, and I think to be more lenient there than in other places would be a mistake,"" Rep. Frank Wolf told the Investigative Project on Terrorism. ""There were 15 [hijackers] from that country, and there is a lot taking place in that region.""

Only an exclusive handful of countries enjoy inclusion in the Global Entry program -- Canada, Mexico, South Korea and the Netherlands. According to the IPT, some officials are questioning why Saudi Arabia gets to reap the benefits of the program, when key U.S. allies like Germany and France are not enrolled; Israel has reached a deal with the U.S., but that partnership has not yet been implemented.

Any Saudi travelers cleared through the program will be able to bypass the normal customs line after providing passports and fingerprints. The status lasts for five years.

The decision is a turnaround, the IPT notes, from when Saudi Arabia was briefly placed on a list of countries whose U.S.-bound travelers would face higher scrutiny, in the wake of the failed Christmas Day bombing attempt in 2009.

But Napolitano spoke highly of ""the bond between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"" when she announced the change in January.

""By enhancing collaboration with the government of Saudi Arabia, we reaffirm our commitment to more effectively secure our two countries against evolving threats while facilitating legitimate trade and travel,"" Napolitano said.

The Global Entry program was launched in 2008 to expedite pre-approved passengers through the airport customs and security process when they arrive in the U.S. The program is designed to weed out low-risk passengers and enable authorities to zero in on those who may be more likely to pose a threat.

But the program has sparked controversy in the past. Critics objected in late 2010 when Mexican citizens were included in the program, raising concerns that drug cartels would quickly learn how to exploit loopholes in the plan. DHS officials, however, insisted at the time that people who attain trusted traveler status don't get a free pass and are still subject to random searches.

The program allows travelers who have undergone a thorough vetting process -- fingerprinting, background checks, interviews with customs agents, etc.-- to attain a low-risk status that allows them to skip the line at customs and complete their entry process at an automatic kiosk."

They added in a statement on Graham’s Facebook page, “It is clear the events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens and terrorize a major American city.”

The two Republican conservatives have demanded that terror suspects not be Mirandized or tried in federal courts and instead be shipped to the detainee prison on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

But the Supreme Court has never said that a U.S. citizen captured on U.S. soil, like Tsarnaev, could be treated as an enemy combatant.

“The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans,” the senators said. “We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives. The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now.

“Under the Law of War we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel. Our goal at this critical juncture should be to gather intelligence and protect our nation from further attacks.”

In a separate tweet, Graham added, “The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to ‘remain silent.’”

Tsarnaev was arrested Friday night in Watertown, Mass. He was being held at a local hospital, and a Justice Department official said he likely would be charged later Saturday. Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. Attorney in Boston, invoked a “public safety exemption in cases of national security and potential charges involving acts of terrorism” as a reason not to immediately read him his Miranda rights against self-incrimination.

In 2011, a Justice Department memo expanded the use of the public safety exception in domestic terrorism cases, so that it can be invoked in exceptional circumstances even when there is not an imminent safety threat. The changes were made after a controversy over the handling of the suspect in the Christmas Day 2009 airline bomb attempt, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was questioned by FBI agents for less than an hour before being read his rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, said in a statement that “every criminal defendant” is entitled to Miranda rights, noting that Tsarnaev became a naturalized American citizen.

“The public safety exception should be read narrowly. It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule,” the ACLU said. “Every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried and true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.”

For the record, 3:30 p.m. April 20: A headline on this post said the senators had called for Tsarnaev to be sent to Guantanamo. They said he should be declared an enemy combatant.

As Republican and Democratic leaders battled over procedure, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated behind the scenes on a compromise bill.

The measure is the first change to law governing sexual assault in the military in years, stemming from the furor that has erupted over the rising numbers of sexual assaults in the military; there were 3,553 sexual assault complaints reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, a nearly 50 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.

The problem has drawn particular scrutiny in this Congress by the seven women on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who were divided on the best approach to contain the problem. “This agreement represents a huge win for justice in America’s armed forces,” said a joint statement from Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, who have both offered measures to combat sexual assault.

Ms. Gillibrand intends to move forward with her legislation to remove commanders as a stand-alone bill; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has assured her a vote.

House and Senate negotiators turned back Mr. Obama’s renewed push to close the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, extending a prohibition on the transfer of prisoners to the United States and forbidding the construction of facilities to house them. But they did loosen restrictions on the transfer of Guantánamo prisoners to other countries.

Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the change should ensure that about half the detainees still at the military prison will be transferred. Half will remain.

There was no guarantee that the remaining few days of this session will be smooth for the Pentagon bill, pending nominations or other matters that must be dealt with. Without a military policy bill, the Pentagon will no longer be able to offer combat pay to troops, re-enlistment bonuses or impact aid to local schools and governments near military bases, a cudgel that Armed Services leaders intended to use to force consideration of their measure."

I was chairman of the judiciary committee for 17 years or its ranking member. I teach separation of powers and constitutional law. This is something I know.

USATODAY

When attempts at immigration reform fail — as they so often have over the past two decades — the cause is always the same. People remember that the last major reform, in 1986, promised amnesty for undocumented workers in exchange for blocking new illegal immigration and delivered only the former.

So there's reason to look warily at the latest plan, which the Senate will begin debating this week.

But taken to extremes, demands for tough enforcement can be used as a tool for killing reform entirely. And that, unfortunately, appears to be the tactic of choice for some Senate Republicans, who don't want to lose Hispanic votes by opposing a bipartisan immigration bill but don't particularly want it to pass either.

Their plan is to set impossible enforcement goals that would have to be met before any of today's estimated 11 million undocumented workers could gain legal status.

One case in point is a proposed amendment to the compromise bill crafted by the so-called Gang of Eight senators. Written by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the amendment would turn the plan's 10-year wait for green cards for undocumented workers into a never-ending one.

Among its unrealistic goals is the adoption of biometric entry-exit screening systems at all international airports and seaports. This is a worthy effort, one that both parties have been trying to reach since 9/11. But progress has been stymied by the complexity of the task. And, looking forward, it's hard to see it being put in place any time soon.

The measure would also require that border agents be aware of 100% of all illegal border crossings and that they thwart at least 90%. These standards would be subject to interpretation by both the secretary of Homeland Security and the head of the Government Accountability Office (an investigative branch of Congress). This means that some future administration or Congress could throw a wrench into the plan.

The underlying bill is no slouch on enforcement. It would spend $5.5 billion over 10 years along the border. It would also set a goal of 90% apprehension in areas where most of the illegal crossings take place. After five years, if the goal had not been met, more money would be committed and border-state governors would be given a greater say.

The firm belief is that the goals will be met. The government is already spending $18 billion on immigration enforcement each year — more than on all other law enforcement activities combined. Illegal crossing over the U.S.-Mexico border has slowed to a trickle, and by some accounts it has even reversed as job opportunities south of the border have grown.

There is still much that needs to be done. The E-Verify system for checking applicants' status at the workplace needs to be fully deployed. And some form of entry-exit system needs to be phased in. But none of these things should be used as an excuse for ignoring other issues, including the need to bring some 11 million people into the mainstream.

Unlike 1986's political sleight of hand, this year's legislation is a tough, credible plan for preventing a new surge of illegal immigration. A quest for unattainable perfection should not be allowed to undo the good that it would achieve.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/12/Horowitz-blasts-left-Heritage,2013-11-12 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Horowitz at Heritage Foundation: 'The Communist Party Is The Democratic Party',"On Tuesday, former Marxist-turned-conservative icon David Horowitz spoke at the Heritage Foundation to mark the launch of what will be a ten-volume compendium of his writings on leftism, The Black Book of the American Left. In his wide-ranging speech, Horowitz described his transition from left to right, and discussed the shortcomings of a conservative movement unwilling to deal with the ugly realities of what the American left represents.

Horowitz began by distinguishing the David Horowitz Freedom Center from other think tanks, instead characterizing it as a “battle tank.” He labeled himself “monomaniacal” in his focus on the left and its relation to communism. “There are hedgehogs and foxes. The foxes know many things. And the hedgehogs know one thing. I am a hedgehog,” he joked.

“My parents called themselves progressives,” Horowitz explained with regard to his communist parents. “The agenda was a Soviet America…the slogan of the communist party in those days was peace, jobs, democracy. Sound familiar?”

That was the theme of Horowitz’s speech as he continued: how the communists had taken over the Democratic Party. “The communist party is the Democratic Party,” Horowitz stated. “In The Great Gatsby, [F. Scott] Fitzgerald describes the rich as people who break things and leave them for others to clean up. That is a wonderful description of the left.” Horowitz, who began as a radical Marxist, said that the modern left had learned stealth from their failures in the 1960s: “The left have learned from the 1960s…we in the 1960s didn’t want to pretend to be Jeffersonian democrats…That’s why we failed in the 1960s. That’s why they’ve succeeded now.”

But the right, Horowitz pointed out, has failed to acknowledge that reality. On Obamacare, for example, Horowitz railed against the language used by the left: “single-payer.” Instead, he said, “it is communism,” pointing out that it was state ownership of the means of production. He added, “The left hate the Constitution because Madison designed it to thwart them.”

Horowitz then analyzed what he claimed were the four features of the leftist mentality. First, he said, the left and right are on opposite sides of the “fundamental divide of the modern age”: the left believes that human beings are inherently good and infinitely malleable, and so can be shaped by proper state guidance. Conservatives, by contrast, believe that human beings are responsible for social problems, and concentrating power in the hands of humans is dangerous.

Second, Horowitz said, the left are characterized by the belief that “history is a forward march.” Obama, Horowitz claimed, is a deep believer in this concept, all the way down to his carpet in the Oval Office, which assures those who enter that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. “Leftism is a crypto-religion,” he explained. “They see themselves as a savior. People who believe that redemption will take place in this life and I will be a part of it, that’s Hitler. That’s Mao…That’s the American left.”

Third, Horowitz said that the left was characterized by “alienation from this country… What weakens America is actually good.” Horowitz cited the Obama administration’s eager withdrawal from Iraq as evidence of that proposition: “Obama betrayed every American who gave their life for the people of Iraq.” He also slammed the Obama administration with regard to Benghazi: “Benghazi is the most shameful act in the history of the American presidency.”

Finally, said Horowitz, the American left “lie. And it’s not like politicians spinning…you cannot be a leftist without lying about the most basic strategic facts about who you are.”

Horowitz summed up pessimistically: “We are within reach of a totalitarian state in this country…These are very very dark days for this country.” But, Horowitz held out hope: “there’s been an earthquake on the conservative side since I switched sides…the tea party is the earthquake. The best thing that Republicans can do is stop the fratricide.”"

Carter initially joined the Marines in 1998; he joined the Army a decade later in 2008 after being honorably discharged in 2003 and has attained the rank of Staff Sergeant.

Carter earned the Medal of Honor by running back and forth between Combat Outpost Keating and a disabled Humvee while serving in Afghanistan. Three American soldiers were stuck in the disabled humvee without any ammunition to defend themselves or strike back at the enemy.

Carter and his platoon were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. Once there, Carter found himself at Combat Outpost Keating, which he described as “a death trap” because it sat deep within a valley surrounded by mountains. The outpost was there to keep insurgents from slipping into Pakistan, and Carter was there to help man it until it could be shut down on October 4, 2009.

But as CNN reports, the Taliban struck the day before the outpost was to be closed. Carter and his fellow soldiers were forced to defend their lives in what is arguably one of the most intense firefights of the war in Afghanistan.

As the Taliban targeted mortars and large guns at Combat Outpost Keating in an attempt to render the location defenseless, they kept a constant barrage of small arms fire on the troops as well. By using this tactic, they were able to kill eight of the 53 American soldiers stationed there.

With the worst of the fire coming in, Carter realized three fellow soldiers–Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace, and Sgt. Justin Gallegos–“[were] trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire.”

Carter ran “through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men.”

By the time the attack on Combat Outpost Keating ended, two of the soldiers in the Humvee–Mace and Gallegos–were dead, and Carter says he is haunted by his belief that he could have done more. He says the faces of the dead soldiers pop into his head and he thinks, “I shoulda [sic] done this, I could of done that.”

Breitbart News salutes Staff Sgt. Ty Carter for his courage under fire. We are free because of men like him. God bless the families of the troops who were lost at Combat Outpost Keating. Breitbart News refuses to allow their sacrifice to be forgotten.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A valuable new report issued this month by the Open Society Justice Initiative documents the extent of the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of extraordinary rendition — the practice of abducting suspected terrorists and transferring them to countries with reputations for torturing prisoners during interrogations.

Reporting by The Times and other news media has long established that the C.I.A. operated a secret detention program with “black site” prisons outside the United States. In December, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a highly critical, classified report on this program that has not been released. Committee members invoked its findings without revealing any useful new information at the recent confirmation hearing for John Brennan, the Obama administration’s top counterterrorism official, who was named to head the C.I.A. But the committee chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, has said that the black sites and coercive techniques were “terrible mistakes.”

According to the Open Society report, 54 countries participated in this program, including many where the rule of law is weak or nonexistent, like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia and Somalia. More surprising and alarming is the collusion of leading democracies. Belgium, Finland and Denmark, among others, allowed their airports and airspace to be used for flights associated with C.I.A. rendition operations. Britain, Italy, Germany and Australia helped interrogate one or more suspects and either allowed or actively aided in their transfers."

Senator Ron Wyden, an earnest and wonky Democrat from Oregon, instead saw opportunity to again sound his cryptic but insistent warning about the alarming scope of government surveillance.

For hours before a C-SPAN camera and a mostly empty chamber, he expounded about his concerns over the nine-year renewal of a broad Bush-era surveillance law, loading his remarks with references to Ben Franklin, colonialists and obscure semiannual intelligence reports.

“I do not take a back seat to any member of this body in terms of protecting the sources and methods of those in the intelligence community,” Mr. Wyden said. But he warned that those efforts “should never be a secret from the American people.”

Late Wednesday, the secret was exposed, bringing to light the scale of government collection of communication information in the name of national security that Mr. Wyden and another serious-minded Western Democrat — Mark Udall of Colorado — have been hinting at for years."

So does that of Sean Smith, Glenn Doherty and Tyrone Woods who, along with Stevens, were murdered at the hands of Al Qaeda-linked terrorists in a siege of the U. S consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.

Despite President Obama’s pledge to “hunt down” the Islamic jihadists who slaughtered those four brave Americans in cold blood, to date, not one suspect has been killed or apprehended.

This despite the fact that one of the main suspects in the attack, Ahmed Khattala, has granted lengthy interviews to the New York Times, CNN and several other American news outlets and saunters around the streets of Libya in plain sight even today, almost daring the Obama administration to come get him.

More On This... The Obama Doctrine has officially collapsed — Putin is now in charge

Khattala has good reason to feel safe. Over the course of the past year, Obama administration officials have gone from falsely blaming the Benghazi assault on an obscure YouTube video about Mohammed (current National Security Advisor Susan Rice) to whining “what difference does it make” (former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) to, finally, throwing their hands in the air and dismissing Benghazi altogether as just another GOP-driven “phony scandal” (President Obama himself).

Yes, Ahmed Khattala must be quaking in his sandals.

The multiple lies, cover-ups and brazen disinterest on the part of the Obama administration in seeking justice for Stevens and his colleagues comprise one of the most shameful episodes in the history of American foreign policy. Perhaps the most maddening aspect of the Benghazi siege—again, a premeditated terror attack by an Al Qaeda linked outfit on a U.S. consulate that left four Americans dead—is that we’ll likely never get some of the more crucial questions surrounding it answered.

Just where was President Obama as the entire seven-hour-plus ordeal was unfolding?

Whose idea was it to concoct the YouTube clip lie and parade Rice in front of a national television audience to trumpet it five days after the attack?

Why did the CIA reportedly have dozens of personnel on the ground in Benghazi the night of the attack?

Why is the Obama administration going to such great lengths to suppress any testimony about Benghazi?

Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf, for one, has charged that the administration may have been supplying weapons gathered in Libya to Syrian rebels and is seeking to cover its tracks. That would help explain the CIA assets on the ground in Benghazi.

Wolf’s theory makes a lot of sense, given the fondness the Obama White House has shown for supporting Islamist revolutionaries everywhere from Egypt to, ironically enough, Libya.

This decision to back—even arm—radical Islamists is a stunning turn of events.

Today, on September 11, 2013, one year after the Benghazi attack and just twelve years removed from 9/11, the U.S. government is throwing its weight behind forces—whether Al-Qaeda types in Syria or Muslim Brotherhooders in Egypt and elsewhere—that share the exact same totalitarian, anti-American ideology as the jihadists who brought down the Twin Towers.

Which begs the question: what exactly do we have to show for twelve years of American blood and treasure expended in the War on Terror?

President Obama’s willfully misleading claims during the 2012 campaign season that Al Qaeda was “on the run” and “nearing defeat” notwithstanding, AQ and its allies and affiliates now cover more geographical ground than they did on 9/11: from Pakistan and Iraq to Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, North Africa, Sinai, Nigeria, Algeria, Europe and beyond.

Likewise, Al Qaeda’s ideology has inspired a generation of young followers in the West, resulting in the kind of terror and mayhem we saw unleashed by the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston last April.

At the same time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, continues its march towards nuclear weapons and along with its jihadist proxy, Hezbollah, is establishing a presence throughout Latin America, at our very doorstep.

In addition, while the Muslim Brotherhood may be down in Egypt right now, it is anything but out. The world’s first modern Islamist terrorist organization has affiliates in some 70 countries worldwide and remains wildly influential, including among Muslim communities here in the United States.

From closing down U.S. embassies en masse last month, to farming out its Syria policy to Putin’s Russia, to propping up the Morsi dictatorship in Egypt and throwing Israel under the bus at every turn, the Obama administration has projected stunning weakness, uncertainty and ignorance and overseen a series of foreign policy disasters that have whittled down America’s influence in the Middle East to almost nil.

And thanks to the Benghazi debacle, our enemies now believe that American blood comes cheap."

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, recently delivered a grim warning: “If you want [the military] to be doing what it’s doing today, then we can’t give you another dollar.”

His worries reflect reductions that started in 2009 and have reached crippling levels, even in President Obama’s proposals to avert sequestration. I take the general at his word, but I am concerned that the president does not.

Sequester hurts national security, not just because 50% of the cuts fall on the military’s 18% share of the overall budget but because the Pentagon has been the only place the president is willing to cut. For four years he has mismanaged our nation’s most vital resource, our uniformed military, fomenting the sequester-inspired readiness crisis it faces today. His actions, his under-resourced strategies, accelerated withdrawal plans and lead-from-behind policies have left the Pentagon far less able to shoulder the burden of another 10% cut.

The wide swath of missions Dempsey referred to benefit Americans in varied ways. Some are obvious, like fighting terrorism; some are subtler, like patrolling our airspace and shoring up our economic security by keeping vital avenues of commerce free — on the seas and in space and cyberspace.

Those are missions the military should be able to perform without putting undue stress on the armed services as a whole. Actually, I want them to be fully prepared if they are called on to do much more. While there is no question the Pentagon was long overdue for a housecleaning, we have cut down so rapidly and so blindly that we’re in danger of breaking the back of the force.

And, perhaps more important, the sequester will cripple our military’s ability to fulfill its primary role: to keep this nation out of war.

Already, Pentagon planners are going through the laundry list of missions that could be cut. The Navy has been forced to keep a carrier in port rather than send it on a scheduled deployment to the Middle East. That message is not lost on the Iranians.

Sequestration manifests itself in less prominent but no less potent ways. For example, tons of illegal narcotics are intercepted annually by military patrols in the Caribbean. The Navy is now shuttering operations that will leave the door open for those drugs to find their way to America’s suburbs. The Navy may also have to curtail its ballistic missile defense patrols — even as North Korea successfully launched a missile into space in December and conducted a nuclear test in recent weeks.

Advertisement

The Air Force will be hit so hard, its leadership is being forced to cut flight hours for air crews. If they cannot train adequately enough to deploy, our pilots may well be grounded during the next national crisis.

The Marine Corps faces an equally dire outlook, where cuts are so deep we risk losing the Marines as a deployable force. Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, warned in congressional testimony that because there will be no amphibious ready group around Africa, the Marines can no longer provide quick-reaction support to our embassies there. The next time America needs to call 911, we may not be able to call in the Marines.

Advertisement

The Army faces similar challenges, as do the industries that support the Defense Department.

In California alone, it is estimated that we could lose 126,000 private sector jobs, 20,000 active-duty military jobs and more than 15,000 civilian Defense Department jobs. I have spent the last year and a half talking with my constituents who will be directly affected by these cuts. It is unbelievable that the president would support a plan that would dissolve a highly skilled and dedicated workforce at installations such as the Antelope Valley’s Plant 42. Remember, many workers in California and across the nation have lost their jobs because of previous dramatic defense cuts. Sequester only adds to this pain.

Advertisement

That brings us to a choice. If there were a proposal on the table that spared the troops and heeded Dempsey’s warning of not a dollar more from the armed forces, I would ask House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to consider it. But after cutting defense three times, the president’s solution to replacing sequester means another $250 billion out of the armed forces and more taxes. The choice the American people are being given is “break the military” or “break the military and new taxes.”

Let’s be clear: Even if the president were given every dollar in new taxes he has requested, it wouldn’t make a difference in our national debt. Entitlement programs will continue to grow out of control, and the amount we spend on interest to service the debt soon will start to outpace even what we spend on the military. The cuts he continues to insist on, while below the level of sequestration, are still severe enough to hollow out our force. This approach forces me to conclude that the president, for all his stump speeches and props, wants the sequester to happen.

The president is forcing America to indulge him in this dangerous experiment with national security. It is unworthy of the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands in uniform whom he has directed into harm’s way over the last four years. It is a reckless experiment when one takes stock of the growing threats and commitments that occupy our forces around the world.

Manning faces up 90 years in prison for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks

Army psychologist testified Manning struggles with his gender identity

A U.S. soldier%2C Manning was working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010

FORT MEADE, Maryland (AP) — U.S. soldier Bradley Manning took the stand Wednesday during his sentencing hearing for leaking classified material to WikiLeaks and apologized for hurting the United States and others.

Manning gave an unsworn statement, which means he cannot be cross-examined by prosecutors. He began with an apology.

""I'm sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that it hurt the United States,"" he said.

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for leaking the information while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010.

He said he understood what he was doing and the decisions he made. However, he said he did not believe at the time that leaking the information would cause harm.

Earlier, an Army psychologist said Manning's private struggle with his gender identity in a hostile workplace put incredible pressure on the soldier.

Manning eventually came out to Capt. Michael Worsley and e-mailed the therapist a photo of himself wearing a wig of long, blond hair and lipstick. The photo was attached to a letter titled ""My problem,"" in which Manning describes his issues with gender identity and his hope that a military career would ""get rid of it.""

Worsley testified at Manning's sentencing hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore. He said the soldier had little to no support base.

""You put him in that kind of hyper-masculine environment, if you will, with little support and few coping skills, the pressure would have been difficult to say the least,"" Worsley said. ""It would have been incredible.""

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010. His lawyers contend that Manning showed clear signs of deteriorating mental health that should have prevented commanders from sending him to a war zone to handle classified information.

Manning sat and listened attentively to the psychologist who had treated him, smiling occasionally. But his face tightened when Worsley talked about how guarded and hesitant Manning had been in Iraq to talk about his gender identity.

Worsley's testimony described some military leaders as lax at best and obstructionist at worst when it came to tending to troop mental health.

He said some in Manning's brigade ""had difficulty understanding"" recommendations the doctor would make regarding the needs of some soldiers.

""I questioned why they would want to leave somebody in a position with the issue they had,"" Worsley said of troubled soldiers.

Navy Capt. David Moulton, a psychiatrist who spent 21 hours interviewing Manning at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., after his arrest, testified as a defense witness that Manning's gender identity disorder combined with narcissistic personality traits, post-adolescent idealism and his lack of friends in Iraq caused him to reasonably conclude he could change the world by leaking classified information.

""He became very enthralled with this idea that the things that he was finding were injustices that he felt he morally needed to right,"" Moulton said.

He said Manning was struggling to balance his desire to right wrongs with his sense of duty to complete his Army tasks and his fear of losing his GI benefits and the opportunity to attend college.

""His decision-making capacity was influenced by the stress of his situation for sure,"" Moulton said. ""He was under severe emotional stress at the time of the alleged offenses.""

The soldier was set to take the stand in his own defense later Wednesday. His sister and aunt are also on the defense witness list.

At least 46 international journalists and 78 spectators were in attendance. Many spectators wore black ""truth"" T-shirts.

Most reporters watched a closed-circuit feed of the hearing in a nearby building. Other closed-circuit feeds were available to overflow spectators in a trailer outside the courthouse and another nearby building.

Security was tight. Barricades surrounded the courthouse, and those entering the courtroom or any of the viewing areas were scanned for metal objects and had their belongings meticulously searched."

“A member of the public would not hear the President’s statement to be a simple admonition to hold members accountable,” Fulton stated. “A member of the public would draw the connection between the ‘dishonorable discharge’ required by the President and a punitive discharge approved by the convening authority.

She Left In February A Los Angeles-Area Native', 'She Has Reported Across Southern California', 'Edited', 'Traveled The States']",Immigration bill would be largest such effort ever attempted,"WASHINGTON — After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of eight senators is poised to offer a sweeping bill to rewrite the nation’s immigration laws this week, taking advantage of a changed political alignment that, for the first time in nearly a generation, appears to have opened the way for comprehensive legislation.

The bill would chart a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the 11 million people in this country without proper legal status, spend billions of dollars more on border security, create new legal guest worker programs for low-income jobs and farm labor, require new verification measures for most companies hiring new workers and significantly expand overall immigration to the U.S. for the next decade, according to an outline obtained by The Times’ Washington bureau.

The legalization program would amount to the largest such effort any nation has attempted, affecting more than three times as many people as the Reagan-era immigration reform law. But it is only one part of the legislation, and perhaps not the portion with the greatest impact.

The agricultural workforce — where half the workers currently have no legal status — would be transformed by a new guest worker program that is designed to bring more than 300,000 immigrant farmworkers to the nation’s fields over the next decade and provide field workers an expedited pathway to citizenship. A new visa program for housecleaners, landscapers and other low-skill occupations would be created, while high-tech industries would be allowed to double the number of foreign workers they use.

All told, the country’s current inflow of about 1 million legal immigrants a year could grow by half over the next decade.

The bill also would probably spur a spending spree on the Southwest border as the government rolls out more surveillance technology, including unmanned drones and military-grade radar, to detect people crossing into the United States.

Although Congress has deadlocked repeatedly on immigration policy, leading figures in both parties expect that the legislation, expected to run hundreds of pages, stands an excellent chance of approval in the Senate, which plans to begin debate on it next month, and that some version of it could become law by year’s end.

That would make the effort the first comprehensive immigration overhaul since the 1986 amnesty law signed by then-President Reagan.

“I think we are on the cusp of history here. This is a really big deal,” said Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “We are operating in a Washington environment that is so dysfunctional, so political, so partisan and yet on this issue.... eight members came together on this from a full ideological spectrum — that is historic.”

Opponents warn that American workers will see their wages erode in the face of greater competition from migrants. Supporters counter that the bill would benefit the U.S. economy by bringing the current unauthorized population out of legal limbo and by providing a steady flow of legal workers for industries with labor shortages.

The legislative work in Washington reflects the changed dynamic in the country, as polls show a majority of Americans back some type of legal status for those living here without proper authorization.

Rather than viewing immigrants as a threat or burden to society, increasing numbers of Americans hold positive views of the contributions immigrants make, polls show.

That shift, along with the growing power of Latino voters, many of whom have made immigration reform a priority, appears to have broken a deadlock on the issue. After the overwhelming Latino vote for President Obama in 2012, many Republican strategists decided their party had little choice but to embrace reform. They tapped Sen. Marco Rubio, the rising tea party Republican from Florida, as their front man in talks with Democratic leaders and the handful of Republicans who had previously supported a legalization plan.

“What we have seen is, I think, a remarkable — in Washington — level of consensus between and support for bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday.

For months, the eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — have been meeting privately, often in the office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) steps from the Senate floor, as the contours of the bill took shape.

Securing the nation’s borders against illegal crossings has long been a cornerstone of reform efforts. The new plan requires a secure border with Mexico before the other provisions of the bill, including the citizenship proposals, could take hold. It provides $3 billion to increase surveillance, including the use of unmanned aerial drones. The Southwest border would be considered secure if, within five years, 90% of those attempting to cross illegally are turned back in areas that have had more than 30,000 apprehensions a year.

Advertisement

An additional $1.5 billion would go toward a double-layer fence constructed with help from the National Guard. Money would also go to local authorities to prevent border crossings, to triple prosecutions in some areas, and to dispatch 3,500 more customs agents.

After five years, if the border security goals remain unmet, a commission of border state governors and attorneys general will be given money and authority to implement further measures. “We’re confident it’s achievable,” Rubio said over the weekend in a Fox News interview.

Advertisement

Gaining citizenship would be a decadelong and costly process that would be tied to the border security provisions.

Six months after the bill becomes law, most of the 11 million people in the country without authorization — those who have been in the country before Dec. 31, 2011, and have no serious criminal record — would be eligible to apply for a new probationary legal status. That would allow them to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. They would be required to pay a $500 initial penalty as well as an application fee and back taxes. The probationary status would be good for six years and could then be renewed after payment of another $500 penalty.

Advertisement

At the end of 10 years, if the border security targets have been hit, those on probationary status would be able to pay another $1,000 to apply for a green card, which provides permanent legal residency. Three years later, they could apply for citizenship. Those granted probationary status would not be eligible for government benefits during the decadelong wait.

If the government does not meet its border security targets, people could stay on probationary status, but would not be allowed to apply for citizenship.

Advertisement

Two groups would get a special expedited citizenship path — young people who were brought to this country illegally as children, and agricultural workers, who would become eligible for green cards within five years if they commit to keep working in the fields, and would be eligible for citizenship after that.

During the 10 years, the government would clear up the current backlog of people who have applied for visas to be reunited with family members already living in the U.S. Roughly 4 million such applications are on file, although government officials say an unknown number of those represent people who already have entered the country illegally or who have given up plans to immigrate.

Advertisement

With the new route to citizenship for some comes closed doors for others. Adult siblings of U.S. citizens will no longer be eligible for a family preference in the visa application process. The bill would eliminate 55,000 “diversity immigrant visas” that are awarded by lottery each year and go largely to migrants from Africa and Eastern Europe.

The U.S. already admits more immigrants than any other country in the world. It is poised to increase that by 50% over the first decade under the draft bill.

Advertisement

Representatives of labor and business hashed out a series of agreements for foreign workers that the senators have folded into their bill. A new visa system, negotiated between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, would bring in as many as 200,000 low-skilled workers for jobs in hospitality, meat packing and other industries.

The government would also set up a new start-up visa program for entrepreneurs and merit visas for high-achieving student workers.

Advertisement

The program would be run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with pay scales set at median industry wages and the number of visas determined by the U.S. unemployment rate and other factors.

Visas for the existing high-tech worker program could nearly double to more than 120,000 per year.

Advertisement

For farmworkers, as many as 337,000 new three-year visas — 122,333 each year for the first three years after the bill becomes law — would be available. After five years, the secretary of Agriculture would set an annual visa limit based on market conditions. Growers would also have to pay transportation and housing costs for workers, but workers’ spouses and children would not be eligible to join them.

The law would also require all employers to check new workers against an electronic-verification system. The requirement, which could cost the government $1.5 billion to implement, would be phased in over five years.

Advertisement

Passage in the Senate could give momentum to a similarly bipartisan group in the House, which is preparing its own bill.

“We need to design a system that is flexible going into the future so that immigration can serve as a real competitive advantage for us economically and as a society,” said Doris Meissner, who was head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000, and is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington. “All the more reason to grab the moment.”

Officers who guard the line say the border is more secure in most places than they have ever known it. They say they are in a strong position to hold off an illegal surge, and to show why they point to Arizona, once the busiest and most contentious border battlefront. To the east, in Texas, agents are still struggling to stop persistent migrants in hundreds of miles of varying and penetrable terrain. But in Arizona, every available measure shows steep declines in the number of people making it across, figures that border agents say demonstrate what they can accomplish.

In Congress, many Republicans recall that an amnesty in 1986, which was supposed to solve illegal migration, was followed by an even larger unauthorized influx. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working on a proposal that would require measurable gains in border security before immigrants would be allowed to proceed onto a path to full citizenship.

But to border officials here, Congress seems to be behind the times, failing to notice that they have already made many of the enforcement advances that lawmakers are seeking. Since 2005, the number of patrol agents in the Southwest has nearly doubled, to more than 18,000. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, has built its air wing to more than 260 aircraft. It acquired an array of technology, including ground sensors and aerial detection devices developed by the Defense Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and created a military-style command structure with expanded intelligence operations to coordinate agents on the ground.

While tightening the border, officials also created a system of penalties for those who get past it, making it far more likely that migrants who were caught would be jailed, prosecuted as criminals, or expelled from the country far from the place where they tried to enter."

Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, woodland and desert (shown) $319,000 The Marine Corps produced new and markedly better camouflage patterns. But the Marines took steps to make sure they weren't copied or used by other services. One such measure: The Marines inserted small Marine Corps logos into the pattern.

Army Combat Uniform (ACU) $2.63 million The Army unveiled its own ""universal"" camouflage pattern, intended for use in all environments. But that choice was marred with shortcuts and mistakes. The Army commissioned a study of which pattern worked best, but the brass chose this pattern before that study was finished.

Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) $3.1 million Most Air Force personnel work far from the front lines. But that force has its own ""tiger stripe"" uniform. Now, Air Force personnel in Afghanistan are told to wear Army Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern camouflage instead. The Airman Battle Uniform is now prohibited for use in battle.

Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP) $2.9 million For troops in Afghanistan, the Army scrapped the pattern it had introduced in 2005 and replaced it with a new one. Now, the Army is working to replace this replacement. It is expected to present another camouflage pattern later this year. The Army estimated that switching out the uniforms cost more than $38.8 million.

Navy Working Uniform Type I $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) The Navy designed this camouflage-style uniform for settings where camouflage is not usually necessary: on Navy bases and ships. Sailors call them ""aquaflage"" or ""blueberries.""

Navy Working Uniform Type II (desert) $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) In the mid-2000s, the Navy decided it needed its own distinct uniform for fighting on land. But the Marine Corps objected, because the pattern was similar to the Marine one. Now, the Navy limits the use of this pattern: It is worn only by Special-Operations troops and Navy personnel supporting them.

Navy Working Uniform Type III (woodland) $435,000 (combined with other 2011 patterns) This uniform features a green camouflage pattern with Navy logos. Because of the spat with the Marine Corps over the Navy's desert camouflage, some Navy forces in the Middle East have been issued these uniforms instead."

The companies said some of the requests were for terrorism investigations. But others were from a local sheriff asking for data to locate a missing child or from federal marshals tracking fugitives. From these statements, it was impossible to ascertain the scale of the FISA requests made by the National Security Agency.

The companies said they have been pressing the U.S. government for permission to talk more openly about the data requests since The Washington Post and Guardian newspapers reported on a secret surveillance program code-named PRISM that was aimed at tracking terrorist activities. The reports cited an NSA PowerPoint presentation that said the agency connected directly to the servers of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other tech-industry giants. Another NSA document described the program differently.

Facebook and other tech companies have vigorously denied giving the government direct access to their servers. But they said they comply with law enforcement requests approved by a court.

Beyond those statements, the firms have been unwilling to detail how they are cooperating with national security officials. Security experts have said the FISA orders likely prevented the companies from talking publicly about the data requests.

“In light of continued confusion and inaccurate reporting related to this issue, we’ve advocated for the ability to say even more,” Facebook general counsel Ted Ullyot wrote in a blog post late Friday.

As a result of recent negotiations with the government, Ullyot said, the company was permitted for the first time to give a range of how many U.S. local law enforcement and national security-related requests it has received. The government would not allow it to disclose specific numbers.

Facebook had been in “deep discussions with government officials throughout the week and released the information less than one minute” after gaining final government approval, a person familiar with the matter said.

That the company would rush to release a figure that gives the public little idea of the scale of the FISA requests is a sign of the pressure it has been under since the PRISM program was made public.

Google has released a range of the numbers of National Security Letters it got from the government every year since 2009. In each year, it was between zero and 999, except for 2010, when it was between 1,000 and 1,999. These figures do not include FISA requests.

A letter that Google sent to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has prompted discussions with federal officials about whether Google can release more detailed information, said a person familiar with the talks.

In a statement late Friday, Google said: “We have always believed that it’s important to differentiate between different types of government requests. We already publish criminal requests separately from National Security Letters. Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users. Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

They were likely not right-wing Americans, as some on the left had predicted and hoped.

We do not yet know whether they are part of a larger cell or whether these attacks were directed from abroad versus being exclusively the idea of these two terrorist brothers. Experts note that on one hand terrorist groups have put information on the Internet on how to make the specific types of bombs used in the attack, but also say it is very possible these brothers also received terrorist training overseas. We may learn the answers to these questions in coming days.

Either way, it’s disconcerting that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was “sharing intel“ with authorities in the investigation of this bombing. SPLC is the ultra-left group that has a habit of demonizing conservative organizations as “domestic hate groups,” but has now been linked in federal court to a convicted terrorist. Even some outspoken liberals take issue with the SPLC’s outrageous bias, saying SPLC is “essentially a fraud.”

Recently, a U.S. army officer used SPLC’s material to say the military should watch out for soldiers thought to support various Christian organizations targeted by the SPLC, as well as immigration-reform groups (suggesting they’re “anti-Muslim”) and Tea Party groups.

It’s critically important to recognize that there are countless peaceful and patriotic Muslim Americans, and they must not be lumped in with terrorists. But given our history, it’s not “anti-Muslim” to note when a terrorist is Muslim and motivated by fanatical religious beliefs.

The Obama administration’s decision to prosecute the Ft. Hood shooter, Maj. Nadal Hasan, as a perpetrator of “workplace violence” instead of a terrorist attack–while refusing to give military honors, such as Purple Hearts to those shot by Hasan–showcases a profoundly disturbing political correctness that has no place in national security circles.

As the recent sentencing of convicted terrorist Floyd Corkins, who confessed that he planned his terrorist attack based on information provided by SPLC, approaches on Apr. 29, it is increasingly important that no law enforcement agency lends any credibility to the SPLC. Its partisan agenda focuses so much energy going after conservatives and Christians instead of real terrorists.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/defense-budget-cuts_n_2584099.html,2013-01-30 00:00:00,['Senior Military Correspondent'],Defense Budget Faces Cuts To Personnel After Decade Of War,"WASHINGTON -- For more than a decade, Congress and the Pentagon have spent money on the nation's 1.3 million active-duty troops and their families. Salaries and benefits soared far above civilian compensation, military bases and housing were refurbished, support services like day care, family counseling and on-base college courses were expanded.

Now comes the reckoning. These personnel costs, necessary and warranted for those bearing the burden of war, are threatening to wreck the military, squeezing the accounts meant to fix or replace gear worn from a decade of war, for research and development, and for new missions in, say, Africa.

So stubbornly are personnel costs rising that at the current rate of increase, they would consume the entire defense budget by the year 2039, leaving well-paid troops standing around with their tanks, ships and airplanes rusting and out of gas.

The problem has been evident for years -- the past two defense secretaries have called personnel costs ""unsustainable."" But neither the Obama White House nor Congress has signalled its willingness to tackle the issue by proposing bold reductions in pay and benefits -- or by deep cuts in the active-duty force.

In his confirmation hearing Thursday, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) will get a chance to weigh in on the issue as the nominee for defense secretary. He has said nothing in public on the issue, and his background gives little clue: as a successful businessman he's cognizant of the bottom line; as a former combat infantryman, his heart may make him to reluctant to touch the grunts' pay stubs.

But with deep cuts in defense spending barrelling down toward the Pentagon, some defense officials and outside experts fear that the opportunity for thoughtful reforms may be passing. Personnel costs are likely to be cut -- but perhaps not wisely. A freeze on hiring of new civilian personnel, for instance, could demolish plans to hire more mental health care providers for returning troops suffering from post-traumatic stress, even though Ash Carter, deputy defense secretary, has vowed to protect such programs ""to the extent feasible.""

Military pay and benefits ""are the third rail of budget planning in the Defense Department,"" said Gordon Adams, a defense economist who oversaw the post-Cold War defense drawdown during the Clinton administration. With no long-term budget deal in sight and no long-term planning in the works, the shrinking of the Defense Department ""will happen year by year -- more ankle-biting than systematic planning,"" Adams said.

Pentagon spending plans are getting slammed by the automatic cuts under sequestration, scheduled to take place on March 1; by the likelihood that Congress will pass no new defense spending bill, leaving the Pentagon confined, under a continuing resolution to last year's defense budget plan; and by long-term spending cuts which have yet to be made.

But the impact is real. The Pentagon has been spending money it expected from the 2013 budget proposed last year by the White House. Cranking back to conform to last year's budget levels will be painful, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said recently, requiring the Army to squeeze $6 billion out of its operations and maintenance accounts by Oct. 1. These are funds that pay for fuel, training, some family support programs and vehicle maintenance.

And while Pentagon officials have vowed not to cut family programs, a continuing resolution, rather than a new 2013 budget, will not allow the Army to move money from one operations account to another -- it all gets cut, Odierno said.

""People have been in denial about this ongoing trend, and now the accumulated impact of it is coming home,"" said Clark Murdock, a former senior planner at the Pentagon and a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

But the data is clear. Since 2001, total military compensation, including pay and benefits, grew by 20.5 percent, while comparable private-sector civilian pay did not increase at all, according to a broad Pentagon review of pay and compensation released last year. The cost of military compensation rose steeply even though the size of the active-duty force grew by only 3 percent during that period.

Part of the reason was that Congress mandated that military personnel should get an annual pay raise 1 to 1.5 percent higher than the Employment Cost Index, which measures civilian earnings.

Thus, a sergeant's base pay and housing allowance rose 20.5 percent between 2001 and 2009, when the average enlisted military member was earning $50,747 in base pay and housing -- not including other allowances and bonuses. Officer pay rose 9.1 percent, to an average of $94,700.

Congress also demanded that the Pentagon absorb a larger share of the housing costs of military families. Their housing allowance was bumped up by 5.7 percent in 2007, another 4.7 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009. Currently, the Pentagon pays all housing costs for families who live off base. Other benefits include shopping at on-base commissaries, which typically save military shoppers about 30 percent on groceries.

Base pay and housing allowance boosts the income of an Army master sergeant with 10 years of service, living at Fort Drum, N.Y., to $84,666.48 a year, according to the current Pentagon pay tables. This sergeant would pay a tax rate of 15 percent, a $6,417.40 tax advantage over civilians.

An Army captain with six years of service with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, earns $85,330.80 a year in pay and housing allowance -- not counting bonuses, tax-free danger pay for service in a war zone and other benefits. A brigadier (one-star) general at Fort Drum, with 16 years of service, is earning $131,652 a year plus a housing allowance of $2,247 per month.

""The fiscal reality facing us means that we also have to look at the growth in personnel costs which are a major driver of budget growth and are, simply put, on an unsustainable course,"" soon-to-retire Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in October 2011. Months later, the White House included in its budget proposal a timid increase of between $31 and $128 a month in the health insurance premiums paid by military retirees, unchanged since 1985. That proposal was trashed by Congress.

But in the new era of budget austerity and tough choices, that kind of congressional protection may not last.

""Our folks are worried about whether they're going to get paid, what support services aren't going to be there to help them and their families,"" said Joyce Raezer, executive director of the National Military Family Association. She defended the increases in pay and benefits by saying, ""We've been at war. We've had to pay for people to be at war.""

The inevitable cuts in defense spending could, if not managed properly, hurt military families, she said. For instance, whittling down the size of the active duty force could put more of a burden on families if the global missions the military is expected to fill aren't reduced as well. ""We are going to be an on-call force, there is going to be trouble somewhere, and if there are fewer people, the ones left will be on call more often,"" said Raezer, a long-time military spouse.

She also worries that cuts in family support programs will drive reductions in mental health services just at a time when they are most needed.

""We're not saying all these programs will be needed forever,"" said Raezer. But in all the talk about budget cuts and dwindling resources, she said, there is no thoughtful plan to reduce spending in a rational way.

""What we see coming,"" she said, ""is budget cuts first -- and then figuring out how to do with less.""

Clarification: Language has been added to clarify the calculations of base pay and allowance increases for specific members of the military. Original language in the headline and copy referring to ""Lavish Benefits"" was inaccurate and reflected neither the views of David Wood nor The Huffington Post. We regret the mischaracterization."

(CNN) – While the future of immigration reform is still in question, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight, predicted the Senate will pass the bill with 70 votes or more.

“I think we're going to have a political breakthrough, that Congress is going to pass immigration reform. I think we're going to get plus 70 votes,” he said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I've never been more optimistic about it.”



His GOP colleague in the Gang of Eight, Sen. Marco Rubio, doesn't sound quite as confident. The senator from Florida maintains the bill is almost in “perfect shape” but reiterated it needs tweaks to its border security provisions.

Meanwhile, a Democratic member of their bipartisan group, Sen. Bob Menendez, said those changes must not undermine one of the bill’s main provisions, which offers a pathway to citizenship.

The Senate voted last week to begin debate on the bill, and senators have already started filing amendments to the legislation. But the measure’s fate hangs on whether Republicans can find a solution that can win favor among enough representatives in the GOP-controlled House.

Rubio has been aggressive in stating that he may withdraw support from his own bill if the measure does not include language that would further boost border security and enforcement–a requirement for many conservatives.

The Republican senator said “95, 96% of the bill is in perfect shape and ready to go, but there are elements that need to be improved.”

“The vast majority of Americans and conservative Republicans are prepared to support immigration reform, but only if we can ensure we're not going to have another wave of illegal immigration in the future,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Menendez, however, suggested Democrats have already made big compromises, saying the bill adds $6.5 billion in funds for border security and includes senators from border states as authors of the bill. (Republican Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona are part of the Gang of Eight.)

“There are critics of our bill in which - 10 angels could come swearing from above that this is the best legislation for America, and they would say the angels lie. So, those I can never solve or satisfy,” Menendez said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The New Jersey Democrat said his party is open to changes in the border plan, but maintained he “cannot support” a requirement that the border be certified secure before undocumented immigrants are allowed to begin their pathway to citizenship.

Senators rejected such a proposal last week by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who wanted to delay the legalization process for millions until the Department of Homeland Security could certify it had effective control over the southern border for six months.

But others in the House still favor a similar effort and may pursue that as an option should the bill pass the Senate.

“We're going to have triggers that can never be achieved in terms of border security as an impediment to the pathway to legalization and citizenship,” Menendez said, fervently disagreeing with the idea.

In the end, he said, he thinks the bill will get enough votes to pass and will win over his colleagues on the other side of Capitol Hill.

“When we hit 60 votes, which we will, I have no doubt that other people will want to be on the right side of history, and that will send a very strong message to the House,” he said.

For his part, Graham cautioned that if Congress doesn't pass reform, Republicans will have little chance of taking back the White House in 2016.

""We're in a demographic death spiral as a party, and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" he said on NBC.

The caution comes as no surprise to Aaron Negherbon, whose nonprofit helps soldiers circumvent government fiscal challenges and red tape to get critical equipment to combat troops.

“I’ve been told by units that are over there, as well as units that are still stateside, that they are already feeling budget pinches as a result of the state of affairs in D.C.,” said Negherbon, TroopsDirect founder. “We’re hearing more statements that are along the lines of, ‘Our supply chains have been minimized, and we can’t get stuff in the time that we need.’”

For the past three years, Negherbon says his handful of volunteers near Oakland, Calif., have secured and expedited 60,000 pounds of vital supplies like stretchers, communications gear, protective goggles and more to infantry units and special operations forces around the globe.

But then a few weeks ago, the former real estate broker fielded a call for something never requested before: bulletproof vests.

“We need body armor,” Negherbon recalls the veteran Army sergeant saying. “He said, ‘We’re getting ready to deploy, and they are only giving us 30 of the 60 vests that we need.’ The way he laid it out to me … it was part budget and part just general policy of what the unit was going to be issued as opposed to what they needed to have issued.”

The sergeant told Negherbon 60 soldiers in his unit, which deploys to Afghanistan in early April, are route-clearing specialists assigned to eliminate roads of obstacles, primarily improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

“It’s not like they are chefs or secretaries,” Negherbon said. “They are the guys that go out there and identify and defuse the bombs.



[Related: NATO chief urges countries to halt defense cuts]

For security reasons, Negherbon declined to identify the Army sergeant who called him. But he says he verified the request with a unit commander before placing the order. Negherbon sent Yahoo News a copy of the invoice for 31 modular operator plate carriers (MOPC) by Condor. The total cost of $1,700 was relatively low because the sergeant said they already had the protective plates for the MOPCs.

Story continues

However, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon said every soldier deployed to Afghanistan is issued the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV).

“It provides for maximum protection, as the Army has conducted exhaustive testing on that system. Certainly fit for route-clearing operations,” Matthew Bourke, the spokesman, said in an email to Yahoo News.

The military is already operating on less money than planned and without an approved annual spending bill, but Bourke is adamant that his branch has no shortage of body armor or other supplies.

“That is just not accurate,” he said. Bourke did acknowledge that Special Forces troops and certain other units are provided the MOPC-style vests because some soldiers find the design lighter and more mobile.

“The MOPC is approved for wear, but does not offer the protection rates IOTVs do,” he said. “When developing body armor, protection has always been our primary concern.”

Negherbon said troops tell him the IOTV is antiquated and cumbersome.

“Like issuing a musket when a shotgun is needed,” he said.

Regardless of which vest is better, Negherbon said TroopsDirect policy has always been to go with what the boots on the ground want.

“If they ask for a certain item, that’s what we give them,” he said. “They know what is best for them.”

TroopsDirect raised $786,813 in 2011 through corporate backers, grants and individual donors. Negherbon, who drew a $43,750 salary, said 87 cents of every dollar went directly to troop-related expenses.

Troops have responded by blanketing the organization’s Facebook wall with thanks.

“Sir, I spoke with our Seabee's this past week and they wanted me to convey their greatest appreciation in the boxes of gloves and safety glasses sent to them! Truly a blessing to them so they can finish the mission!”

“Care packages are nice but they aren’t keeping us alive and our arms and legs intact like your TroopsDirect shipments are.”

Automatic budget cuts slated to begin March 1 could cost the Department of Defense a possible $46 billion through the end of September.

“Ultimately, sequestration and the continuing resolution will affect readiness and training and fleet and equipment maintenance,” wrote Bourke, the Army spokesman. “It will affect acquisition and modernizing our equipment. It's going to affect soldiers in combat. But, not soldiers that are currently there or those set to deploy in this next round. The units after that, however, will start to feel the effects.”

In the meantime, TroopsDirect expects the bulletproof vests to be ready for shipping in early March.

“We’ve never had a request like this,” Negherbon said. “But certainly for obvious reasons we are filling that order in rapid fashion.”"

Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/broad-powers-seen-for-obama-in-cyberstrikes.html,2013-02-04 00:00:00,"['David E. Sanger', 'Thom Shanker']",Broad Powers Seen for Obama in Cyberstrikes,"WASHINGTON — A secret legal review on the use of America’s growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review.

That decision is among several reached in recent months as the administration moves, in the next few weeks, to approve the nation’s first rules for how the military can defend, or retaliate, against a major cyberattack. New policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code — even if there is no declared war.

The rules will be highly classified, just as those governing drone strikes have been closely held. John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, played a central role in developing the administration’s policies regarding both drones and cyberwarfare, the two newest and most politically sensitive weapons in the American arsenal.

Cyberweaponry is the newest and perhaps most complex arms race under way. The Pentagon has created a new Cyber Command, and computer network warfare is one of the few parts of the military budget that is expected to grow. Officials said that the new cyberpolicies had been guided by a decade of evolution in counterterrorism policy, particularly on the division of authority between the military and the intelligence agencies in deploying cyberweapons. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk on the record."

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']",How Edward Snowden managed to outfox everyone,"I hate to say this. Well, maybe I don’t.

It appears that Edward Snowden, the 30-year-old computer analyst hiding in broad daylight, has managed not only to throw a wrench into U.S. foreign policy but also to outfox the very national security apparatus whose overreach he warned against.

It’s pretty astonishing that our government can figure out a way to vacuum up our every phone call, email and text message but can’t get its hands on Snowden, who left Hong Kong for Russia on Sunday, and may be there still, as he figures out how to make his way to what he has (inexplicably) described as a democratic nation for asylum.

Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham put his finger on it when he told Fox News on Sunday that “the freedom trail is not exactly China-Russia-Cuba-Venezuela.” (I guess somewhere along the line, Iceland dropped off Snowden’s list.)

In New Delhi during a three-day visit to India, Secretary of State John Kerry sarcastically called Russia and China “bastions of Internet freedom” and admonished governments that have helped or may help Snowden remain out of the grasp of American authorities.

“There would be, without any question, some effect and impact on the relationship, and consequences,” Kerry said, according to my colleague Henry Chu. “I’d urge them to live within the law. It’s in the interest of everyone.”

Still, one has to wonder why it took the government until Sunday to revoke Snowden’s passport, as the AP reported. It may not have mattered in the long run, but why wait two weeks to take that step?

When Snowden left Hong Kong, according to a detailed New York Times story posted Monday, he was allowed to pass through normal airport checkpoints, despite his annulled passport.

The story also said that Snowden decided to leave Hong Kong after attorneys there advised him that he might not be able to remain free on bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. If he were incarcerated during that time, they said, he would probably not have his computer. Giving up his computer, the attorney said, would be “totally intolerable.” (Forget waterboarding. Confiscate a 30-year-old’s computer and watch him beg for mercy.)

One also wonders why the feds revealed Friday that Snowden had been indicted on three felonies, including two charges under the 1917 Espionage Act, which made it likely, in the view of some foreign policy experts, that countries antagonistic to the United States (i.e., Cuba and Venezuela) would not be inclined to respect the State Department’s notice advising governments that Snowden should not be allowed transit to or through their countries.

In any case, as this amazing story continues, in slow motion, like a global version of the famous white Bronco chase, the Obama administration has itself to blame for this mess.

Forget the unforgivable lapses on the part of national security contractors, like Snowden’s former employer, Booz Allen Hamilton.

The sweeping nature of the spying program that Snowden revealed should never have been secret in the first place. While it’s reassuring when Keith Alexander, head of the National Security Agency, tells Congress that the program is responsible for “connecting dots” and stopping at least 50 terror plots since 9/11, it’s almost mind-boggling that the agency is just now instituting the security equivalent of the “buddy system,” designed to prevent analysts from unilaterally downloading material.

At a party in Los Angeles over the weekend, the murmured consensus among many guests with whom I chatted was “Let ‘em read my email, I have nothing to hide.” But that’s not really the issue. The American public has a right to know the broad outlines of the government’s electronic spying program, and exactly how it keeps us safe. Until Snowden provided proof of these programs’ existence to the Washington Post and the Guardian, the public — and indeed, most of Congress — had no idea of the extent of the surveillance.

Snowden’s “Where’s Waldo?” sideshow is riveting to watch, and may have unpleasant, if fleeting, implications for our relationships with the countries that have shown a willingness to help him out.

I’m not exactly sure I am cheering for his rapid repatriation, as I have mixed feelings about the charges he faces, which could get him up to 30 years in prison.

But the longer he’s out there, the more bumbling the U.S. government looks.

President Obama's advisers are also trying to tamp down concerns about the targeted killings ahead of the confirmation hearing Thursday for CIA director nominee John Brennan -- the counterterrorism adviser and drone-program supporter who has come under criticism from Democrats.

Pressed repeatedly about the complicated constitutional and legal questions raised by the targeted killing of Americans, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the president takes those issues ""very seriously.""

But he noted that Al Qaeda is in a ""state of war against us,"" and defended what he described as ""targeted strikes against specific Al Qaeda terrorists.""

""We conduct those strikes because they are necessary to mitigate ongoing actual threats, to stop plots, to prevent future attacks and to save American lives,"" Carney said. ""These strikes are legal, they are ethical and they are wise.""

Carney would not describe the legal criteria for ordering those drone strikes.

A Justice Department official, though, told Fox News there are at least three conditions that have to be met in order for a strike to be ordered -- there has to be an ""imminent"" threat, the target has to have engaged in terrorist activities, and the target has to be unable to be captured.

Separately, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the government is ""confident that we're doing so in a way that is consistent with federal and international law.""

Under Obama, the U.S. drone program has ramped up dramatically since the George W. Bush administration. It has become one of the most important tools in the administration's counterterrorism campaign -- particularly in Pakistan, but also in the expanding fronts of the war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates.

Scrutiny of the program follows a 2011 drone strike in Yemen that killed two Americans -- Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. It marked the first time an American citizen was targeted for death by a U.S. president and killed in a drone strike.

On Monday, a bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote a letter to Obama asking for ""any and all legal opinions"" that describe the basis for the authority to ""deliberately kill American citizens.""

The questions come in advance of Brennan's confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee. Several of the authors of the drone letter sit on that committee. Obama's nominee for Defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, also had his confirmation hearing last week. The letter Monday made a blunt threat suggesting that withholding information on drones could imperil those nominations.

""The executive branch's cooperation on this matter will help avoid an unnecessary confrontation that could affect the Senate's consideration of nominees for national security positions,"" the senators wrote.

As the letter was released, a Justice Department document surfaced in news reports describing the administration's drone-attack authority.

As first reported Monday night by NBC News, the memo says it is legal for the government to kill U.S. citizens abroad if it believes they are senior Al Qaeda leaders continually engaged in operations aimed at killing Americans -- even if there is no intelligence pointing to an active plot against America.

The 16-page document says that delaying action against individuals continually planning to kill Americans would create an unacceptably high risk. It adds that the threat posed by Al Qaeda and its associated forces demands a broader concept of when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat.

It's unclear whether that will satisfy lawmakers' concerns. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the intelligence committee, said in a statement Tuesday that the document was already provided to the committee last year.

""The committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the Department of Justice that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper,"" she said. Feinstein was not among the senators who signed the letter to Obama Monday.

While Awlaki was considered a powerful terror operative for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he was never charged. In their letter Monday, the senators said they believe there are ""circumstances"" where a U.S. president can use ""lethal force"" against Americans who ""choose to take up arms"" against their country, ""just as President Lincoln had the authority to direct Union troops to fire upon Confederate forces during the Civil War.""

But they said ""it is vitally important"" for Congress and the public to understand how the administration interprets the limits on that power. They complained that the administration has ignored prior requests for legal opinions from the Justice Department.

Brennan, a vocal supporter of the drone program and other controversial counterterrorism tools dating back to the George W. Bush administration, is facing a level of criticism from Democrats that no other Obama nominee has encountered. Eight Democrats and three Republicans penned the letter to Obama Monday. One of them, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has previously pressed Brennan on the drone issue.

Another, Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said last week he was ""deeply disappointed"" coming out of a meeting with Brennan. He claimed the White House counterterrorism adviser was ""unprepared"" to discuss a recent report on the CIA detention and interrogation program.

Brennan as director of the Central Intelligence Agency puts one of his closest and most powerful aides in charge of an agency that has been transformed by more than a decade of secret wars.

Working closely with the president, Mr. Brennan oversaw the escalation of drone strikes in Pakistan in 2010 and was the principal architect of the administration’s secret counterterrorism operations in Yemen. He became a prominent public spokesman for the administration, appearing on television after foiled terrorist plots and giving speeches about the legality and morality of targeted killing.

The question that now faces Mr. Brennan, if he is confirmed by the Senate, is whether the C.I.A. should remain at the center of secret American paramilitary operations — most notably drone strikes — or rebuild its traditional espionage capabilities, which intelligence veterans say have atrophied during years of terrorist manhunts.

Four years ago, Mr. Brennan bowed out of consideration as Mr. Obama’s C.I.A. director in the face of claims from some human rights advocates that he had approved — or at least failed to stop — its use of brutal interrogation methods. He denied the accusations and ended up with a consolation prize, a job as the president’s counterterrorism adviser that most assumed would have offered a much lower profile."

President announced the withdrawal in his State of the Union speech

It will reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan by about half

Reductions will continue through the end of 2014 as Afghans take responsibility for their own security

WASHINGTON -- President Obama's decision to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan by 34,000 by this time next year still gives the coalition enough muscle to support Afghan security forces as they battle through another fighting season this summer while staying on track to wrap up the combat mission in two years, military officials and analysts say.

Obama announced his plan Tuesday night during his State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress.

""Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan,"" Obama said. ""This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.""

The plan allows for leaving about 50,000 U.S. troops through November, said Mark Jacobson, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former deputy NATO civilian representative in Afghanistan. Jacobson attended a briefing Tuesday with senior White House officials. Steeper declines will come after that, leaving about 32,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan next February.

""This is not a dramatic decrease,"" Jacobson said.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement the troop withdrawal plan was based on a recommendation from Marine Gen. John Allen, who just relinquished command of coalition forces in Afghanistan.

The 34,000-troop withdrawal is the latest phase in a transition plan that the United States, Afghanistan and allies developed at recent NATO summits in Lisbon, Portugal, and Chicago.

The number of U.S. troops has already declined from a high of about 100,000 in 2010 to 66,000 now.

This year's fighting season is expected to be a critical test for Afghan security forces, who are leading most combat operations now.

""Mullah Omar has decreed that he wants to make 2013 an intense year,"" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, referring to a statement from the Taliban leader.

This year is different in that the intensity will be aimed at Afghan security forces, Dempsey said over the weekend. Afghan forces are now leading 90% of the operations and taking the bulk of the casualties.

""What really hangs in the balance now is the confidence level of the Afghan security forces and its people in them,"" Dempsey said on his way to Afghanistan to attend the change of command ceremony where Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford assumed command from Allen.

The challenge for the United States is to withdraw U.S. forces without appearing to abandon Afghanistan.

The withdrawal of troops from the Soviet Union in 1989 led to the collapse of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government by 1992, an event that casts a dark shadow over recent Afghan history.

The United States and its allies have pledged to support Afghanistan's economy and help fund its security forces after most combat forces withdraw.

The president did not provide numbers for any kind of residual force after 2014, a topic that remains subject to negotiations with Afghanistan.

But officials said America will stay engaged. The United States ""will maintain a long-term commitment to Afghanistan ­ including through the continued training and equipping of Afghan forces and counter-terrorism operations against al Qaeda and their affiliates,"" Panetta said in the statement.

The Pentagon has said the functions of U.S. forces after 2014 will center on a counter-terrorism mission focused on al-Qaeda and other global threats and advising and supporting Afghan security forces."

In the poll, 85 percent of adults surveyed said it was likely that their ""communications history, like phone calls, e-mails, and Internet use,"" was ""available for businesses, government, individuals, and other groups to access without your consent."" That was a higher percentage than believed that any other kind of private information, such as medical and financial records, is being obtained without their approval. The survey, which was conducted just before the controversy erupted over the National Security Agency's access to Verizon phone records (although not actual conversations), will be released in full on June 13.

A solid majority of Americans opposes a broad national right to same-sex marriage, saying the power to legalize gay unions should rest with the states — even as most support marriage equality for gay people, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.

On national security, Americans expressed strong skepticism about taking the lead in trying to solve overseas conflicts, but support for action against Iran if it is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon. The public continues to support the Obama administration’s use of unmanned drone aircraft; 72 percent back their use against people suspected of being terrorists, but 66 percent are concerned the drone program suffers from “not enough oversight.” The poll found mistrust of the federal government, amid national debate about whether it has grown too intrusive; in subsequent interviews, several respondents said the federal government should stay out of private lives, and one cited the recent scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, which has acknowledged targeting Tea Party conservatives, in arguing marriage should be left to the states. “The federal government is too involved in too many personal things that they don’t need to be involved in,” said Frances Narramore, 75, a retired teacher in Arizona, who calls herself an independent. “Just look at what’s happening at the I.R.S., and you see what I mean by that.”

The disclosure has reignited longstanding debates in the US over the proper extent of the government's domestic spying powers. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate intelligence committee who, along with Udell, has expressed concern about the extent of US government surveillance, warned of ""sweeping, dragnet surveillance"". He said: ""I am barred by Senate rules from commenting on some of the details at this time, However, I believe that when law-abiding Americans call their friends, who they call, when they call, and where they call from is private information. ""Collecting this data about every single phone call that every American makes every day would be a massive invasion of Americans' privacy.""

By far the most disingenuous, however, was Jim Sensenbrenner, who (as he has emphasized to the credulous journalists who served as his stenographers today) wrote the PATRIOT Act, who has remained in a senior position on House Judiciary Committee since that day, and who now claims to be shocked — shocked! — there is dragnet collection going on in the casino he built.

Overturn DOMA, they say, but leave it up to the states. More, same poll:Let's hear from the Guardian , which broke the original story:What needs to come out of this is a debate about the Patriot Act. And if you don't know who Glenn Greenwald is by now, you should.Another person to follow for explanation and context is Marcy Wheeler Fair warning: ZOMG! She's a blogger!

Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a director at the New America Foundation and the author of “Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden – From 9/11 to Abbottabad,” the basis for the HBO documentary “Manhunt” that will be shown on CNN at 9 p.m. ET Monday.

(CNN) —

In the past few weeks, we’ve seen a British soldier hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London and bombers blowing up spectators at the Boston Marathon.

On the surface, terrorism is alive and well.

So how should the United States react to these continuing threats?

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

For the first time on Thursday, President Obama laid out the full scope of his proposed counterterrorism strategy, and it boiled down to this: George W. Bush’s endless war on terror is over.

And that’s appropriate, since the enemy Bush went to war with after September 11 has largely been defeated.

Obama’s speech at the National Defense University in Washington was designed to lay the political groundwork to wind down America’s longest war, the war that began when al Qaeda destroyed the World Trade Center and a wing of the Pentagon 12 years ago.

Thursday’s speech was the first time Obama had delivered an overarching framework for how to conceptualize the conflict that has defined U.S. national security policy since 9/11.

Other speeches by Obama have focused on aspects of that conflict, such as Guantanamo and the Afghan war. But no speech has made such an expansive examination of the war against al Qaeda and its allies in all its manifestations, from drone strikes to detention policies to a clear-eyed assessment of the scope of the threats posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as by those “homegrown” extremists who attacked the Boston Marathon in April.

Much of the coverage of the speech has centered on the measures the president outlined to impose greater constraints on CIA drone strikes and to try to hasten the eventual closing of Guantanamo.

But the most significant aspect of the speech was the president’s case that the “perpetual wartime footing” and “boundless war on terror” that has permeated so much of American life since 9/11 should come to an end.

Obama argued that the time has come to redefine the kind of conflict that the United States is engaged in: “We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.”

This is why the president focused part of his speech on a discussion of the seemingly arcane Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and its Taliban allies.

Few, if any, in Congress who voted for the authorization understood at the time that they were voting for a virtual blank check that has provided the legal basis for more than a decade of war. It is a war that has expanded in recent years to other countries in the Middle East and Africa, such as Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. has engaged in covert military operations against al Qaeda-affiliated groups.

Theoretically, when U.S. combat troops finally withdraw from Afghanistan in December 2014, the authorization should simply expire, and the nation will no longer be at war. After all, once combat operations are over in Afghanistan, why would you want to keep in place an authorization for a permanent war?

However, there are now some in Congress who would like to expand the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force beyond its present parameters to include military operations against terrorist groups that were not involved in the 9/11 attacks, which could prolong America’s wars indefinitely and add additional terrorist groups to the United States’ list of enemies it is at war with.

U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ranking member of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for instance, last month called for an expansion of the scope of the authorization.

Obama made it quite clear in his Thursday speech that he would oppose such an expansion, saying he hopes instead to “ultimately repeal the AUMF’s mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further.”

In short, Obama intends to end a seemingly endless war.

That’s because, according to Obama, “the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us.”

On Thursday, Obama asserted (in my view, correctly) that what remains of the terrorist threat, while significant and persistent, is nothing on the scale of the al Qaeda organization that launched the 9/11 operation and instead consists of “less capable al Qaeda affiliates, threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, homegrown extremists.”

These threats, the president further asserted, can be managed by carefully targeted drone strikes overseas and efforts to counter extremist ideology at home and do not require some kind of broader war.

Obama is also looking to his legacy and the presidents who will follow him and is trying to begin to create the public consensus and legal framework that will help to ensure that the United States isn’t “drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states.”

Obama clearly hopes to leave office in 2016 as the commander in chief who finally ended America’s longest war.

Jan Brewer Talks Border Security Issues Ignored by Senate Immigration Bill,"The “Gang of” 8 grand immigration proposal, over 800 pages, is written by members of the same body that has failed to address the problem of meaningful immigration reform for over 30 years.

Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wanted the 92 other members to join in this important debate. In the House of Representatives in particular, the silence of the GOP leadership is deafening.

Look at what is missing in this process: transparency; experts on many aspects of immigration reform; and law enforcement agencies involved in dealing with the problems on the ground. The GOP-led House of Representatives has promised regular order. How much transparency we will see from the Senate is undetermined. Most of all, valuable input from relevant Governors are left out of the equation.

A transparent public discussion is required. In 1986 we had outright amnesty and the promised enforcement of a secure border. Lack of promised enforcement by Democrats got us to this point with a significantly larger problem. Are we creating de facto amnesty again with a rushed comprehensive bill over incremental and combined approaches to the problem?

With America’s burgeoning Hispanic population–the largest block of illegal immigrants–more emphasis seems to be placed on who will vote en masse for which party over necessary solutions for the long-term future of this country. It is a bitter pill to take, with the term “lawful presence” in its prescription.

The recent terror attacks in Boston renewed calls from both Republicans and Democrats in the “Gang of 8” for immediate immigration reform. Border security is key, as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer recently stated in my American Forum.

Governor Brewer made the case for working with residents that live along the border, state police, sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies. There is also the issue of sending the National Guard for additional resources.

This is not a numbers issue; it is a human issue. We have citizens in constant danger along our southern border. There are areas where a fence is necessary and could prove to be effective. The Obama Administration restricts border patrol activity on federal lands, and the cartels, human traffickers, illegal aliens who break our law by crossing the southern border are not known for their obedience to the law. They cross onto federal land with impunity, and the proper authorities are not allowed to pursue.

The “Gang of 8” proposal so far leaves more questions to be answered than solutions offered. Solutions must include standards, methods to achieve those standards, and metrics to measure their effectiveness. Long-term concerns, such as those expressed by Governor Brewer, much less solutions, are largely cast aside."

In a 2010 audience Q&A about his (then) new book on Barack Obama, Remnick confessed that what he saw among the everyday moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers who populate the Tea Party is an entity motivated mostly by fear and race:

When you hear people in the Tea Party movement saying, ‘I want my country back, I’ve lost my country,’ something is being said there, very often, that has to do with race. It has to do with otherness. It has to do with a nostalgia for an imagined America some time ago.

As I write this, Remnick is being celebrated all throughout the elite media for his morally illiterate New Yorker article that biographies Boston Marathon suspects, Tamerlan and Dzohokhar Tsarnaev. So impressed is the elite media, that George Stephanopoulos has invited Remnick to appear on “This Week” Sunday.

If you are naively wondering why all this is happening, here is what I wrote earlier today:

Much of this is and will be motivated by the left’s bizarre desire to forever rationalize radical Islam. For some reason, Islamists are the only racist, sexist, homophobic theocrats the media can’t summon outrage against. I suspect it is also the result of industry-wide disappointment over the fact that the bad guys aren’t right-wingers. (Would Remnick have summoned such eloquence for the savage second coming of McVeigh? Would the media be gushing over it?)

So what we have here is the media still looking for a way to blame the most inviting and inclusive country in the world for not being inviting and inclusive enough.

The same media that sees only evil in the peaceful Tea Party just can’t bring itself to see evil in the kind of terrorism they can’t exploit against the Tea Party or any of their enemies on the right.

The media will bend over backwards to shroud monstrous terrorism in lofty nuance.

You and I, though, are just monsters.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

USA TODAY

People are jumpy these days.

Social media and the stock market went wild, briefly, on Tuesday when this (hacked) Associated Press tweet appeared around 1 p.m.: ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.""

The AP took down its Twitter account and quickly announced it had been hacked.

The FBI is investigating the incident, said bureau spokeswoman Jenny Shearer.

Rest assured, there was no attack on the White House — and aides reported that President Obama was busy at work.

""The president is fine,"" spokesman Jay Carney said. ""I was just with him.""

A group of hackers loyal to embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad claimed responsibility for the hoax, tweeting out: ""Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.""

The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 128 points in seconds after the report. It recovered just as quickly when the report was found to be false.

The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on the incident, as did the New York Stock Exchange.

The incident took place eight days after the Boston Marathon bombings.

In a statement, the Associated Press said, ""The AP twitter account has been hacked. A tweet about an attack at the White House is false. We will advise on acct. status.""

The AP confirmed that its Twitter account has been suspended, and ""it was working to correct the issue.""

(Note: This tweet drew instant suspicion from journalists. The Associated Press style is to never refer to ""Barack Obama."" It is always ""President Barack Obama."" The service also normally capitalizes the word ""BREAKING"" when news happens.)

The wire service said its mobile Twitter account was also broken into, and all of its accounts have been shut down.

The data collection is not just restricted to terrorism suspects but “people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks.”

According to officials who are familiar with these classified rulings, the court has expanded it’s role while assessing “broad constitutional questions” and establishing judicial precedents without any public scrutiny. Some rulings are over 100 pages long.

The role of the FISA court has changed over the years, originally approving case by case wiretaps. In 2007, with greater judicial oversight of intelligence operations and other legislation, the FISA court “has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court, serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come, the officials said.”

In particular the court has expanded the NSA’s surveillance authority under a legal principle called the “special needs” doctrine which allows, in cases of terrorism, “an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures.” This doctrine was originally established by the Supreme Court in 1989 when it found that a minimal invasion of privacy is acceptable in order for the government to combat an “overriding” public danger. FISA judges have used this more broadly to allow collecting communications data to track terrorism suspects that “does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.”

William C. Banks, a national security law expert said “It seems like a legal stretch. It’s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data.”

In one instance, intelligence officials were allowed to access an email attachment that was sent within in the United States because there was suspicion that it contained the schematics of diagram that could have been connected to Iran’s nuclear program.

But this example of domestic surveillance is permissible because a 2008 law expanded the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include “weapons of mass destruction.” And other secret findings have “eased access to data on espionage, cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence.”

“The definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ is very broad,” another former intelligence official said in an interview. “An espionage target, a nuclear proliferation target, that all falls within FISA, and the court has signed off on that.”

In an interview with the New York Times, “current and former national security officials, discussed the court’s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified. Judges on the FISA court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions.”

The FISA Court only hears one side of the cases that come before it (the government’s side) and findings are almost never made public. There is a “Court of Review” in case of appeal, but that has only happened “a handful of times in the court’s history, and no case has ever been taken to the Supreme Court.”

It may not even be possible for the communications companies who are turning over information to the government have a right to appear before the FISA court.

The FISA court was created by Congress in 1978 in order to serve as a check on wiretap abuses by the government. There are 11 judges who serve in 7 year shifts, ten were nominated by Chief Justice John Roberts. Last year the courts heard nearly 1800 cases and according to sources no requests were denied.

FISA judges have had to “intervene repeatedly” when “Internet and phone companies…have raised concerns that the government is overreaching in its demands for records or when the government itself reports that it has inadvertently collected more data than was authorized, the officials said.”

The court has ordered the the NSA to destroy communications records when information has been collected improperly. According to the New York Times’ sources,

The judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of “metadata” — facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed, but not the content of conversations — does not violate the Fourth Amendment, as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American’s communications.

In 2008, Congress passed new procedures in the FISA Amendment acts where “the collection of metadata must be considered “relevant” to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities.” The courts hae indicated that while individual pieces of data may not appear relevant, “the total picture that the bits of data create may in fact be relevant.”

When pressed about informing the public about these issues, there has been push back. Reggie Walton, the FISA court’s presiding judge, said there could be a potential benefit but there are “serious obstacles.” General Alexander, the NSA director responded in a public Senate hearing in June “I don’t want to jeopardize the security of Americans by making a mistake in saying, ‘Yes, we’re going to do all that.’ ” Alexander pledged to try and make decisions more public."

AFL-CIO%2C U.S. Chamber accord would create W-Visa

Bipartisan groups in Senate and House have been writing own bills

Program would start granting visas in April 2015 and expand each year

WASHINGTON — Key senators welcomed an agreement Sunday by business and labor that would remove a large hurdle to a major immigration overhaul, but they cautioned that much work remains to be done and that no final deal has been reached.

The compromise between officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO would create a ""W-Visa"" program that would bring in up to 200,000 foreign workers a year to do janitorial, hospitality and construction work.

As outlined Saturday by the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor union, the plan would establish a Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research to make recommendations on changes to the number of visas for low-skilled workers the country gives out each year.

The accord addresses one of the biggest issues facing legislators negotiating a sweeping immigration bill that would legalize the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants, strengthen border security and change the way the United States grants visas.

""We have created a new model, a modern visa system that includes both a bureau to collect and analyze labor market data, as well as significant worker protections,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""We expect that this new program, which benefits not just business, but everyone, will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs.""

Bipartisan groups in the Senate and House who have been writing their own bills are hurrying to file their bills in early April, and President Obama has supported their efforts to move quickly on the complicated topic.

The group of senators negotiating an immigration bill, known as the Gang of 8, had asked business and labor to forge a compromise on this issue but has not officially signed off on the agreement.

""This issue has always been the deal breaker on immigration reform, but not this time,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has been involved in the current immigration deal and several failed efforts in the past.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Gang of 8, said Sunday he was encouraged by the agreement but called it simply a starting point in the long legislative process that lies ahead.

""We will need a healthy public debate that includes committee hearings and the opportunity for other senators to improve our legislation with their own amendments,"" Rubio said in a statement.

""We haven't signed off,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

""There are a few details yet. But conceptually, we have an agreement between business and labor, between ourselves that has to be drafted,"" he said.

One of the biggest sticking points in the talks has been how much the foreign workers would be paid. Labor officials have been fearful that low salaries paid to the foreign workers would bring down wages for American workers.

Ava Avendaño, the AFL-CIO's director of immigration and community action, said the two sides agreed that the foreign workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage, or the actual wages paid by the employer to other workers with similar experience and qualifications.

The W-Visa Program would start April 1, 2015, and grant 20,000 visas in the first year. That would increase to 35,000 available visas in the second year, 55,000 visas in the third year and 75,000 in the fourth, Avendaño said. After that, the program would grow, or shrink, based on recommendations of the newly created immigration bureau.

The deal ensures that small businesses have access to the workers and limits the number of W-Visas that can be granted to construction companies.

Once granted a W-Visa, workers would be able to switch between U.S. employers — a possibility that does not exist under current law — and stay in the USA year-round. They would also be able to apply for legal permanent residence, or green cards, on their own. Current law requires employers to do that on their behalf.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that supports an immigration plan that would legalize the nation's undocumented immigrants, called the agreement a ""historic breakthrough"" that significantly increases the likelihood of an immigration plan passing Congress.

According to a transcript of that proceeding, a magistrate at Tsarnaev’s hospital bedside read him the Miranda warning, informing him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. But among the things we don’t know is if, or to what extent, Tsarnaev was interrogated before being informed of his rights.

Over the weekend, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. gave every indication that he intended to have Tsarnaev questioned without the Miranda warning. We have to hope that didn’t happen. The Constitution is not like a deck chair, to be brought out in good weather and then put away and ignored when the seas get rough. Tsarnaev is entitled to the same constitutional protections as any other criminal defendant.

The Constitution provides protections to all those accused of crime, including the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to counsel, the right to a speedy trial in front of a jury, and the right to have guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

There is no exception in the Constitution, or ever recognized by the Supreme Court, for especially horrible crimes or for ones that can be labeled terrorism.

But that never seems to stop officials from looking for exceptions during crises. In addition to Holder’s remarks, Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham called over the weekend for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant and tried in a military tribunal, an idea that was fortunately rejected.

Since 9/11 there has been a debate, still unresolved, as to what constitutional protections apply to those apprehended in foreign countries and held as enemy combatants. But there is no doubt that a crime in the United States must be investigated and prosecuted in accord with the Constitution.

This is not the first crime of terrorism in an American city. The anarchists of the early 20th century, the attackers in the first World Trade Center bombing and Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who were convicted of the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, to mention a few, were prosecuted and tried in compliance with the Constitution.

It is striking that in all of these instances, the government succeeded in gaining convictions in courts. In other words, complying with the Constitution is not an obstacle to successful law enforcement. The federal judiciary, and likewise state courts, have shown repeatedly that they are capable of handling such cases. And even if complying with the Constitution were to make prosecution more difficult, that would not be a sufficient reason for suspending it.

Holder said on the Sunday talk shows that the government intended to invoke the “public safety exception” that allows suspects to be questioned without being given Miranda warnings in emergency circumstances. But this exception does not apply here because there was no emergency threat facing law enforcement.

The emergency exception to Miranda that Holder embraced was announced by the Supreme Court in New York vs. Quarles in 1984. A woman told the police that she had been raped by a man with a gun. When the police caught the suspect in a grocery store, they saw an empty holster and no gun. The man was asked about the location of the gun, and he told the officer where to find it.

The Supreme Court ruled that, although the suspect had not yet been given Miranda warnings, the statement about the gun was admissible against him because of the urgent need to find the gun. In other words, the public safety exception applies only when police are acting in an emergency to prevent serious immediate harm. If the police needed to question Tsarnaev as to the location of other bombs, the emergency exception would apply.

But Holder has said that no such threat exists. It appears then that the attorney general’s intention to allow questioning of Tsarnaev without reading him his rights would violate Tsarnaev’s 5th Amendment rights. That could well mean that any incriminating statement he were to make would be excluded from use as evidence.

And what about the idea advanced by McCain and Graham that Tsarnaev should be treated as an enemy combatant and prosecuted in military courts? It’s unlikely we’ve heard the last of it.

But the Constitution does not — and should not — permit trying American civilians in military tribunals. A verdict from a military tribunal, no matter how fair the proceedings, never would have the credibility of a conviction from a federal court. More important, there is no stopping point to the erosion of the Constitution; why couldn’t any crime that caused significant loss of life be deemed an act of terror and the suspect denied constitutional protection?

Throughout American history, whenever there has been a serious threat, people have proposed abridging civil liberties. When that has happened, it has never been shown to have made the country safer. These mistakes should not be repeated. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be investigated, prosecuted and tried in accord with the U.S. Constitution.

Senate Republicans block vote on Hagel nomination

Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Chuck Hagel’s nomination as secretary of defense on Thursday, launching an unprecedented filibuster and a severe rebuke to the White House.

Falling one vote shy of the 60 needed to move forward on the nomination, the Hagel filibuster brought stark condemnations from President Obama and Senate Democrats for its precedent-setting nature -- the first time a defense secretary nominee had been filibustered. The setback came during what many believe is a critical period for the Pentagon as it winds down troops from Afghanistan and implements costly budget cuts.

It was also a hard slap to a former colleague and member of the chamber.

Asked about the Senate vote during an online “fireside hangout,” Obama said that he expects that Hagel will be confirmed. But he slammed Senate Republicans for their “unprecedented filibuster” of a defense chief nominee.

“What seems to be happening, and this has been growing over time, is the Republican minority in the Senate seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything,” Obama said. “Well, that’s not the rule.”

He added that “it’s just unfortunate that this kind of politics intrudes at a time when I’m still presiding over a war in Afghanistan and I need a secretary of defense who is coordinating with our allies” on U.S. strategy in the region.

Republicans predicted they would relent to a simple majority vote, guaranteeing confirmation, later this month -- but only if they see more information about Hagel’s post-Senate foreign policy speeches and his work in private investment groups. Senior Republicans initially scoffed at those demands, first raised by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), as unnecessary, but now party leaders hold them up as the main cause for delay.

Even if Hagel is eventually confirmed, the process marked another escalation in long-running nomination wars dating to the 1980s, now crossing into an area that has long been the most bipartisan on Capitol Hill: national security.

The Hagel fight also demonstrated the Republican fixation on the events surrounding the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya that killed four American diplomats. GOP senators have clung to the tragedy as cause for holding Hagel’s nomination hostage in exchange for more details about the attack.

Such demands are commonplace in the Senate but are usually reserved for lower-level Cabinet posts or for deputy-secretary positions, not for the person who is in charge of overseeing more than 2 million service members — 66,000 of them in battle in Afghanistan.

“This isn’t high school, getting ready for a football game or some play that’s being produced at high school,” Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said during an angry floor speech Thursday morning. “This is - we’re trying to confirm somebody to run the defense of our country, the military of our country.”

The final tally Thursday was 58 votes to end the filibuster to 40 against, but actually 59 backed Hagel because Reid changed his vote to no so that he could use parliamentary rules to quickly reconsider the nomination when the Senate returns from its Presidents Day break Feb 25.

Reid called for the vote Thursday, despite pleas by several Republican senators to delay the vote until after the holiday recess. By calling the vote, Reid set up the Senate to block President Obama’s choice to lead the Pentagon, a stinging slap at a former colleague and member of that chamber.

Reid had initially called for a vote on Friday -- which Democrats and Republicans then agreed should be sped up to Thursday -- to highlight what Reid sees as unprecedented Republican obstruction. Democrats said the Republican push for a delay, even a brief one, was designed to allow more time to bloody the nominee and that, in fact, the GOP will never be satisfied with the amount of information released about Hagel.

Democrats said they also pressed ahead with a vote to fill the Cabinet position quickly, as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta steps down and heads to California. But Democrats conceded that if Hagel is blocked, they will try again after the recess.

“If we don’t bring it to an end today, then there will be another vote a week from Tuesday,” Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the armed services committee, said before the vote. But, he added, “the world is too dangerous to have this period of uncertainty.”

Earlier Thursday, Reid announced that Republicans had secured enough votes to mount a filibuster on the confirmation.

But a number of Republicans who believe it is bad precedent for a defense secretary nominee to face a 60-vote threshold said they would be willing to vote to end debate on the nomination if the White House provided further answers to several lingering questions.

Democrats can return to the issue after next week’s recess, when a number of leading Republicans have said they will vote to close off debate, allowing the Senate to move ahead to an up-or-down vote on the nomination, requiring only 51 votes for confirmation.

“I think that during the break is sufficient time to get any additional questions answered,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said before the vote Thursday. “And I will vote for cloture on the day we get back, and I believe that enough of my colleagues would do the same,”

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told reporters that cutting off debate is “premature.”

“When we come back from the recess 10 days from now, senators should have had sufficient time to consider Senator Hagel’s nomination, and I will vote to have an up-or-down vote,” Alexander said. “I know of many of my colleagues who think that’s enough time. It would be better for the institution and the country if we had enough time to consider Senator Hagel and then have an up-or-down vote, so we don’t get into a habit of making it look like we’re suing the filibuster to block Cabinet nominees. That’s not the case here.”

Earlier in the day, Democratic aides confirmed that senior Republicans told them late Wednesday that GOP leaders had at least 41 Republicans to block the planned Friday vote. A senior GOP aide confirmed that some Republicans who had publicly opposed filibustering what has traditionally been a key national security post with bipartisan support were now withholding their votes for answers from the White House.

“The members still await the information they want,” the senior aide said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s leadership team deliberations.

Speaking immediately after Reid in the morning, McConnell (R-Ky.) ignored mentioning a filibuster and instead focused his remarks on the automatic spending cuts set to hit March 1 — which will include $46 billion slashed from the Pentagon’s 2013 budget.

Leading Republicans, including McCain, have said they would drop the filibuster effort if the White House gives them more information about the actions President Obama took during an eight-hour siege at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11. The attack killed the U.S. ambassador to the country and three other Americans.

Democrats, however, have suggested that Republicans are only focusing on Benghazi to slow the confirmation process so that Hagel — known for a mercurial temperament and as an impulsive decision-maker in the past — would withdraw his nomination.

A spokesman for Hagel suggested he would stay and fight, as did a spokesman for the president, who was flying to a domestic policy event in Georgia.

“We urge the Republicans in the Senate to drop their delay,” Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said. “There is a clear majority in the United States Senate for senator Hagel’s confirmation. These delaying tactics are unconscionable, and they should end right away.”

White House counsel Kathryn H. Ruemmler sent McCain a letter Thursday that largely reiterated the facts found by an accountability review board that examined the Benghazi attack. She added that then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was in contact with the Libyan leadership during the attack “to coordinate additional support to protect Americans” there, noting that Obama called the Libyan president the next day to discuss the security situation in the area.

“We continue to urge the full Senate to act swiftly and confirm senator Hagel,” Ruemmeler wrote.

McCain said Thursday that he was satisfied by the White House response to his question but that he believes other senators still have pending inquiries.

“We are working on and having negotiations now, trying to smooth this thing out and get it done,” McCain said. “I have said all along that we had to have the concerns of senators addressed. I’m hopeful that we can get those concerns addressed and still move forward with a 51-vote vote, because we have never required 60 votes on a secretary of defense.”

On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Reid warned forebodingly that if Hagel was not confirmed Friday, the Pentagon would be without an official leader.

“In less than two hours, our country will be without a secretary of defense,” Reid said. “It’s shocking that my Republican colleagues would leave the nation without a fully empowered secretary of defense.”

The Pentagon says otherwise. Defense Secretary Panetta “believes Senator Hagel should be confirmed as quickly as possible, and plans to stay in office until he is confirmed,” Pentagon spokesman George Little said.

Panetta did little to hide his frustration Thursday about Hagel’s embattled nomination. Hosting former secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the Pentagon for what Panetta had hoped would be his last day on the job, he said he was counting the days until he flies home to California— for good.

After calling Clinton’s visit a “great Valentine’s Day present for all of us here,” Panetta joked that there was one more item on his wish list.

“The second-best Valentine’s present would be to allow Sylvia and I to get the hell out of town at the end of the day,” Panetta said, referring to his wife. “I feel like it’s “Groundhog Day” around here.”

During his time on the Senate floor Thursday, Reid slammed Republicans for demanding more information on Benghazi from Hagel and the White House, calling claims that Hagel had not been forthcoming in his testimony during his confirmation hearing “outlandish.”

Sanger', 'Thom Shanker']",Broad Powers Seen for Obama in Cyberstrikes,"WASHINGTON — A secret legal review on the use of America’s growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review.

That decision is among several reached in recent months as the administration moves, in the next few weeks, to approve the nation’s first rules for how the military can defend, or retaliate, against a major cyberattack. New policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code — even if there is no declared war.

The rules will be highly classified, just as those governing drone strikes have been closely held. John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, played a central role in developing the administration’s policies regarding both drones and cyberwarfare, the two newest and most politically sensitive weapons in the American arsenal.

Cyberweaponry is the newest and perhaps most complex arms race under way. The Pentagon has created a new Cyber Command, and computer network warfare is one of the few parts of the military budget that is expected to grow. Officials said that the new cyberpolicies had been guided by a decade of evolution in counterterrorism policy, particularly on the division of authority between the military and the intelligence agencies in deploying cyberweapons. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk on the record."

Carter']","Lawmaker: If CNN can interview Benghazi suspect, why can't FBI?","Story highlights Rep. Jason Chaffetz wants to know why the FBI hasn't interviewed Ahmed Abu Khattala Some have described Khattala as the ringleader of the attack on the consulate Khattala tells CNN that no American or Libyan official has asked to speak to him He denies he had any role in the attack the left ambassador, three other Americans dead

(CNN) —

A Republican lawmaker demanded Wednesday to know why investigators have not captured or killed any of the suspects in the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, pointing out that CNN was able to find a man who some say was the ringleader in the assault that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead.

Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration’s inquiry into the September 11, 2012, attacks in Libya has been “simply unacceptable,” according to a draft letter obtained by CNN.

“One of the pertinent questions today is why we have not captured or killed the terrorist who committed these attacks?” Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told reporters. “News out today that CNN was able to go in and talk to one of the suspected terrorists, how come the military hasn’t been able to get after them and capture or kill the people? How come the FBI isn’t doing this and yet CNN is?”

Chaffetz was referring to CNN’s recent interview with Ahmed Abu Khattala, who Libyan and U.S. officials have described as the Benghazi leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated militia group Ansar al-Sharia – one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi.

He has been described as a “person of interest” in the investigation, according to officials.

In that interview, Khattala told CNN’s Arwa Damon that he had not been contacted by any Libyan or American officials.

House panel subpoenas State Department over Benghazi

“Even the investigative team did not try to contact me,” he told Damon, referring to the FBI.

When asked whether he would be willing to meet with investigators if they asked, Khattala said: “Yes, no problem. …But not as an interrogation, as a conversation like the one we are having right now.”

Damon spent two hours interviewing Khattala at a coffee shop at a well-known hotel in Benghazi, describing his demeanor as fairly relaxed. He allowed Damon to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation, but refused to appear on camera.

Khattala’s narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and, at times, seemed to be contradictory, Damon said.

He admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack, but denied any involvement in the violence.

When he arrived at the perimeter of the compound, Khattala said he saw men carrying RPGs and medium guns, but that gunfire prevented him from getting close and entering the compound.

Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless

Khattala said by the time he managed to get inside the compound, everyone had withdrawn. He said he did not see any fires.

Asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack, Khattala and two of the men he brought with him to the interview “burst out laughing,” Damon said.

Khattala does not appear to be a man who is in hiding, having granted interviews to The New York Times, Reuters and other news agencies in the weeks following the Benghazi attack.

“Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Comey, who will replace Robert Mueller as FBI director in September.

“The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don’t know more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave Americans. “

The FBI did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the letter.

The letter was initiated by Chaffetz and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of the fiercest critics of the administration’s Benghazi response.

Others who agreed to sign the letter included Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. On the House side, Darrell Issa, the chairman of the committee leading the House Benghazi investigation, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio signed the letter.

In the letter, the lawmakers wrote: “We encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi. We owe the families of those killed, and the people of this nation, answers to who was responsible and ensure they are held accountable.”

The attack at the Benghazi diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election.

White House releases Benghazi e-mails

The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances – later proved untrue – that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States.

The White House and its allies in Congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the “fog of war,” not any deliberate effort to mislead the public.

Lawmakers Push to Hold Boston Suspect as Enemy Combatant,"Beyond the absence of known links between Mr. Tsarnaev and Al Qaeda, it is also unclear whether the Constitution permits the government to hold citizens arrested on domestic soil as enemy combatants. Though Mr. Graham believes that it would be lawful, other lawmakers disagree. Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has resolved the question.

During the Bush administration, the Supreme Court upheld the indefinite military detention of Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen who was captured carrying a weapon on the Afghanistan battlefield.

But the court never resolved the case of another American, Jose Padilla, whom the Bush administration held as an enemy combatant for several years after his arrest in Chicago. Two different federal appeals courts disagreed about whether it was lawful to hold someone like Mr. Padilla in indefinite detention without trial, and the Bush administration transferred him back to the civilian court system before the Supreme Court took up the case.

In the Hamdi ruling, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote “there is no bar to this nation’s holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.” But she also wrote the decision was limited to Mr. Hamdi’s “narrow circumstances.” She also said the purpose of wartime detention was to keep captured enemies from returning to fight, adding, “Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.”

Mr. Graham said the purpose of holding Mr. Tsarnaev as a military detainee would be to question him at length without any lawyer. Though the Obama administration has said it would use a public-safety exception to the Miranda rule to question him for a period without warning him of his rights to remain silent and have a lawyer, Mr. Graham said that would at best gain only a few days before a lawyer intervened.

Mr. Graham also acknowledged that ultimately Mr. Tsarnaev must be transferred back to the civilian criminal justice system for prosecution, because the statute authorizing military commissions — which he helped write — does not apply to United States citizens. Mr. Graham, one of the leading Republican voices opposing the torture of terrorism suspects, emphasized that interrogation as an enemy combatant would not mean inflicting suffering on Mr. Tsarnaev in order to make him talk, and that anything he said in military detention should not be used as courtroom evidence.

But Mr. Graham rejected the view that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might be equally or more effective than intelligence officials at persuading Mr. Tsarnaev to provide information, even with a defense lawyer at his side, since the law enforcement officials would have the leverage of being able to float more favorable treatment in exchange for cooperation as part of a potential plea bargain. He said interrogators needed to build a rapport with a prisoner, suggesting that any presence of a lawyer would disrupt that dynamic.

“That is, to me, the dumbest way to induce someone to talk,” he said of such tools and tactics of law enforcement officials. “I want intelligence officials trained in the intelligence process to have a chance to talk to him, without a lawyer.”"

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']","David Ignatius: Snowden exposed policies approved by Congress, courts","Journalists have a professional commitment to the idea that more debate is better, so we instinctively side with leakers. But I’m skeptical about some of the claims of Edward Snowden, the young National Security Agency contractor who leaked secrets about that agency’s surveillance programs to The Post and the Guardian.

Snowden has described his actions in idealistic terms. “I’m willing to sacrifice . . . because I can’t in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. But it’s hard for me to see him as a hero.

What worries me is that Snowden is challenging the rule of law. The NSA Internet surveillance program he decided to reveal is legal, in the sense that it was passed by both houses of Congress and is reviewed regularly by the intelligence committees. It is overseen by judges who sit on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. In 2008, that court ruled against a company that challenged the law.

Perhaps Snowden would argue that Congress and the courts ­haven’t been aggressive or diligent enough in their oversight, and that the NSA has dangerously misused its surveillance authority. Or maybe he would argue that he’s answering to a higher moral code, or that Congress and the courts are wrongly interpreting the Constitution. These claims will be tested in the coming debate, but we should be wary about endorsing any contention that it’s okay to violate laws because you’re acting on higher authority.

Snowden’s case is similar to that of CIA dissident Philip Agee. He published a revelatory memoir in 1975 called “Inside the Company: CIA Diary,” which outed the names and code names of scores of operatives with whom Agee had worked. He wrote in the introduction: “When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After 12 years with the agency, I finally understood how much suffering it was causing. . . . I couldn’t sit by and do nothing.” Agee died in 2008 in Cuba, where he had sought refuge.

The CIA claimed at the time that it had suffered great damage from Agee’s revelations, but it’s still very much in business. Indeed, you could argue that the agency is far more aggressive and willing to use deadly force today than Agee ever envisioned. In that sense, we should be skeptical both of the efficacy of whistleblowers and of claims that unauthorized disclosures (as by Agee, or now Snowden) will cause irreparable harm. Usually these turn out to be overstated.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence who oversees the NSA, argued last weekend that Snowden made “reckless” disclosures about its monitoring of foreign Internet communications, and that “potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm” could come from the revelation of a court order authorizing collection of telephone call data from Verizon. Congress and the courts will examine such claims, but how should we as citizens evaluate them?

My guess is that Clapper is correct when he implicitly argues that these electronic surveillance programs are the United States’ best tool in combating terrorism. It’s probably also true that each revelation of U.S. capabilities weakens this advantage by putting adversaries such as al-Qaeda on notice about our snooping capabilities. The revelations likely make it harder, as well, for U.S. corporations and foreign allies to cooperate.

For evidence of how al-Qaeda goes to school on leaks about surveillance techniques, just read the collected messages of Osama bin Laden that were taken from his hideout in Abbottabad when he was killed May 2, 2011. He admonished his aides how to avoid U.S. overhead surveillance (“move only when the clouds are heavy”) and money-laundering surveillance (“get rid of the bag that the money was in because it might have a chip”).

What bin Laden understood best was the need to avoid NSA monitoring of his telephone and Internet communications. He went dark, communicating only by courier. That’s how he remained hidden in plain sight for five years: He didn’t leave any digital tracks.

Some might argue that the bin Laden case shows that the NSA’s efforts are futile; the terrorists have gotten too smart for us. But intelligence collection relies on the human fact that even smart people do stupid things; they forget how powerful and pervasive the U.S. systems are. That’s why these surveillance programs remain valuable.

The United States went security-mad after Sept. 11, 2001, in ways that harmed the country. But these excesses led Congress to restructure surveillance programs so that they were lawful and controlled. These lawful programs were the ones Snowden unilaterally disclosed.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was hit with the charges in an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department late Thursday. The terror suspect's capture and prosecution in federal court -- all of which was first revealed to the public Thursday -- caught lawmakers by surprise.

Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, said Thursday the Obama administration's decision to bring Abu Ghaith to court in New York City is wrong, ""sneaky"" and against the will of Congress. While foes of using Guantanamo to hold suspects say detainees there are afforded fewer legal rights, supporters say they can yield more information while held in the military facility.

Graham says Abu Ghaith is clearly an enemy combatant and should have been sent straight to the Guantanamo Bay detainee facility for extended questioning.

""The Obama administration’s lack of a war-time detention policy for foreign members of al Qaeda, as well as its refusal to detain and interrogate these individuals at Guantanamo, makes our nation less safe,"" Graham and Ayotte said in a joint written statement. “We are at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups, and America’s detention policy must reflect that reality.""

More On This...

On Friday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell also questioned whether the U.S. was losing valuable intelligence by going through the civilian court system.

""From public reports it is clear that Abu Ghaith possesses valuable knowledge of al Qaeda's activities within Iran. Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans, and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies. He is an enemy combatant and should be held in military custody,"" he said.

But the White House argues that the civilian courts are a more effective avenue for justice.

""Article 3 courts have shown that they are, in many ways, a more efficient way for us to deliver justice to those who seek to harm the United States of America and that is the consensus view of the president's national security team and of agencies all across the federal government -- that this is the best way to handle bringing Abu Ghaith to justice,"" Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday.

Fox News has learned that the suspect was arrested Feb. 28 overseas and arrived March 1. His next court appearance is set for April 8. He has at least three court-appointed lawyers; he does not have the resources to pay for them.

The case reflects the Obama administration priority of prosecuting terror suspects in U.S. federal courts instead of holding them at Guantanamo Bay, which the administration has so far been unable to close.

The capture of Abu Ghaith drew praise from Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who called it a ""very significant victory"" in U.S. efforts against Al Qaeda.

The Justice Department touted the capture of Abu Ghaith as significant.

""It has been 13 years since Abu Ghaith allegedly worked alongside Usama Bin Laden in his campaign of terror, and 13 years since he allegedly took to the public airwaves, exhorting others to embrace Al Qaeda's cause and warning of more terrorist attacks like the mass murder of 9/11,"" U.S. Attorney Bharara said in a news release announcing Abu Ghaith's arrest. ""The memory of those attacks is indelibly etched on the American psyche, and today's action is the latest example of our commitment to capturing and punishing enemies of the United States, no matter how long it takes.""

Attorney General Eric Holder added, ""No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice.""

Abu Ghaith became an international name in late 2001 when he appeared on pan-Arab satellite television urging Muslims everywhere to fight the United States and warning of more attacks similar to those of Sept. 11.

In one video, he was sitting with bin Laden in front of a rock face in Afghanistan. A teacher and mosque preacher in Kuwait, he was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship after 9/11.

He is identified as a major Al Qaeda core official by the New America Foundation think tank in Washington. King said Abu Ghaith was involved in the planning in the 9/11 attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

""Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of Al Qaeda,"" King said. ""I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: It's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.""

Attorney Michael Rosensaft, who was a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan until last fall and is now in private practice, predicted the trial will last months, if not years, and that some of the evidence against Abu Ghaith will be a challenge for prosecutors to bring to court if it is classified.

Abu Ghaith's trial will make one of the few prosecutions of senior Al Qaeda leaders on U.S. soil. Charging foreign terror suspects in American federal courts was a top pledge by President Obama shortly after he took office in 2009 -- aimed, in part, to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

""The propaganda statements in which Abu Ghaith and his late father-in-law, Usama bin Laden, praised the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 are alone enough to merit the most serious punishment,"" King said

The Obama administration's attempts to move many of the detainees held at Guantanamo into facilities in the United States to stand trial domestically were halted during Obama's first term after Congress passed a measure with bipartisan majorities opposing such transfers.

“If you want to embrace that theory it means that every investigative journalist in the United States who works with their sources, who receives classified information is a criminal,” he continued. “And it’s precisely those theories and precisely that climate that has become so menacing in the United States.”

He went on the name examples such as Daniel Ellsberg and others who have revealed classified information to journalist involving actions that were a betrayal of the American people. Historically many of those whistle-blowers have been validated and vindicated. Not so much recently.

But you could really tell that Greenwald hit a nerve when Gregory shot back with this.



“Well, the question of who’s a journalist may be up to debate with regard of what you are doing,” Gregory opined. “And of course, anybody who’s watching this understands I was asking a question, that question has been raised by lawmakers as well.”

Oh fuck dude, really? This is a story that has gone through a fully legitimate set of papers, the Washington Post and the Guardian - and you're going to excuse your accusing another journalist of being aby turning around and questioning whether hea Journalist?

And your justification is that your just asking a question that ""Lawmakers have asked""?

That doesn't make it a legitimate question, which it wasn't. It was an Attack pure and simple. It was an attempt to de-legitimize the messenger. It was an accusation, based on nothing, that Greenwald has been helping Snowden Flee and/or Evade Capture, when an arrest warrant hadn't even been issued for Snowden in Hong Kong yet. How exactly could Greenwald be prosecuted for being Snowden's ""Travel Agent"" through China and Russia? What makes anyone think Greenwald could help with that, particularly since it's already been reported that a set of Wikileaks Attorney's are traveling with him?

What are they accusing Greenwald of doing? Providing the in-flight meal? Paying for his Upgrade to First Class? What are we talking about here?

Basically as he pointed out, Greenwald is being smeared as a co-conspirator by other journalists with NO EVIDENCE what so ever. I just finished a diary which included Fox News attacking Eric Holder for authorizing a warrant on Reporter James Rosen as a ""co-conspirator"" in the CIA Leak, cuz Reporters are ""Heroes"" for leaking on the Obama Administration, unless they're Liberal Journalist like Glenn Greenwald, then they should possibly be prosecuted, exactly the way James Rosen hasn't been - yet. The irony ratio here is quite high. So is the crazy ratio.

And it wasn't just Gregory, later in the show Chuck Todd reiterated the charge in a attempt to rehabilitate the question and further discredit Greenwald.



Todd: ""He rejected the premise of the question, he didn't answer it"".

No, he didn't answer it because we've NEVER DONE THAT. We've never prosecuted journalists for reporting information that was given to them by insiders and leakers. It waswhether Judith Miller or Robert Novak

There was a point in time when the most radical on the right-wing thought New York Times Editor Bill Keller should have been tried for Treason when this story was first revealed back in 2006 - but nobody, nobody took that seriously. Well, nobody that should have been anybody.



For a meeting without historical precedent, the president of the United States had called the Times to the White House to personally try to prevent a state secret from appearing in print—an exposé of the National Security Agency’s efforts to monitor phone calls without court-approved warrants that the Times had held back on for over a year. Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. sat in a wing chair facing Bush, while Keller and Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman sat across from Bush’s lawyer, Harriet Miers, and national-security adviser Stephen Hadley. General Michael Hayden, the then-director of the National Security Agency, sat alongside Bush with a thick briefing book in his lap. After stiff pleasantries, Bush issued an emphatic warning: If they revealed the secret program to the public and there was another terrorist attack on American soil, the Paper of Record would be implicated. “The basic message,” recalls Keller, “was, ‘You’ll have blood on your hands.’ ”

The Times held the story, for awhile, then eventually published it. No charges were filed. Even in this White House meeting, that possibility wasn't evenbecause there

If you think there was a statute that could have allowed George Bush to Prosecute the New York Times way back then - don't you think he would have tried?

It was never seriously on the table because that National Security Statute applies to the person with the Security Clearance, not the people they talk to. It's doesn't apply to journalists. There's a reason we don't have a ""Sedition Act"".

The sad part is that this line of questioning was really a smoke-screen to make Greenwald the issue instead of the NSA. Greenwald, just prior to this, made a series of allegations based on documents leaked by Snowden that EVEN THE FISA COURT THOUGHT THE BREATH AND SCOPE OF NSA SURVEILLANCE WAS BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT, BEYOND THE LAW AND CONSTITUTION.

He said he had in his position a Secret 80-page decision to that effect. As far as I know that document has not been released yet.

I admit the bread and circus act of personality conflict can grab our attention far more easily that the truly salient details, in fact I'm hoping that may occur with lede in the very diary, but if that helps more eyeballs get the center of what Greenwald said prior to his tit v tat with Gregory over ""Journalism"" - so be it.

Behold.



Gregory >> with regard to that specific fisa opinion, isn't the case based on people that i've talked to, that the fisa opinion based on the government's request is that they said, well, you can get this but you can't get that? that would actually go beyond the scope of what you're allowed to do, which means that the request was changed or denied, which is the whole point the government makes, which is that there is actual judicial review here and not abuse. isn't this the kind of review and opinion that you would want to keep these programs in line? Greenwald >> i don't know what government officials are whispering to you, david, but i know that the documents that i have in my possession and that i have read from the nsa tell a much different story, which is that there was an 80-page opinion from the fisa court that said that what the nsa is doing in spying on american citizens is a violation of both the fourth amendment and the bounds of the statute. and it specifically said that they are collecting bulk transmissions, multiple conversations from millions of americans, not just people that are believed to be involved in terrorist organizations or working for a foreign agent, and that this is illegal. and the nsa then planned to try and accommodate that ruling. but i think the real issue as journalists and as citizens is, why should we have to this? how can we have a democracy in which a secret court rule that what the government is doing in spying on us is a violation of the constitution and the law and yet we sit here and don't know what that ruling is because it's all been concealed and all been secret? i think we need to have transparency and disclosure, and that's why mr. snowden stepped forward so, that we could have that. >> there are reports he's ultimately headed to venezuela. is that your understanding? >> i don't -- i'm not going to talk about where he's headed or what his plans are. i think it's up in the air. i'm not sure where he's headed. he's my source for these stories. i'm not going to talk about where he's going.

Yeah, that's some realstuff right there David. I myself, would like to see those documents where even the FISA Court said what the NSA was doing was illegal, and I'd like to see exactly how thein a way that allowed them to continue the program to the satisfaction of the court.

This is the crux of this issue, do we have any meaningful ""oversight"" or are these NSA people running amok in defiance of the Court and the Law?

We're spending far more time debating the Hero/Traitor on the Run questions regarding Eddie Snowden the Celebrity than we are the content of what he's actually released. For example what are the NSA guidelines that limit collection and retention of U.S. Data?



The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection. However, alongside those provisions, the Fisa court-approved policies allow the NSA to: • Keep data that could potentially contain details of US persons for up to five years; • Retain and make use of ""inadvertently acquired"" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity; • Preserve ""foreign intelligence information"" contained within attorney-client communications; • Access the content of communications gathered from ""U.S. based machine[s]"" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.

Is it reasonable to keep this information for up to five years, even if it includes private information on U.S. Citizens? Even if it contains information protected by attorney-client privilege? Even if it the data doesn't have national security, but merely ""criminal"" implications?

We have this now, are we talking about it? Are the ""Journalists""? Nope. Is Snowden headed to Paraguay? Squirrel!!!!

Pathetic.

Peter King as ""very specific.""

The meeting, that took place on Saturday afternoon, was chaired by National Security Advisor Susan Rice with the Principals Committee to ""further review the situation and follow-up actions,"" according to the White House.

Among those at the meeting Saturday afternoon were the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security and the directors of the FBI and CIA. Rice then joined Lisa Monaco, President Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, in briefing the president, the White House said in a statement.

""The president has received frequent briefings over the last week on all aspects of the potential threat and our preparedness measures,"" according to the statement.

The travel alert was the first of its kind since an announcement preceding the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It came as Washington prepared to close its embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world this Sunday over security concerns.

More On This...

U.S. officials have not offered many details on the nature of the threat, but apparently are taking it seriously.

On Friday, the threat was described by Rep. Peter King, chairman of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, as “very specific.”

“We’re not certain exactly where something might happen but it’s very specific as to when and it’s also very specific as to the fact that it is going to happen, so we have to be on alert everywhere,” the New York Republican told WINS-AM.

The travel alert was the first of its kind since an announcement preceding the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It came as Washington prepared to close its embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world this Sunday over security concerns.

U.S. officials have not offered many details on the nature of the threat, but apparently are taking it seriously.

A White House official said Friday night President Obama was being updated on ""a potential threat occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.""

An official told Fox News on Saturday that the president will get updates through his birthday weekend, which includes a retreat to Camp David, from Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco.

""There is a significant threat stream and we're reacting to it,"" said Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He told ABC News in an interview to be aired Sunday that the threat was ""more specific"" than previous ones and the ""intent is to attack Western, not just U.S. interests.""

King, a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told WINS-AM that Americans abroad should register with the U.S. consulates in the countries they are visiting.

“I would let the American embassy know where you are. Basically check in and where you are and how long you plan to stay there and what your itinerary is,” King said.

John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the alert indicates the U.S. government must have some ""pretty good information"" about a possible threat.

Great Britain announced Friday night it would also close its embassy in Yemen ""as a precautionary measure"" on Sunday and Monday and urged its nationals to leave the country.

The travel alert issued Friday warned Americans of the ""continued potential for terrorist attacks, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.""

It said: ""Current information suggests that al-Qa'ida and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August.""

The alert reminded Americans about the potential for attacks on transit systems and other ""tourist infrastructure.""

Pentagon officials also said there is an increased alert among security personnel in the region in response to the Al Qaeda terror threats.

""Actions have been taken,"" one Pentagon official told Fox News.

Retired Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, said the threat is yet another sign that Al Qaeda and its affiliates are emboldened -- and stressed that the U.S. needs to do a better job securing its embassies.

""It has got to be one of our top priorities,"" he told Fox News.

Keane said it appears Al Qaeda is trying build off the Benghazi terror attack. ""When they sense weakness, they attack,"" he said. ""They believe that we're pulling back, and they were stunned ... that we did not come after them immediately after that attack.""

Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said the embassy threat was linked to Al Qaeda and concerned the Middle East and Central Asia.

""In this instance, we can take a step to better protect our personnel and, out of an abundance of caution, we should,"" Royce said. He declined to say if the National Security Agency's much-debated surveillance program helped reveal the threat.

The New York Times reported Friday night that American officials said the U.S. had intercepted electronic communications among senior operatives of Al Qaeda.

Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, also supported the department's decision to go public with its concerns.

""The most important thing we have to do is protect American lives,"" he said, describing the threat as ""not the regular chitchat"" picked up from would-be militants on the Internet or elsewhere.

State Department officials said Thursday, after announcing the temporary shutdown of embassies and consulates on Sunday, that they were acting out of an ""abundance of caution.""

Spokeswoman Marie Harf cited information indicating a threat to U.S. facilities overseas and said some diplomatic facilities may stay closed for more than a day.

The agency added the U.S. Consulate in Basrah, Iraq, to the list Saturday.

Sunday is a normal workday in many Arab and Middle Eastern countries, meaning that is where the closures will have an impact. Embassies in Europe and Latin America would be shuttered that day anyway. The State Department on Friday released a list of 21 embassies and consulates affected.

""We have instructed all U.S. embassies and consulates that would have normally been open on Sunday to suspend operations, specifically on August 4,"" a senior State Department official said Thursday night. ""It is possible we may have additional days of closing as well.""

The issue of security abroad has been prominent since the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and a string of demonstrations on other U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa.

U.S. and British intelligence agencies have cracked the encryption designed to provide online privacy and security, documents leaked by former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden show.

In a clandestine, decade-long effort to defeat digital scrambling, the National Security Agency, along with its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have used supercomputers to crack encryption codes through ""brute force"" and have inserted secret ""back doors"" into software with the help of technology companies, The Guardian,TheNew York Times and ProPublica reported Thursday.

The NSA has also maintained control over international encryption standards.

As the Times points out, encryption ""guards global commerce and banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical records, and automatically secures the e-mails, Web searches, Internet chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a federal suit challenging the government's collection of telephone communications data, called the NSA's efforts to defeat encryption ""recklessly shortsighted'' and said they make the Internet less secure for all.

In a statement, the ACLU said the actions will ""further erode not only the United States' reputation as a global champion of civil liberties and privacy but the economic competitiveness of its largest companies.''

""The encryption technologies that the NSA has exploited to enable its secret dragnet surveillance are the same technologies that protect our most sensitive information, including medical records, financial transactions and commercial secrets,"" said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. ""Even as the NSA demands more powers to invade our privacy in the name of cybersecurity, it is making the Internet less secure and exposing us to criminal hacking, foreign espionage, and unlawful surveillance.''

The spy agencies have focused on compromising encryption found in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), virtual private networks (VPNs) and 4G smartphones and tablets. The NSA spent $255 million this year on the decryption program — code named Bullrun — which aims to ""covertly influence"" software designs and ""insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems"" that would be known only to the agency.

The documents leaked by Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, do not name specific companies or encryption technologies, and refer to customers and users as ""adversaries.""

The NSA calls its decryption efforts the ""price of admission for the U.S. to maintain unrestricted access to and use of cyberspace.""

A 2010 memo describing an NSA briefing to British agents about the secret hacking said, ""For the past decade, N.S.A. has led an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies. Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming online. Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable.""

The GCHQ is working to penetrate encrypted traffic on what it called the ""big four"" service providers — Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft's Hotmail.

One document shows that by 2012, the British agency had developed ""new access opportunities"" into Google's systems.

Most major tech companies did not immediately respond. In the past, they have said they cooperate with government agencies only as prescribed by law.

Google said in a statement: ""We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. As for recent reports that the U.S. government has found ways to circumvent our security systems, we have no evidence of any such thing ever occurring. We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.""

A spokesman for Microsoft, Dominic Carr, said Thursday night that ""the company has significant concerns about the allegations of government activity reported today.'' He cited a previous Microsoft statement denying it provides ""any government with the ability to break the encryption.''

The NSA says code-breaking is fundamental to its mission of protecting national security by deciphering communications from terrorists, spies or other U.S. adversaries.

During the 1990s, the agency fought unsuccessfully to have a secret government portal included in all encryption protocols.

Experts and critics say that while ""back doors"" may help intelligence gathering, they weaken the Web's overall security and trust, and could be used against Americans.

""The risk is that when you build a back door into systems, you're not the only one to exploit it,"" Matthew Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, told the Times. ""Those back doors could work against U.S. communications, too.""

Bruce Schneier, a security technologist, examined the documents before they were published and authored an analysis for the Guardian. He told USA TODAY that they are the biggest revelations yet from the documents leaked by Snowden and said they show NSA has ""subverted"" much of the Internet and tech companies that form its backbone.

""They fundamentally undermine the social contract of the Internet — which is that you get what you think you get and it works,'' Schneier said. ""An agency has subverted vast swaths of this to turn the Internet into a surveillance engine. Now the Internet doesn't do what people thought it did.''

""They've done it through secret agreements with companies, so essentially all the companies you deal with on the Internet have been lying to you. They have basically sucked the trust out of the Internet — the NSA and these companies. It's a public-private partnership to turn the internet into a surveillance engine.''

The Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit group that advocates for a free Internet, called the NSA efforts ""a fundamental attack on the way the Internet works.''

""In an era which businesses as well as the average consumer trust secure networks and technologies for sensitive transactions and private communications online, it's incredibly destructive for the NSA to add flaws to such critical infrastructure,"" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, CDT Senior Staff Technologist.

""The NSA seems to be operating on the fantastically naïve assumption that any vulnerabilities it builds into core Internet technologies can only be exploited by itself and its global partners. The NSA simply should not be building vulnerabilities into the fundamental tools that we all rely upon to protect our private information,"" Hall added.

The Times and ProPublica said intelligence officials asked them not to publish the article, arguing that the revelations ""might prompt foreign targets to switch to new forms of encryption or communications that would be harder to collect or read.""

After removing ""some specific facts,"" they chose to publish ""because of the value of a public debate about government actions that weaken the most powerful tools for protecting the privacy of Americans and others.""

ProPublica published a separate article explaining its decision to publish:

The story, we believe, is an important one. It shows that the expectations of millions of Internet users regarding the privacy of their electronic communications are mistaken. These expectations guide the practices of private individuals and businesses, most of them innocent of any wrongdoing. The potential for abuse of such extraordinary capabilities for surveillance, including for political purposes, is considerable. The government insists it has put in place checks and balances to limit misuses of this technology. But the question of whether they are effective is far from resolved and is an issue that can only be debated by the people and their elected representatives if the basic facts are revealed.

The non-profit news organization noted that ""American history is replete with examples of the dangers of unchecked power operating in secret,"" specifically the President Nixon, who ""tried to subvert law enforcement, intelligence and other agencies for political purposes, and was more than willing to violate laws in the process.""

""Such a person could come to power again. We need a system that can withstand such challenges. That system requires public knowledge of the power the government possesses. Today's story is a step in that direction,"" ProPublica wrote.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

FBI agents are investigating the attacks, which happened two weeks ago, at the Washington-based headquarters. Fourteen computer servers and 20 workstations reportedly were penetrated during the attack.

The Energy Department is in the process of notifying employees whose information was stolen. While no classified information was compromised, the Free Beacon reports there are indications the hackers could have been seeking access to such data. Chinese hackers may be suspects, as the department is a known target of Beijing -- according to the Free Beacon, the sophistication of the attack indicates the involvement of a foreign government.

The department includes the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains nuclear weapons.

""It's a continuing story of negligence,"" former Energy Department security official Ed McCallum told the Free Beacon, explaining that the department continues to have security problems despite controlling some of the most ""sophisticated military and intelligence technology the country owns.""

He said China, as well as Iran, have been after Energy Department secrets. Several groups and agencies have warned about stepped-up cyber activities out of China.

""China continues to develop its capabilities in the cyber arena,"" the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a November 2012 report to Congress. ""U.S. industry and a range of government and military targets face repeated exploitation attempts by Chinese hackers as do international organizations and nongovernmental groups including Chinese dissident groups, activists, religious organizations, rights groups, and media institutions.""

Officials tell the Beacon they're working to plug security holes in the system and are developing ways to prevent a similar cyber attack in the future.

Confirmation of the attack comes only days after The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal announced that Chinese hackers had infiltrated its computers and stolen passwords for its employees. In a written statement, News Corporation, parent company of FoxNews.com, described the attack as an ""ongoing issue."" China's Ministry of National Defense has denied accusations they were behind the cyber attacks.

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio's repeated criticism of parts of the sweeping U.S. immigration bill he helped craft has unsettled immigration reform advocates and others who support its passage.

Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender, has consistently defended the bill's centerpiece - providing legal status for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.

But he has publicly said he wants changes to the bill and said last week that he agreed with some of the concerns voiced in a letter by 150 prominent conservatives who oppose the legislation. He also told CNBC that it would not pass without changes.

His office also raised eyebrows a few weeks ago when it circulated a memo to other Senate staff listing 21 concerns with the bill and ideas for changing what would be the biggest overhaul of federal immigration law in decades.

Frank Sharry, head of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, said Rubio's comments made him ""anxious"" and cautioned that the lawmaker must avoid taking his message too far.

""Rubio is uniquely qualified to talk to conservatives about immigration reform,"" Sharry said. ""On the other hand, if he thinks now that he's the face of immigration reform, that he's going to drive this bill in a direction that makes it less palatable for the progressive coalition that created the political space for reform, it's going to be a huge problem.""

Rubio, however, has said that failure to heed his concerns could endanger the prospect of overhauling immigration law, an issue that has historically divided conservatives and the American left.

As the most high-profile conservative in the bi-partisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators who labored for months to craft the legislation, Rubio will play a key role when it comes up for debate in the Democratic-controlled chamber.

Selling the bill is a delicate balancing act for Rubio. His comments are intended to build trust with conservatives, who have traditionally opposed immigration reform, but he must avoid alienating Democrats, whose support is also vital for passage.

While enactment of the bill could help Rubio's overall presidential prospects, it could cost him support in crucial early-voting conservative states such as Iowa and South Carolina.

Rubio has won credit from Democrats for backing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Pushing the economic case for the bill's passage, Rubio argues that new visa programs for foreign workers could boost America's global competitiveness, especially in the technology sector.

Yet he has often qualified his support by making clear he favors toughening the enforcement provisions of the bill, which are seen as politically necessary to get many Republicans' support for giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.

In a town hall-style appearance on Fox News last week, Rubio said he wanted to see the bill go farther to boost security on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Asked about conservatives' mistrust of the Obama administration on border enforcement, he replied, ""You've hit on the exact point.""

Rubio promised to consider revisions that would put Congress in charge of creating a border security plan rather than the Department of Homeland Security as currently called for in the bill. ""Unless we get people's confidence that we are going to secure the border, this bill won't pass,"" he said.

SELLING TO CONSERVATIVES

As a frequent guest on conservative radio and television programs, Rubio has a broad platform. And his arguments have converted some talk show hosts, including Mike Gallagher who acknowledged recently that he had been won over to supporting the central focus of the bill.

But David Leopold, general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports immigration reform, said Rubio was ""pushing the envelope.""

""Rubio needs to back up this bill,"" Leopold said. ""To offer a bill, to sit down and roll up your sleeves and write a bill with Democrats - I'm not going to discount that that took guts - but in that same vein, he needs to go into his caucus and sell this bill as a champion and not as a critic.""

Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, which supports immigration reform, said some of Rubio's comments were ""off-putting.""

But he added that Rubio's approach might turn out to be a shrewd way of reaching out and showing fellow conservatives that he is listening to their concerns. ""He does have a difficult role in trying to sell this package to conservatives.""

Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant emphasized that the lawmaker was not the only member of the Gang of Eight to say publicly that more work was needed to pass the bill in the Senate.

Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American from New Jersey, told Univision in an interview that the supporters ""don't currently have"" the minimum 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.

""After the last four or five months, I don't think anybody should question Senator Rubio's commitment to passing immigration reform,"" Conant said. That commitment is ""why he says we need to be open-minded about criticisms and we need to be open-minded about improving the bill,"" Conant said.

Fitz warned that Rubio ""may be creating expectations that aren't going to be able to be met"" in terms of promises to toughen border security.

Other Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight, including Senators John McCain, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, also are expected to push for the bill within their party.

""I think Rubio is critical,"" said Rebecca Tallent, a former aide to McCain who is now director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which supports immigration reform.

""He speaks to a lot of the folks who wouldn't necessarily be inclined to vote for something like this but Senator McCain brings the historical context and has a leadership role within the party and is good at building coalitions,""

In at least one recent closed-door meeting with Republicans, Rubio was even more blunt than he has been in public about what he sees as the bill's flaws, according to participants.

""The message was not, 'Listen, I've come up with a really good bill that we need to support it.' It was, 'This is a terribly flawed bill but it moves the ball forward and over the next weeks and months, it will move ever rightward,'"" said a conservative who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity."

In addition to Obama%2C four U.S. senators report receiving suspicious mail

Lab tests still pending on substance sent to Sen. Wicker

Ricin not considered effective for mass terrorism

WASHINGTON — The FBI said Wednesday it has arrested a Mississippi man ""believed to be responsible'' for mailing letters that tested positive for poisonous ricin to President Obama, a senator and another official.

Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested at his home in Corinth, Miss., the FBI said.

Curtis is ""the individual believed to be responsible for the mailings of the three letters sent through the U.S. Postal Service which contained a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin,'' the FBI said in a statement.

The White House and Capitol Hill were on alert after initial tests Wednesday showed that suspicious letters contained ricin, a deadly toxin.

As federal authorities investigated the letters to Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., several other senators reported that they, too, had received suspicious mail. The reports prompted U.S. Capitol Police to close portions of two congressional office buildings for a brief time.

Preliminary tests on the granular substance in the letter to Obama showed evidence of ricin, but additional lab analysis is underway to confirm that finding, according to an FBI statement. Similar testing is being done on the letter to Wicker, and results can take 24-48 hours.

Both letters bore a Memphis postmark, law enforcement authorities said. In an intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press, the FBI reports that both letters say: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" Both are signed, ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" wording that candidates use at the end of their broadcast political ads.



Ricin can be deadly if ingested or inhaled, but it's generally considered ineffective as a weapon for mass terrorism because it is very difficult to put it into an airborne form.



The letters to Obama and Wicker both were intercepted at off-site screening facilities where official mail is checked for potential contaminants.

Obama was briefed on the suspicious letters Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning, said White House press secretary Jay Carney.



Both the FBI and the White House stressed that there is no indication of any connection between the letters and Monday's twin bombings at the Boston Marathon. Carney cautioned that Americans shouldn't jump to any conclusions.

""Before we speculate or make connections that we don't know … we need to get the facts,"" Carney said.

The letter to Wicker was discovered first, on Tuesday, and Capitol Police said it contained a ""white granular substance."" The letter to Obama was revealed Wednesday morning.

Another suspicious package was received Wednesday morning at the Washington offices of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., according to Shelby's spokesman Jonathan Graffeo. He said the package is being investigated by Capitol Police and it was not known if it was similar to the ones addressed to Obama and Wicker.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., issued a statement saying that a suspicious letter was received Wednesday morning at his Saginaw, Mich., field office. He said the staffer who received the letter did not open it and turned it over to authorities, who are investigating and testing the letter for toxins.

""We do not expect to learn at least a preliminary result of those tests until late tonight or tomorrow,"" Levin said in a statement. ""The staffer who discovered the letter is being kept overnight at a local hospital for precautionary reasons, but has no symptoms. We do not know yet if the letter has any connection to suspicious mail sent to other public officials.""

Also Wednesday, authorities evacuated the Phoenix office of Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., after receiving reports of suspicious letters. Flake later announced that investigators had determined that there was no threat.

All routine mail to Congress and the White House is screened off-site, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said, but those tests can produce inconsistent results. If the tests indicate the possibility of a biological agent, the material is sent to an accredited laboratory for further analysis, and only those tests can confirm the presence of a biological agent.

As news of the letters spread Wednesday, tensions ran high at the Capitol. U.S. Capitol Police alerted congressional staff just after noon that they were investigating a suspicious package in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, as well as suspicious envelopes received in upstairs offices of both the Hart building and the nearby Russell Senate Office Building. The message advised staff that they were not required to stay in their offices, but to avoid the areas where the suspicious packages were being investigated.

An announcement in the buildings just before 1 p.m. said that test results on the packages were negative and closed off areas had reopened. Scott Ongill, a Senate staffer, said such alerts are not unusual. ""There is a couple, three (alerts) a week around the Capitol campus. It's not that uncommon an occurrence. They're doing due diligence."" He said they usually end up being tourists who left something.

Ricin is derived from the same plant used to produce castor oil. Because it is not readily put in the form of an aerosol that spreads easily through the air, it is considered far less worrisome as a weapon than anthrax, the substance mailed to members of Congress in shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in an episode that killed five and sickened 17 others.

""It's high school chemistry to make it, but it's not a serious bio threat,"" said Randall Larsen, former executive director of the WMD Commission, which was set up by Congress to investigate threats posed by weapons of mass destruction. ""You won't find bio-terror experts getting all upset by ricin. It's usually (used by) nut jobs doing something to try to get attention from people.""

Michael Osterholm, a former bioterrorism adviser to the George W. Bush administration who heads the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, called the interception of the ricin letters ""a success story.""

""It's a horrible situation that it happened but it's a success that it was found,"" Osterholm said. ""The ability to identify ricin in a letter was not in place before 2001. The U.S. mail is being tested for things like this. This was not a letter that got opened and someone said, 'Oh my gosh.'""

Handling a letter would be unlikely to give someone a lethal dose of ricin, Osterholm says. The poison is most dangerous when inhaled; getting it on one's fingers wouldn't pose that sort of risk. However, if someone is poisoned with ricin, there is no treatment and it can kill in one to three days.

Compiles,"At the Homeland Security Department, officials have repeatedly sought to use the security agency’s Internet and telephone databases and other resources to trace cyberattacks on American targets that are believed to have stemmed from China, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to officials. They have often been rebuffed.

Officials at the other agencies, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the tensions, say the National Security Agency’s reluctance to allow access to data has been particularly frustrating because of post-Sept. 11 measures that were intended to encourage information-sharing among federal agencies.

In fact, a change made in 2008 in the executive order governing intelligence was intended to make it easier for the security agency to share surveillance information with other agencies if it was considered “relevant” to their own investigations. It has often been left to the national intelligence director’s office to referee the frequent disputes over how and when the security agency’s spy tools can be used. The director’s office declined to comment for this article.

Typically, the agencies request that the N.S.A. target individuals or groups for surveillance, search its databases for information about them, or share raw intelligence, rather than edited summaries, with them. If those under scrutiny are Americans, approval from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required.

The security agency, whose mission is to spy overseas, and the F.B.I., its main partner in surveillance operations, dominate the process as the Justice Department’s main “customers” in seeking warrants from the intelligence court, with nearly 1,800 approved by the court last year.

In a statement, the security agency said that it “works closely with all intelligence community partners, and embeds liaison officers and other personnel at those agencies for the express purpose of ensuring N.S.A. is meeting their requirements and providing support to their missions.”

The security agency’s spy tools are attractive to other agencies for many reasons. Unlike traditional, narrowly tailored search warrants, those granted by the intelligence court often allow searches through records and data that are vast in scope. The standard of evidence needed to acquire them may be lower than in other courts, and the government may not be required to disclose for years, if ever, that someone was the focus of secret surveillance operations."

Federal Times

Inspectors have uncovered improprieties by company that conducted background checks

Some investigators falsified information

Snowden leaked documents on U.S. government surveillance programs

A 2011 re-investigation of Edward Snowden's background check may have been faulty, Office of Personnel Management Inspector General Patrick McFarland told Congress on Thursday. Snowden is a former National Security Agency contract employee who leaked details of a top-secret spying program at NSA.

""We do believe that there may be some problems"" with the re-investigation, McFarland said when Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., asked him whether he had concerns about whether Snowden's reinvestigation may not have been carried out in an appropriate or thorough manner. McFarland was testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee on the federal workforce, which Tester chairs.

McFarland said that U.S. Investigative Services, a company that handles 45% of the federal government's contracted background checks, conducted the 2011 re-investigation into Snowden. Later that year, McFarland's office began investigating USIS for contract fraud. That investigation is still ongoing.

In a statement, USIS said it received a subpoena for records from McFarland's office in January 2012, with which it complied. USIS said it has cooperated fully with the government's civil investigation, but said it has not been told it is under criminal investigation.

USIS would not confirm or deny whether it had conducted any investigations into Snowden, saying those investigations are confidential.

McFarland told the subcommittee that 18 background investigators and record searchers — 11 federal employees and seven contractors — have been convicted for falsifying background investigation reports since the IG began investigating so-called fabrication cases in 2006. The abuses included interviews that never occurred, answers to questions that were never asked, and record checks that were never conducted, McFarland said.

A 19th investigator pled guilty last month, McFarland said, and a 20th is expected to plead guilty this week. Both investigators are contractors, he said.

Snowden was fired from his job as a Booz Allen Hamilton contractor after revealing NSA programs that collect private online communications from companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google, and phone records and metadata from Verizon.

Meanwhile, Icelandic business executive said Friday that a private plane is on standby to transport National Security Agency secrets leaker Edward Snowden from Hong Kong to Iceland.

Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson said he has not spoken directly with Snowden but has been in touch with a third party representing him.

The businessman, who has connections to the WikiLeaks secret-spilling organization, said he has access to planes in Hong Kong and mainland China that Snowden could use.

But Iceland's government says it has not received an asylum request from Snowden, who has revealed his role in providing secret NSA documents about widespread surveillance programs.

Iceland Interior Ministry spokesman Johannes Tomasson said Snowden hasn't approached the ministry and could initiate an asylum request if he was already in Iceland.

When asked about the reports of Sigurvinsson chartering a private plane to fly Snowden to Iceland, Tomasson said: ""We don't object to that. But we don't have any knowledge other than what has been in the news. We can't comment any further on that.""

U.S. officials have expressed an interest in prosecuting Snowden for his admitted role in the publication of the documents. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and is hiding.

Sigurvinsson said that Snowden's potential private flight is being funded by private donations.

""There are a number of people that are interested in freedom of speech and recognize the importance of knowing who is spying on us,"" he said. ""We are people that care about privacy.""

Money is being raised on Snowden's behalf by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee based in the United States, but it was not expected to be tapped to help with the cost of a possible flight to Iceland.

Spokesman Matt Wall said Friday that more than $20,800 had been raised so far to pay for possible legal fees but that this would not be put to use for Snowden's personal expenses.

Sigurvinsson is a former director of DataCell, a data hosting service provider that, as one of its services, processed donations for WikiLeaks. He previously worked for investment and technology companies, including Baugur Group, MerkurPoint and iCell.

He said his group hopes to obtain Icelandic citizenship for Snowden.

""We are hoping that the government does what they did with Bobby Fischer,"" he said, referring to the late chess master who went to Iceland to escape U.S. prosecution for breaking sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia. ""We will see what happens."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Putin: Edward Snowden can stay in Russia if he stops leaks,"MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin suggested Monday that American fugitive Edward Snowden might be allowed to stay in Russia, and said the Russians would never turn Snowden over to the United States.

“If he wants to go somewhere and somebody will host him – no problem,” Putin said in televised remarks during a news conference in Moscow. “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must stop his work aimed at harming our American partners.”

It appears, the Russian president added, that Snowden has no such intention. “So he must choose for himself a country to stay in and move there,” he said. “Unfortunately, I don’t know when this will happen. If I knew I would tell you now.”

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked U.S. security secrets, met Monday morning with Russian consular service officials and handed them an appeal to 15 countries for political asylum, according to a Russian Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official didn’t name the countries, but said that Russia was among them.

Kim Shevchenko, a Russian consular official at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, later confirmed to the Interfax news agency that Snowden had applied for asylum in Russia.

The United States has a warrant for Snowden’s arrest and has asked that Russia return him, despite the fact that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty. Putin dismissed the notion, while noting that Russia does engage in spy swaps.

“Russia never hands anybody over anywhere and doesn’t intend to do so,” the Russian leader said. “At best, we exchanged our Foreign Intelligence Service agents for those who were detained and arrested and convicted in a Russian Federation court.”

Putin stressed that Snowden is not a Russian agent and that he is not cooperating with Russian special services. “I am telling you responsibly he is not cooperating with us today, either.”

Earlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said to reporters that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the American FBI “are in constant contact” over Snowden.

Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of the monthly National Defense journal, said it appeared that Putin was, in effect, offering a peace deal to the United States over Snowden.

“Putin publicly pledged that if Snowden stays in Russia the Kremlin will do its best to prevent any public exposures in the Russian mass media of the CIA’s and NSA’s secret activities,” Korotchenko said. “Washington should see this as a fair deal, a much better bargain than if Snowden goes on to Venezuela and continues to expose U.S. special services operations.”

“Putin made it as clear as possible that Russia is not playing a game with the United States and that Snowden landed in Russia quite unexpectedly for the Kremlin,” the analyst added.

Washington (CNN) - The leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees said Sunday that terrorists have gained ground in the past two years and that the United States is not any safer than it was at the outset of 2011.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, agreed that despite the death of Osama bin Laden and drone strikes aimed at decimating al Qaeda's leadership, President Barack Obama's administration has lost ground in the ongoing battle with global terrorism.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='jhseher']

""Are we safer now than we were a year ago, two years ago?"" host Candy Crowley asked Feinstein on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""I don't think so,"" the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman replied.

""I absolutely agree that we're not safer today,"" Rogers added.

Rogers warned that the Obama administration's successes against high-value targets have fostered a false sense of security.

""People think that, well, we've got this thing beat,"" Rogers said. ""And that's just not the case.""

In the wide-ranging joint interview with Crowley, Feinstein and Rogers detailed an international climate growing more hostile toward the United States.

Feinstein said increasingly fundamentalist Islamist groups are gaining power and winning the minds of the disenfranchised in the Middle East and Near Asia.

""I see more groups; more fundamentalist, more jihadist, more determined to kill to get to where they want to get,"" Feinstein said.

As evidence the U.S. is in greater danger, the California lawmaker cited a rise in fatalities from terrorist-related activities and increasingly specialized and dangerous technology available to terrorists. Feinstein specifically highlighted bombs as a growing threat to American security - and not the kind of improvised devices that plagued U.S. armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, or rudimentary explosives like the pressure-cooker bomb used by the Boston marathon bombers. She said terror groups had already tried, on four separate occasions, to send these newer, more deadly explosives into the United States.

""There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,"" Feinstain said. ""There are bombs that go through (metal-detecting) magnetometers.""

Rogers said the evolving nature of the terror threat - both an increase in the number of al Qaeda affiliates globally and the group's shifting strategy - has produced an enemy that, even if it’s not outright winning, has disproven Obama's claim the group is ""decimated.""

""Al Qaeda as we knew it before is metastasizing to something different,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the terrorist network has changed its modus operandi. Rather than placing a premium on sophisticated, simultaneous large-scale terror attacks - like those of September 11, 2001, and embassy bombings throughout the 1990s - the new breed of al Qaeda is more decentralized, he said, something that will make it ""exponentially"" harder to stop the next attack from happening.

""They've now switched to this notion that smaller events are OK, so if you have more smaller events than bigger events, they think that might still lead to their objectives and their goals,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the potency of the al Qaeda threat comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the American intelligence apparatus working to root out the next terror events.

""The pressure on our intelligence services to get it right, to prevent an attack, are enormous,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said a wave of disclosures about U.S. intelligence collection - revelations prompted by leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden - has turned public opinion against agencies that are working to defend the United States.

""Our intelligence services are not the bad guys,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the disclosures are not just a source of consternation among counterterrorism officials, but also a serious risk to national security. In describing the headaches posed by the drips from Snowden's spigot of classified documents detailing National Security Agency operations, Rogers said the revelations about the agency's methods of surveillance have already prompted three al Qaeda affiliates to change the way they communicate. With every disclosure, he said, it becomes more and more likely that a planned attack will slip through the intelligence web.

""I can't tell the thousands of man-hours they have spent trying to prepare people to understand fact from fiction, what is happening versus what is not happening,"" Rogers said."

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, told CNN on Wednesday that he thinks the House GOP’s plan to approach immigration reform through piecemeal legislation is acceptable since the bills will simply be combined in conference.

“We would much prefer a big comprehensive bill but any way that the House can get there is okay by us,” Schumer said. “I actually am optimistic that we will get this done. I’ve had a lot of discussions with members of both parties in the House. Things are moving in the right direction.”

Schumer said House Republicans now appear more open than ever to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, and are going to use the strategy of passing a large group of bills addressing specific immigration issues to get to a conference with the Senate bill. “My initial reaction was the House wasn’t going to take up any bill,” Schumer said. “That would have been very bad, no bill. Now they’re doing it in pieces.”

Schumer added that he thinks “a couple of their pieces are very similar to ours.”

Schumer is the latest amnesty proponent to admit publicly the end game strategy is to get to a conference with the Senate bill by having the House pass a group of bills. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has all but promised the same thing, as have House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).

Schumer’s fellow Gang of Eight member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), publicly admitted the same goal a few weeks ago when he pleaded with leftwing activists at the Center for American Progress to help get them to conference.

Ultimately, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) claimed in an op-ed on Wednesday that this is all part of the “secret Republican strategy to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.”

“The names may have changed, but the tactics remain the same,” Hayworth wrote. “After decades of promises to address illegal immigration, we are once again hearing the same old nonsense from Republican politicians.”

“Lawmakers vowing to act tough on border security while looking to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants has become infuriatingly all-too-familiar,” he said."

USA TODAY

Washington Post%2C Guardian first reported siphoning of personal data Thursday night

PRISM manages foreign intelligence information collected under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

Executives from several tech companies refuted reports they provide direct access to servers to NSA%2C FBI

The National Security Agency's classified PRISM program is an internal government computer system used to manage foreign intelligence collected from Internet and other electronic service providers, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement Saturday.

The disclosure Saturday marks the most extensive explanation the government has offered of what the program is, how it works and what it is authorized to collect.

Clapper said he declassified the details of the NSA's surveillance and intelligence collection programs ""in hope that it will help dispel some of the myths and add necessary context to what has been published"" about government surveillance of Americans' phone records and foreigners' Internet use.

The National Security Agency and the FBI are siphoning personal data from the main computer servers of nine major U.S. Internet firms, The Washington Post and the London-based Guardian reported Thursday night. Clapper said those reports lacked context about how the program is governed.

The Guardian this week revealed that the government demanded millions of phone records from Verizon. On Saturday, the newspaper reported on a classified NSA data-mining program called ""Boundless Informant"" that allegedly records and analyzes where electronic intelligence comes from. The classified document shows NSA collected nearly 3 billion pieces of intelligence from U.S. computer networks in one month, the paper reported.

""Over the last week, we have seen reckless disclosures of intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe. In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context — including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government — to these effective tools,"" Clapper said.

""PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program,"" Clapper said in a fact sheet that accompanied his statement.

The system manages foreign intelligence information collected under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, he said. ""The authority was created by the Congress and has been widely known and publicly discussed since its inception in 2008,"" he said.

The program has yielded results, including providing insight into a terrorist organization's strategic planning efforts, intelligence about weapons of mass destruction proliferation networks and information about potential cyberthreats, the fact sheet said.

""This insight has led to successful efforts to mitigate these threats,"" the fact sheet said.

Clapper said Congress ""after extensive public debate"" reauthorized Section 702 in December. He and Attorney General Eric Holder provide ""exhaustive"" reports assessing compliance with targeting to Congress twice a year, Clapper said in the fact sheet. Congress also receives opinions from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, he said, and congressional intelligence and judiciary committees are regularly briefed.

The government ""does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers,"" Clapper added. ""The notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches.""

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which meets in secret, approves the information collection and the providers know about it, Clapper said. The decisions are based on ""a written directive"" from Holder and Clapper, the fact sheet said. Eleven federal judges, appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, sit on the court.

""In short, Section 702 facilitates the targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning foreign targets located outside the United States under court oversight,"" the fact sheet said. ""Service providers supply information to the government when they are lawfully required to do so.""

Executives from Facebook, Google and Apple disputed reports that the companies have provided direct access to their servers for the National Security Agency and the FBI.

To target someone for such intelligence collection, the government must have ""an appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose,"" such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyberactivities, or nuclear proliferation, and the foreign target must be ""reasonably believed to be outside the United States,"" the fact sheet said. Section 702 prohibits ""intentionally"" targeting any U.S. citizen or anyone known to be in the United States, the sheet said. The agency also cannot target a person overseas if the purpose is to get information from a person inside the United States, the sheet said.

""We cannot target even foreign persons overseas without a valid foreign intelligence purpose,"" the fact sheet said.

If the intelligence community intercepts communications for a person in the U.S., it cannot use the information unless it is needed to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence, is evidence of a crime, or indicates a threat of death or serious injury, the fact sheet said.

Targeting decisions are reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice, the fact sheet said."

President Obama to nominate ex-Pentagon official as Homeland Security secretary

Jeh Johnson served as Pentagon general counsel

Johnson must be confirmed by Senate

President Obama plans to nominate former Pentagon attorney Jeh Johnson as the next secretary of Homeland Security, a White House official said Thursday.

Johnson, general counsel for the Defense Department during Obama's first term, will be introduced by the president at a ceremony on Friday.

If confirmed by the Senate, Johnson would replace Janet Napolitano, who left the administration to run the University of California education system.

""The president is selecting Johnson because he is one of the most highly qualified and respected national security leaders, having served as the senior lawyer for the largest government agency in the world,"" the official said.

The official said that during his tenure at the Defense Department, Johnson exhibited ""sound judgment"" and provided ""prior legal review and approval of every military operation approved by the president and secretary of Defense.""

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because Obama has not yet made his public announcement.

Johnson would be the fourth head of the Department of Homeland Security, created in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The White House official described Johnson as ""a critical member of the president's counterterrorism team,"" and someone who worked closely with Homeland Security officials during his years at the Pentagon.

His specialties include cybersecurity, the official said. He played a key role in repealing the Pentagon's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that banned openly gay servicemembers.

Johnson, who left his Pentagon post in 2012, also provided legal guidance in the use of unmanned drones against terrorism suspects overseas, and in the use of military commissions — rather than civilian courts — to try suspects.

The Homeland Security nominee also led a crackdown on unauthorized news leaks at the Defense Department, including a warning to a former Navy SEAL who wrote a book about the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

During a speech at Britain's Oxford University last year, Johnson said that the nation's war on terrorism should not be endless, and the focus should shift to law enforcement and intelligence operations.

""War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs,"" Johnson said. ""In its 12th year, we must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the new normal.""

These and other subjects could well surface at a Senate confirmation hearing.

Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, said Johnson ""grappled with the challenges of protecting national security while respecting human rights and upholding American ideals"" during his time at the Pentagon.

""These are key issues in the Department of Homeland Security, and we would welcome the opportunity to work with him should he be confirmed to lead DHS,"" she said in a statement.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., criticized Obama for nominating a ""loyalist and fundraiser"" to lead what he called a ""mismanaged"" department.

""This is deeply concerning,"" Sessions said. ""This huge department must have a proven manager with strong relevant law enforcement experience, recognized independence and integrity, who can restore this department to its full capability.""

An early political supporter of Obama, Johnson — a native of Wappingers Falls, N.Y. — also served as general counsel to the Air Force during President Clinton's administration.

Snowden used his first significant direct media contacts since arriving in Russia in June to portray his disclosure of secret intelligence gathering programs as a public service alerting Americans and people around the world to the risks those operations pose to individual privacy.

Since he fled his National Security Agency job in Hawaii and began leaking highly classified information, Snowden has been charged in the U.S. with felony espionage and theft of government property. But he is hailed as a hero by those who share his concerns that the massive NSA data sweeps in the name of counterterrorism unjustly intrude on the communications of innocent people.

Snowden said he realized he was “going in blind” when he sought to take public his complaints of excessive government monitoring, unsure whether the global audience would share his views.

“For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished,” he told the Post. “I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”

The 30-year-old former NSA contractor insisted in two days of conversation with the Post’s Barton Gellman in Moscow that neither China nor Russia -- the two countries to which he fled after leaking details of NSA surveillance -- could have obtained his cache of stolen intelligence.

Snowden declined to discuss the whereabouts of the purloined files, the Post said, “but he said that he is confident he did not expose them to Chinese intelligence in Hong Kong. And he said he did not bring them to Russia.”

Snowden also denied having “loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States.” He said he has “no relationship with the Russian government,” which has given him asylum on condition he cease leaking information that is damaging to the Kremlin’s “American partners.”

“If I defected at all,” Snowden is quoted as saying by the Post, “I defected from the government to the public.”

Gellman said Snowden seldom veered into his personal life during their 14 hours of discussion other than to say he mostly stays in his apartment surfing the Internet and communicating with friends. The fugitive said he survives mostly on ramen noodles and chips, and described himself as “an indoor cat.”

In the Christmas Day message he recorded for Britain’s Channel 4, an alternative to the BBC’s televised holiday address by Queen Elizabeth II, Snowden expanded on his intentions in leaking classified NSA information, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported.

“A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They’ll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalyzed thought,” Snowden says in the address taped in Moscow to be broadcast at 4:15 p.m. London time on Christmas Day.

“The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,” Snowden says in a segment of the address released to the Guardian on Tuesday. “Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.”

The Guardian said Snowden’s address was filmed in Russia by American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. The Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald, the Post’s Gellman and Poitras have been conduits for Snowden’s NSA disclosures.

Channel 4 has been broadcasting an “alternative” to the queen’s Christmas Day address for the past 20 years, often giving a platform for a quirky or controversial figure. Then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave the address in 2008, and Marge, the fictional mother on “The Simpsons,” appeared in 2004.

Snowden refers in his turn in the television spotlight to George Orwell, the early-20th century British author of the classic dystopian novel “1984"" about government surveillance and control run amok.

“The types of collection in the book -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today,” Snowden says of the NSA’s spying techniques. “We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person.”

“The political reality is … that the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.” – Senator Chuck Hagel, 2006

As a result of those words and his voting record, former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel’s nomination has turned a decades-long, bipartisan confirmation process for secretary of defense into an acrimonious one.

While some leading figures such as the Anti-Defamation League’s Abe Foxman and the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Rabbi Abraham Cooper say Hagel’s words are borderline anti-Semitism, I’m less worried about anti-Semitism and more worried about the judgment of a potential defense secretary who thinks Israel has won support because of “intimidation,” not merit.

Israel is widely supported by the American people because Israel deserves to be supported. Israel is a lonely democratic ally and a steady friend of the United States in a dangerous and tumultuous region. Their people are like the American people – free, independent, capitalistic and tolerant.

A Gallup poll taken last year showed 71% of the American people view Israel favorably while only 19% view the Palestinian Authority favorably and just 10% view Iran favorably.

In a Pew Research Center study last month, 50% of adults said they sympathize more with Israel in its dispute than with the Palestinians. Just 10% sympathize more with the Palestinians, while about as many (13%) volunteered that they sympathize with neither side.

Contrary to Hagel’s logic, Israel doesn’t enjoy widespread American support because anyone – from any faith – intimidated someone else; Israel earned the support of the American people because of its people’s values.

Opinion: Hagel is a friend to Israel

The danger in what Hagel said is if he thinks Israel is supported on Capitol Hill because of intimidation, then it’s not hard to see why Hagel is so soft in his support for our ally. He sees himself as an independent voice willing to stand up to intimidation, and he wears his anti-Israel votes as badges of honor.

But Hagel isn’t independent. He’s alone.

His position on Middle Eastern matters is so outside the mainstream of both parties that almost no one agrees with him.

In 2000, Hagel was one of only four senators who refused to sign a Senate letter in support of Israel.

Peter Beinart: What’s behind Hagel nomination fight

The following year Hagel was one of only 11 senators who refused to sign a letter urging President George W. Bush to continue his policy of not meeting with Yasser Arafat until the Palestinian leader took steps to end the violence against Israel.

John Cornyn: Why I can’t support Hagel

Contrary to America’s longstanding bipartisan position, Hagel has called for direct talks with terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. In 2007, Hagel voted against labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the group responsible for the death of many American servicemen in Iraq, a terrorist organization.

And in 2008, he was one of two senators on the banking committee to oppose a bill putting sanctions on Iran. One of the measure’s biggest backers was an Illinois senator named Barack Obama.

I’m a New Yorker and neither of my senators – Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand – supports Israel because someone muscled them into that position through intimidation. They both support Israel because the lobby that wants them to support Israel is an American lobby, made up of people from both parties and all religions and from people with no religion or political party at all.

But if Chuck Hagel believes that it’s intimidation and not sound judgment that has caused his colleagues to support Israel, then Chuck Hagel should not be confirmed as our next secretary of defense.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet on Friday with members of a privacy oversight watchdog board to try to reassure Americans rattled by revelations of the U.S. government's vast monitoring of phone and Internet data.

Obama is scrambling to show he has credibility on the issue after coming under fire for the scope of surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency, which was revealed in a series of disclosures by former government contractor Edward Snowden.

The president will hold talks with members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a five-person independent agency that has been largely dormant since 2008 and held its first full-fledged meeting on Wednesday after the Senate confirmed David Medine as its chairman last month.

The board's purpose is to review actions the government takes to protect national security, while balancing those steps with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties.

Obama, in an interview with PBS anchor Charlie Rose broadcast on Monday, strongly defended the surveillance program as necessary to protect against the possibility of attacks, but said he wanted to ensure Americans' retained their right to privacy.

His approval rating has dropped in some opinion polls, with the fallout over the surveillance program cited as a reason.

Privacy advocates have argued the surveillance activities infringe on Americans' civil liberties, and say the oversight is insufficient.

The Obama administration and high-profile lawmakers have defended the program as vital national security tools that are vigorously overseen by the administration, Congress and a special court.

'FURTHER QUESTIONS WARRANTED'

Medine told Reuters on Wednesday the board was aiming to hold a public event around July 9 to get legal insight from experts, academics and advocates.

""Based on what we've learned so far, the board believes further questions are warranted,"" said Medine, who previously was a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and served as an associate director at the Federal Trade Commission.

The White House announced steps to try to reveal more information about steps taken by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secretive court that oversees requests for surveillance warrants against suspected foreign threats inside the United States.

At Obama's direction, his homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, asked the director of national intelligence on Thursday to review FISA court opinions and filings relevant to the NSA programs and determine what additional information the government could reveal about them.

The effort ""builds on the administration's ongoing effort to declassify a significant amount of information regarding these programs,"" said a White House statement.

""The president's direction is that as much information as possible be made public while being mindful of the need to protect sources and methods and national security,"" the White House said.

Case over Security Fears,"An assistant U.S. Attorney is Houston has withdrawn from a major prosecution against the Aryan Brotherhood.

The prosecutor, Jay Hileman, sent an email to one of the Brotherhood’s defense attorneys, informing him that he was no longer on the case. It is widely believed that Hileman withdrew due to concerns and his and his family’s security.

In the wake of the horrific murders of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife, speculation, fueled by the media, has focused on the Aryan Brotherhood, a drug-trafficking crime syndicate with a significant presence in Texas. Police have not named a suspect in the murders and there is no known evidence tying the criminal gang to the murders, but the widespread media speculation of their involvement is having a dramatic ripple effect.

Hileman was part of a team bringing a major racketeering case against 34 members of the Brotherhood. An important component of the government’s case is based on testimony from a former general of the Brotherhood, who is currently under very tight security.

The Justice Department will replace Hileman with another prosecutor from Washington, DC. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston released the following statement:

The case currently pending in the Southern District of Texas has been and will continue to be worked by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas in partnership with the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division.

The Aryan Brotherhood has morphed over the years from a prison gang to a major middleman in the drug trade. Whether or not the gang was involved in the recent murders in Kaufman County, it is clear that the most violent elements of the drug trade are now active in Texas.

PART 1 | Immigration reform under Reagan: Twenty-seven years ago the United States implemented a plan that offered amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Hear from one of the architects of the bill and key players as they discuss where it went wrong. (The Washington Post)

A Senate panel took up amendments to a comprehensive immigration bill Tuesday and was expected to consider a proposal aimed at tightening the monitoring of foreign students in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings.

The measure, offered by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), would require the Department of Homeland Security to transfer all student visa information to border control agents at ports of entry. Aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing the amendment process, said the proposal was inspired by reports that alleged accomplices of the accused Boston bombers were living in the country on expired student visas.

In opening the committee’s session Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the panel’s chairman, said a key consideration for him in the immigration bill was that “the pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants in the United States “not be a false promise.” He called on senators to reject efforts to set up procedures that he said would be “nothing but obstacles to that goal.”

Before considering Grassley’s amendment, the committee took up changes related to border security. On a voice vote, the panel approved an amendment offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would limit the use of drones along the border with Mexico to three miles of the border in the San Diego and El Centro sectors.

The committee members then rejected 12 to 6 an amendment offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) that would have required the Homeland Security Department to implement a system to verify the entries and exits of visa holders using biometric identifiers such as fingerprints and iris scans. The amendment was aimed at reducing visa overstays, which account for an estimated 40 percent of the illegal immigrant population.

View Graphic See which amendments were adopted into the immigration bill

Sessions argued that his provision would force the government to obey a 1996 law that called for implementing such a biometric system. But opponents, including Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the system would be too expensive to establish in the short term. They said the immigration bill includes a provision to strengthen entry and exist verification using “biographic” data such as photographs.

Another Sessions amendment aimed at reducing the influx of legal immigrants under the legislation was defeated on a 17 to 1 vote. The senator from Alabama argued that the arrival of millions of job seekers acts to drive down wages and adversely affects U.S. citizens. Schumer and Graham said illegal immigration depresses wages much more and touted the bill’s provisions favoring “merit-based” legal immigration, which they said would better meet the needs of the economy than the current system based largely on family ties.

Immigration advocates have feared that Republicans would seize on the Boston attacks, allegedly carried out by two men who immigrated as youths with their Chechen parents, to rally opposition to the sweeping bipartisan immigration bill.

Grassley has been a leading critic of the legislation, and he cautioned last month that the Senate should move deliberately in the wake of the marathon bombings to determine potential weaknesses in the immigration system before making changes.

“Given the events of this week, it’s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,” Grassley said at a hearing in April. “How can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil? How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the U.S.? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill before us?”

The Senate Judiciary Committee began the second day of amendments shortly after 10 a.m. Last week, the committee debated 32 proposed changes to the immigration bill related to border security, adopting 21.

Leahy has said he hopes to complete the amendment process by the end of the month, potentially sending the bill to the full Senate in June. House Republican leaders are weighing whether to consider a comprehensive immigration bill or break the bill into pieces, a tactic opposed by Democrats and the White House.

At a fundraiser with Democratic donors in New York on Monday, President Obama said: “I am absolutely confident that if we stay with it, we are going to be able to get immigration reform done this year.”

The Grassley proposal will be considered along with several dozen others related to regulating the number of immigrants who are allowed to enter the United States through legal channels to seek employment, also known as “future flow.”

The proposals are a critical component of the bipartisan legislation, which aims to avoid the problems created in 1986, when Congress approved the last sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

Critics of that plan said lawmakers failed to set in place a program to meet — and adequately regulate — the demand for visas in the workplace, helping lead to a wave of illegal immigrants now estimated at 11 million.

Senate staffers familiar with Grassley’s student visa amendment described it as acceptable to the eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — who developed the legislative framework for the immigration bill. The four members of that group who serve on the Judiciary Committee are expected to support the adoption of the amendment.

The immigration bill includes provisions to add hundreds of thousands of new visas for low-skilled and high-tech workers. Senators on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to either expand or contract the visa levels proposed in the bill.

Any changes that are made by the committee could upset a pair of fragile agreements hashed out by the bipartisan coalition. On the low-skilled side, Senate negotiators worked with the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor union, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to create a new “W” visa program for up to 200,000 temporary workers in jobs such as waiters and janitors.

The program would start in 2015 with 20,000 visas and expand to 75,000 by 2019, after which a new federal bureau would make annual recommendations based on employment data. The number of visas would rise if unemployment is low and contract when it spikes, and the foreign workers would be paid salaries equivalent to American workers.

On the high-tech side, up to 180,000 visas would be available to foreign engineers and computer programmers at U.S. tech companies, which could hire up to 15 percent of their workforces under the so-called H-1B program. If companies exceed that percentage, they would have to pay the additional workers higher salaries, as well as financial penalties to the government.

Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has filed several amendments to increase the number of high-tech visas, but his amendments will not be debated until Thursday, Senate aides said. That will give the bipartisan group that developed the comprehensive bill time to negotiate over which amendments to support and which to oppose, the aides said.

Republican Congressman Frank Wolf wants to know why.

Kolbye addressed the GovSec West Conference in Dallas in late November and discussed various aspects of the Benghazi investigation with attendees. During his presentation, Kolbye noted that, contrary to initial reports, FBI assets were on the scene in Benghazi within a few days after the attack. Breitbart News reported that story when it broke.

Kolbye explained, “We have people in a lot of other foreign countries who are [legal attachés]. We have investigative teams that are well equipped.” In response to claims that the FBI could not access the site because of security clearance issues, he affirmed, “We were there.”

Rep. Wolf was amazed that this information didn’t reach Congress sooner. He told Breitbart News last Thursday:

I’m shocked to find that someone said that they were there in several days and all the reports we’ve had both from the administration and from the news media was that it took several weeks before they got there. Secondly, I don’t understand why this guy, Kevin Kolbye, wasn’t called as a witness by several other committees in Congress.

The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012. The Washington Post reported on September 18 that FBI agents had arrived in Libya, but later information indicated that they were delayed en route to Benghazi. On October 4, the Associated Press (AP) reported that a team of FBI agents arrived in Benghazi and stayed for only one day due to clearance issues. “Agents arrived in Benghazi before dawn on Thursday and departed after sunset, after weeks of waiting for access to the crime scene to investigate the Sept. 11 attack,” the report reads.

Kolbye’s claim that FBI staff was on-site at Benghazi flies in the face of these reports.

Rep. Wolf is leading the charge to untangle the complicated web of circumstances surrounding Benghazi. Wolf has been the driving force behind the idea of forming a Benghazi Select Committee to investigate the 2012 attack. While House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) appears unmotivated to appoint members to one, a recent McLaughlin-Caddell poll showed that two thirds of Americans want a Select Committee; this number includes 83 percent of Republicans as well as 58 percent of independents who “believe it is important for a special committee to get the truth about Benghazi.”

Speaking with Breitbart News, Rep. Wolf expressed his outrage at Congress’s lack of critical information:"

Story highlights Bruce Schneier: Historically, surveillance was difficult; now it's become much easier Schneier: Government and corporate surveillance used to be very different He says today NSA can piggyback on corporate surveillance; they're like partners Schneier: We need to decide whether data is a societal resource or a commodity

(CNN) —

Historically, surveillance was difficult and expensive.

Over the decades, as technology advanced, surveillance became easier and easier. Today, we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance, where everything is collected, saved, searched, correlated and analyzed.

But while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance, the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there. The former always collected information about everyone, but over time, collected more and more of it, while the latter always collected maximal information, but over time, collected it on more and more people.

Corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information. Corporations always collected information on everyone they could, but in the past they didn’t collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary. When surveillance information was expensive to collect and store, companies made do with as little as possible.

Telephone companies collected long-distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes. Credit cards collected only the information about their customers’ transactions that they needed for billing. Stores hardly ever collected information about their customers, maybe some personal preferences, or name-and-address for advertising purposes. Even Google, back in the beginning, collected far less information about its users than it does today.

Ann De Wulf Bruce Schneier

As technology improved, corporations were able to collect more. As the cost of data storage became cheaper, they were able to save more data and for a longer time. And as big data analysis tools became more powerful, it became profitable to save more. Today, almost everything is being saved by someone – probably forever.

Examples are everywhere. Internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple collect everything we do online at their sites. Third-party cookies allow those companies, and others, to collect data on us wherever we are on the Internet. Store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases. CCTV and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements; so does your cell phone. The Internet will facilitate even more surveillance, by more corporations for more purposes.

On the government side, surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected. When surveillance was manual and expensive, it could only be justified in extreme cases. The warrant process limited police surveillance, and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance. Specific individuals were targeted for surveillance, and maximal information was collected on them alone.

As technology improved, the government was able to implement ever-broadening surveillance. The National Security Agency could surveil groups – the Soviet government, the Chinese diplomatic corps, etc. – not just individuals. Eventually, they could spy on entire communications trunks.

Now, instead of watching one person, the NSA can monitor “three hops” away from that person – an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance. Using sophisticated tools, the NSA can surveil broad swaths of the Internet and phone network.

Governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance. Why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data? For example we just learned that the NSA collects e-mail, IM and social networking contact lists for millions of Internet users worldwide.

But as corporations started collecting more information on populations, governments started demanding that data. Through National Security Letters, the FBI can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant. Through secret agreements, the NSA can monitor the entire Internet and telephone networks.

This is a huge part of the public-private surveillance partnership.

The result of all this is we’re now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance.

Data is a byproduct of the information society. Every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record, and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day. Even if we don’t use a computer – buying something in person with cash, say – the merchant uses a computer, and the data flows into the same system. Everything we do leaves a data shadow, and that shadow is constantly under surveillance.

Data is also a byproduct of information society socialization, whether it be e-mail, instant messages or conversations on Facebook. Conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded, and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go.

Moore’s law has made computing cheaper. All of us have made computing ubiquitous. And because computing produces data, and that data equals surveillance, we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance.

Now we need to figure out what to do about it. This is more than reining in the NSA or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse. We need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource, a part of us that is inherently ours by right, or a private good to be bought and sold.

Writing in The Guardian, Chris Huhn said that “information is power, and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom.” How this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined.

Pleas for President Obama to toughen his stance on Russia have fallen on deaf ears.

A project to build Russian facilities on U.S. soil has raised concerns within the CIA and the Pentagon.

Putin%27s Russia appears increasingly emboldened by Obama administration promises of %22flexibility%22

It appears that pleas for President Obama to toughen his stance on Russia have fallen on deaf ears. Despite a litany of brazen power plays by Moscow, the Obama administration is now considering a proposal that could enhance Russia's capability to spy on the United States. The Senate will soon have an opportunity to ensure that this proposal and any others like it in the future do not put America's national security interests at risk.

Many Americans were stunned when, on November 16, news reports surfaced that Russian Space agency Roscosmos is close to gaining approval for the construction of half-a-dozen satellite ground monitoring stations on U.S. soil. It is disturbing that it took leaks to the media from defense and intelligence officials for Americans to discover that such an audacious proposal was even under review.

The stated purpose of the Russian-controlled monitoring stations is to improve Moscow's global positioning network, but logic dictates that the stations would also give Russia a prime vantage point to spy on the United States from within our own borders.

The project has rightly stirred serious concerns within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Pentagon. As Department of Defense (DoD) and CIA officials have warned, Russia could use these stations to gather intelligence and provide its satellite-guided weapons with pinpoint accuracy.

I have personally reviewed the classified report from DoD on this issue. I share DoD's alarm.

The disagreement between these agencies and the State Department suggests a troubling tug-of-war within the Obama administration over how to counter Russia's growing boldness. From agreements to reduce nuclear stockpiles to scrapping our Eastern European missile defense system, the administration's naïve attempts to ""reset"" relations with Russia continue to ignore the fact that President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly refused to cooperate with the United States. Instead, Putin seems to relish any opportunity to mock U.S. power.

Here is just how badly the ""reset"" has gone this year: In January, Russia's ban on U.S. adoptions took effect, victimizing his country's most vulnerable citizens in a desperate act of retaliation against criticism of Russia's human rights offenders. In August, Russia granted asylum to U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden, who is charged with espionage and theft of U.S. government property after releasing up to 200,000 classified documents to the media. Not to mention that Russia has defended the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

It is time to stop pretending that Russia is genuinely interested in engaging in good-faith efforts to advance bilateral relations with the United States. Putin's Russia appears increasingly emboldened by the Obama administration's promises of ""flexibility"" and reluctance to challenge Russia's insults. Alongside the rollback of democratic progress and declining rule of law within Russia, today's tense relations are reminiscent of an era prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

So far, the pushback from DoD and the Intelligence community has forced the administration to delay a final decision on Russia's proposed GPS stations, but I am hopeful my Senate colleagues will support legislation to add transparency to this urgent and serious matter. My amendment to the 2014 Defense Authorization bill would require both the Secretary of Defense and Director of National Intelligence to certify that any U.S.-based GPS stations controlled by foreign governments are not capable of gathering intelligence or improving foreign weapons systems. This determination would be made before any construction could be authorized.

The Obama administration should seize this opportunity to reaffirm that America's national security interests will not be jeopardized by attempts to appease Russia's own strategic pursuits. A better ""reset"" would be one that rebuilds public confidence in the administration's handling of its relationship with Russia.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/05/Obama-Verizon-phone,2013-06-05 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Obama Admin Grabs Millions of Verizon Phone Records,"According to a breaking report from the UK Guardian, Barack Obama’s National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of millions of domestic customers of Verizon under a court order obtained in April. The order requires Verizon to turn over phone records on an “ongoing, daily basis” to the NSA, both within the US and between the US and international sources.

The Guardian reports: “The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) handed over the order to the FBI on April 25, and gave them a three month blanket surveillance clearance. That means that numbers of both parties, location data, call duration, and time of all calls are subject to government surveillance. That makes the Obama administration’s oversight essentially unlimited.

The NSA, White House and Department of Justice all declined comment. The court order says that Verizon is forbidden to let customers know about the surveillance. Verizon also declined comment.

The order forces Verizon to turn over electronic versions of “all call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’ created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad” … or, more ominously, “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.” Every single day, Verizon must turn over that information.

The Guardian says that Verizon may not be the only cell-phone provider targeted with the order, and adds that “previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.”

The law legalizing this sort of surveillance is 50 USC 1861, a provision of the Patriot Act allowing requests of business records.

This sort of controversy arose in 2006 under President Bush under the auspices of the war on terror. President Obama essentially declared the war on terror over in April, at about the same point the administration received its blanket surveillance go-ahead from the FISA court.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/17/politics/nsa-court-ruling-questions/index.html,2013-12-17 00:00:00,"['Evan Pérez', 'Cnn Justice Correspondent']",5 questions about the NSA court ruling,"(CNN) —

A federal judge ruled the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of data on nearly every call made by U.S. phone subscribers is likely unconstitutional, providing ammunition to efforts to rein in surveillance programs that have expanded since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional

Here are five questions about the implications of the court’s ruling:

Q: How does the ruling affect the NSA’s data collection?

A: The NSA continues to have legal authority, based on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, to collect phone metadata, which includes numbers called and length of calls.

The judge stayed his ruling to give the government time to appeal. But the ruling provides the first indication yet that the courts could put some limits on surveillance that the political branches of government – Congress and successive administrations under Republican and Democratic presidents – have not done.

If the ruling stands, it also means that more Americans could sue to have their data removed from the NSA’s data collection programs.

Q: Why does the government collect the data and has it been useful for national security?

A: The Obama administration and officials from the Bush administration say the program is crucial to protecting national security.

NSA Director Keith Alexander has said the program, in conjunction with others, has thwarted more than 50 attacks. Supporters of the program in Congress put the number of attacks prevented at closer to 12 or 13.

In Monday’s ruling, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the program doesn’t appear useful at all, adding that government had not cited “a single instance” in which analysis of the NSA phone data program stopped an imminent terror attack.

Q: What have other courts said about the NSA program?

A: Until Monday’s ruling, 15 different judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had ruled 35 times that the NSA’s phone data collection is legal under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the government says.

The legality rests also in part on a 1979 Supreme Court ruling, called Smith v Maryland, that phone subscriber rights to privacy didn’t include information held by the phone company, such as raw data on phone calls.

Last month, a federal judge in California rejected an attempt to challenge the NSA program, saying the expectation of privacy doesn’t extend to phone data.

The Supreme Court, in a separate case last year, required police to seek warrants to attach a GPS device to a suspect’s car, but most justices questioned whether the 1979 precedent still was valid given the advances in technology.

Q: What does the ruling mean for Edward Snowden, who disclosed the program?

A: The ruling could increase public support for the idea that Snowden deserves amnesty for exposing a program that now at least one judge thinks is unconstitutional. But the Obama administration flatly rejects any talk of amnesty.

Snowden’s open letter offers to help Brazil investigate NSA surveillance

NSA official: Snowden amnesty ‘worth having a conversation about’

The administration has said there is no plan to seek the death penalty if Snowden returns from his temporary exile in Russia to face federal charges for leaking NSA classified documents.

But Attorney General Eric Holder, in an interview with CNN, said of Snowden: “I think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to have loved.”

Q: Are there efforts to change the NSA programs?

A: There are multiple proposals to change the NSA data collection programs, but the ones that have the likelihood of passing Congress would still allow the data collection to continue.

Some proposals would take the phone data program out of the NSA’s hands and require the phone companies to collect the data, then allow the government to seek access to it. NSA officials call it a “hot potato” that no one wants to hold onto.

The Defense Department recently announced it would be giving domestic law enforcement forces hulking vehicles designed to efficiently maneuver in a war zone for use in thwarting any potential high-scale activity.

This did not sit well with those who see a troubling trend: the militarization of local police departments, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which has criticized the Defense Department for giving 18-ton, $500,000 armor-protected military fighting vehicles to local forces.

ACLU affiliates have been collecting 2012 records to determine the extent of military hardware and tactics sent to police and plan to issue a report early next year.

""One of our concerns with this is it has a tendency to escalate violence,"" said ACLU Center for Justice senior counsel Kara Dansky.

An Associated Press investigation of the Defense Department military surplus program this year found that a disproportionate share of the $4.2 billion worth of property distributed since 1990 — everything from blankets to bayonets and Humvees — has been obtained by police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.

Ohio State University campus police got one vehicle, saying they would use it in large-scale emergencies and to provide a police presence on football game days. Others went to police in High Springs, Fla., and the sheriff's office in Dallas County, Texas.

In New York, the Albany County sheriff's department already had four smaller military-surplus Humvees, which have been used for storm evacuations and to pull trees out of roadways. Their new Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle will go into service after technicians remove the gun turret and change the paint from military sand to civilian black.

Sheriff Craig Apple rejected the idea that the nation's police forces are becoming too militaristic.

""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" he said. ""Our problem is we have to make sure we are prepared to respond to every type of crisis.""

To be sure, there has been some concerns raised in the past.

Radley Balko, the author of ""The Rise of the Warrior Cop,"" argues that the police mind set in the country is to be like a soldier.

""Instead of bringing soldiers in to do domestic law enforcement, we have allowed, and even encouraged, police officers to basically be armed like, police like, use the tactics of, be dressed like and adopt the mind set of these soldiers,"" he said at a CSPAN forum last summer. ""And the outcome is just as troubling, I think, as if the military were actually doing domestic police themselves.""

In October, Reuters ran a column by Michael Shank and Elizabeth Beavers called ""The Militarization of U.S. Police Forces"" in which the authors called for Congress to permanently ban the transfer of all military-grade equipment to U.S. cities.

The column noted the Pentagon's 1033 Program that allows the Defense Department to donate its surplus equipment. It pointed out allegations of fraud and abuse and called some of the machinery donated ""impractical.""

""Shocking, almost comical, examples of abuse have been well-documented — from the officer who sold his weapons on eBay, to the one who lent his weapons to unauthorized friends and the police departments that lost the military weapons or tried to auction them off,"" the column said.

For police and sheriff's departments, which have scooped up 165 of the mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPS, since they became available this summer, the price and the ability to deliver shock and awe while serving warrants or dealing with hostage standoffs was, however, just too good to pass up.

""It's armored. It's heavy. It's intimidating. And it's free,"" said Apple.

The NSA spying scandal goes deep%2C and the only upside is that it will distract from other scandals.

Sooner or later%2C power granted tends to become power abused.

Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy.

""How ironic is that? We wanted a president that listens to all Americans -- now we have one."" That was Jay Leno's take on the Obama administration's expanding NSA spying scandal, which has gone beyond Verizon phone records to include Google, Facebook, Yahoo and just about all the other major tech companies except, apparently, for Twitter.

The NSA spying scandal goes deep, and the Obama administration's only upside is that the furor over its poking into Americans' private business on a wholesale basis will distract people from the furor over the use of the IRS and other federal agencies to target political enemies -- and even donors to Republican causes -- and the furor over the Benghazi screwup and subsequent lies (scapegoated filmmaker Nakoula is still in jail), the furor over the ""Fast And Furious"" gunrunning scandal that left literally scores of Mexicans dead, the scandal over the DOJ's poking into phone records of journalists (and their parents), HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' shakedown of companies she regulates for ""donations"" to pay for ObamaCare implementation that Congress has refused to fund, the Pigford scandal where the Treasury Department's ""Judgment Fund"" appears to have been raided for political purposes -- well, it's getting to where you need a scorecard to keep up.

But, in fact, there's a common theme in all of these scandals: Abuse of power. And, what's more, that abuse-of-power theme is what makes the NSA snooping story bigger than it otherwise would be. It all comes down to trust.

The justification for giving the government a lot of snooping power hangs on two key arguments: That snooping will make us safer and that the snooping power won't be abused.

Has it made us safer? Anonymous government sources quoted in news reports say yes, but we know that all that snooping didn't catch the Tsarnaev brothers before they bombed the Boston Marathon -- even though they made extensive use of email and the Internet, and even though Russian security officials had warned us that they were a threat. The snooping didn't catch Major Nidal Hasan before he perpetrated the Fort Hood Massacre, though he should have been spotted easily enough. It didn't, apparently, warn us of the Benghazi attacks -- though perhaps it explains how administration flacks were able to find and scapegoat a YouTube filmmaker so quickly . But in terms of keeping us safe, the snooping doesn't look so great.

As for abuse, well, is it plausible to believe that a government that would abuse the powers of the IRS to attack political enemies, go after journalists who publish unflattering material or scapegoat a filmmaker in the hopes of providing political cover to an election-season claim that al-Qaeda was finished would have any qualms about misusing the massive power of government-run snooping and Big Data? What we've seen here is a pattern of abuse. There's little reason to think that pattern will change, absent a change of administration -- and, quite possibly, not even then. Sooner or later, power granted tends to become power abused. Then there's the risk that information gathered might leak, of course, as recent events demonstrate.

Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy. So why trust them with so much power? The evidence to date strongly suggests that they aren't worthy of it.

Websense Security Labs has been intercepting waves of bogus e-mails, purporting to come from ""FoxNews.com Editors,"" announcing an invasion of Syria by United States military forces.

One headline reads, ""US deploys 25,000 troops in Syria,"" and text in the e-mail points to links to breaking news stories about the ""invasion"" and current upheaval in Syria. A few of the headlines even suggest that this may indeed be the start of World War III.

Bipartisan group outlined proposals to overhaul immigration system they hope to pass this spring

Critics say a pathway to citizenship would amount to amnesty

President Obama delivers a major speech on immigration in Las Vegas

The selling of the bipartisan Senate immigration principles began in earnest Tuesday, as key GOP supporters John McCain and Marco Rubio fanned out on TV and radio to promote their proposal's merits.

Florida Sen. Rubio, a Tea Party favorite, appeared Tuesday afternoon on Rush Limbaugh's show, a day after the conservative talk show host criticized the bipartisan proposal as a form of amnesty.

""Things are often demagogued and described in a way that are not accurate,"" Rubio said on the syndicated radio program. ""I think the more people are aware about what we're for and what we're not for, the more empowered we are ... to make a better argument for our position versus theirs.""

A group of eight senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans -- on Monday announced they had reached agreement on four broad categories to be addressed in sweeping legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system.

The principles include a path to citizenship, revamping the way immigrants come to the United States legally, boosting ways employers can verify the legal status of workers, and allowing more low-skill workers to come into the country. President Obama on Tuesday outlined his immigration proposal in a speech in Las Vegas.

McCain, R-Ariz., pushed back in CBS and MSNBC interviews on the idea that the proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the United States -- after border security is tightened and these migrants meet a strict set of conditions -- is not amnesty.

""Border enforcement and border security is a pre-requisite,"" McCain said on CBS This Morning. ""And obviously that makes sense since we don't want to have a repeat again some years from now of another group of people coming to this country illegally.""

McCain said a pathway to citizenship will be established for people already in the USA who have not committed crimes, pay fines and back taxes, and get in line behind those who have already applied legally for a green card.

""They will have to meet a lot of criteria,"" McCain said on CBS. ""I hope that as more Americans see this proposal that they will understand that we cannot have forever 11 million people living in the shadows in this country.""

Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a leading Democrat in the bipartisan group, said Tuesday on MSNBC that there is nothing ""easy"" in the proposed path to citizenship. ""There'll be some admission of wrongdoing. It is not amnesty in any sense of the word,"" Schumer said.

Rubio's appearance on Limbaugh's radio show could be critical. Limbaugh's syndicated show reaches millions of radio listeners, and the talk show host helps shape opinion among conservatives.

On Monday, as the senators unveiled their immigration principles, Limbaugh blasted the proposal and the idea that it is a way for Republicans to improve their standing with Latino voters.

""The Republican participation in this is taking place largely because they believe if they don't do it, they will never win the presidency again because they will never get Hispanic votes,"" Limbaugh said Monday.

Rubio said Tuesday that it is a ""false argument"" to characterize Republicans as anti-immigrant and anti-immigration. He stressed that legislation based on the Senate principles still needs to be written -- and he vowed he would not support the final product unless it contained border security and workplace enforcement ahead of a pathway to citizenship.

""If this bill does not have real triggers in there, if there is not language in this bill that guarantees that nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won't support it,"" Rubio said.

Rubio also challenged the president to work with the bipartisan group of senators, and not advance an immigration plan that is politically to the left of the framework that has been outlined.

""He can either decide that he wants to be part of a solution, or he can decide if he wants to be part of a political issue and try to trigger a bidding war,"" the Florida senator said, vowing not to get caught in a fight ""to see who can come up with the most lenient path forward.""

After the interview with Rubio, Limbaugh heaped praise on the senator as a ""guy who does not fear talk radio."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people,” he did not mention radical Islam at all.

In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets, Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston, sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects, and praised Boston’s police officers.

He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said, “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.”

He became most animated, though, when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered.

“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement, not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people,” Obama said.

Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think, Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case, there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers, especially older brother Tamerlan.

In an interview with Russia Today, the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader,” and they were “afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a lot.”

She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago, and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites.

But the mother, perhaps like Obama, seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really, in her mind, had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.

On Monday evening, in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings, Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke, the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”

Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera.

Robert Baer, a former CIA official, said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West, and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan, Even Piers Morgan, who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda, discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening.

But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence, Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence.

For instance, the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror, instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009."

The Afghan president signaled he was not prepared to sign the agreement during a meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice. According to the White House, he outlined ""new conditions"" for signing it, just days after a tentative deal had been reached.

The White House said Monday that Rice responded by saying this would mean the U.S. would then start planning to pull out all its forces after 2014, adding that a signed agreement is necessary to plan for thousands of troops to stay in the country to train and mentor Afghan security forces to face the Taliban.

""Without a prompt signature, the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan,"" she told the Afghan president.

Their meeting in Kabul came the day after Karzai's surprise decision to ignore Sunday's recommendation by an Afghan assembly of dignitaries to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement, a refusal that cast doubt on whether American and allied troops would remain in Afghanistan to train Afghan forces after most foreign troops withdraw next year.

More On This...

According to Karzai's office, he told Rice during Monday's meeting that he wouldn't back down from that decision, deferring it to whoever succeeds him as president in April elections.

Karzai announced his decision at a gathering of 2,500 tribal elders and regional leaders known as a Loya Jirga, even though the council not only overwhelmingly approved the deal after a four-day meeting but urged him to sign it by Dec. 31.

Washington has asked him to change his mind. But the mercurial Karzai, in the meeting with Rice, says he laid out a series of new demands -- albeit ones mostly involving steps the U.S. has already said it would take.

One new demand was that the United States should address a suggestion by the Loya Jirga that all Afghan prisoners be released from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

According to the statement, Karzai ""said the United States of America should respond to the suggestion mentioned in the resolution of the Loya Jirga to free all the Afghan prisoners in Guantanamo.""

There are nearly 20 Afghans currently being held at the American facility in Cuba.

Karzai's office said that in the meeting with Rice, he also asked for further assurances from the United States that its forces will not raid Afghan homes and that America express a sincere commitment to help start stalled peace talks with the Taliban. He also reiterated his demand that the United States commit to holding free and transparent elections on April 5.

The statement further added that Karzai asked Rice to convey his concerns about the raids and peace talks to President Barack Obama so that he can ""give assurances regarding the issues to the Afghan people.""

Obama has already addressed the issue of raids in a letter to Karzai last week that was read to the assembly.

In it, Obama assured Karzai that under the agreement, the U.S. will continue to respect ""Afghan sovereignty."" He also said the U.S. military will not conduct raids on homes except under ""extraordinary circumstances"" involving urgent risks to U.S. nationals.

The US has repeatedly urged Karzai to sign a deal that would allow about 8,000 American troops to stay in the country beyond a 2014 withdrawal deadline.

The two-term Afghan leader has insisted that the winner of an April 5 election to succeed him should be the one to sign the deal. More than $8 billion in annual funds for Afghanistan's fledgling security forces and development assistance also are at stake.

Karzai may be concerned about his legacy, worried he might be seen as responsible for an agreement that some Afghans will likely see as selling out to foreign interests.

Karzai's statement said that Rice told the Afghan president that the U.S. was committed to transparent elections that will be held on time and without interference as prescribed by Afghan law.

It added that Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. and coalition commander, told Karzai he had ordered his troops ""to act according to the security agreement and suggestions of the consultative Loya Jirga.""

But is also said Rice did not provide a commitment on the peace talks.

Karzai has blamed the United States for the collapse of talks that were to be held at a Taliban office in the Gulf State of Qatar.

The Taliban office, which opened in Doha last June after talks between the United States and Qatar, closed after Karzai accused the religious movement of trying to set up a government-in-exile by identifying its office as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

A furious Karzai told the Loya Jirga delegates on Sunday that Obama had promised him the Taliban would not open an embassy.

Rice met with Karzai at the end of a previously unannounced three-day trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops and civilians for the Thanksgiving holidays, the White House said, adding that the meeting was at Karzai's request. Her spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, said the meeting was the last stop on her trip.

Karzai, who had convened the Loya Jirga, complicated the debate by announcing on the opening day that he wanted delegates to endorse the deal but he would not sign it.

He repeated that stance Sunday laying down a series of ill-defined conditions and promising to continue negotiations with the United States. They included demands that America ensure peace in a country that has been at war for more than 12 years and guarantee transparent elections.

Karzai, who is constitutionally barred from running in the upcoming presidential vote, also accused the United States of meddling in the 2009 elections, which were marred by fraud, and said he wanted to keep that from happening again.

Even if the president changes his mind and signs the document, it still must be approved by the Afghan parliament, then finally signed into law by Karzai.

Combining all instances of reported sexual assault on an off campus from 2009 to 2011, George Washington University had 56; Georgetown University, 26; and Howard, 20.

With thousands of students arriving this month for a new academic year at Howard University, the school is still roiling from reports of two summertime crimes that have raised fresh questions about safety on the Northwest Washington campus.

Police reported two violent attacks at Howard last month: the robbery and fatal shooting of a rising senior on July 4, and the rape of a campus visitor inside a classroom building on July 22.

The publicity surrounding both reports, along with a separate crime spike last fall, have prompted a soul-searching on how to shake long-standing perceptions and realities about crime and safety on a campus in the heart of a big city.

The discussion began when the campus was already shaken by a financial crisis at Howard, first revealed in June, that led to layoffs and sparked a debate about the school’s future.

“Having a safe environment is essential,” Howard’s president, Sidney A. Ribeau, said in a recent interview. “If people are worried about crime, they cannot learn.”

July 10, 2013 Friends and family attend the memorial for Howard University student Omar Adam Sykes. Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Ribeau and other officials have sought to boost campus security in time for the fall semester. He said that freshmen, who will begin moving into dorms Saturday, will be counseled about their environment soon after their arrival. Students will also be greeted by guards posted at dormitories, and they will be offered 24-hour shuttle service to off-campus apartments and other buildings in the historic Shaw neighborhood.

In addition, undercover D.C. police officers will patrol the campus in increasing numbers.

“The officers are being told to be more observant, that their job is even harder now,” said Cedric Scott, an 11-year veteran of the Howard University police force and vice president of the Metropolitan Campus Police Officers Union. “We don’t want to be in a position where something happens and we aren’t where we’re supposed to be.”

Howard leads most other schools in the District in both on- and off-campus street robberies, which often target students carrying book bags, computers and smartphones.

But in other ways, Howard compares favorably with the other urban campuses of Washington. The university reported 20 sexual assaults on and off campus between 2009 and 2011, the latest years available.

Georgetown University reported 26 sexual assaults on and off campus over those three years. George Washington University reported 56.

Howard officials also point to statistics that show a dramatic drop in campus crime over a five-year period. There were 47 robberies in 2008 and 15 last year. There were 29 in 2010 and five in 2011.

They also say the recent financial turmoil has not affected public safety. Howard University Police Chief Leroy K. James said the budget issues that forced the elimination of 73 university staff members spared his 211-member force.

James said 15 officers were recently hired and an additional five are about to join. Officials said the public-safety budget has risen from $10 million to $11 million, not including several million to improve technology, such as key-card access to buildings and surveillance cameras.

Officials are also contemplating more long-term efforts to improve campus safety, including revitalizing the more well-worn portions of the Georgia Avenue corridor, which skirts Howard’s open, 108-acre campus.

The thoroughfare hardly offers a grand entrance to campus. Walking up from the Shaw Metro station to the university means passing a collection of gritty

carry-outs, an array of “cold beer” signs and storefronts selling throwaway cellphones.

Ribeau described the contrast between Georgia Avenue and the campus itself as emblematic of “the divide between the haves and the have-nots in America.”

He said he hopes that Howard can anchor a burst of gentrification, much like those occurring elsewhere in the District, attracting thousands of new residents and clearing away crime. “Ten years from now, there will be a new Georgia Avenue corridor,” he said.

Already, store owners and vendors said they’ve seen marked improvements and called the area safer than in years past. And campus visitors interviewed last week expressed little concern.

Kenya Hall, a 37-year-old from Brooklyn, came with her son, Aaron Trotman, who plans to attend Howard this fall. “I’m not scared,” said Trotman, 17. Hall added, “I’ve seen two police pass by in the last five minutes.”

But Wilhelmina Rochester, who drives a FedEx truck and makes stops throughout campus each day, said students here and elsewhere nearby are typically easy prey. “I’ve seen people get robbed,” said Rochester, 57, adding that she occasionally notices security lights that don’t work.

The latest discussion of safety at Howard was prompted primarily by a random robbery July 4 on Georgia Avenue, which police said led to the shooting death of Omar Adam Sykes, 22. He would have been a senior majoring in business marketing this year. No arrest has been made.

Then came the report of a rape July 22, which the victim said occurred after her attacker followed her off a Metro bus. Police and university officials said privately that surveillance video does not support the woman’s story, but they have not discounted it and have released a photo of a man they want to question.

There was also a crime spike last October, including a carjacking in a campus parking lot, a robbery of a student at gunpoint in front of the stadium, an assault of four students as they walked home from a party and another robbery at gunpoint of a man outside the campus theater.

Then, in November, a 19-year-old student was raped in the Bethune Annex dorm by an intruder police said had been hiding in her bathroom. University officials said they have replaced keycard access with 24-hour security guards at every dorm.

D.C. police charged a man in that rape and another attack in which a woman allegedly was stabbed repeatedly by a man who broke into her apartment in Northeast Washington. Police said the same knife was used in both attacks. The suspect’s trial is pending.

The victim of the on-campus rape, who spoke publicly for the first time since the attack in an e-mail exchange this month, said she has decided to return to Howard this fall despite her misgivings about safety.

“Although the choice was not easy especially considering recent events, I have decided to come back,” she wrote. “It’s a struggle mentally, emotionally and physically to feign normality and return to the school after something such as this.”

But, she said: “The last thing you want taken from you is something you’ve worked for and deserve. I want my education and I refuse to let him or anyone else take that as well.”"

""I had no idea that for five grams of cocaine -- which is what that nickel weighs, five grams -- you could be sentenced to 10 years in prison,"" Kerik said in a clip of an interview that aired on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""I was with men sentenced to 10 years in prison for five grams of cocaine. That's insane.""

Kerik, who had been nominated by former President George W. Bush to lead the Department of Homeland Security, spent time in prison on eight felony counts, including tax fraud and lying to the White House.

""If the American people and members of Congress saw what I saw, there would be anger, there would be outrage, and there would be change, because nobody would stand for it,"" Kerik said of his time behind bars.

David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said on ""Meet the Press"" that there was a ""growing consensus"" on the issue of prison reform, citing comments from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Attorney General Eric Holder has instituted several reforms as part of a ""Smart on Crime"" initiative, including a policy that allows some low-level drug defendants to avoid mandatory minimum sentences."

Rubio defends immigration bill emerging from bipartisan group,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) blitzed the airwaves Sunday to defend the immigration bill being written by four Republican and four Democratic senators.

Speaking on seven news shows -- including two Spanish-language broadcasts -- Rubio said the draft legislation lays out a way for those in the country unlawfully to apply for legal status, includes stiff penalties for breaking the law and will make the country’s border more secure than ever before.

“I just hope that I can convince people that leaving things the way they are now is much worse than approaching it the way we’ve outlined,” Rubio said on ABC News’ “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”

RELATED: Is the border secure?

“We’re not awarding anything.” Rubio said on Fox News Sunday.

Rubio, who was elected on a wave of tea party support and is a GOP presidential hopeful, is considered to be the best chance the group has of selling the compromise to conservatives.

He said that in order for immigrants who entered the country illegally to earn legal status, they will have to pass a criminal background check, prove they are gainfully employed and pay a penalty. Immigrants with this probationary status will have to wait 10 years before applying for permanent residency, he said, and during that time, they won’t qualify for food stamps or federal medical benefits.

“It will be cheaper, faster and easier for people to go back home and wait 10 years than [go through] this process. That’s why it’s not amnesty,” Rubio said. “If somehow being in the country illegally is cheaper, easier and quicker than the right way, I wouldn’t support that,” he said.

Rubio said that Senate staff members were drafting the bill and that he hoped to be able to talk in more detail about the provisions this week. He said he looked forward to considering amendments from the 92 other senators who have not been involved in writing the bill, but said he would oppose any amendments designed to kill the effort.

Rubio outlined three parts of the bill designed to improve border security. The provisions would have to be implemented before immigrants with probationary status could apply for permanent residency. Employers would be required to use a federal verification database before hiring workers, a new exit visa system would track when visitors overstayed their visas, and technology would be put in place to provide 100% surveillance of the Southwest border and stop 90% of the people who attempt to cross illegally.

“All three have to happen,” he said. Under the bill, the Department of Homeland Security would have five years to accomplish the border security goals. If it fails to do so in that time frame, an independent border commission would be given funding and authority to complete the task in the following five years, he said.

Once the measures in the bill are put into place, Rubio said, “we will have the most effective enforcement system this country has ever had.”

Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, however, said the security measures should come before immigrants can apply for probationary legal status, not after.

“When the Gang of Eight was first formed a publicly stated principle was the enforcement would come first — before legalization,” Sessions said in a statement. “Today, on the Sunday shows, Gang of Eight members admitted that they abandoned this principle and that, in fact, legalization — or amnesty — would come first.”

Speaking after Rubio’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on the broadcast he was encouraged by what the group has agreed on.

“Border security is absolutely critical to this picture,” said Cornyn, adding that he wanted to read the bill before he decided whether to support it. “So much of it is restoring public confidence that the government is actually doing its job,” he said. If the bill doesn’t restore confidence in border security, he said, he will “have a hard time supporting it.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one of the eight senators writing the bill, said there would have to be some flexibility built into how border security is measured so that it doesn’t derail the whole process. Durbin said that there will be more investment in border security, but emphasized how much has already been done.

“Our border with Mexico is the safest and strongest it’s been in 40 years,” Durbin said, adding that the government is now putting more money into border enforcement than into the budgets of the FBI, the ATF and the DEA combined.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/rand-paul-filibuster_n_2819740.html,2013-03-06 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Rand Paul Filibusters John Brennan Nomination,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday he intended to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as director of the CIA, citing concerns about President Barack Obama's policy on civil liberties.

""I will speak until I can no longer speak,"" Paul said.

Paul, an outspoken libertarian, pointed to what he called the abuses of executive power and civil liberties under Obama's administration. In particular, he objected to the contents of a letter he received from Attorney General Eric Holder that asserted the U.S. government had the legal authority to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil.

""Where is the Barack Obama of 2007?"" he asked, referring to then-presidential candidate Obama's criticism of Bush-era violations of civil liberties. ""If there were an ounce of courage in this body, I would be joined by many other senators,"" he added. ""Are we going to give up our rights to politicians?""

Paul had asked the Justice Department about the constitutionality of drone strikes and whether they could be used agains U.S. citizens. Holder responded in a letter that conceded the military could authorize a drone strike on U.S. soil.

""It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.

Paul elaborated on his concern Wednesday: ""When I asked the president, 'Can you kill an American on American soil,' it should have been an easy answer. It’s an easy question. It should have been a resounding an unequivocal, ‘No.’ The president’s response? He hasn’t killed anyone yet. We’re supposed to be comforted by that. The president says, ‘I haven’t killed anyone yet.’ He goes on to say, ‘And I have no intention of killing Americans. But I might.’ Is that enough? Are we satisfied by that?""

Paul started his filibuster speech around 11:45 a.m. Unlike most modern filibusters, the Kentucky senator is actually attempting to talk through the whole thing -- like Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" -- rather than simply raising his hand to object and requiring 60 votes to proceed. The last ""talking"" filibuster was in 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), spoke out against extending the Bush-era tax cuts. Filibuster reform advocates have proposed returning to this old-fashioned style.

""I will not sit quietly and let him shred the constitution,"" Paul said of Obama, later adding that getting an answer from the president on drone strikes was like ""pulling teeth.""

The White House declined to comment Wednesday.

Paul's speech drew on the work of bloggers from both the left and right who have criticized the president on civil liberties, such as Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian and Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic. Kevin Williamson of the National Review also earned a mention for a piece he wrote asking whether under Obama's standards the Nixon and Johnson administrations should have bombed college campuses.

""To be bombed in your sleep? There's nothing American about that,"" Paul said. ""There's nothing constitutional about that.""

Last week, Paul voted for the nomination of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary -- another key Obama national security appointment -- after first voting against cloture on the matter, saying he was using his vote to try to get more information about Hagel.

Brennan's confirmation was expected as soon as Wednesday, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Following Paul's filibuster, the aide was still ""cautiously optimistic"" that once the senator ended his speech a time agreement for a vote could be reached.

Paul also used his filibuster Wednesday to speak out against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He conceded that he would have supported the Afghanistan war at the outset, but said it had since become far wider than its initial response to the Sept. 11 attacks.

""The problem is as this war has dragged on, they take that authorization of use of force to mean pretty much anything, and so they have now said that the war has no geographic limitations,"" he said. ""So it's really not a war in Afghanistan, it's a war in Yemen, Somalia, Mali. It's a war in unlimited places.""

Paul went on to reprimand Congress for ceding its authority to govern U.S. wars. ""Were we a body that cared about our prerogative to declare war, we would take that power back,"" he said. ""But I'll tell you how poor -- and this is on both sides of the aisle -- how poor is our understanding or belief in retaining that power here.""

This is a developing story. Updates will appear below:

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined the filibuster just before 3 p.m., giving Paul a break after more than three hours of speaking.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) then took over for Lee just after 3:10 p.m. ""You must surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile,"" he said.

Paul resumed speaking around 3:45 p.m, and the filibuster went bipartisan just before 4:00 pm, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) joined in.

Wyden said he intended to vote for Brennan's confirmation, but added that the nomination provided an opportunity to seek more information on the Obama administration's legal documentation for targeted killings. He said the Senate Intelligence Committee had gotten that information.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came to the Senate floor to ask a question of Paul just before 4:20 p.m. Rubio did not criticize the administration's targeted-killings policy per se, but he defended the Senate's right to ask questions of presidential appointment nominees.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined the filibuster just before 4:40 p.m. The Georgia senator, who is retiring in 2014, said that he thought the administration should be capturing and interrogating more suspected militants, rather than launching drone strikes at them. He said that he did not support the nomination of John Brennan.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to the floor at about 4:45 p.m. to try to invoke cloture on the Brennan nomination to allow the vote to happen Wednesday night.

Sen. Paul (R-Ky.) said he would be happy to vote, but that he hasn't gotten the answer he wanted, and therefore objected to holding the vote.

The filibuster showed no signs of stopping as it entered its eighth hour Wednesday evening. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) read aloud supportive tweets.

""I think the technical term for what the Twitterverse is doing right now is called 'blowing up,'"" he said.

Meanwhile, Obama and several Republican senators were dining at the Jefferson Hotel, meeting in an attempt to find a replacement plan for the automatic spending cuts that took effect March 1.

Just after 9:15 p.m., Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) joined the filibuster as it neared 10 hours.

Close to 11:30 p.m., Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) took to the Senate floor, followed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell expressed support for Paul's efforts, and said that he would not support Brennan's nomination if Reid invoked cloture.

Washington (CNN) - Senators won't give their official reading of former Sen. Chuck Hagel's performance at Thursday's nomination hearing until they vote on his nomination to be defense secretary.

But some think Hagel didn't do so well.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='danabashcnn']

Several senators told CNN that during a series of Senate floor votes during a break in the hearing that Hagel's lackluster performance, in the opinion of many senators, was all the buzz on the Senate floor.

One senator who is undecided but was not at the Armed Services Committee hearing says it is ""all the talk – I mean all the talk."" Fellow senators are ""shocked"" by how ill prepared Hagel seemed for basic questions about controversial comments he has made, this senator said.

A Democrat on the committee supporting Hagel shook his head in disbelief, saying he was surprised Hagel was not more forceful, especially since he has been on the other side of the dais and knows how this works. Hagel served in the Senate from 1997 through 2008.

Another undecided senator - this one who serves on the committee responsible for vetting Hagel's nomination - was also taken aback that Hagel didn't have better answers for Sen. John McCain's pointed questions, especially on the Iraq surge. The senator said Hagel could have simply said ""the Iraq war was wrong, but once we were there, the surge was the right way to go.""

Separately, an administration official involved in the confirmation process said ""a lot of what we've seen today is political theater. Chuck Hagel is someone very pragmatic and he wanted to have a conversation. He didn't take the bait. Some people will say he didn't get angry or mad, but that's not who he is. He decided to take the high road.""

But that said, a second official acknowledged ""we think he's on his way, but he didn't round the bases today. He could have. He didn't."" Had Hagel ""rounded the bases,"" he would have ensured no senator would step forward to filibuster him.

To be sure several Democrats on the committee defended Hagel, telling CNN they believe he was getting attacked with unfair gotcha questions on statements he made years ago.

Asked if he thought the questions were fair, Sen. Carl Levin, who chairs the committee, told reporters he thought ""some of the questions where (Hagel) was not allowed to answer was not appropriate.""

He added that he hopes the committee could vote on Hagel's nomination as early as next Thursday.

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama recognized a soldier's struggles on and off the battlefield when he presented the Medal of Honor on Monday.

Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter received the top combat valor medal for demonstrating ""the urge to serve others at whatever cost,"" Obama said, when his combat station in Afghanistan came under attack.

The October 2009 assault on Combat Outpost Keating by some 300 Taliban fighters left eight Americans dead, many wounded and ""almost everyone was left with deep invisible wounds to their hearts and to their minds,"" Carter said after the White House ceremony.

""Only those closest to me can see the scars that come from seeing good men take their last breath,"" he said.

A second soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, in February was presented with the Medal of Honor for his role in that battle. Two living soldiers have not been presented the medal for the same battle in nearly 50 years.

Now, Carter is an advocate for other veterans suffering from the invisible wounds of war, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

Obama recounted Carter's acts of bravery, then said it is ""absolutely critical for us to work with brave young men like Ty to put an end to any stigma that keeps more folks from seeking help.""

The president noted the ""blizzard of bullets and steel into which Ty ran, not once or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times, and in doing so he displayed the essence of true heroism.""

Carter planned to show his family around the Washington monuments, Obama said. But ""if you want to know what makes our country truly great, if you want to know what a true American hero looks like,"" he told them at the ceremony, ""you don't have to look too far. You just have to look at your dad because today he's the sight we've come to see.""

Next week, President Barack Obama will award former U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha the nation's highest award for combat valor for his actions in repelling a deadly insurgent onslaught in Afghanistan in October 2009. He is the fourth living recipient to receive the award for service in Iraq or Afghanistan.

In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Romesha describes his thoughts about seeing Combat Outpost Keating for the first time. The remote outpost was at the foot of three large mountains and surrounded by a river on one side as well. By all military standards, the base was virtually impossible to defend because of the looming mountains that would ultimately give the Taliban a tactical advantage to shoot down into the base and offer deep cover to those fighters in the rocky mountainsides.

""This is a pretty indefensible spot. This is the exact opposite of when you open up the manual and look in to find the definition of finding a defensible spot, this is the total opposite of it,"" Romesha said in the interview with Tapper.

Romesha is being recognized for his courage at COP Keating against the onslaught of hundreds of Taliban fighters. With just over 50 troops inside the tiny base, Romesha directed and led several charges to repel the 12 hour long attack and regain control of the outpost which had been overrun.

The assault on the outpost in the eastern province of Nuristan goes down as one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan with eight soldiers killed and more than 20 wounded.

Romesha tells Tapper in an emotional account about his failed attempt to save a close friend, taff Sgt. Justin T. Gallegos, who was trapped in a vehicle which had come under heavy Taliban fire.

""There was movement everywhere. There was muzzle flashes everywhere. You just couldn’t pick them out fast enough. I tried to hold it as long as I could but when you’re the only machine gun pocking on the COP at that point you start drawing quite a bit of attention and finished the belt and scurried on back,"" Romesha said. ""I called Gallegos and told him told I was sorry. I just told him I was sorry. I couldn’t hold that position for him anymore and they were still stuck."""

An elite Capitol Police tactical team is based just a few blocks from the Navy Yard

They responded quickly but were ordered away by a Capitol Police watch commander%2C one officer says

The Capitol Police are launching an investigation into the allegation

The U.S. Capitol Police have launched an investigation into whether an elite tactical team was abruptly recalled from responding to Monday's Navy Yard shooting massacre before D.C. Metropolitan Police officers confronted the shooter.

Two Metropolitan Police officers entered the Navy Yard without the Capitol Police team and one was wounded by the gunman, Aaron Alexis.

Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus said Wednesday that Chief Kim Dine ordered the independent inquiry, which is to report its findings and recommendations by Oct. 21.

The elite Capitol Police Containment & Emergency Response Team is based just a few blocks from the Navy Yard. A law enforcement source told WUSA-TV the unit was less than 30 seconds from the gate and responded as Metropolitan Police pleaded for help.

A Capitol Police watch commander ""wouldn't let them go in and stop people from being slaughtered,"" one officer told the Washington TV station, which is owned by Gannett, USA TODAY's parent company.

An officer toldThe Washington Post that the officers' union had filed a complaint. The Capitol Police have launched an investigation into the allegation

""We were definitely the closest tactical team in the city,"" the unidentified officer told the newspaper. ""It was at the scene very early on, within a couple of minutes. They were ordered to disengage and turn back. For what reason, we don't know.""

Capitol Police acknowledged that the department had ""offered and provided mutual support and assistance.""

""I take our response to this tragedy and our support to law enforcement partners very seriously,"" Dine said in a separate statement. ""While I am the Chief of Police, at my core I am a police officer who feels strongly about our shared commitment and responsibilities. ... I place a high priority on law enforcement agency relationships and law enforcement coordination and communication.""

Dine, a former D.C. district commander , said that he ""personally offered assets"" to D.C. Chief Cathy Lanier. He also said he was ""in close & constant coordination"" with D.C. police, the Capitol Police Board, the FBI, Park Police and other responding agencies, ""while focused on the security of the Capitol Complex.""

Dine became the Capitol's top cop in December 2012.

The CERT, created in 1978, consists of three ""cells"" — two assault teams of at least six officers each, plus and a counter-sniper unit. Two teams were on duty Monday and the third was training at Fort Meade, the Post reported.

The Capitol Police say ""their primary mission consists of rescuing Congressional members, their staff, and visitors who have been taken hostage by terrorists. Secondary missions include, countering threats made against dignitaries, responding to critical incidents and providing security for major events, such as the Presidential Inauguration.""

Congress created the Capitol Police in 1828 to provide security for the Capitol building. Today, the department's duties include protecting members of Congress and their families in addition to policing congressional buildings, parks and streets covering about 25 city blocks."

John Lewis (D-GA), who was beaten while marching for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on “Bloody Sunday” in 1965, compared National Security Agency (NSA) leaker Edward Snowden to Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

In an interview with the UK Guardian that was published on Wednesday, Lewis said Snowden was following in the footsteps of others who engaged in non-violent civil disobedience.

“In keeping with the philosophy and the discipline of non-violence, in keeping with the teaching of Henry David Thoreau and people like Gandhi and others, if you believe something that is not right, something is unjust, and you are willing to defy customs, traditions, bad laws, then you have a conscience,” Lewis said. “You have a right to defy those laws and be willing to pay the price.”

Lewis noted that is what “we did” during the civil rights movement and mentioned he “got arrested 40 times during the sixties. Since I’ve been in Congress I’ve been arrested four times. Sometimes you have to act by the dictates of your conscience. You have to do it.”

Lewis also said the federal government similarly spied on and targeted Martin Luther King.

“We had that problem during the height of the civil rights movement,” Lewis said. “People spied on, and got information on Martin Luther King Junior, and tried to use it against him, on the movement, tried to plant people within different organizations–that probably led to the destruction of some of those groups.

As The Hill noted, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also likened Snowden to Thoreau and Martin Luther King in June.

“On deciding when you decide to become a civil disobedient–we’ve had famous ones in our career, but some of them only had to serve, like [Henry David] Thoreau only had to serve one day in jail, Martin Luther King served 30 days in jail,” Paul said then."
http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/27/politics/us-syria/index.html,2013-08-27 00:00:00,"['Chris Lawrence. Jill Dougherty', 'Tom Cohen']",Hagel: 'We're ready to go' if ordered on Syria chemical weapons,"Washington (CNN) -- With a flurry of comments and activity, U.S. officials sought Tuesday to lay the groundwork for a military strike in Syria -- though some in Washington are pushing back.

The moves by top members of President Barack Obama's administration come less than a week after rebels claim more than 1,300 people were killed in a Syrian government, most of them dying from use of chemical weapons.

The White House offered legal justification for a strike, with spokesman Jay Carney telling reporters the large-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria presented a national security threat to the United States that required a response.

Carney said Obama had yet to make a final decision on how to respond to what U.S. officials characterize as the worst chemical weapons attack since former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein launched a poison gas attack that killed thousands of Kurds in 1988.

The president continues to review options, Carney said, adding ""nothing has been decided."" Carney assured reporters some sort of response will come.

""Allowing the use of chemical weapons on a significant scale to take place without a response would present a significant challenge to or threat to the United States' national security,"" he said.

Vice President Joe Biden made clear the administration's view of who was to blame, telling the American Legion that ""there is no doubt who is responsible for the heinous use of chemical weapons -- the Syrian regime.""

On the same day Obama talked with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and UK Prime MInister David Cameron, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry consulted allies and indicated potentially imminent action by a coalition likely to include key NATO partners and regional powers.

The United States has already moved warships armed with cruise missiles into the region. Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday that forces were ready to carry out a strike if ordered. A senior Defense Department official told CNN that any strike could be completed ""within several days.""

""We are ready to go, like that,"" Hagel told the BBC, adding that ""the options are there, the United States Department of Defense is ready to carry out those options.""

Syria warns West amid growing talk of military strike

White House: No decision yet

Options available to Obama range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a ""do-nothing"" approach.

The White House has ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime.

On Monday, Carney said that the first step toward a military response in Syria would be the public release of a U.S. intelligence report on the August 21 event near Damascus that reportedly killed and wounded thousands.

A U.S. official who was not authorized to speak on the record told CNN that release of the intelligence report was planned for Tuesday, but Carney later said it would come out some time this week.

Another official told CNN the intelligence report would include forensic evidence and intercepted communications among Syrian military commanders.

Yet there's been some debate, within the administration, over what information should be released. The CIA and other intelligence agencies, for instance, have argued there was no need, and perhaps harm, in divulging details, two U.S. officials told CNN's Evan Perez.

One of the officials noted that the U.S. conclusion that the Syrian government was responsible, as expressed by Biden and Kerry, made releasing underlying intelligence superfluous.

Carney said Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" in the administration that chemical weapons were used by the al-Assad government, telling reporters that ""we see no evidence of any alternative scenario.""

For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces.

However, last week's attack obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate

Legislator: Congress can't 'be pushed aside'

Yet some in Congress say that before Obama orders any strike, they should go through them first.

A group of 31 Republican and six Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday sent a letter to the president urging him ""to consult and receive authorization"" before authorizing any such military action.

""Any U.S. military action could bring serious consequences or further escalation,"" said Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was not among the letter's initial signatories. ""The president should be making the case to the American public, and his administration should come to Congress to explain their plans.

""The consequences are too great for Congress to be pushed aside.""

Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican and influential member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the U.S. response to the Syria situation will influence another regional proliferation issue -- Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons.

Obama ""time and again has basically said that Iran will not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, that's the red line,"" King told CNN on Monday, adding that failure to enforce a similar threat against Syria on chemical weapons would undermine the president.

""This is as much a warning to Iran as I see it, as it is action against Syria,"" King said.

Even some in Obama's own party are cautioning against action that's not suitably inclusive. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN on Monday the United States should only act in concert with an international coalition from at least NATO allies and Arab League members.

""Without their participation, it looks as if this is just a Western-vs.-Islamic struggle. It's not,"" said Reed, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""This is to vindicate a basic rule of international law that these weapons will not be used, not by Iran, not by any power.""

Reed said the most realistic option would be cruise missiles launched from U.S. Navy ships at sea, noting that ""we can have precision weapons that could be fired and keep our aircraft out of Syrian airspace and away from their anti-aircraft systems.""

""The most effective targets would have command-and-control, because you could send a signal to the Syrian regime that if they don't agree to international standards, if they don't make it clear and make it obvious that they're not going to use these weapons, and that we can inflict additional damage on their command-and-control,"" he added.

Earlier, a senior administration official said that assuming Obama decides to go ahead with a military response, any action could come as early as mid-week.

Factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for Russia next week for a summit with G8 allies, and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to Egypt because of the ongoing political turmoil there, the official explained.

Why Jordan wants military meeting to be hush-hush

American officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any U.S. action, which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons. Representatives of three allied governments involved in those top-level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible.

""No one is talking about a long process,"" one European diplomat told CNN.

Russia, China opposition make U.N. action unlikely

While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished, certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly China undermined the possibility that the Security Council would support a military mission.

Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners such as Germany, France and Britain -- all of which have called for action against Syria -- and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide political backing for Obama to order U.S. missile strikes.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said Kerry spoke Monday with his British, Jordanian, Qatari and Saudi counterparts, as well as the secretary-general of the Arab League.

The diplomatic efforts appeared to be working, with an Arab League spokesman condemning the al-Assad regime Tuesday for the chemical attack.

Opinion: For U.S., Syria is truly a problem from hell

In another move, the United States postponed its involvement in talks scheduled for this week in Geneva on seeking a political solution to the Syrian civil war. Russia expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision and warned against any Western military strike on Syria.

Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts.

Dempsey's letter, dated July 19, listed U.S. assets in the region including Patriot missile defense batteries in Turkey and Jordan, as well as F-16 jet fighters positioned to defend Jordan from possible cross-border trouble. In addition, the Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region.

U.S. official: Almost no doubt al-Assad regime used chemical weapons

According to U.S. officials, updated options offered to the president in recent days included:

• Cruise missiles fired from one of four Navy destroyers deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. The missiles would be used to strike ""command and control"" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers. There is no indication that the missiles would strike actual chemical weapons stockpiles.

• Military jets firings weapons from outside Syrian airspace. This option carries additional risks and is considered less likely.

Chemical weapons inspectors reach alleged attack site

To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an ""avoider-in-chief"" regarding military involvement in Syria.

""It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action,"" Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday.

He said he expected a significant response that amounts to ""a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce, not one that turns pink.""

""It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere,"" Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time. ""The president's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country.""

The 844-page bill does not require that any measurement of border security be reached

All U.S. business owners would have to use the federal E-Verify program

The government would have to get a system to track when an immigrant enters%2C exits U.S.

The immigration bill filed by a bipartisan group of senators Wednesday would flood the nation's southwest border with more Border Patrol agents, National Guardsmen and fencing to hold back illegal immigration.

It also calls for additional immigration judges, more horse patrols and 24-hours-a-day and seven-days-a-week surveillance by drones.

But the 844-page bill does not require that any measurement of border security be reached before the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants can become U.S. citizens, and that is an issue with some lawmakers.

""That's not enforcement,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala, said. ""That's the honor system.""

Ever since the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" announced they were crafting an immigration bill in January, Republicans in the House and Senate have said that they need to ensure the border is secure in order to support granting legal status to the nation's unauthorized immigrants.

Many are fearful of a repeat of 1986, when Washington passed a law that allowed up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants to become legal, but did not secure the southwest border with Mexico as promised.

The Senate bill requires several things to happen before unauthorized immigrants can get their green cards, which would then allow them to apply for U.S. citizenship. Among the requirements:

• All U.S. business owners would have to use the federal E-Verify program to check the immigration status of new hires.

• The government would have to establish a system to track every time an immigrant enters and exits the country.

• The Department of Homeland Security, with the help of $6.5 billion, an additional 3,500 Border Patrol officers and National Guardsmen, would have to develop and implement a plan to add more fencing and secure the border. It would set ""goals"" of monitoring 100% of the border, and intercepting 90% of people trying to illegally cross in high-risk sections of the border.

""They all three work together to ensure that this is the most effective enforcement system that this country has ever had,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Gang of Eight, said while outlining the bill Sunday.

But as long as border security plans are implemented, that 90% benchmark does not have to be reached for unauthorized immigrants to continue on their road to citizenship. That upset conservatives as they delved into the bill Wednesday.

Some law enforcement officials along the border were concerned that the security provisions don't go far enough.

The bill sets a goal of intercepting 90% of border-crossers in ""high-risk"" sectors, defined as one where more than 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year. In 2012, that would include three border sectors — the Tucson sector in Arizona, and the Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in eastern Texas.

Donald Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition — which includes the chief law enforcement officer of all Texas counties within 25 miles of the border — said an intensified focus on those sectors would simply lead would-be immigrants to other points along the border.

""It's kind of like squeezing a hose — you're shutting off the water, but eventually it's going to burst out somewhere else,"" Reay said.

Reay said he was happy to see increases in grants issued to local law enforcement agencies, and was thrilled that the bill would provide satellite phones to some people who live and work in remote border regions with intermittent cellphone access that limits their ability to call for help. But he said the increases in manpower along the border wouldn't be nearly enough to stem future tides of unauthorized immigrants.

""Three thousand, five-hundred more agents is not going to cover that entire void that exists along the border,"" Reay said.

But others, such as the Border Network for Human Rights executive director Fernando Garcia, said he feels that the massive increases in manpower along the border are already more than enough. The federal government has boosted the number of Border Patrol agents from just over 4,000 in 1993 to more than 21,000 in 2012.

Garcia said that has resulted in a ""militarization"" of the region, and he called further additions a ""misguided and irresponsible use of resources.""

Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which supports a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, said the border provisions were added to appease conservative voters and members of Congress. But he said complaints raised Wednesday by Sessions and others that the bill doesn't assure a secure border would have been raised no matter what was in the bill.

""Unless it's putting a double-moat on the border, whatever happens, (they) are going to say that's not enough,"" Noorani said. ""The question is: is that practical? What (the Gang of Eight) wrote is something that can be implemented, something that will work."""

As lawmakers in Washington debate an immigration overhaul that could include a pathway to legal status or citizenship for millions of unauthorized immigrants, the figures from the nonpartisan Pew Center are regarded by many demographers as the most reliable estimates of the number of people who might be eligible for those programs.

The new estimates, which are based on the most recent census data and other official statistics, show that the population of immigrants here illegally did not decline significantly from 2009 to 2012, despite record numbers of about 400,000 deportations each year and stepped-up border enforcement by the Obama administration as well as laws to crack down on illegal immigration in states like Alabama, Arizona and Georgia.

Recent figures, including reports from the Border Patrol of illegal crossings at the southwest border, suggest that the numbers began to grow again last year. But Pew researchers said the increases in the 2012 census data — the latest available — were too small for them to conclusively confirm the recent rise."

The October 2009 assault on Combat Outpost Keating by some 300 Taliban fighters left eight Americans dead, many wounded and ""almost everyone was left with deep invisible wounds to their hearts and to their minds,"" Carter said after the White House ceremony.

""Only those closest to me can see the scars that come from seeing good men take their last breath,"" he said.

A second soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, in February was presented with the Medal of Honor for his role in that battle. Two living soldiers have not been presented the medal for the same battle in nearly 50 years.

Now, Carter is an advocate for other veterans suffering from the invisible wounds of war, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

Obama recounted Carter's acts of bravery, then said it is ""absolutely critical for us to work with brave young men like Ty to put an end to any stigma that keeps more folks from seeking help.""

The president noted the ""blizzard of bullets and steel into which Ty ran, not once or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times, and in doing so he displayed the essence of true heroism.""

Carter planned to show his family around the Washington monuments, Obama said. But ""if you want to know what makes our country truly great, if you want to know what a true American hero looks like,"" he told them at the ceremony, ""you don't have to look too far.

“We are making progress but we’ve got to finish the job,” Obama said at a naturalization ceremony for 28 citizens at the White House on Monday. “This issue is not new. Everyone pretty much knows what’s broken. Everybody knows how to fix it. We’ve all proposed solutions and we got a lot of white papers and studies. And we just got at this point to work up the political courage to do what’s required to be done.”

Obama’s remarks were aimed at a bipartisan group of senators who have been working on a proposal for nearly three months. The so-called “gang of eight” had hoped to complete their work Friday, before a two-week congressional recess, but left town for spring break without a deal.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

In January, Obama threatened to send his own bill to Congress if the group did not produce a proposal “in a timely fashion.” His remarks Monday suggest the White House is willing to give the group more time to work before it takes that step.

“I expect the debate to begin next month. I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible,” he said. “We know that real reform means continuing to strengthen our border security and holding employers accountable. … Let’s get this done.”

Obama’s time frame may be tough for senators to reach. U.S. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the judiciary committee, already has cast doubt on the chances of getting a bill through his committee by the end of April. Even if the bill comes to the floor next month a vote would not necessarily follow quickly. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has said he plans to let senators debate the legislation at length, and there remains no clear path for the bill through the Republican-led House.

The senators remain deadlocked over several issues, including the details of a guest-worker program and how the legislation will implement and define security at the border.

Obama has largely steered clear of the talks, instead offering broad elements he wants to see included. The president on Monday used the platform to revive his call for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the key requirement for any bill.

Obama spoke after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano administered the oath to 28 new citizens, including 13 members of the military. Obama praised the group as a reminder of the “promise of America.”

“Immigration makes us stronger. It keeps us vibrant. It keeps us hungry. It keeps us prosperous. It is part of what makes this such a dynamic country,” he said.

Many of the president’s core supporters, especially African-Americans and members of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing who voted repeatedly against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, are expressing the deepest reservations. With rank-and-file House Republicans showing little inclination to back Mr. Obama on an issue on which he has staked his political credibility, scores of Democratic votes will be needed if a resolution authorizing force against Syria is to pass the House.

Democrats say they are being confronted with a difficult choice: Go against the wishes of a president who is popular and well respected in their caucus, or defy voters back home who are overwhelmingly opposed to another United States military intervention overseas.

In the first sign of how splits within the party will loom large over the Syria debate, two Democrats voted no and a third voted present on Wednesday when a divided Senate committee approved a use-of-force resolution with senators from both parties crossing over."

Father is not bitter about CIA analyst%27s decision to leak information

The news has turned family upside-down%2C but dad says he is not angry

Says he does not know whether his daughter is still in Hawaii

The father of the girlfriend to the security analyst whose revelations of secret surveillance programs rocked the globe says he doesn't feel bitter about his family's life being turned upside-down, and he sends his love to the couple.

Jonathan Mills spoke briefly to a handful of reporters from the driveway of his modest Laurel, Md., duplex, saying he didn't know if his 28-year-old daughter Lindsay Mills is still in Hawaii. He said they have communicated by text message but that he doesn't know her whereabouts, or those of Edward Snowden, the former CIA technical analyst working in Hawaii when he leaked details of U.S. government surveillance efforts.

""I know more from your reports than from anywhere else,"" Jonathan Mills told reporters.

Asked how she's doing in the face of the revelations, the gray-haired, pony-tailed Mills said, ""She's holding on.""

Jonathan Mills said he last saw her when she visited about two months ago. Lindsay Mills grew up in the duplex in a modest suburban Baltimore neighborhood. He said Snowden, 29, and his daughter had been dating for four or five years and described him as ""very nice – shy, reserved.""

Asked if Snowden's leak was a surprise, he said, ""He's always had strong convictions right along and it kind of made sense, but it's still a shock.""

Jonathan Mills had originally refused to talk to reporters as he arrived at his home Tuesday afternoon. About a half dozen local police officers were soon dispatched to the home, where they stood in the driveway for nearly an hour. Finally, a Laurel police spokesman persuaded the elder Mills to come outside and speak briefly with the media. The entire interview lasted less than two minutes, and Mills, who spoke in a hushed voice, said it was ""all right"" that Snowden's leaks have turned his family's life upside-down. ""I understand.""

Jonathan Mills added, ""I just wish him good luck and he's got my love.""

Lindsay Mills, 28, said recently on her blog that ""my world has opened and closed all at once, leaving me lost at sea without a compass.""

Mills' latest blog post, on Monday, says she won't be blogging again for ""a while.""

In the post, Mills talks of typing on a ""tear-streaked keyboard"" and reflects ""on all the faces that have graced my path. The ones I laughed with. The ones I've held. The one I've grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu. But sometimes life doesn't afford proper goodbyes.""

Snowden had been hiding in a Hong Kong hotel before checking out on Monday. He told The Guardian that he left behind his family and a six-figure job in Hawaii to disclose the details of NSA phone and Internet data collection.

Lindsay Mills worked with the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe in Hawaii, colleague Terryl Leong said. In a post Sunday, Mills said she was feeling ""sick, exhausted and carrying the weight of the world.""

A post June 3 reports, ""I feel alone, lost, overwhelmed, and desperate for a reprieve from the bipolar nature of my current situation.""

In a post May 13, she says that ""E's"" family would be visiting them in Hawaii.

Andrea Torres, director of the Samadhi aerial dance studio in Honolulu, told The Telegraph that Mills had trained there all of last year.

Torres told The Telegraph: ""She took a beginner's class in silks, and enjoyed pole dancing and inquired about burlesque. She came by herself and she was very fit.""

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), said Saturday in a joint statement that alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be denied a defense attorney and declared an “enemy combatant.”

They added in a statement on Graham’s Facebook page, “It is clear the events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens and terrorize a major American city.”

The two Republican conservatives have demanded that terror suspects not be Mirandized or tried in federal courts and instead be shipped to the detainee prison on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

But the Supreme Court has never said that a U.S. citizen captured on U.S. soil, like Tsarnaev, could be treated as an enemy combatant.

“The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans,” the senators said. “We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives. The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now.

“Under the Law of War we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel. Our goal at this critical juncture should be to gather intelligence and protect our nation from further attacks.”

In a separate tweet, Graham added, “The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to ‘remain silent.’”

Tsarnaev was arrested Friday night in Watertown, Mass. He was being held at a local hospital, and a Justice Department official said he likely would be charged later Saturday. Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. Attorney in Boston, invoked a “public safety exemption in cases of national security and potential charges involving acts of terrorism” as a reason not to immediately read him his Miranda rights against self-incrimination.

In 2011, a Justice Department memo expanded the use of the public safety exception in domestic terrorism cases, so that it can be invoked in exceptional circumstances even when there is not an imminent safety threat. The changes were made after a controversy over the handling of the suspect in the Christmas Day 2009 airline bomb attempt, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was questioned by FBI agents for less than an hour before being read his rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, said in a statement that “every criminal defendant” is entitled to Miranda rights, noting that Tsarnaev became a naturalized American citizen.

“The public safety exception should be read narrowly. It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule,” the ACLU said. “Every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried and true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.”

For the record, 3:30 p.m. April 20: A headline on this post said the senators had called for Tsarnaev to be sent to Guantanamo. They said he should be declared an enemy combatant.

Hackers have figured out how to exploit Java to install malicious software enabling them to commit crimes ranging from identity theft to making an infected computer part of an ad-hoc network of computers that can be used to attack websites.

""We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,"" the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team said in a posting on its website late on Thursday.

""This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered,"" the agency said. ""To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, disable Java in Web browsers.""

Oracle declined on Friday to comment on the warning.

Java is a computer language that enables programmers to write software utilizing just one set of code that will run on virtually any type of computer, including ones that use Microsoft Corp's Windows, Apple Inc's OS X and Linux, an operating system widely employed by corporations.

Computer users access Java programs through modules, or plug-ins, that run Java software on top of browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.

The U.S. government's warning on Java came after security experts warned on Thursday of the newly discovered flaw.

It is relatively rare for government agencies to advise computer users to completely disable software due to a security bug, particularly in the case of widely used programs such as Java. They typically recommend taking steps to mitigate the risk of attack while manufacturers prepare an update, or hold off on publicizing the problem until an update is prepared.

In September, the German government advised the public to temporarily stop using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to give it time to patch a security vulnerability that opened it to attacks.

Java is so widely used that the software has become a prime target for hackers. Last year Oracle's Java surpassed Adobe Systems Inc's Reader software as the most frequently attacked piece of software, according to security software maker Kaspersky Lab.

Java was responsible for 50 percent of all cyber attacks last year in which hackers broke into computers by exploiting software bugs, according Kaspersky. That was followed by Adobe Reader, which was involved in 28 percent of all incidents. Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer were involved in about 3 percent of incidents, according to the survey.

The Department of Homeland Security said attackers could trick targets into visiting malicious websites that would infect their PCs with software capable of exploiting the bug in Java.

It said an attacker could also infect a legitimate website by uploading malicious software that would infect machines of computer users who trust that site because they have previously visited it without experiencing any problems.

They said developers of several popular tools, known as exploit kits, which criminal hackers use to attack PCs, have added software that allows hackers to exploit the newly discovered bug in Java to attack computers.

Security experts have been scrutinizing the safety of Java since a similar security scare in August, which prompted some of them to advise using the software only on an as-needed basis.

At the time they advised businesses to allow their workers to use Java browser plug-ins only when prompted for permission by trusted programs such as GoToMeeting, a Web-based collaboration tool from Citrix Systems Inc.

Java suffered another setback in October when Apple began removing old versions of the software from Internet browsers of Mac computers when its customers installed new versions of its OS X operating system. Apple did not provide a reason for the change and both companies declined to comment at the time.

Adam Gowdiak, a researcher with Polish security firm Security Explorations, told Reuters he believes that Oracle fails to properly test its software fixes for security flaws. ""It's definitely safer for users to stay away from Java 'til Oracle starts taking security seriously,"" he said.

Hagel had been asked to disclose details about foreign funding he had received, either through paid speeches or through entities with which he was involved. In a short statement yesterday, Hagel said he couldn’t comply with the request.

This information is critical to determining Hagel’s fitness to head the Defense Department. As Secretary, he assumes a lead role in defining, and protecting, America’s national security interests. The Senate is absolutely right to demand details about compensation he received from foreign entities. The disclosure will help allay concerns about possible conflicts of interest.

The stonewalling on the disclosure is just the latest stumble in Hagel’s path to confirmation. His performance at his confirmation hearing on January 31st was widely panned. Even Democrat supporters reported they were “shocked at how ill-prepared” Hagel was in the hearing. He didn’t seem ready to answer questions that were widely expected to be asked. On other questions he fumbled, having to later clarify his answers.

The worst part, though, was probably when Hagel admitted “I don’t know enough about [military programs and technology]. There are a lot of things I don’t know about. I, if confirmed, intend to know a lot more than I do.”

Heading the Defense Department is not made for on-the-job training. It is the largest, most complex organization in the world. It is also vital to America’s safety. Hagel has not been nominated for Commerce or Labor, where the nation could easily withstand a failed Secretary. He will be managing America’ military, through a period of budget cuts and reassessment of strategic threats.

Only a seasoned executive, with intimate knowledge of America’s military, could navigate the department and our country safely through those waters. Regardless of party, each Senator must carefully ask themselves whether they can support a nominee who seemed so ill-prepared and visibly incompetent in his hearing. If they do, then they are at least partly responsible for any calamities that may ensue.

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, appearing today alongside Chicago Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, said the terrorism events at the Boston Marathon last week have not and should not deter work on immigration reform.



After an appearance at the City Club of Chicago, both men told reporters that despite the fatal bombing and subsequent efforts to capture the suspects, work continued in Washington throughout the week on drafting a proposal.



""If anything, this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws. We need it for national security reasons. We need it for the economy,"" said Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.



""It's premature to make any kind of a judgment as to the outcome of this. We just don't know all of the facts. So the last thing we ought to do is make some kind of knee-jerk assessment as to how this affects some other bill in Congress,"" Ryan said.



Gutierrez said the federal government spends $18 billion a year on immigration enforcement — more than is spent on the FBI or on other enforcement agencies.



The Democrat contended a comprehensive immigration reform plan, including employer verification and reviewing the status of those whose temporary visas or work permits run out, would allow the money to ""got after the truly bad guys.""



While the House version of immigration reform has yet to be drafted, Ryan said the fact that Republicans and Democrats are working together on legislation could, for a public distrustful of Congress, provide ""an opportunity to prove that divided government can work.""



""I really believe that we have an opportunity to have a real long-term solution and I'm not talking some quick fix,"" Ryan told an audience of about 300 people. ""I'm talking an enduring system that works, that honors the rule of law, that honors the faith of the immigration system.""



Ryan also said there was a value argument to be made for immigration reform.



""We do not want to have a society where we have different classes of people who cannot reach their American dream by not being a full citizen,"" he said. ""That is a very important part of immigration reform.""

According to federal law enforcement officials, the man was being interviewed about whether he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the bombing suspect, were connected to a two-year-old triple slaying when he attacked an FBI agent. There were conflicting accounts of what happened in the moments before the man was shot.

One federal law enforcement official said the man, a professional martial-arts fighter, was shot after trying to grab the FBI agent’s gun. Two other officials said the man reached for a knife and was shot as he attacked the agent. All three officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the episode is under official review.

The man was identified as Ibragim Todashev, 27, a former Boston area resident who knew Tsarnaev from martial-arts and boxing circles. Todashev had recently moved to Orlando from Cambridge, Mass.

Law enforcement officials said Todashev was not a suspect in the bombing. They said he was being interviewed about his possible role in a triple slaying in Waltham, Mass., in September 2011. They said Todashev acknowledged involvement in the killings and also implicated Tsarnaev in what the law enforcement officials described as a drug deal that went bad.

The FBI provided few details about the shooting in Orlando and did not mention the Waltham slayings, but the bizarre twist demonstrated the extent of the ongoing investigation into the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

Dozens of FBI agents and other law enforcement officers have been conducting interviews across the United States and in Russia with associates of Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, the other bombing suspect, to learn whether anyone else was associated with the Boston attack.

The interviews have focused largely on people from the northern Caucasus area of Russia, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent six months in 2012. The Tsarnaev family has roots in Chechnya, part of the restive region, and the FBI suspects that he might have had contact with Islamist militants there last year.

Reached Wednesday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, Anzor Tsarnaev, Tamerlan’s father, said that his son knew Todashev and that he believed the two had met while in the United States.

“All Chechens are like relatives,” the elder Tsarnaev said when told about the shooting in Florida. “This is all so sad.”

He questioned how Todashev could have been killed during an interrogation. “Why do they think they have the right to kill people?” he said. “It was a setup, like with Tamerlan.”

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police four days after the bombing. His brother was captured later that day and faces charges that could carry the death penalty. Before he was charged, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the FBI that no one else was involved in the plot and that he and his brother had acted out of anger over the U.S. conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Shortly after midnight Wednesday, the FBI agent, two Massachusetts State Police officers and other law enforcement personnel went to Todashev’s apartment in a residential area near Universal Studios in Orlando to interview him about his relationship with Tsarnaev and their suspected ties to the Waltham slayings.

The law enforcement officials said he was initially cooperative and appeared to be on the verge of signing a confession when the interview turned into a confrontation. The FBI agent suffered minor injuries, and Todashev was fatally shot.

Todashev was arrested in early 2010 in Boston on charges including reckless driving. This month, he was arrested on a charge of aggravated battery after getting into a fight in an Orlando parking lot, according to police records. At the time of the Orlando arrest, he was driving a Mercedes with Georgia license plates.

Tsarnaev’s name had surfaced in earlier news reports about the Waltham slayings, which remain unsolved. Stephanie Guyotte, a spokeswoman for Middlesex County’s district attorney’s office, said the investigation is ongoing and refused to say whether Todashev or Tsarnaev was a suspect.

On Sept. 12, 2011, police found three men dead in a well-kept rental house on a short, quiet street in Waltham. The men were identified as Brendan Mess, 25, of Waltham, Erik Weissman, 31, of Cambridge and Raphael Teken, 37, of Cambridge. The Boston Globe and other news outlets have reported that Tsarnaev was friends with Mess and that the two met through boxing.

A woman who lived next door to the rental house said she was home that day and consoled Mess’s distraught girlfriend, who reportedly found the bodies and ran screaming outside. The neighbor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she does not want her name associated with the gruesome slayings, said she was told that the men had their throats slashed and that their bodies were covered with marijuana.

“She was horrified,” the neighbor said of the girlfriend. “We didn’t hear a thing that night. . . . The fact that all of this attention has come here again is very painful.”

Authorities say the men died early Sept. 12, but relatives of at least one of the victims insist that the men were killed Sept. 11, the 10th anniversary of the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon. Sept. 11 is the date listed on the tombstone of Weissman, according to photos posted on an online memorial.

At the time of the killings, Waltham police issued a statement saying that detectives did not think the attack was random and that the victims probably knew their attacker or attackers. The Middlesex district attorney’s office later said in a statement that the men died of “sharp-force injuries of the neck.’’

Two friends of Teken and Weissman said they believed the deaths were connected to a massive May 2011 drug bust in nearby Watertown. The bust followed a year-long investigation by federal authorities and resulted in charges against 18 people. Weissman was a founder of a company that produced glass bongs.

WASHINGTON — The head of the Transportation Security Administration has told lawmakers that despite their concerns, he's going to let passengers carry small knives on planes starting later this month.

John Pistole, the TSA administrator, delivered the message in a letter this week to 133 House members who oppose the policy change and who have called it everything from misguided to dangerous to confusing.

Pistole announced the change last month, which will allow travelers to carry pocketknives with blades up to 2.36 inches long onto airline planes starting April 25. Also being allowed back on planes for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks: hockey sticks, golf clubs, small bats.

Flight attendants, air marshals and pilots have objected loudly. So did 133 House members, who signed a letter March 21 urging Pistole to back off his decision,

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, asked TSA ""to revisit this potentially dangerous and confusing policy.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. and a member of the transportation security subcommittee, said the policy change ""seems misguided and frankly dangerous.""

Pistole replied in his letter Wednesday that 3 billion passengers have flown domestically since small scissors and knitting needles were allowed on planes ""without a single reported disruption from these objects."" He aims to focus on riskier threats.

Locking and strengthening cockpit doors has reduced the risk that terrorists can gain control of a plane. But Pistole said the shoe bomber in 2001 and the underwear bomber in 2009 were able to smuggle non-metallic explosives onto planes, and intelligence suggests more bombers are trying to do so.

""Given these real and significant threats, security experts worldwide have concluded that small pocket knives and certain sporting equipment do not pose a security risk that would result in the catastrophic failure of an aircraft and the loss of all life on board,"" Pistole wrote lawmakers.

The House Homeland Security subcommittee on transportation will have a hearing Thursday on TSA's risk-based program. And the TSA's Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which was organized to give the agency advice about its operations, is getting a secret briefing on the knife policy April 22."
