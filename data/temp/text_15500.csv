Despite the apparent diplomatic failure, the White House received an endorsement from the 28-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the key Western military alliance.

After a meeting of the allaince’s policymaking arm, NATO Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement in Brussels that reports of a chemical weapons attacks by Syria “cannot go unanswered. Those responsible must be held accountable.”

The statement didn’t commit NATO to joining any military operation, but gave its blessing for such an effort, said George Benitez, an analyst with the Atlantic Council of the United States and editor of the Natosource blog. “They’re saying: ‘We support what you’re going to do.’”

He said there appeared to be fewer misgivings about military action than before other recent U.S.-led interventions. Germany and Poland, which kept a distance from the U.S., French and British attack on Libya in 2011, supported the NATO statement, for example.

At the U.N., in a meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council, British representatives proposed a resolution condemning Syria’s use of banned chemical agents and called for all necessary means to respond to it.

But officials from Russia, Syria’s principal international backer, made it clear that they would oppose the resolution, killing the idea and foreclosing any further discussion, diplomats said.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said the Obama administration found the British proposal “strong and compelling.” She laid blame for the failure of the diplomatic effort on continued Russian opposition “to any meaningful [Security Council] action on Syria.”

Harf said U.S. officials would consult other countries about possible military action as well as other options, and “will take appropriate actions to respond in the days ahead.”

The White House has sought to build international support for punitive airstrikes against Assad’s government for the purported poison gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21. More than 300 people were killed, and more than 3,000 were injured, according to the Syrian opposition and aid organizations.

Assad’s government denied responsibility for the attack, blaming rebels who have fought to oust him from power since early 2011. The United States and its allies have not yet offered proof to back up their contention that the Syrian government had carried out chemical attacks.

U.S. officials said the goal of any alliance attack on Syria would be to degrade Assad’s military and deter it from further use of chemical weapons. They said they are not trying to topple Assad or change the balance of power in the civil war.

Under international law, military action is justified in self-defense or with a U.N. blessing. But Harf said a strong response is warranted in this case because chemical weapons use violates international law and as well as international norms.

“They have violated the general laws of war,” she said.

http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/09/07/Congratulations-Australia,2013-09-07 00:00:00,['John Hayward'],"Congratulations, Australia","I’d like to congratulate the voters of Australia for doing what the voters of America should have done in 2012:

Australia’s conservative leader Tony Abbott swept into office in national elections on Saturday as voters punished the outgoing Labor government for six years of turbulent rule and for failing to maximize the benefits of a now fading mining boom.

Abbott, a former boxer, Rhodes scholar and trainee priest, promised to restore political stability, cut taxes and crack down on asylum seekers arriving by boat.

“From today I declare that Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business,” Abbott told jubilant supporters in Sydney.

America, on the other hand, will not be open for business until 2017 at the earliest.

It’s always a mistake to overstate the similarities between different national political environments – the differences are profound in even the most similar countries. But there are some sharp parallels to be drawn here, particularly on the need for pro-growth tax cuts, and the squandering of a natural resources revolution. Obama’s War On Energy has some similarities to the way Australians seem to feel their mining boom was wasted:

The election was been pitched as a choice on who is best to lead the A$1.5 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy as it adjusts to an end to a prolonged mining investment boom, fuelled by China’s demand for its abundant natural resources.

Abbott, 55, built up a strong opinion poll lead on the back of promises to rein in government spending, scrap an unpopular tax on carbon emissions, and stop the flow of refugee boats arriving in Australia’s northwest.

His campaign had support from media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspapers, which have urged voters to reject Rudd’s Labor government. Australia’s other major newspaper group Fairfax also called for a change of government, saying

Rudd had painted Abbott’s planned spending cuts as dangerous European-style austerity and said his government was best placed to manage an economy that is slowing but remains the envy of much of the developed world.

This is really a golden moment for any aspiring capitalist economy to eat America’s lunch. We’re years away from being remotely competitive. The Obama Democrats are hell-bent to double down on his failed policies, not just due to ideological rigidity, but because Obama’s ego will never allow him to admit he’s been fundamentally wrong about everything for five years.

And the American ruling class has become quite obsessed with using socialist policies to build invulnerable voting coalitions of government dependents. They take Obama’s re-election as a sign that the American electorate is reasonably comfortable with the New Normal of double-digit real unemployment, expensive gas, a declining standard of living, out-of-control government spending, and all the rest of it. The bar of economic leadership was lowered to accommodate President Obama; the ruling class doesn’t think it will be raised any time soon.

Now is your moment, aspiring capitalist tigers of the world. The American workforce is buried under food stamps and long-term disability checks; employers are wrapped in chains of regulation, held tightly shut with the padlocks of ObamaCare. No corporation in its right mind would relocate into the American quagmire of soaring corporate taxes (with class-warfare battle cries signaling even worse to come), high labor costs, and crushing regulatory burdens. Every CEO in the world watched Democrats march Apple Inc. executives into a show trial and berate them for daring to keep their offshore revenue offshore, instead of bringing it home so Uncle Sam could cut himself a thick slice. They all watched Obama and his party present irresponsible government deficits as an argument for tax increases, rather than government reform.

A weakened America has turned away from its bedrock principles of economic liberty. A huge void is waiting to be filled."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department on Thursday warned Americans not to travel to Pakistan and ordered non-essential government personnel to leave the U.S. Consulate in Lahore because of a specific threat to that diplomatic mission.

In a travel warning, the State Department said the presence of several foreign and indigenous terrorist groups posed a potential danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan.

The personnel drawdown at the Lahore consulate was a precautionary measure and wasn't related to the recent closures of numerous U.S. diplomatic missions in the Muslim world, two U.S. officials said. The consulate in Lahore was scheduled to be closed for the Eid holiday from Thursday through Sunday and no reopening had been scheduled, one of the officials said.

The officials were not authorized to discuss the order by name and requested anonymity.

A spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Meghan Gregonis, said, ""We received information regarding a threat to the consulate. As a precautionary measure, we are undertaking a drawdown of all except emergency personnel.""

The U.S. is evacuating staff to Islamabad, said Gregonis. Emergency personnel will stay in Lahore and the embassy officials do not know when the consulate in Lahore will reopen. The U.S. will continue to evaluate the threat reporting.

Gregonis said the threat was specific to Lahore.

Earlier this week, 19 U.S. diplomatic outposts in 16 countries in the Middle East and Africa were closed to the public through Saturday and non-essential personnel were evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Yemen after U.S. intelligence officials said they had intercepted a recent message from al-Qaeda's top leader about plans for a major terror attack.

None of the consulates in Pakistan nor the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad was affected by the earlier closures."

He Joined The Post In His Previous Assignments Have Included Pakistan Bureau Chief', 'Reporter']",Musharraf goes before Pakistani anti-terror court,"Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s longtime military leader, spent Friday night in comfortable police quarters before appearing in an anti-terrorism court Saturday to formally face charges centering on his 2007 suspension of the constitution and mass firing of senior judges.

The retired general, who ruled Pakistan for nine years, has unsuccessfully sought bail in a showdown with an increasingly assertive judiciary determined to bring him to account for his autocratic actions before relinquishing power under pressure in 2008.

If convicted, he would be the first former army chief to go to prison in Pakistan’s 65-year history, which includes long stretches of military rule and coups such as the one Musharraf launched to gain power in 1999. That prospect has raised fears of a backlash by a powerful military leadership that considers Musharraf one of its own, even if he is no longer well liked among the brass.

In an uneventful hearing, the anti-terrorism court continued the case — which essentially portrays Musharraf as an enemy of the state — until May 4. He left under heavy security, offering the occasional salute, to spend the next two weeks in custody.

There was an element of irony to his appearance in that court: Musharraf famously allied Pakistan with the United States in its counterterrorism operations and war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Musharraf, 69, calls the charges against him baseless and politically motivated, but he began bowing to the law Friday after dramatically fleeing a courthouse Thursday to avoid detention.

It was unclear whether he will spend the next two weeks under house arrest at his villa on the capital’s outskirts, as his lawyers are seeking, or have to remain at an officers’ club attached to central police headquarters in the capital.

While some political analysts have predicted a destabilizing battle between the courts and the army if the retired four-star general is put on trial, others hope for a clean and quick resolution — preferably one that avoids further humiliating Musharraf, whose return to Pakistan last month to run for prime minister has proved disastrous.

A smooth exit would ease tensions in the tumultuous nation as it heads into elections on May 11 that will bring an unprecedented handoff of power between elected governments.

On Friday, Pakistan’s Senate, sitting in a limited session, passed a resolution demanding that Musharraf be tried for abrogating the constitution. All major contenders for prime minister in the upcoming elections have piled on, urging punishment."

MANAGUA, July 5 (Reuters) - Nicaragua has received an asylum request from fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden and could accept the bid ""if circumstances permit,"" President Daniel Ortega said on Friday.

""We are an open country, respectful of the right of asylum, and it's clear that if circumstances permit, we would gladly receive Snowden and give him asylum in Nicaragua,"" Ortega said during a speech in the Nicaraguan capital Managua.

Ortega, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, did not elaborate on the conditions that would allow him to offer asylum to Snowden, who has been at the eye of a diplomatic storm since leaking high-level U.S. intelligence data last month.

Options have been narrowing for Snowden - believed to be staying in a transit area at a Moscow airport - as he seeks a country to shelter him from U.S. espionage charges.

A one-time Cold War adversary of the United States, Ortega belongs to a bloc of leftist leaders in Latin America that have frequently taken up antagonistic positions with Washington.

Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has benefited greatly from financial support from Venezuela, and Ortega was a staunch ally of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez.

Chavez's successor Maduro voiced sympathy with Snowden and described him as a champion of human rights. That suggested Venezuela may help Snowden, who is stranded in Moscow after flying there from Hong Kong on June 23, to find a safe haven.

Snowden's bid for Icelandic citizenship hit an impasse earlier on Friday when the country's parliament voted not to debate it before the summer recess.

Afterwards, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied to another six countries for asylum, adding to a list of more than a dozen countries which he has already asked for protection.

The anti-secrecy organization, which has been supporting Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven since his exit from Hong Kong 12 days ago, said on Twitter it could not reveal the names the countries due to ""attempted U.S. interference"". (Reporting by Ivan Castro; Editing by Philip Barbara)"

Mission compared to making Assad eat cereal with a fork instead of a spoon

No Air Force assets included in the mission planning

%22Degrading%22 Syria%27s military is a term of art%2C not a science

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's choice of the term ""degrade"" to describe an attack on Syria has been interpreted by Pentagon planners as guidance for a limited strike, according to senior military officials.

The weapon of choice is the Tomahawk cruise missile aboard four Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean. Though powerful, the missiles alone would likely not be capable of crippling Bashar Assad's regime, which is accused of using chemical weapons. The targets selected for attack are meant to punish Assad, not swing the tide in favor of rebels seeking his ouster, said a senior officer familiar with the planning.

That officer, another officer with experience in the Middle East and two senior defense officials with knowledge of the planning told USA TODAY the type of weapons that would be used and the type of targets that would be hit. All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the planning.

The attack would involve launches of missiles solely from ships, according to the two senior officers familiar with the planning. The Air Force can fire missiles from outside Syrian air space but are not expected to take part in the mission, the officers said.

""Degrade"" is not a military textbook term, the four officers and officials said. In other words, it is open to interpretation.

Pentagon press secretary George Little said repeatedly in a briefing Thursday that an attack on Syria would not require U.S. ground troops, or ""boots on the ground."" The mission would be limited to deterring and degrading Assad's ability to use chemical weapons.

The strike would be limited in scope and duration, Little said. The security of chemical weapons stockpiles is being taken into account by the Pentagon.

The strike, as envisioned, would be limited in the number of targets and done within a day or two. It could be completed in one fell swoop with missiles, said one senior official familiar with the weapons involved. A smaller, follow-on strike could be launched if targets aren't sufficiently damaged.

A second senior official, who has seen the most recent planning, offered this metaphor to describe such a strike: If Assad is eating Cheerios, we're going to take away his spoon and give him a fork. Will that degrade his ability to eat Cheerios? Yes. Will it deter him? Maybe. But he'll still be able to eat Cheerios.

The two officers with current and recent service in the Middle East say the term ""degrade"" is so vague that it could be used to describe the effect of a single cruise missile strike.

Hagel, appearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill, said a strike would cost ""tens of millions of dollars."" An operation in that range would likely be limited to the cost of launching missiles from U.S. destroyers cruising within range of Syria, according to budget analysts. The Tomahawk missiles aboard the ships, which generally carry dozens of them, cost about $1.1 million each.

A broader strike, one aimed at destroying Syria's air defenses and creating a no-fly zone, for example, would cost $500 million to establish and $1 billion per month to maintain, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has told Congress in a letter.

Likely targets in a limited strike include Syrian air defenses, said Peter Singer, director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Another might be the Syrian Army's Fourth Division, which apparently carried out the chemical attack on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration says killed 1,400 people, Singer said.

Buildings housing headquarters associated with the Syrian military, its intelligence and chemical weapons program are other likely targets."

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

But it appears to have done little to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, curb illegal Jewish settlement-building or craft a unified strategy to keep nuclear weapons out of Iranian hands.

It was a diplomatic mission with a strikingly unambitious agenda, Middle East experts say, and one that failed to exceed low expectations.

Obama’s prods to Israelis and Palestinians to abandon intransigent positions blocking the path to peace were so gentle as to have passed almost unnoticed. He appealed to young Israelis to “put yourself in their shoes” and acknowledge that Palestinians live in repressive occupation with no state of their own. To the Palestinians who have refused to resume peace talks while the Israeli government bulldozes forward with its construct-and-conquer housing strategy, Obama chided that “there is no point for negotiations” if they insist on resolving what divides them as a precondition for returning to the table.

Most worrisome, say those who monitor the volatile region, was a sense that the Obama administration was simply checking off a neglected foreign policy matter from its second-term to-do list. Having tried, however feebly, to break the stalemate in pursuit of a two-state solution to end decades of conflict, the White House can now pass off the task to Secretary of State John F. Kerry and return its attention to the mountain of domestic challenges.

Obama’s popularity among Israelis has plumbed new depths for an American president since his 2009 visit to Cairo, a gesture aimed at opening a fresh chapter in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Israeli polls show a meager 10% approval rating for the U.S. president.

Political conservatives who dominate the Israeli government see Obama as reluctant to back immediate and credible threats of punitive airstrikes against Iran if the Persian state continues to pursue nuclear weapons capabilities. And Netanyahu’s obvious preference for Republican Mitt Romney in last year’s presidential election did little to dispel the impression that neither leader cares much for the other.

Carefully scripted appearances in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem allowed Obama to recast himself as emissary of Israel’s closest political friend. He and Netanyahu traded jovial one-liners in the presence of media microphones and were pointedly seen putting their heads together for a serious chat during Wednesday night’s state dinner. Beyond the atmospherics, though, the two-day visit left little changed.

“If there was any clear message, it was that peace is not going to be achieved by this generation of Israeli leaders,” said George Bisharat, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and senior scholar at the Institute for Palestine Studies think tank.

Obama chose to direct his one impassioned appeal for peace and justice to university students on Thursday, signaling that he has given up on the prospects for progress with Netanyahu and his newly installed coalition dominated by hard-liners, Bisharat said.

Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in territory seized from Palestinians during the 1967 Middle East War has accelerated to the point where there is no hope of creating a viable Palestinian state, Bisharat said. Despite the U.S. leader’s visit, he added, “there is nothing on the political horizon that promises to slow the Israeli colonizing juggernaut.”

Obama’s appeal to Israelis to respect Palestinian rights to self-determination, freedom of movement and pursuit of a prosperous life “might have somewhat heartened” the Palestinians, Bisharat said. But he expressed dismay at Obama’s reference to a two-state solution in which Israel would be for the Jews and Palestine for the Muslims, calling it “the equivalent of declaring support for a white South Africa” in the era of apartheid.

Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of the Jewish Voice for Peace group that promotes democracy, justice and human rights for all in Israel, was likewise disappointed, though not surprised, by the visit’s failure to convey that many American Jews are opposed to the hard-line rhetoric and divisive policies thwarting a negotiated peace.

“There were no new initiatives unveiled, no next step to come out of it. I felt like he was just checking off a box,” said Vilkomerson of the visit, which she likened to “Kabuki theater.”

Those opposed to the “extremist agenda” of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that dominates the shaping of U.S. policy on Israel have despaired of seeing Washington take the initiative in fostering peace, she said.

“The European Union is starting to lead on this issue, with the rise of the BDS approach, the Palestinian call for an anti-apartheid movement in the South African model,” Vilkomerson said, referring to the Boycotts-Divestment-Sanctions strategy aimed at punishing Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands.

Hopefully, she added, pressure will mount on Washington to use its clout with Israel to rekindle the peace process, “but I don’t think it will happen in this administration.”

“He’s not even trying to move the ball. This visit is an investment, a restoration, a reset” of stilted U.S.-Israeli relations, said Robert Danin, senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“Obama is not at a stage where he is going to roll up his sleeves and do it himself to get things going, he’s not going to expend the political capital that would take,” Danin said, referring to the congressional gridlock and pressing economic matters awaiting his return home.

“This visit has a going-through-the-motions quality to it,” Danin said. “It’s like campaigning -- he hates it but it’s got to be done.”

The hawkish intellectuals who spin the geopolitical theories that lead to young Americans being sent to war cannot abide President Obama’s penchant for talking with adversaries and avoiding conflict.

That preference for peace over war threatens to take away from the neocons their top candidate for a future battlefield -- Iran. After years of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy, and after an election that brought a more moderate leader to power in Tehran, the Obama administration decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the challenge of Iran’s drive toward building nuclear weapons. With the deal forged in talks involving the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China, Germany and Iran, a significant step has been taken toward bringing Iran back into the circle of rational actors on the world stage.

Of course the neocons and many members of Congress do not believe rationality is an attribute of which Iranians are capable. Given the history of the last 30 years, the extremism of Islamic militants and the theocratic dictatorship that rules the country, skepticism is not unreasonable.

But it is also true that Iran is a complex nation with a large class of educated, sophisticated citizens and an advanced economy. Even Iran’s mullahs cannot forever ignore political pressure from within and economic pressure from without. The election of President Hassan Rouhani marked a sharp shift away from the wacky radicalism of his predecessor. Both Rouhani and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have given clear signals they want to end the debilitating standoff with the international community.

The tough sanctions were meant to soften Iran’s hard line. With that goal apparently achieved, there is nothing unwise about exploring the possibility of real change. The provisional deal drops some sanctions in exchange for measures that will curtail the Iranian nuclear program and open it up to inspections. In the six months to come, a tougher task has yet to be accomplished: a permanent agreement to end Iran’s quest for the bomb.

It is entirely possible it may not work, but giving diplomacy a try is certainly preferable to a mad march to war.

“We cannot rule out peaceful solutions to the world’s problems,” Obama said as he spoke about the deal with Iran. With the Iraq war over, the war in Afghanistan terminating, negotiations in the works in Syria and now a potential ratcheting down of antagonism with Iran, the president has moved far from the neoconservative militarism that dominated American foreign policy in the George W. Bush years.

If the Iran deal pays off, not only will the president finally earn the Nobel Peace Prize he won so prematurely in 2009, but the neocons will find themselves bereft of any new battlefields."

http://news.yahoo.com/palestinians-unenthusiastic-obama-visit-185949028.html,,[],Palestinians unenthusiastic about Obama visit,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — President Barack Obama will find a disillusioned Palestinian public, skeptical about his commitment to promoting Mideast peace, when he visits the region.

Obama's trip, beginning Wednesday, appears aimed primarily at resetting the sometimes troubled relationship with Israel. But winning the trust of the Palestinians, who accuse him of unfairly favoring Israel, could be a far more difficult task.

After suffering disappointments during the first Obama administration, Palestinians see little reason for optimism in his new term. The White House announcement that Obama will not present any new peace initiatives strengthened their conviction that the U.S. leader isn't prepared to put the pressure on Israel that they think is necessary to end four years of deadlock in negotiations.

""Obama is coming for Israel, not for us,"" said Mohammed Albouz, a 55-year-old Palestinian farmer. ""Obama will come and go as his predecessors did, without doing anything.""

While Israel is preparing to give Obama the red-carpet treatment, there are few signs of excitement in the West Bank. Large posters of Obama hung in Ramallah last week were quickly defaced, and a small group of activists called ""The Campaign for Dignity"" plans on releasing black balloons into the air in a sign of mourning when Obama arrives.

Obama himself played a role in reaching the current deadlock, which stems in large part from disagreements over Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim both areas, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as parts of a future state, a position that is widely backed internationally.

When Obama first took office, he strongly and publicly criticized the Israeli settlements, saying the construction undermines hopes for peace. ""It is time for these settlements to stop,"" Obama said in a high-profile address to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo just months after taking office.

Story continues

When Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Israeli prime minister in early 2009, the Palestinians said they would not negotiate unless settlement construction was frozen. They were further emboldened by Obama's tough stance.

Obama persuaded Netanyahu to impose a 10-month slowdown, but Palestinians did not agree to restart talks until the period was nearly over. When the Israeli moratorium expired several weeks later, Netanyahu rejected American appeals to extend the slowdown, and the negotiations collapsed.

Obama stopped pushing the matter, and talks have never resumed, and the Palestinians, viewing Obama as afraid to take on Israel's allies in Washington, have few expectations now.

""What we are going to tell him behind closed doors is what we are saying in public. There is no secret that a successful peace process needs a complete settlement freeze,"" said Nabil Shaath, a top adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas. ""The Israelis are building on our land and claiming they want to negotiate with us about this land.""

More than 500,000 Israelis now live in settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians say the ever-growing settlements are a sign of bad faith and make it increasingly difficult to partition the land between two peoples.

Netanyahu maintains that negotiations must resume without preconditions, and the fate of the settlements should be one of the issues on the table. He notes that previous rounds of negotiations have gone forward without a construction freeze.

Obama will get a firsthand glimpse of settlements when he heads to the Palestinian city of Ramallah on Thursday. The 20-minute drive from Jerusalem passes by sprawling settlements that are home to tens of thousands of Israelis.

Obama is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leaders and visit a youth center. He plans to head to the West Bank town of Bethlehem the next day to see the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christian tradition says Jesus was born.

Netanyahu, who was re-elected in January, has said he will make a renewed push for peace in his new term. His new government, which takes office this week, is sending mixed signals.

On one hand, he has named former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, a political centrist who has good working relations with the Palestinians, as his chief negotiator. The biggest partner in his coalition, the centrist Yesh Atid Party, has demanded the new government make a serious attempt to restart talks.

At the same time, Netanyahu's own Likud-Yisrael Beitenu bloc is dominated by hard-liners who oppose major concessions to the Palestinians. Another partner, the Jewish Home Party, is linked to the settler movement and would reject any attempts to freeze construction, much less hand over West Bank territory to the Palestinians.

Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said getting talks back on track will require a deeper and long-standing effort by the president and his new secretary of state, John Kerry, who is expected back in the region in April.

""We really hope that President Obama and Secretary Kerry can succeed in reviving a meaningful peace process, succeed in having Netanyahu saying the sentence that he accepts the two states in the 1967 borders,"" Erekat said. ""We don't need new plans. We need commitment.""

The gaps between Israel and the Palestinians are just one of many obstacles. The Palestinians are also deeply divided between Abbas' government in the West Bank, which favors a negotiated agreement with Israel, and the rival Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, which rejects peace with Israel. Hamas has controlled Gaza since expelling Abbas' forces in 2007.

Yehia Moussa, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, told the pro-Hamas ""Felesteen"" newspaper the Obama visit was meant to ""cool down"" the Palestinians ""by giving empty promises that will assist with continuing the (Israeli) occupation.""

Hani Masri, a prominent Palestinian commentator in the West Bank, said the visit might lead to some movement.

""Most likely we are going to see some life in the negotiations,"" perhaps a limited settlement freeze that forces Abbas to resume talks. ""But such a process won't lead to a peaceful settlement."""

Sanger', 'Jodi Rudoren']","Syria Has Used Chemical Weapons, Israel Says","TEL AVIV — Israel declared Tuesday that it had found evidence that the Syrian government repeatedly used chemical weapons last month, arguing that President Bashar al-Assad was testing how the United States and others would react and that it was time for Washington to overcome its deep reluctance to intervene in the Syrian civil war.

In making the declaration — which went somewhat beyond recent suspicions expressed by Britain and France — Israeli officials argued that President Assad had repeatedly crossed what President Obama said last summer would be a “red line.” But Obama administration officials pushed back, saying they would not leap into the conflict on what they viewed as inconclusive evidence, even while working with allies on plans to secure the weapons if it appeared they were about to be used or handed to Hezbollah.

The declaration from Israel’s senior military intelligence analyst was immediately questioned in Washington. Officials said an investigation was necessary, but added that American intelligence agencies had yet to uncover convincing evidence that an attack on March 19, and smaller subsequent attacks, used sarin gas, a deadly agent that Syria is believed to hold in huge stockpiles.

“We are looking for conclusive evidence, if it exists, if there was use of chemical weapons,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said when pressed on the Israeli assessment."

The Russian president's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in Syria, published on The New York Times' website late Wednesday, set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged, some impressed, and some just plain bemused.

Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""insulted.""

Putin said he wrote the article ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders.""

But he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of American exceptionalism.

It was a reference to President Barack Obama's address on Tuesday night, in which he said that while America can't be a global cop, it ought to act when in certain situations.

""That's what makes us exceptional,"" Obama said. ""With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.""

Putin's answer to that?

""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" he wrote.

World reaction

He concluded with the line, ""We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.""

The White House shrugged off the fuss around Putin's jabs at Obama, describing them as ""irrelevant.""

Obama himself ignored a question about the op-ed on Thursday. His chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Putin has a right to his opinion, noting that America is an exceptional nation.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned Putin's views on equality.

""What I found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to God he judges us all - I don't know exactly what his words are but he says `we are all God's children.' I think that's great. I hope it applies to gays and lesbians in Russia as well,"" Pelosi said.

Putin signed a law earlier this year that bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported.

'Hey Putin'

There are others who took issue with Putin's view.

""Hey Putin, next time you wanna write a letter to convince America about something, how about you skip saying we're not exceptional? #rude,"" tweeted Sarah Rumpf, a political consultant in Texas.

Is the U.S. really No. 1?

Russia's wars

The Russian president also annoyed some people by warning against military action without U.N. Security Council approval.

""Man who launched military action in Georgia and Chechnya without UN say-so says wars without it are illegal?"" tweeted the journalist John Podhoretz.

A report commissioned by the European Union said that Georgia illegally started the war with Russia in 2008 but that the Russian response, which involved occupying large parts of Georgian territory, also violated international law.

The two wars between Russian forces and separatists in Chechnya are widely considered to be internal conflicts.

Some Twitter users unearthed a previous op-ed that Putin wrote for the Times about the Chechen war in 1999.

Putin, then the prime minister of Russia, struck a different tone in which he sought to explain Russia's military action.

""No government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes,"" he wrote. ""It is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger.""

""Not a word on UN or Pope or Int'l law,"" Philip Gourevitch, a staff writer at The New Yorker, commented about the 1999 article. (Putin mentions the pope in his op-ed this week as being among those opposed to a U.S. strike against Syria.)

Senator's stomach turns

The overall tone of Putin's latest broadside was too much for Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday.

""I almost wanted to vomit,"" he said. ""I worry when someone who came up through the KGB tells us what is in our national interests and what is not. It really raises the question of how serious the Russian proposal is.""

But plenty of people seemed to think Putin had scored points against Obama.

""I think it's sad to see him acting with more common sense and humanity than Obama,"" said Ashton Blazer.

""Putin made a compelling, though disingenuous, case against military strikes. Its effectiveness shows how badly Pres Obama was outmaneuvered,"" tweeted Marc Lamont Hill.

Power plays

Others saw it in less subtle terms.

""#Putin diplomatically serves it to Pres. Obama in the last paragraph. Can't believe the #nytimes ran this,"" wrote Mary F. Mueller.

For some people, the tension between the two presidents has become a spectacle in its own right.

""Putin plays his next move on our very own NYTimes. This is almost getting as good as Breaking Bad,"" wrote Twitter user @MiketheEye.

Others said the tone of the article brought to mind some of the famous photos of Putin in macho poses.

""Putin wrote his Times op-ed on an Underwood, shirtless, with hunting knife nearby,"" joked Chris Regan."

Gordon', 'Steven Lee Myers']",Obama Calls Russia Offer on Syria Possible ‘Breakthrough’,"Mr. Obama’s statements opening the door to the plan came as support for a resolution authorizing force on Capitol Hill seemed to be receding, with even some who had announced support for it now reversing course. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday evening that he would not take the procedural steps to force an initial vote on authorization of force Wednesday, slowing Senate consideration of the resolution.

A senior Democratic aide said that the developments with the Russian proposal were a significant factor in the delay, which will allow members to consider the plan and also hear from the president, who is scheduled to meet with them at the Capitol on Tuesday in advance of his nationally televised speech to explain his rationale for military force.

Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, made the proposal that could avert a strike earlier in the day, seizing on a seemingly offhand remark by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Traveling in Britain, Mr. Kerry said that Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, could avoid strikes by agreeing to give up his chemical weapons.

“He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week — turn it over, all of it, without delay and allow the full and total accounting,” Mr. Kerry said.

Mr. Kerry’s remarks, especially the reference to the short window of time, underscored the urgency of the administration’s preparations for a strike, and it did not appear to signal a shift in policy. The State Department’s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, later clarified in an e-mail to reporters that Mr. Kerry was simply “making a rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied using.”"

Snowden, a fugitive from U.S. authorities, is apparently still holed up in the transit zone at Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport, an airport official said, according to Interfax. The former national security consultant arrived at the airport on June 23 after a period in hiding in Hong Kong.

U.S. officials have vowed to pursue and extradite Snowden, who was charged by federal prosecutors last month with two violations of the Espionage Act and the theft of government property.

The request for a meeting was sent to Russian representatives of Amnesty International, Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, a Polish civil rights group and a U.N. representative in Russia. Russian Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin was also invited, the Interfax report said.

Snowden also intends to make a statement, the details of which were not disclosed, the report said.

Snowden “intends to express his attitude toward a maniacal persecution campaign unleashed against him by the U.S. administration resulting from which passengers of air flights bound for Latin America are exposed to danger,” the unnamed airport official told Interfax.

A meeting between Snowden and representatives of the human rights groups was set to take place at 4:30 p.m. local time at the Sheremetyevo transit zone, a Foreign Ministry official said.

However, it remains unclear whether the invited parties can enter the transit zone of the airport without possessing traveling documents and having their passports exit-stamped, the official said.

“Other than that, Snowden is a free man, as our president [Vladimir Putin] pointed out, and can make statements,” the official told The Times on condition of anonymity. “However, I think he will heed our advice and refrain from any more leaks, which can do harm to our U.S. partners while he is here.”

[Updated, 4:36 a.m. PDT July 12: In a letter to the human rights organizations, the text of which was provided to the Times, Snowden thanked the “brave countries around the world” that have offered him asylum.

“By refusing to compromise their principles in the face of intimidation, they have earned the respect of the world,” Snowden said in the letter.

“Unfortunately, in recent weeks we have witnessed an unlawful campaign by officials in the U.S. Government to deny my right to seek and enjoy this asylum under Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Snowden said.

He referenced the July 3 forced grounding of a flight out of Moscow that had Bolivian President Evo Morales on board. The flight was forced to land in Vienna in connection with suspicions the plane might be carrying Snowden to a welcoming Central American or South American country.

“Never before in history have states conspired to force to the ground a sovereign president’s plane to effect a search for a political refugee,” Snowden said of the incident.

Snowden said the purported attempts by the U.S. to extradite him represented “a threat not just to the dignity of Latin America or my own personal security, but to the basic right shared by every living person to live free from persecution.”]

USA TODAY

Just 44 of 533 members of Congress say they will vote yes on a strike on Syria

In 27 states%2C not a single senator or representative has committed to voting for the measure

White House lobbying %27a signal of the urgency and perhaps the growing sense of foreboding%27

WASHINGTON — President Obama faces a daunting and uphill battle to win congressional authorization for a military strike on Syria, a USA TODAY Network survey of senators and representatives finds.

The comprehensive poll of Congress finds that only a small fraction of the 533 lawmakers — 22 senators and 22 House members — are willing to say they will support the use of force in response to the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Far more overall — 19 senators and 130 House members — say they will oppose a resolution that would authorize military strikes. There are two vacant seats in the House where lawmakers resigned and have not yet been replaced.

The largest group of lawmakers remains undecided, including a majority of the Senate and the House. That could create an opportunity for the president to persuade them in a string of six interviews with TV network anchors Monday and a televised address to the nation Tuesday. The Senate could vote as early as Wednesday.

""We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address Saturday. ""Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again; that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons. All of which would pose a serious threat to our national security.""

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough made the rounds of the morning talk shows Sunday, making the administration's case.

Congress isn't convinced. In the survey:

•Democrats haven't fallen in line behind the president, at least not yet. Congressional Democrats are as likely to oppose the measure as support it, although most say they are undecided. At the moment, 28 Democrats support action; 28 oppose it.

•Republicans who have made a decision overwhelmingly oppose Obama, by nearly 8-1. Sixteen Republicans support action; 121 oppose it.

•In a majority of states, not a single member of Congress has gone on record endorsing the president's request for authorization of a military strike. That includes a dozen states that Obama carried in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

""I think it's an uphill slog from here,"" House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., one of the handful of Republicans who supports the president, said on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday. He said the White House has ""done an awful job"" in explaining the reason for a strike and added, ""It's a confusing mess.""

On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was horrified by images of the chemical weapons attacks in Syria but warned that the strikes could destabilize the country or even increase the odds that opposition forces obtain chemical weapons. ""I don't think we're going to do anything to Assad,"" he said of the Syrian leader.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said he has heard overwhelming opposition from his constituents. ""And keep in mind, my district voted 77% for the president,"" he said on CBS. ""I think the president has work to do, but I think he can possibly get the votes. But he's got to come before the Congress and the nation.""

On this issue, Obama hasn't been able to count on the classic partisan divide that has defined the capital's politics through his tenure. Some liberal Democrats have aligned with Republican libertarians to oppose a military strike. Some GOP hawks who typically oppose him (including Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama beat for the White House in 2008) argue for action.

Even African Americans in Congress, who have been among Obama's most reliable supporters on other issues, are resistant. Of 42 black lawmakers, two are committed to voting ""yes.""

""This is truly a momentous occasion in which the outcome is up for grabs,"" says Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. He notes the ""high-wire act"" for Obama as he returned Friday from his European trip. ""The urgency you saw with the president hustling back to the States, the national address he'll give — all that is a signal of the urgency and perhaps the growing sense of foreboding in the White House.""

A separate Washington Post count of congressional support Sunday reported different specific numbers but also found a tough road ahead for the president. In the Senate, the Post found 23 in favor, 17 opposed, 10 leaning no and 50 undecided; in the House, 25 in favor, 111 against, 116 leaning no and 181 undecided.

In the USA TODAY Network survey, journalists from USA TODAY and nearly 40 other Gannett-owned newspapers and television stations across the country reported on the views expressed by every senator and all but four members of the House, who couldn't be reached."

WASHINGTON -- When a less-gray-haired Sen. Barack Obama declared, early in his first presidential campaign, that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of estranged nations like Iran and Syria without preconditions, he was roundly chastised by both Democrats and Republicans alike for naivete.

But now, after six arduous, solitary years of standing by a policy of preferring accord with rogue nations over recourse to full-on war, his approach seems to be on the verge of bearing fruit.

In Syria, President Bashar Assad has agreed to open his chemical weapons program to international oversight, and eventual destruction, after a furious round of diplomacy involving Secretary of State John Kerry and top Russian diplomats. And in Iran, a new, moderate president has responded to a personal letter from Obama, engaging in direct communication for the first time in years and hinting that he might be willing to pull back from his country's controversial nuclear program in exchange for a reduction of painful economic sanctions.

None of the developments has occurred without context or notes of caution, but it's nevertheless a remarkable turn of events for a president whose foreign policy, even a month ago, appeared to be in hapless disarray. If the diplomatic tracks in Syria and Iran pan out, proponents say they could point the way to the resolution of two of the most significant international crises facing the nation, without any American-caused warfare.

""The administration's willingness to show both strength and smarts is paying off,"" said Joel Rubin, the director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund and a former State Department official, who has worked to promote conflict resolution in the Middle East through discourse.

""On Syria, the president demonstrated that there was a clear point that he did not want the regime to pass, and then took a window of opportunity to cut a deal that actually advances American security interests even more,"" Rubin added. ""An ancillary benefit has been that it's demonstrated to the Iranians that the U.S. is thinking before it's shooting, and that's a pretty new trend for the U.S.""

Next week, the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, travels to New York for the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). His arrival brings perhaps the greatest hope for a diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Tehran in recent memory, and in turn, a possible vindication of Obama's refusal to condone military strikes against the country.

The Obama administration has yet to confirm whether any United States officials plan to meet with Iranian counterparts in New York. Nonetheless, the prospect of such a meeting has diplomatic circles buzzing.

""If there's a meeting between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of UNGA, that will be huge,"" said a senior Obama administration official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations.

Such a meeting would almost certainly be held well below the presidential level, the official said, most likely between the Iranian foreign minister and a senior U.S. diplomat like Wendy Sherman, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, or Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. It's also possible that a ""chance encounter"" between Obama and Rouhani could be arranged in the halls of the UN.

""Sherman and Burns have the most experience communicating with Iran,"" said the official. ""But whoever it is, it would be a momentous meeting, because this kind of open, direct talks haven't happened in 34 years.""

The past week has seen a number of unprecedented overtures from Rouhani, including a rare interview with an American news outlet and writing an op-ed, published Friday in the Washington Post, in which he called for a new era of ""constructive engagement"" between Iran and the West.

The Iranian government also released nearly a dozen prisoners ahead of Rouhani's visit to the U.S., something that experts say often happens before international forays, but rarely includes such domestic political detainees as the women's rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was released on Wednesday.

And in his interview with NBC this past week, Rouhani said that his country had no intention of ever developing nuclear weapons, adding that he has ""complete authority"" to negotiate a deal over the peaceful components of the nuclear program.

""This is probably the best opportunity that I can think of [for a breakthrough],"" said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council and a longtime advocate of the U.S. taking a less heavy-handed approach to diplomacy with Iran. ""Right now, Rouhani has unprecedented flexibility.""

Skeptics have suggested that Rouhani may have less freedom to maneuver within the hardline elements of his country than he's suggested, especially on the question of the nuclear program. But even some of the most ardent Western dissenters on the regime's capacity to moderate say that the current moment represents one of the greatest openings for dialogue in memory.

Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, and a former top Middle East official in the Bush administration where he often struck a hard line on Iran, said recently that in meetings with the foreign minister in Tehran he has detected an openness to negotiating on Syria.

""It's hard for us to imagine any solution in Syria that doesn't somehow have an Iranian role,"" Feltman told CNN last week. ""The Iranians stated that they understand that we need to get to a political solution. I don't think from my conversations that I had in Iran that the Iranians see it in their interest to see the situation [in Syria] continue or deteriorate.""

Parsi believes that in winning a surprise electoral victory over conservatives, Rouhani has actually earned himself a brief window of opportunity to make a deal with the West -- but it's one that must be struck quickly.

""You have to assume he has six months or so where he can get his way, and where the conservatives will have to be on their best behavior,"" Parsi said. ""This is a moment when he has maximum flexibility -- it will either expand if he gets a deal, or it will be lost if he doesn't. If the U.S. fails to reciprocate, we will be forced to deal with the hardliners six months from now.""

Not everyone agrees that Obama deserves full credit for pursuing diplomacy at the expense of other tactics. After all, while he has avoided troops-on-the-ground combat in places like Iran and Syria, he hasn't slowed his deadly policy of drone strikes in hot zones like Yemen and Pakistan.

And to some participants in the Obama administration's earlier days, the talk of dialogue and diplomacy in places like Iran was often more talk than practice -- the recent openings from Assad and Rouhani, they argue, have essentially fallen in his lap.

""I think he was not looking for diplomacy with Iran or Syria,"" said Vali Nasr, the dean of Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, and a former State Department policy adviser. ""Now that it has come his way, he will be judged by whether he makes diplomacy work.""

Others -- including some of Obama's own advisers -- argue that to the extent Obama deserves credit for the possible breakthroughs, it is instead because he turned against his espoused belief in dialogue, and showed a credible threat against the regimes: For Syria, it was the recent talk of cruise missile strikes, they say; for Iran, it was years of crushing economic sanctions.

""It was that threat of force from President Obama that changed the calculus around the chemical weapons issue [in Syria], and allowed for this diplomatic progress,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters on a conference call Friday.

But while it's true that Obama hasn't always held true to the ideals of his early campaign days -- first-term talk of engagement ""grounded in mutual respect"" eventually gave way to tough rhetoric about ""painful sanctions"" and nuclear red lines -- he consistently resisted the hardline pull, from hawkish members of Congress and Israeli allies, toward a preventative military strike.

""There is too much loose talk of war,"" Obama said about U.S. and Israeli threats toward Iran, in a powerful 2012 speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

For observers like Parsi, it is actually this softer side that has done the most to earn the present detente with Iran.

""What Iranians are largely reacting to now is that Rouhani got a congratulatory letter from Obama. That's not toughness -- that is a huge concession given to the Iranians,"" said Parsi. ""When Iranians are convinced that the other side wants to take military action, the only way they know to respond and try to prevent it is to show how high the costs would be, not to suddenly show flexibility.""

It's a notion promoted by some of the sharpest minds in U.S. policy. Earlier this year, Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Los Angeles Times that without the promise of a softer touch, a strong sanctions regime would only harden Iranian interlocutors.

“Sanctions are easy to do, and afterwards we can tell ourselves that, ‘by God, we’ve really stuck it to them,’” he said. “But it seems to me that the more you press this regime, the more they dig in.”

""Sanctions and pressure are useless if you don't get something for them,"" added Rubin. ""There are going to be some people in Washington who say, 'see, the sanctions are working, let's keep the pedal to the floor and we'll push them over completely and get everything that we want.' But that's not how it works. What the president's saying is, 'let's test them.'""

Officials say those tests are likely to come down to technical issues, such as whether Iran is willing to reduce the number of nuclear centrifuges it currently has in operation. Progress on this front could signal ""whether perhaps there's a place for the U.S. and Iran to meet in the middle,"" said the administration official.

""It's going to be technical specifications, not speeches or tweets or op-eds, that will be the crucial components in determining whether or not there will ever be a true thaw between the two countries.""

Associated Press

U.S. had until Friday morning to resume funding

Dues halted to protest decision to make Palestine a member

UNESCO best known for protecting world heritage sites

PARIS (AP) — The United States has lost its voting rights at UNESCO after an official said it missed a crucial deadline, two years after halting its dues payments to protest the decision to make Palestine a member.

Under UNESCO rules, the U.S. had until Friday morning to resume funding or submit an explanation for its arrears. Neither happened and the U.S. was losing its vote automatically, according to a UNESCO official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the dispute.

The loss of the vote means the U.S. cannot participate in funding decisions for the agency, which may be best known for its program to protect the cultures of the world via its Heritage sites, which include the Statue of Liberty and Mali's Timbuktu.

The U.S. hasn't paid its dues to the Paris-based U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in three years, in protest over the decision by world governments to make Palestine a UNESCO member in 2011.

The suspension of U.S. contributions, which account for $80 million a year — 22% of UNESCO's overall budget — brought the agency to the brink of a financial crisis and forced it to cut American-led initiatives such as Holocaust education and tsunami research over the past two years.

It has worried many in Washington that the U.S. is on track to becoming a toothless UNESCO member with a weakened voice in international programs fighting extremism through education, and promoting gender equality and press freedoms.

""We won't be able to have the same clout,"" said Phyllis Magrab, the Washington-based U.S. National Commissioner for UNESCO. ""In effect, we (now won't) have a full tool box. We're missing our hammer.""

The UNESCO tension has prompted new criticism of U.S. laws that force an automatic funding cutoff for any U.N. agency with Palestine as a member.

But its core mission, as conceived by the U.S., a co-founder of the agency in 1946, was to be an anti-extremist organization. In today's world, it tackles foreign policy issues such as access to clean water, teaches girls to read, works to eradicate poverty, promotes freedom of expression and gives people creative thinking skills to resist violent extremism.

Among UNESCO programs already slashed over funding shortages is one in Iraq that was intended to help restore proper water facilities. Another was a Holocaust and genocide awareness program in Africa to teach about non-violence, non-discrimination and ethnic tolerance, using the example of the mass killing of Jews during World War II.

This loss is a particular blow to the U.S., since Holocaust awareness was one of the areas the country aggressively promoted in the agency's agenda when it rejoined in 2002 after an 18-year hiatus, during which the U.S. had withdrawn from the organization over differences in vision.

The concern over UNESCO is resonating in the U.S. Congress.

""The United States must not voluntarily forfeit its leadership in the world community,"" Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, told The Associated Press in an email.

With efforts by President Barack Obama to get the money restored having failed or stalled, Ellison plans to introduce legislation in Congress to overturn what he calls the ""antiquated"" laws that automatically halted the flow of funds to the agency from November 2011.

The Obama administration has proposed language to amend the legislation, but it remains on the table amid recent U.S. budget setbacks.

For some it's a question of sooner rather than later, with the U.S. racking up arrears to UNESCO of some $220,000 a day, which it will have to pay back if it ever wants to fill the empty chair and get back the vote.

""Paying off three years is manageable, but it indeed becomes much more difficult if you allow many years to pass and the bill gets larger and larger and larger,"" said Esther Brimmer, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for international organizations.

The Palestinian Ambassador to UNESCO, Elias Sanbar, said other countries are beginning to make up for the U.S. shortfall.

""Is this in the interest of the U.S., to be replaced?"" he asked.

UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova lamented the changes that are not only seeing America silenced within her organization but also bringing UNESCO financially to its knees.

""I regret to say that I'm seeing, in these last two years . a declining American influence and American involvement,"" Bokova told The Associated Press.

""I can't imagine how we could disengage with the United States at UNESCO. We are so intertwined with our message. . What I regret is that this decision became so divisive and triggered this suspension of the funding,"" she added.

Bokova said she accepts political reality and would find ways for UNESCO to continue its work, despite a 2014 budget that's down by an estimated $150 million.

Some fear this debacle is just the tip of the iceberg, and worry about more serious consequences, if Palestine joins other agencies such as the World Health Organization."

(CNN) —

Israel has agreed to free a limited number of Palestinian prisoners in a goodwill gesture, an Israeli minister said Saturday, a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a step toward revived peace talks.

An agreement has been reached that “establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between” Palestinians and Israel, Kerry said Friday in Amman, Jordan.

“This is a significant and welcome step forward,” Kerry said.

The announcement came as Kerry visited the Middle East this week and came up with a formula for reanimating peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian territories, a source close to the talks said.

Israel’s defense minister said Saturday that his government expressed its intention to begin talks with the Palestinians immediately.

“We are getting to the negotiations with clean hands and great desire to get to an arrangement that will end the conflict,” Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon said.

Kerry has been working intensely with the Palestinian side to get them on board, and he met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as chief peace negotiator Saeb Erakat.

Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s Minister of Strategic Affairs, spoke of the prisoner release Saturday morning during a discussion in Ramat Gan, said his spokesman, Yair Cohen.

“As the negotiations proceed, Israel agrees to free, as a goodwill gesture, a limited number of prisoners during the period of the negotiations,” Steinitz said.

It is not yet clear how many prisoners will be released and who they will be.

Caught by surprise?

A senior Palestinian official, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation, told CNN there was much uncertainty over the latest developments.

“It looks like all the Palestinian leadership were taken by surprise regarding the decision and announcement by Mr. Kerry and the decision by President Abbas,” he said. “There is nothing clear and we need clarifications.”

The official said all prisoners being held in Israeli jails should be freed, but that no information has been given on who might be released.

Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator and leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, a political party, told CNN that the negotiations “are bound to fail sooner than later” if there is no commitment to clear terms of reference and a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territory.

Kerry’s declaration “reveals a very fragile situation which could collapse at any moment because of internal differences in the Israeli government, which refuses to commit to internationally accepted 1967 borders, and which is refusing to stop the settlement construction and activities,” he said.

On prisoners, Barghouti said: “We welcome any release of prisoners, especially who were arrested before 1993.” But, he added, “It makes no sense if Israel releases 200 prisoners and arrests 250 in the same month.”

’Courageous leadership’

Speaking in Amman, Kerry said that if everything goes as expected, representatives for the two sides will join him in Washington “for initial talks within the next week or so, and a further announcement will be made by all of us at that time.”

Kerry praised the “courageous leadership” of both Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying they had chosen to make difficult decisions.

“They have courageously recognized that in order for Israelis and Palestinians to live together side by side in peace and security, they must begin by sitting at the table together in direct talks.”

Kerry thanked Jordan’s King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Nasr Judeh for their help during his visit, as well as the Arab League for its support of the peace initiative.

King Abdullah arrived in Cairo on Saturday to brief Egyptian officials about the agreement reached between the Palestinians and Israel on resuming peace talks, Jordan’s royal court press office said.

His visit is the first to Egypt by a foreign head of state since the July 3 ousting of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy.

Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces and the U.S. European Command are scheduled to hold a bilateral aerial exercise Sunday by both of their air forces, Israeli officials said. The regularly scheduled exercises will last about two weeks.

’Right for our future’

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni lauded the prospect of peace.

“These past few months were long, filled with doubt and cynicism,” Livni said in a statement Friday. “But now, four years of political stagnation are coming to an end.

“I know that, despite this being an opportunity, once the negotiations begin they will be complex – but I am convinced with all my heart that this is the right thing for our future, our security, our economy and Israel’s values.”

She expressed respect for Netanyahu “for making the decisions representing Israel’s important interests, as well for American Secretary of State, John Kerry, which led us and the Palestinians into the negotiations room.”

In the Palestinian territory of Gaza, however, Hamas dismissed the renewed effort for peace talks.

“This negotiation will be useless. It is not going to achieve anything for the Palestinian people. It will not help the prisoner issue, the border issue or the land issue,” the group said in a statement. Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza shortly after Hamas was elected to run its government in 2006.

Talks based on land swaps, pre-1967 borders?

Kerry urged people to wait for all the elements of the agreement to be formalized, rather than guess at the detail.

“Any speculation or reports you may read in the media … are conjecture … because the people who know the facts are not talking about them,” he said.

One of the reports Kerry may have been referencing was a Reuters report quoting an Israeli official who said the Jewish state agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps.

It would be in line with a decades-old United Nations resolution calling on Israel to release territories it gained during a war, a demand that Israel has historically fought. But it would help create contiguous borders for a future Palestinian state that would coexist next to a Jewish state.

Israel’s official reaction to the report has been denial.

U.S. officials are handing responsibility -- and up to $80 million -- to President Hamid Karzai’s government to finish refurbishing the Kajaki Dam and power system in the southern province of Helmand as President Obama brings home U.S. troops and cuts back Washington’s nation-building experiment in Afghanistan.

No project symbolizes America’s vast ambitions -- or deep frustrations -- in Afghanistan more than the effort to boost production from Kajaki Dam to provide electricity to the Taliban heartland, a goal military commanders long deemed essential to blunting the insurgency.

But ceding control of the mammoth development project carries clear risks. Chief among them: The Afghan government may further delay or abandon construction, turning one of the largest investments in the nearly $100-billion U.S. relief and reconstruction effort into an enduring example of failure.

The Kajaki project reflects the challenge the Obama administration faces as American military involvement diminishes: closing out the U.S. combat role while entrusting Afghan institutions with protecting hard-won security and development gains.

U.S. officials in Kabul, the capital, say the state-run utility, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat, known as DABS, will finish work at Kajaki by the end of 2017 -- 12 years after the dam upgrade began and three years after U.S. combat troops are scheduled to depart Afghanistan.

“It’s great news for us that the [Afghan] government has shown this kind of interest and ownership,” said Ken Yamashita, Kabul mission director for the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, which has managed the project. “It’s very rewarding to us to see ... that DABS is now capable of doing this.”

But others question the 4-year-old utility’s competence and experience, as well as the government’s commitment to a project that insurgents have violently opposed. To finish the construction, Afghan troops must secure a crucial supply road leading to the dam that has come under frequent attack.

President Obama’s decision to increase the U.S. troop level in 2010 focused on retaking ground in southern Afghanistan. Some of the fiercest fighting occurred in Helmand province, where at least 29 Marines were killed clearing the road to Kajaki. Many others were grievously wounded.

Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, then-commander of U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan, argued at the time that improving the Kajaki Dam would create jobs and promote agriculture, thus weakening support for the insurgency.

“It’s safe to say the Marines have a jaundiced view of [the handoff] given the sacrifices they made to clear the area,” a former U.S. official in Kabul said.

Until this year, Black & Veatch, an engineering company based in Overland Park, Kan., had a $266-million contract that included installing an 18-megawatt turbine at Kajaki that would increase the dam’s peak electrical generation by more than half.

But during a visit to Washington in January, Karzai demanded that more development work be funneled through his government. He specifically cited the dam.

Although many at USAID opposed the move, the agency rewrote the contract to put DABS in charge of the turbine. The Afghan utility is expected to select a construction company this year to finish the work at a cost of $60 million to $80 million, according to preliminary estimates.

“As with any large infrastructure project, this one is with risk,” Yamashita said. “We’re all committed to making it succeed.”

Nestled in dun-colored hills, the hydroelectric complex -- an aging power station, a 300-foot-high earthen dam and an emerald-green reservoir -- was built in 1953 by the American engineering giant Morrison-Knudsen.

By hiring the firm that had built the Hoover Dam and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Afghanistan’s king, Mohammed Zahir Shah, sought to modernize his nation. The U.S. government saw a way to expand its influence on the doorstep of the Soviet Union during the depths of the Cold War.

In the mid-1970s, USAID installed two turbines in the dam’s power station, but the complex decayed over the next quarter-century of Soviet occupation, civil war and Taliban rule.

By 2001, the station was barely producing power. Washington bureaucrats flush with post-Sept. 11 dollars seized on the idea of a third turbine, which would boost the dam’s 33-megawatt peak output. It would provide electricity to Helmand and neighboring Kandahar province, traditional Taliban strongholds.

In 2005, USAID contracted a Chinese government company to install the third turbine. But by the time the Chinese were ready to transport it to the dam, British forces had taken over Helmand from U.S. troops and were battling a rejuvenated insurgency.

It took a six-day military operation involving 4,000 British troops, backed by U.S. airstrikes, to deliver the massive apparatus to the dam in the summer of 2008.

But the Chinese engineers left Kajaki that fall, claiming a Taliban kidnapping threat. Since then, the turbine parts have sat in dozens of huge metal containers, unopened, in dirt at the dam compound.

U.S. combat units have departed the area, leaving Afghan soldiers and police in charge. But militants still rule nearby villages and siphon electricity, without payment, from the overburdened transmission lines.

Over the winter, Taliban fighters captured several dam workers and accused them of deliberately depressing the power output.

“We said, ‘Just please allow us to install [the turbine], then you will have more power. Otherwise there is no chance,’ ” said the dam’s longtime chief engineer, Sayed Rasoul, a genial man with a bushy beard. “Finally they accepted.”

Rasoul said the Taliban would permit the Afghan-led installation to proceed because they also want more reliable electricity. But the regional governor, Mullah Abdul Razzaq Akhund, said the insurgents’ patrons in Iran and Pakistan view the dam as an example of unwanted foreign influence.

“The Taliban want to stop this project if they can,” he said.

It’s far from clear that the Afghan utility has the experience to administer the project. A recent audit by the Pentagon’s special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction found that $23 million in U.S. gear had gone unused by DABS in Helmand and Kandahar because the utility “lacked the capacity to install and manage the equipment.”

Mirwais Alami, DABS’ chief commercial officer, said the utility would work closely with USAID and others on what is its biggest project by far. “This was a very good decision by the Americans,” he said at his office in Kabul.

Though insurgents and some villagers are skeptical of the U.S. role in Kajaki, DABS officials are spreading the word to local elders that the hydroelectric project is now Afghan-run.

“The people are very interested in supporting this project,” Alami said. “We had thousands of foreign security forces and no progress. This has gone on for five, six, eight years. It should really have only taken one year.”

After four days of talks that repeatedly appeared ready to collapse, officials announced that they had agreed on a six-month deal aimed at giving Iran limited sanctions relief in return for temporary curbs on its nuclear program.

The deal could ease the threat of war and reduce tension between the U.S. and Iran, but it could also prove difficult to implement, and the follow-up long-term agreement could be far more difficult to nail down, U.S. officials acknowledge.

“Iran, like any nation, should be able to access peaceful nuclear energy, but because of its record of violating its obligations, Iran must accept strict limitations on its nuclear program that make it impossible to develop a nuclear weapon,” President Obama said in a late-night statement aired from the White House.

“The burden is on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes,” Obama said.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said on his Twitter account at 3:03 a.m. Geneva time, “We have an agreement.”

The deal, described by Obama as “an important first step toward a comprehensive solution,” is intended to open the way for what is likely to be even tougher bargaining to reach a comprehensive agreement.

U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, speaking in Geneva, said that limiting Iran’s nuclear program would expand the time Tehran would need to reach a nuclear weapons capability.

“It will make our ally Israel safer,” he said in a news conference.

But the deal was quickly denounced by leading Republicans in Washington.

“Amazing what WH will do to distract attention from O-care,” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in a Twitter statement.

Obama administration officials have said an agreement would ease what has been long viewed as one of the world’s most urgent security challenges. Iran is believed by some experts to be close to acquiring bomb-making capability, and the administration has threatened to use force, if necessary, to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Even though the six countries and the new government in Iran were eager for a deal, they had clashed over a series of issues related to how closely supervised Iran’s huge nuclear program would be and how much relief it would get from the penalties that have been crushing its economy.

A senior U.S. official said the agreement would halt progress at nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz and the partially built heavy-water reactor at Arak. It also calls for more intrusive inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities and for the “neutralization” of its medium-enriched uranium, which is considered a threat because it can be readily converted to bomb fuel.

Iranian news agencies said the deal recognized Iran’s “right to enrich” uranium, but U.S. officials denied that.

Zarif acknowledged after the announcement that the right demanded by Iran was not spelled out in the text of the agreement. But in a news conference, he said it did not need to be specified because it was Iranians’ inalienable right.

Under the deal, Iran will be allowed to continue producing low-enriched uranium, suitable for energy generation, and it won’t be required to send its nuclear material out of the country, as Western governments previously demanded, said the official Fars News Agency.

As part of the deal, Iran agreed not to install any additional centrifuges, and not to begin operating any of the thousands that are not yet operational. But the deal doesn’t require Iran to dismantle any of its centrifuges, a demand made by Israel.

The agreement will allow Iran to accumulate more low-enriched uranium, to eight tons from the current seven. But it also provides that by the end of the six-month period it must turn that extra material into an oxide form that makes it at least temporarily unusable as bomb fuel.

Sanctions on the use of gold and other precious metals in trading will be lifted, as will sanctions on insurance and the transportation industry.

Advertisement

But that easing will be temporary, and the six nations — the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — have insisted that core sanctions blocking oil exports and banking transactions will remain in place.

Kerry said the easing of sanctions would be worth $5.7 billion to Iran — $4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales and $1.5 billion in revenue through easing of sanctions on precious metals and the transportation sector. But he said that the remaining penalties would deprive Iran of $14 billion to $16 billion during the six-month period.

Obama will issue an executive order to carry out the sanctions relief, meaning that he won’t have to seek Congress’ approval.

The president has long hoped that reaching out to the Iranian government, an adversary since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, could bear fruit. Administration officials hope the deal can open the way to a new relationship between the countries.

Advertisement

But it is likely to come under fire from Israel and other Mideast allies, which have expressed fear that an agreement would prove too lenient and would open the way for Iran to secretly acquire a nuclear weapons capability.

Congress could also seek to legislate conditions that could hobble the agreement.

Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), a chief advocate for sanctions, said the agreement “appears to provide the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism with billions of dollars in exchange for cosmetic concessions that neither fully freeze nor significantly roll back its nuclear infrastructure.

“Furthermore, the deal ignores Iran’s continued sponsorship of terrorism, its testing of long-range ballistic missiles and its abuse of human rights,” he said.

White House officials made calls to Capitol Hill on Saturday evening as the news broke, a senior administration official said. The administration believes that lawmakers will see that this test of negotiations “is far preferable to the alternative,” the official said.

The official said the president planned to speak to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.

The official also acknowledged that the U.S. had conducted separate bilateral discussions with the Iranians throughout the fall. He was responding to an Associated Press report that outlined secret talks between the two countries.

The official said those talks complemented rather than competed with the multinational negotiations. The conversations were an attempt to discuss “ideas that could then be merged” into the negotiations, the official said.

Ali Vaez, an Iran specialist at International Crisis Group in Istanbul, Turkey, though a strong supporter of the diplomatic effort, said he thought the next round of negotiations may prove “almost impossible.”

Zarif said at the news conference that the deal was “an important achievement. But it’s a first step.”

He said the two sides had agreed to create a special commission to oversee the new restrictions on the nuclear program and the easing of sanctions.

“I hope the outcome of this process, in addition to the resolution of the nuclear issue, will be to take concrete steps in the restoration of confidence, particularly the confidence of the Iranian people toward the West,” Zarif said. “That would be a new beginning.”

Asked whether the deal had averted the threat of war, he said, “If we have been able to prevent an illegal action, that will be a major accomplishment.”

The agreement was announced during the third round of talks in the last five weeks. Negotiators for both sides have been alternatively expressing confidence that they were on the edge of a deal and warning that talks might be broken off.

Iran has been resistant to accepting curbs on its nuclear program, which its citizens view as a sign of the country’s technological prowess. From 2003 until this year, Iran showed little interest in acceding to the wishes of the United Nations Security Council to accept limits on its program.

But Iran’s tone shifted in June, after Hassan Rouhani unexpectedly won the presidency with a mandate to ease the crushing economic pressure.

Rouhani was open to the Obama administration’s diplomatic outreach and spoke on the phone with the president in September, the first time the country’s leaders had spoken in 34 years.

Kerry said it was not yet time to begin considering other steps to improve the U.S.- Iran relationship. “It’s too early for us to talk about other things,” said Kerry. “It’s just not right.”

Iran’s goodwill has to be proved “by the actions that it takes,” he said.

May Not Comply with Congressional Subpoena on Benghazi,"Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the State Department has not decided if it will comply with a congressional subpoena demanding documents related to the crafting of Benghazi talking points for Susan Rice.

Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) sent a five-page letter on Tuesday explaining why he as chair of the Oversight Committee issued the subpoena and what documents he expects to be delivered by June 7th.

Issa is requiring the release of more emails between top Administration officials regarding Benghazi talking points given to Ambassador Susan Rice before her appearance on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the Benghazi attack. The Congressman claims that the emails previously given to the House committee were “incomplete” and noted these documents were released to the press five days before they were given to Congress.

Asked about the State Department’s response to the letter, Psaki praised the “unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress” on the issue of Benghazi. “But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress,” Psaki added. The Spokeswoman said that the Department is “taking stock” and “determining the next appropriate steps.”

“You haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?” a reporter asked Psaki. “That’s correct,” she responded.

Read the transcript and watch the video below:

QUESTION: New topic? Yesterday, Chairman Issa sent a letter to Secretary Kerry and issued a subpoena for documents relating to the development of the talking points used by Susan Rice and communications between 10 current and former State officials. Do you have a reaction? Has he responded? And does the Department intend on complying with the – I believe it’s June 7th deadline for supplying these documents? MS. PSAKI: Well, let me just remind everyone since given the opportunity that we have demonstrated unprecedented – an unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging now in nearly 40 hearings, briefing members of staff, and – members and staff – and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees. On this specific issue, you’ll recall that a hundred pages of documents on the talking points were released just weeks ago. They were inclusive of the emails around this issue, and from our perspective, the CIA-led interagency process, as we now know through which these talking points were developed, has been thoroughly addressed publicly. But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress, and we are taking stock of this recent subpoena and determining the next appropriate steps. QUESTION: Since a hundred pages of emails were actually sent to them and everybody observed it, and in fact, there was a lot of backtracking on initial content and so on, what else – what is being subpoenaed? MS. PSAKI: I encourage you to ask Chairman Issa that question. QUESTION: Has the Secretary responded? MS. PSAKI: No. I just said we’re determining the next appropriate steps. QUESTION: So just a quick follow-up to that just for clarity. So when you say you’re determining the next appropriate steps, you haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena? MS. PSAKI: That’s correct. But we have provided, just as a reminder, of course, a hundred pages of documents on the talking points that this is regarding.

The president’s plan, which would rewrite two constitutional amendments, challenges a bedrock assumption of Mexico’s national identity — its total sovereignty over its energy resources — by inviting private companies to explore and pump for oil and natural gas.

Mr. Pena Nieto’s goal, like those of presidents before him, is to recharge Mexico’s economy by tackling areas that analysts agree hinder its expansion, which has averaged just 2.2 percent a year since 2001, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Perhaps the worst of those is the creaky energy sector. Demand for energy in the country is growing so fast that Mexico could turn from an energy exporter to an energy importer by 2020, the government says."

From reading the transcript – no U.S. press were present, so we are reading the transcript – it seems that Kerry is suggesting that Tamerlan was radicalized during his time in Russia. You’re saying that that is not what he meant to say and that he was speaking more broadly about radicalization.

MR. VENTRELL: Right. I’m clarifying his remarks and saying that he was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism. This isn’t about new details about the ongoing investigation.

QUESTION: So when he learned something, it was about radicalism, but he learned about radicalism; he wasn’t radicalized? That doesn’t make too much sense to me.

MR. VENTRELL: Again, my understanding of this informal press availability is that there was a question broadly about terrorism and foreign fighters, and it was in that context that he was saying that people can be radicalized by extremism. But this isn’t about drawing any conclusions about the specific law enforcement investigation.

QUESTION: So what did he learn? He learned something.

MR. VENTRELL: Again, we’re not getting into any more details about the —

QUESTION: Right. But you put out a statement and the clarification doesn’t clarify anything. So did he learn – was he radicalized in Russia?

Story highlights Experts: Beyond human suffering, Syria has practical implications for Americans Syria is ""Iran's arm in the Middle East,"" geopolitical strategist says Syria is bordered by countries in which the U.S. has a vested interest Oil prices could be affected by continued conflict in Syria

(CNN) —

In between taking care of their families, working and trying to keep up with everyday life, many Americans have caught at least a couple stories about Syria. Many probably know that clashes between government forces and protesters who want the country’s president to relinquish power have become increasingly bloody over the past several months. Much of that violence has been represented in online videos, ostensibly that Syrians have posted, suggesting the slaughter of children and families.

It’s horrible. No one would argue anything else. But there is violence in many corners of the world. Why should what’s happening in Syria be especially important to Americans? It’s clear a lot of people think it’s not. Several readers reacted to Tuesday’s top story on CNN about Syria by commenting: “Zzzzzz not our problem” and “Anyone surprised? *yawn*.”

“We are afraid to ask this question – ‘Why care?’ – because it’s like saying we don’t mind that there’s a humanitarian crisis happening or that people are suffering,” said Hillary Mann Leverett, a Washington-based professor, blogger and one of the nation’s foremost Middle East and Syria experts. She is a former National Security Council adviser to President George W. Bush and has interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a book about Syria authored by her husband, Flynt Leverett, also a Middle East expert.

“People have to know it’s allowed to take a discussion beyond the human suffering,” she said. “There are huge, practical consequences for the United States when it comes to Syria.”

Like what?

CNN asked Hillary Mann Leverett; Joseph Holliday, a former U.S. soldier turned foreign policy analyst; and Robert Zarate, a geopolitical strategist with Capitol Hill experience, to explain why Americans should care about Syria.

1. Geography. Think of Syria as the Middle East’s core. When it’s weak and destabilized, the body is susceptible to serious injury. Violence in Syria could easily spill into bordering Iraq, where the United States recently ended a war that ran from March 2003 to December 2011 and where U.S. troops and American civilians still work.

Beyond Iraq, Turkey, a U.S. ally, borders Syria as do Jordan and Lebanon. If Lebanon is shaken too badly by conflict in Syria, Lebanon could fall into a civil war as it did decades ago, Holliday said. That kind of conflict would spark yet another serious political and diplomatic problem that the United States would inevitably have to address.

2. Al Qaeda. The United States’ No. 1 enemy would appreciate another failed state from which to operate in the Middle East.

3. Iran. Syria supports Iran. Iran has had a contentious relationship with the United States for decades. Remember Bush’s “Axis of Evil”? That trifecta was Iran, North Korea and Iraq.

“Syria is Iran’s arm in the Middle East,” Zarate said. “Iran has used Syria as a staging ground to train and support militants who have crossed into Iraq to hurt our troops and to train for other terrorist activities.”

Each expert CNN spoke with pointed out that Iran has a nuclear program. Whether it has capabilities for nuclear weapons is something the United States and most of the world doesn’t know.

4. Oil prices. Though Syria produces far less oil than Libya, for example, violence in Syria could affect global oil speculation and prices, Leverett said. Ultimately, that affects how much American consumers pay at the pump.

5. The economy, stupid. Leverett and Zarate note that many in the United States may not think about the Iraq war now, but they say it’s important not to forget that war cost an estimated $1 trillion. Whether one supports or opposes military intervention in Syria, the costs incurred by any approach will affect the American economy.

6. Global reputation. “People around the world are looking for some kind of consistency in our foreign policy, and we’ve been criticized for not having that, not having anything close to consistency during the Arab Spring,” Zarate said.

The United States intervened, with NATO leading the way, in Libya. In 2011, Washington supported, at least in words, the Egyptians in their revolt against then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he said. Each time, the United States argued that those actions were in accordance with America’s national values, he said, and its responsibility as a global leader to defend democratic principles."

WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will travel to South Africa next week to participate in memorial events for Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who died on Thursday.

Obama's exact schedule was as yet unclear, the White House said. It was not yet known whether Obama would give public remarks while in South Africa.

""President Obama and the first lady will go to South Africa next week to pay their respects to the memory of Nelson Mandela and to participate in memorial events. We'll have further updates on timing and logistics as they become available,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Obama, speaking Thursday night shortly after Mandela's death at age 95 was announced, said he was one of the ""countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life.""

Obama, America's first black president, also said the first political action he ever took as a young man was attending a protest against apartheid.

Carney, at his daily news briefing, said Obama and Mandela last spoke in 2010 or 2011 and that they also spoke when Obama won his first election as president, in 2008.

He had no details on who might be in the U.S. delegation traveling with Obama, including whether former U.S. presidents might go with him.

The United States has created supply pipelines and set up intermediaries to deliver humanitarian aid to the opposition for several months and will use them to send direct military assistance to the Supreme Military Council, an umbrella group of rebel factions, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said.

“In terms of timelines, we’ve established these pipelines, so I think you should see this as a continuum,” Rhodes said. “There’s already material that has been flowing in to the opposition, and that will continue to be the case in the weeks to come. So, we don’t anticipate that this is something that is far off into the future.”

Another administration official confirmed that the administration is talking about delivery in a matter of weeks, not months. They follow recent rebel losses to President Bashar Assad’s security forces and their allies in Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, and reports of fresh fighting in the country.

Rhodes declined to say what military equipment Obama plans to send. Other officials said the administration plans to send small arms at first and may provide antitank weapons at some point. Some Obama advisors are skeptical of providing shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons out of concern that they could fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other Islamist groups that are seeking to topple Assad.

Gen. Salim Idris, head of the U.S.-backed military wing of the Syrian opposition, said in an interview with the Al Arabiya TV network that he hopes to receive the “weapons and ammunition we need in a few weeks.”

The intensity of fighting and recent gains by government troops and Hezbollah created concern at the White House that the rebels may be in danger of losing the war. A new U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad’s forces used nerve gas several times pushed Obama to reverse himself and help arm the rebels, although at a slower pace than advocates had hoped.

Rhodes did not rule out eventually sending U.S. aircraft to impose a no-fly zone in Syrian airspace. But he said an air campaign would be more “difficult and dangerous and costly” than it was in Libya, where U.S.-led airstrikes helped rebels oust dictator Moammar Kadafi in 2011.

Obama plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week at the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, and is expected to ask Putin to withdraw Russian support from Assad. U.S. officials hope Russia can apply pressure to bring some elements of the Syrian regime together with the opposition to work toward a political settlement.

Leaders should pressure Assad “to come to the table in a way that relinquishes his power and his standing in Syria,” Rhodes said.

“We don’t see any scenario where he restores his legitimacy to lead the country,” Rhodes said. “So we’re fundamentally making an interest-based argument to the Russians that they can best protect their interests by being a part of a political settlement that is real and that enables a transition away from Assad’s rule.”

Snowden was en route to a “third country,” officials in the Chinese territory said. The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper that had repeated contact with the American during his month-long stay in the city, reported that Snowden left on a flight bound for Moscow.

Russia’s ITAR-Tass news agency, citing an unidentified Aeroflot airlines official, said Snowden would fly from Moscow to Cuba on Monday and then on to Venezuela. Last week, Iceland had also been mentioned as a possible destination for Snowden.

Exactly how Snowden’s departure was arranged was unclear, but WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has praised him as a “hero,” and according to the organization’s Twitter feed, Snowden was accompanied on the flight to Russia by WikiLeaks legal advisors.

“WikiLeaks has assisted Mr. Snowden’s political asylum in a democratic country, travel papers and safe exit from Hong Kong,” the group said.

U.S. authorities are seeking to prosecute Snowden for disclosing to the media a trove of documents detailing secret American surveillance programs. On Friday, U.S. authorities revealed that Snowden had been charged with theft of government property and two violations of the Espionage Act: unauthorized communication of national defense information and providing U.S. classified intelligence to an unauthorized person.

Hong Kong officials said Sunday that U.S. authorities had asked Hong Kong to issue a provisional arrest warrant for Snowden but that without “sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.”

Hong Kong authorities said they had informed the U.S. government of Snowden’s departure and said they would continue to seek details from Washington about Snowden’s revelations that U.S. hacking activities had targeted facilities in Hong Kong.

Snowden’s departure from Hong Kong offered authorities in both the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and Beijing a face-saving if inelegant solution to a complicated situation that threatened to strain relations for years had Snowden exercised his various rights to appeal or applied for asylum.

Hong Kong, a former British territory, has a treaty with the U.S. that allows for extraditions; however, mainland officials are allowed to intervene in cases that they determine concern foreign policy or national defense.

Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it was “highly likely” that Beijing authorities had instructed Hong Kong officials not to surrender Snowden.

“The decision was basically made in Beijing not to send him to the U.S.,” Lam said. “Hong Kong was seeking a politically expedient way out before the legal procedures started. What the Hong Kong government said is that they received Washington’s request but were seeking more info. But they haven’t gotten it. So the pretext was that they have no legal reason to detain him.”

“This is a sort of a clever way out for the Hong Kong government to avoid getting into a more difficult situation,” Lam added.

Simon N.M. Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been closely monitoring Snowden’s case, called Hong Kong’s decision to allow the departure “a shocker.”

“I thought he was going to stay and fight it out,” Young said. “The U.S. government will be irate with their Hong Kong counterparts. They may even question whether the Hong Kong government was acting in good faith pursuant to their treaty obligations.”

Opposition to extraditing Snowden from Hong Kong had been building both in the city and on the mainland over the last several weeks. A public opinion poll last weekend in the city of 7 million found about half of respondents did not favor sending him back to the United States for prosecution.

An editorial last week in the Global Times, a Beijing newspaper with close ties to the Communist Party, inveighed against extraditing Snowden, saying “it would be a face-losing outcome for both the Hong Kong government and the Chinese central government if Snowden is extradited back to the U.S. Unlike a common criminal, Snowden did not hurt anybody. His ‘crime’ is that he blew the whistle on the U.S. government’s violation of civil rights.”

“His whistle-blowing is in the global public interest,” the commentary added. “Therefore, extraditing Snowden back to the U.S. would not only be a betrayal of Snowden’s trust, but a disappointment for expectations around the world. The image of Hong Kong would be forever tarnished.”

In Hong Kong, support for Snowden hinged both on Hong Kong’s historic status as a refuge for dissidents -- mostly from the mainland -- as well as locals’ outrage over Snowden’s revelations that their supposed ally, the United States, had been targeting the city for extensive surveillance activities.

Hundreds of Hong Kongers marched last Saturday on the U.S. consulate in the city, chanting slogans such as “Protect Edward Snowden!” and carrying posters of President Obama saying, “Big Brother is Watching You.”

Law Yuk Kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, said Sunday that he was pleased that the city government had “honored its obligation under our legal system to allow Mr. Snowden to leave” the city.

“Hong Kong was probably not a very good place for him,” Law said. “The legal procedures involved had certain uncertainties: First, the legal system is not totally in our hands; Beijing has a lot to say. Second, the procedure relates to a large number of big legal issues … extradition legislation, refugee laws and constitutional obligations to protect rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

Tom Grundy, one of the organizers of last weekend’s demonstration in support of Snowden, said he was “surprised and relieved” that the Hong Kong government “had the option to detain him and put out an arrest warrant and they didn’t.”

“It’s probably good for him,” Grundy said. “It could have been a bit messy. Had he claimed asylum … he would have found himself in a very much broken local immigration system. It could have been a long drawn out process. … We’re relieved for him, and we hope his final destination country will provide him some asylum.”

Young agreed that Snowden’s situation would have “changed drastically” with the issue of an arrest warrant in Hong Kong.

“From his ‘safe place’ he would have been detained in prison awaiting the completion of both his surrender and asylum proceedings,” Young said. “That would have been a harsh existence if he was to fight it out and no certainty that he would not be surrendered.”

Lam said the decision to allow Snowden to leave Hong Kong would certainly result in a “period of tension” both between the U.S. and Beijing and the U.S. and Hong Kong.

“The U.S. of course will now say that Hong Kong’s position as an autonomous region might be jeopardized, because it is quite clear that Hong Kong has taken orders from Beijing not to extradite Snowden. I think it’s likely U.S. will start asking questions about status of Hong Kong, whether it is really still that autonomous.”"

There is a reason the international community has set a clear standard and why many countries have taken major steps to eradicate these weapons. There is a reason why President Obama has made it such a priority to stop the proliferation of these weapons, and lock them down where they do exist. There is a reason why President Obama has made clear to the Assad regime that this international norm cannot be violated without consequences. And there is a reason why no matter what you believe about Syria, all peoples and all nations who believe in the cause of our common humanity must stand up to assure that there is accountability for the use of chemical weapons so that it never happens again.

Last night, after speaking with foreign ministers from around the world about the gravity of this situation, I went back and I watched the videos -- the videos that anybody can watch in the social media, and I watched them one more gut-wrenching time. It is really hard to express in words the the human suffering that they lay out before us.

As a father, I can’t get the image out of my head of a man who held up his dead child, wailing while chaos swirled around him, the images of entire families dead in their beds without a drop of blood or even a visible wound, bodies contorting in spasms, human suffering that we can never ignore or forget. Anyone who could claim that an attack of this staggering scale could be contrived or fabricated needs to check their conscience and their own moral compass.

What is before us today is real, and it is compelling.

So I also want to underscore that while investigators are gathering additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense. The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the firsthand accounts from humanitarian organizations on the ground, like Doctors Without Borders and the Syria Human Rights Commission -- these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us is real, that chemical weapons were used in Syria.

Moreover, we know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons. We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place. And with our own eyes, we have all of us become witnesses."
http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-pm-visiting-ally-iran-says-government-winning-175001933.html,,[],"Syrian PM, visiting ally Iran, says government winning civil war","By Dominic Evans BEIRUT (Reuters) - Prime Minister Wael Halki said on Saturday Syrian government forces were winning the war with rebels and would not rest while a single enemy fighter remained at large. Maintaining Syria's unyielding response to Western calls for President Bashar al-Assad to step aside, Halki said the era of ""threats and intimidation has gone, never to return, while the era of victory and pride is being created now on Syrian soil"". He was speaking during a visit to Iran, which has provided military support and billions of dollars in economic aid to Assad during a 2-1/2-year-old civil war which has killed 100,000 people and shows little sign of being halted by diplomacy. The United Nations said on Monday that a long-delayed ""Geneva 2"" peace conference would go ahead on January 22. The government and the political opposition have both said they will attend, but rebel fighters on the ground have scorned the talks. Assad, whose forces have consolidated their hold around Damascus and central Syria this year, faces little internal pressure to make concessions to his opponents as long as he maintains military momentum and Iranian support. ""The Syrian government will not allow a single terrorist on Syrian territory,"" Halki told Iran's First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri, according to Syria's state news agency SANA. Jahangiri replied that Iran stood ""in the same trench alongside Syria, supporting it at all levels against the aggressive axis of evil"" aligned against Damascus, SANA said. Iran has sent military commanders to Syria to help Assad's army, which is also bolstered by the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah militia and Iraqi Shi'ite fighters. They are battling rebels whose ranks are swollen by an influx of Sunni Islamist fighters from across the Muslim world. The size of Halki's delegation, which included Syria's energy, electricity, health and foreign ministers, reflected the importance of the alliance between the two countries. SANA said they discussed activating Iran's multi-billion dollar credit facility to Damascus, bringing Iranian companies back to Syria's war-ravaged economy and speeding up deals to provide oil products, medical equipment and food. AIR RAIDS Assad's forces, backed by Hezbollah and local militia, have been fighting to secure the mountainous Qalamoun region overlooking the main highway north of Damascus to the central city of Homs and Assad's Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean. Activists said warplanes bombarded targets around Nabak, the main town on the road which is outside government control, dropping bomblets on parachutes which ignited fires. ""So far we have three martyrs in Nabak,"" said a local pro-rebel activist, speaking by Skype, who identified himself only as Abu Rakan. ""In Rima, between Yabroud and Nabak, MiG and Sukhoi planes have carried out eight bombing raids."" SANA said the army had ""eliminated a number of terrorists in Nabak and the surrounding area"", and it also made gains in rebel districts to the east of Damascus, a mix of farmland and urban sprawl known as the eastern Ghouta, and suburbs to the south. Casualties on both sides have been heavy, with Hezbollah losing at least 25 fighters in eastern Ghouta over the last week, according to security sources in Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, said more than 400 people had been killed across Syria since Thursday, many of them in the battles around Ghouta and Qalamoun. Assad's force recaptured the town of Deir Attiyah on Thursday, a week after losing it in a rebel counter-offensive, but progress has been gradual and sporadic. ""At night we push them back. In the daytime, because of the planes and the air raids, the Free Syrian army retreats slightly but at night they return to their positions,"" Abu Rakan said. The Observatory said fighting also erupted on Saturday in the old quarter of the ancient Christian town of Maloula, between Assad's forces and the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which has been at the forefront of fighting around Qalamoun. Amid the violence, weapons experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are trying to oversee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. The United States has offered to destroy the chemicals on a U.S. ship, the OPCW confirmed on Saturday, and is looking for a suitable Mediterranean port where processing can be carried out. Sigrid Kaag, head of the joint UN-OPCW Syria team, said the mission was striving meet a tough deadline to get the most lethal chemical agents out of Syria by the end of the year. She told reporters in Damascus the chemical arsenal, located at various sites across Syria, would be packed, sealed and moved to Syria's Latakia port. ""Then it will be transported to other ships by other member states that will send it to ... a U.S. vessel. It will not be (destroyed) in Syrian territorial waters,"" she said.

http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/09/zakaria-syrians-seem-to-be-playing-clever-game/,2013-09-09 00:00:00,[],Zakaria: Syrians seem to be playing clever game,"Fareed speaks with CNN about Syria and Russia’s proposal that it put its chemical weapons under international control.

If the U.N. Security Council were to pass a Russian resolution with Russian support, Chinese support trying to destroy Syria's chemical weapons' stockpiles, that would certainly offer the president of the United States a way out of this current crisis. He could come out and say, look, there are not going to be any more chemical weapons attacks if all of this is serious.

He could. It’s a blow for the administration's strategy, though, because they really wanted to use this attack as a way of sending a signal, a very strong signal, about the use of chemical weapons. They point out, Secretary Kerry says, that al-Assad has used these weapons perhaps in the teens, that is several times.

It’s also clear that this was an occasion the administration was going to use to shift the balance of power away from al-Assad and toward the rebels. So they lose that option and they lose that ability to degrade al-Assad's air power, in particular six airfields they were planning to strike.

The whole thing, however, does demonstrate something very striking. That is, if you take this Syrian acceptance of this Russian proposal and you add to it al-Assad's interview [with Charlie Rose] that we have seen clips of, what I'm struck by is quite different from Saddam Hussein or many Arab leaders. Al-Assad is not engaging in a lot of bravado or kind of crazy talk if you think of Gadhafi's interview on the eve of that campaign. Al-Assad has been very cool, very calculating, very clever in what arguments he uses.

In the interview, he talked about how there wasn't public support for this. He reminded people of the Colin Powell speech at the United Nations. He talked about the fact that the rebels are linked to al Qaeda. This was not a kind of bizarre rant about American imperialism and Israel. It was clearly designed to weaken the American public's support. And so, you add to it this acceptance of a proposal, and it all strikes me as suggesting that the Syrians are playing a very clever game of counter offensive.

You’ve been skeptical of a lot of this current crisis, on what the U.S. needs to do. What would you want to hear from the president that would reassure you, that would convince you it's the right thing to go ahead and launch these air strikes against targets in Syria?

I think the most important thing with any strategy is what is your objective? What are we trying to do here? And once you figure that out, you can then use whatever tools you have. But you also then know when you've achieved that objective. And I think the problem with the administration's strategy is it's not entirely clear what the objective is. John Kerry calls this a Munich moment, invoking the path to World War II and Adolf Hitler's attempt to conquer the world. But if it's a Munich moment, are we really going to do two days of air strikes that the president describes as a shot across the bow, which is really a warning?

So, you know, if he is going to pursue a very limited – almost symbolic – strike, it needs to be clear that is what the strategy is, what the objective is, when we will know that we have achieved it, and when we can then say, this is done or is there a much broader strategy with much broader objectives at work. I think that this is partly why there isn't as much public support, because people wonder which of these two strategies is being pursued."

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that despite hitting a “snag” in nuclear negotiations last week, Iran is committed “100 percent” to reaching a comprehensive final agreement. But he voiced tough positions on key issues and said “it’s going to be a bumpy road,” with difficult bargaining ahead.

Zarif, who is Iran’s top chief negotiator, outlined his views in an hour-long interview at the foreign ministry here Sunday. He said that his country would continue the talks, despite what he called the “extremely counterproductive” U.S. Treasury Department announcement last week of new steps to enforce existing sanctions.

Iranian concern was eased, Zarif said, after his contacts last week with Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the chief European Union negotiator, Lady Catherine Ashton. “What I have heard from Secretary Kerry and Lady Ashton is that they are committed to an early finalization of the Geneva process with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement. I share that objective.”

Dressed in a diplomat’s blue pinstripe suit and speaking fluent, American-educated English, Zarif presented Iran’s case on nuclear and regional issues. He was frank about his disagreements with leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and said Iran was ready to play a more active role in ending the war in Syria and in providing greater security in the Persian Gulf.

Zarif, seen by critics as the leader of Iran’s “charm offensive,” has become the most visible international face of a regime seeking a deal that would end punishing economic sanctions. He helped negotiate the breakthrough interim agreement reached last month in Geneva to freeze Iran’s nuclear program for six months. He said that in a follow-on comprehensive agreement, Iran would affirm its commitment to a peaceful nuclear program. But he didn’t provide specific responses to administration concerns about activities the U.S. argues aren’t consistent with a civilian program.

On enrichment, for example, Zarif insisted that Iran could continue its domestic program with some limits and greater transparency. “We do not see any reason now that we have put so much time and effort in it, and brought [the West] to the point of abandoning the illusion of zero enrichment in Iran, why should we accept anything less.”

As for Iran’s heavy-water reactor at Arak that would produce plutonium that could be reprocessed as nuclear fuel, Zarif explained: “We cannot roll back the clock 20 years and ask Iran to simply get rid of a project that has been the subject of a great deal of human and materiel investment. However, there are various ways of making sure that this reactor will remain exclusively peaceful.”

Asked about a U.S. demand to close the enrichment facility at Fordow, built into a mountainside, Zarif said: “If you sit in Iran, and you see people having concerns about Fordow, the only conclusion you can draw is that they want to attack you.”

Zarif said he didn’t want to negotiate in public, and he argued that acceptable compromises could be found on such issues. But President Obama, pressed by Israel, has said he would reject an agreement that doesn’t reverse the Iranian program and ensure that it will be restricted to civilian uses only.

“We do not follow a policy of ambiguity; this is not our intention. We follow a policy of clarity — that we do not seek nuclear weapons,” Zarif said. “But we’re not going to accept diktats.”

Zarif acknowledged his recent public dispute with Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, about what Zarif said were Iran’s limited military capabilities. “I respect Gen. Jafari’s remarks, his views, and I expect him to have differences of views with me,” he said. He also noted that some hard-liners in Iran who oppose a deal with the West “have asked for my removal.”

But Zarif insisted that he and President Hassan Rouhani lead a consensual process in all areas of foreign policy, including regional issues such as Syria. “Iran believes there is no military solution for Syria,” Zarif said, noting that he is ready to attend a so-called Geneva 2 conference to seek a political settlement, so long as there are no preconditions for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.

“We’re living at a crossroad,” the Iranian foreign minister said. But he rejected former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s argument that Iran must become “a nation rather than a cause.” He argued that, like America, Iran wanted to press both its values and its interests. America isn’t alone in seeing itself as an “extraordinary nation,” Zarif said: “We do, too.”

The moment drew fire from key Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, who likened it to shaking hands with Hitler.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

The fleeting exchange, captured in photographs and video from a giant soccer stadium in Johannesburg, came after Obama bounded up the steps toward the podium to address the massive crowd.

The United States and Cuba have seen their enmity outlive the Cold War that spawned it — even as Raul’s brother Fidel Castro, now in reportedly poor health, outlasted the decadeslong American embargo meant to push him from power.

The two countries have not had formal diplomatic relations since shortly after Fidel Castro led a 1959 revolution and aligned his country with the Soviet Union. Fidel passed the reins to Raul in 2008.

It was believed to be the first such encounter between the leaders of the two countries since Bill Clinton gripped Fidel Castro’s hand in 2000 at a United Nations lunch.

Shortly after the handshake, Obama delivered a speech honoring Mandela, also called Madiba, in which he seemed to take aim at governments like Castro's, saying: ""There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people.""

While this White House has at times signaled a willingness to ease tensions with Cuba, there were no signs of a fresh diplomatic push on anything approaching the scale of outreach towards Iran, which got a boost from a historic Sept. 27 phone call between Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

""This wasn't a preplanned encounter,"" an Obama aide told Yahoo News on condition of anonymity. ""Above all else, today is about honoring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus.""

Still, ""as the president said, we urge leaders to honor Mandela's struggle for freedom by upholding the basic human rights of their people,"" the official said.

Story continues

At a fundraiser for Senate Democrats in Florida last month, Obama sounded optimistic about political change spreading in Cuba and said it was time to “update our policies” — a clear reference to the economic embargo first imposed by then-President Dwight Eisenhower and regularly toughened since.

“Now, I think we all understand that, ultimately, freedom in Cuba will come because of extraordinary activists and the incredible courage of folks like we see here today,” he said. ""But the United States can help, and we have to be creative,” Obama added. “The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective ... today in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel doesn't make sense.”

The handshake drew sharp GOP criticism. McCain told Public Radio International reporter Todd Zwillich that it gave Castro a propaganda victory and that Obama shouldn't have done it, noting that American international aid worker Alan Gross has languished in a Cuban cell since December 2009.

""Why should you shake hands with somebody who's keeping Americans in prison,"" McCain said, adding: ""Neville Chamberlain shook hands with Hitler."" That was a reference to the British prime minister who wrongly believed he could appease the Nazi leader.

Obama and Castro had exchanged a few words before the American president moved on to share a handshake with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and kiss her on both cheeks. Rousseff has angrily condemned U.S. spying in her country, which reportedly included her own communications.

And Obama also briefly exchanged greetings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, with whom he also has been at odds recently."

Ranchers and farmers often build ladders over their fences in hopes that migrants won't damage the fences when crossing.

Story highlights The Senate's immigration bill calls for doubling the size of the border patrol The House is debating a strong security component to its bill, too Those who live on the border have a nuanced view of security Many want work permits for undocumented immigrants

(CNN) —

Joe Metz, a straight-talking Texas rancher on the U.S.-Mexico border, awoke recently to find 50 cows roaming freely in his front yard. Undocumented immigrants, he says, left a gate open as they crossed his land, which abuts the Rio Grande.

For years, he’s witnessed migrants and drug smugglers touch American soil for the first time on his property.

“We deal with this every day,” he said.

But as a rancher in Hidalgo County, he also knows firsthand the need for labor to keep producers in the Rio Grande Valley operating. The traffic through his land frustrates him – particularly the potentially dangerous drug traffic – but he acknowledges that most crossers are looking for opportunity.

It is an open secret that many of these undocumented immigrants will indeed find jobs in the local economy.

More than 1,700 miles away, U.S. lawmakers are engaged in their own debate over how to balance security concerns and immigrant labor needs.

The Senate has proposed one solution in the form of a sweeping immigration bill that the chamber passed last month. Border security figures prominently in that bill, and is also a priority for members of the House, where the debate has moved.

Five reasons immigration reform isn’t close

Those who live and work on the border say there is a disconnect between the debate in Washington and the realities on the ground.

Voices of the border communities

Miles of border fencing built by the federal government – actually a levy that was cut in half and reinforced with concrete to form a wall – run across Metz’s property near Mission, Texas. Two 40-foot gaps exist in the barrier so that workers can access all parts of the ranch, but there are no gates, creating a funnel for migrants and traffickers to cross.

Google Maps Map: Texas-Mexico border towns

Metz’s experiences make him hawkish on beefing up the border, but he doesn’t just want more border patrol agents. He wants to see work permits granted the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.

The agriculture industry in the Rio Grande Valley depends on immigrant labor, he said.

“They (the government) just need to face up to the situation and give all these people work permits,” Metz said.

Opinion: Immigrants are driving the housing recovery

Migrants will keep coming across the border as long as there is work and a chance to make money, the rancher said.

“Farmers need the help, no doubt about that, because nobody wants to do the work,” said Jimmie Steidinger, a farmer and agricultural producer, in Donna, Texas.

How immigration reform would affect 3 families

For those whose lands are traversed by migrants, the biggest concern is drug traffickers, more so than economic migrants, he said.

Putting undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship would provide not just more able hands, but the relief of knowing who is crossing the border, he said.

For others, securing the border is not about how many boots are on the ground.

Border security means that people on both sides of the boundary feel safe, said Michael Seifert, coordinator of the Rio Grande Valley Equal Voice Network. That is not the case, he said.

The Equal Voice Network represents 11 community-based organizations focused on the area’s poorest residents.

To many of these residents, the border patrol is something threatening, Seifert said.

Reports of heavy-handedness by border agents – including use of force – has bred mistrust among some border residents.

In one case in Arizona last year, a border patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border. The border patrol confirmed that agents were being assaulted with rocks and that after verbal warnings to stop, one agent fired his service weapon.

Many in the community hear the stories of alleged beatings or use of stun guns by border agents and have become wary of their presence.

“We have a completely different perception” than outsiders, Seifert said.

The fears of the community are compounded by the fact that many families live in mixed-status households, where some members are living in the country legally and others aren’t, creating fear of separation.

Seifert said a further buildup along the border would be bad both for businesses and the welfare of the communities.

The view from Washington

The Senate immigration overhaul bill passed only after being amended to include tough border security measures: Doubling the number of border patrol agents on the southern border to nearly 40,000, increasing fencing to 700 miles and deploying more technology.

In the Republican-controlled House, border security is being touted as a prerequisite before any undocumented immigrants are placed on a potential path to citizenship.

“I understand the issues our borders face and am committed to making sure the first thing that must be addressed with any immigration bill is strengthening and protecting the border,” said Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, a member of the bipartisan House group working on a bill.

But some who study the border say the boundary with Mexico is as safe as it’s ever been, and it doesn’t make sense to flood the place with border agents.

“It sounds good and it looks good politically,” to add more agents, said Maureen Meyer, Senior Associate for Mexico and Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, or WOLA. “Calls for border security don’t always reflect reality.”

Opinion: Should U.S. be more like Mexico?

Currently, the border patrol is already double the size it was in 2005. As the agency grew, the number of illegal crossers apprehended decreased.

In 2005, each border agent – on average – apprehended 118 undocumented immigrants that year, according to data extrapolated by WOLA. Last year, that number fell to 19 apprehensions per agent.

If the border patrol is doubled in size again, how much further would that number fall? Would there be a lot of agents standing on the border doing nothing?

Not just a border issue

About 70 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley lies Brooks County, a community that has seen the cost of illegal immigration up close, even though it is not located on the border.

The county includes the town of Falfurrias, the site of the last border patrol checkpoint on Highway 281. Make it past the checkpoint, and a smuggler or migrant could be home free.

David S. Holloway/CNN Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez in his private office in the town of Falfurrias, Texas.

Most migrants try to avoid the checkpoint altogether, choosing instead to go around it by hiking deep into the vast tracts of ranch land.

But too often they become lost, or succumb to the unforgiving heat and die.

In 2012, 129 bodies of migrants were found in Brooks County. At least 42 have been found so far this year – 11 in the past two weeks.

It can cost the county nearly $2,000 to pick up a body, transport it, and perform an autopsy. The county is also burdened with the costs of sending its deputies to these scenes instead of patrolling the community. The counties that are right on the border have access to federal funds to offset law enforcement and other costs, but Brooks County does not.

The border “isn’t secure, and I don’t think they will ever secure it,” Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez said.

Still, Ramirez says that doubling the border patrol and prioritizing border security before immigration reform is not the answer.

“I think they don’t get it. I don’t think that’s the solution,” he said.

More agents will not stop determined migrants, but will simply drive up the price that a smuggler charges, he said. It also raises the likelihood that smugglers will choose riskier routes, meaning that even more people may die from exposure, he said.

What Ramirez would like to see is a deployment of current border agents to high-crossing areas, and a focus on catching drug traffickers.

What do border agents want?

The border patrol would appear to have the most to gain from an immigration bill with a tough security component. It would mean more money and more manpower.

David S. Holloway/CNN The graves of dozens of migrants who died trying to illegally cross the border are in Falfurrias, Texas.

But Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents border agents, the National Border Patrol Council, says that is not the case.

Rather than spending millions hiring and training 20,000 new agents, it makes more sense to properly fund the existing force to bring the border patrol up to 100% staffing for current agents, he said. That alone would be the equivalent of 5,000 new agents.

Calls for increased technology, from sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles are nice, but they are just tools, Moran said. It takes an agent to make an arrest, he said.

“We appreciate the sentiment, but we think (the immigration bill) has to be tweaked a bit,” he said."

Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

(CNN) —

Crucial talks on ending Syrian control of its chemical weapons began Thursday in Geneva with the top negotiators – U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – offering similar goals but different ideas on how to reach them.

“This is not a game,” Kerry said, making clear that a U.S. threat to attack Syria for allegedly gassing its own people remained an option if the negotiations failed to prove Syria and its ally Russia were serious about the Syrian regime handing over its chemical weapons stockpiles.

Any agreement reached must be “comprehensive,” “verifiable,” “credible” and “able to be implemented in a timely fashion,” Kerry said, adding that “there ought to be consequences if it doesn’t take place.”

Lavrov, speaking in Russian, called for following established rules and protocols in the process for Syria to join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and said that a solution “will make unnecessary” a military strike on Syria.

Also Thursday, Syrian U.N. Ambassdor Bashar Ja’afari said his country formally asked to join the chemical weapons convention that bans such arms.

However, the challenge facing negotiators was made clear by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who told Russian TV that his country would only agree to turn over its chemical weapons when the United States drops its threat to attack.

“This does not mean that Syria will sign these documents, carry out the conditions and that’s it,” al-Assad said, referring to the global convention against chemical weapons. “This bilateral process is based, first of all, on the United States stopping its policy of threatening Syria.”

In the interview, al-Assad said joining the convention gives Syria a standard 30 days to provide information on its stockpiles to the international community. Kerry appeared to reject that in his opening remarks for the talks with Lavrov.

Referring to al-Assad’s comment, Kerry said: “We believe there is nothing standard about this process” because of the August 21 chemical weapons attack in suburban Damascus that the United States estimates killed more than 1,400 people.

Reiterating the U.S. contention that al-Assad’s regime was responsible, Kerry said “we have in no uncertain terms made it clear that we cannot allow that to happen again.”

The planned two days of meetings in Geneva by full diplomatic teams, including weapons experts, were considered a litmus test by President Barack Obama’s administration for whether Russia is serious in pushing its ally Syria to give up hundreds of tons of chemical arms.

Otherwise, Obama argues for targeted military strikes intended to inhibit Syria’s ability to use its chemical weapons and deter it from considering doing so.

Key developments in Syria crisis

Skepticism that Russia plan may be stall tactic

Kerry first publicly broached the idea of Syria turning over control of its chemical weapons, responding to a journalist’s question Monday that such a move would prevent a U.S. attack.

In a move that appeared to catch the Obama administration by surprise, Russia then formally proposed putting the Syrian chemical arsenal under international control and al-Assad’s regime said it agreed.

The ongoing U.S.-Russia negotiations in Geneva aimed to work out details on taking control of Syria’s chemical weapons, setting the stage for a related U.N. Security Council resolution.

However, Russia’s steadfast opposition to any U.N. action on Syria raises questions about whether the talks in Geneva are merely a stall tactic to put off the U.S. attack Obama is threatening.

As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has so far blocked U.N. action sought by the United States and European allies against al-Assad’s regime over chemical weapons.

That track record fuels questions in the United States about the sincerity of the new Russian proposal for Syria to turn over control of its chemical weapons, with concerns it is a stall tactic to put off a U.S. attack or some other form of international response.

Kerry told Syrian opposition leaders Thursday that he entered the talks with Lavrov “from a position of skepticism,” said a senior State Department official on condition of not being identified.

That sentiment was echoed by House Speaker John Boehner in Washington.

“I have doubts about the motives of the Russians and Assad,” Boehner said.

U.N. report on Syria coming

Obama had tried to put together a NATO coalition to attack Syria. But he ran into roadblocks, like the vote by Britain’s parliament – a normally reliable party – opting not to participate.

He then asked Congress to authorize a military response in Syria, but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the Russian proposal emerged Monday to provide a diplomatic opening.

While Kerry was in Geneva, Obama met with the rest of his Cabinet on Thursday and wished his absent secretary well.

“I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry has with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result,” Obama told reporters. “And I know that he is going to working very hard over the next several days to see what the possibilities are there.”

Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told CNN on Thursday that Kerry will have his hands full with Lavrov, whom Cohen described as “very, very skilled,” “bright,” “articulate” and “a very tough negotiator.”

Thursday’s initial session revealed some of the dynamic between Kerry and Lavrov.

In their opening statements, Lavrov spoke first with mostly technical comments and then Kerry followed with longer and more forceful remarks. When he finished, Lavrov asked to respond and said he hadn’t come “prepared with the extended political statement,” adding that “diplomacy likes silence.”

Kerry then asked the translator to repeat Lavrov’s final comment, but when that didn’t happen, Lavrov tried to assure Kerry there was no problem.

“You want me to take your word for it? It’s a little early for that,” Kerry said, smiling, as the two men shook hands for the cameras.

In some potential good news for Obama, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday that a U.N. report on the August attack in Syria will “probably” be published on Monday, and that there will “certainly be indications” pointing to the origin of the attack.

France and other U.S. allies have said they want any international response on Syria to come under U.N. auspices, and the report by inspectors who traveled to the site of the attack would be a first step toward generating support for a Security Council resolution.

Obama makes case for action

The president insists he has the authority to attack Syria without congressional approval, but says he decided to seek the support of legislators for the sake of national unity.

In a speech Tuesday night, Obama made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on Syria, challenging Congress and the American public to look at video footage of victims and saying that letting al-Assad get away with it would harm the security of the United States and its allies.

Analysis: Obama a winner or loser on Syria?

Opponents of a U.S. military strike argue that it could lead to another quagmire in someone else’s civil war, and that Obama’s proposal for limited strikes would fail to achieve the objective of eliminating the threat of Syria’s chemical weapons.

Russian President Vladimir Putin injected himself into the American debate with an opinion piece first published late Wednesday on the New York Times website that argued against U.S. military intervention in Syria and implicitly criticized Obama.

The White House shrugged off Putin’s jabs at Obama as “irrelevant,” arguing that Russia’s diplomatic intervention over Syria’s chemical weapons meant that Putin now was “fully invested” in removing them from al-Assad’s control.

Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that CIA-funded weapons have begun flowing to Syrian rebels, as pledged by the administration in June.

The artillery described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition are not American-made, but are funded and organized by the CIA. They started to reach rebels about two weeks ago, the official said.

Gen. Salim Idriss, the head of the Free Syrian Army, told CNN’s Christian Amanpour on Thursday that U.S. aid was reaching the rebels, though he didn’t detail whether that support includes weapons.

“We are getting now a lot of support from our American friends, but I can’t talk in detail about all kinds of the support,” Idriss said.

Congress approved supplying weapons to the rebels after the administration asserted earlier this year that the al-Assad regime had used chemical weapons on a small scale.

Before that, Obama had rejected calls by his national security team and members of Congress to increase direct military aid to the rebels.

Those pushing for arming the rebels argue such a step would counter Russian weapons supplied to al-Assad’s forces and strengthen the hand of moderate members of the Syrian opposition, making them less reliant on well-armed Islamic extremist elements within their ranks.

But a senior U.S. military official has said, “we do not see a clear division between moderates and extremists,” making it hard to back the opposition without supporting extremist elements as well.

While one U.S. official says “only a minority are extremist” – a reference to rebel fighters tied to the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front – U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments say many more rebel fighters than belong to that group may want to establish an Islamic state in Syria.

On the other side of the bloody war, al-Assad’s forces are getting support from at least 2,000 members of Hezbollah – a pro-Syrian group based in Lebanon that the United States has designed as a terrorist organization – U.S. officials estimate.

A week of critical diplomacy is set to begin in Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang. But the sides are so far apart, at least in public declarations, it is impossible to predict where any diplomatic efforts will lead.

North Korea continues to hold fast to the position that its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are non-negotiable. Pyongyang's official news agency says the North wants U.N. Security Council sanctions lifted. The sanctions were put in place after North Korea launched a three-stage rocket last December that put a satellite in orbit. More sanctions were added when the North conducted its third underground nuclear test in February.

The U.S. and South Korea insist that a verifiable path to dismantling those programs must be on the table for any negotiating process to begin.

South Koreans are increasingly saying they may need a nuclear deterrent to counter Pyongyang's threats. China, of course, detests the possibility the U.S. would reintroduce strategic nuclear weapons there. (They were removed in 1991.) Everyone is heaping pressure on China to rein in the North Koreans.

Looking at the North's rapidly growing nuclear threat, some South Koreans admit that after years of dismissing all the bombastic rhetoric from Pyongyang, real fears are emerging.

""It really is a game changer,"" said Hahm Chaibong, president of the ASAN Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. ""We really don't know what to do with it because these are political weapons, these are psychological weapons.""

Wanted: Bold diplomatic moves (by the other guy)

Hahm says the six-party talks don't evoke confidence anymore. In his view, what is needed is a bold, new strategy comparable to President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to Beijing credited with not only laying the groundwork for rapprochement with the U.S., but opening up China to the world.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is no Zhou Enlai. But Beijing may be hoping Washington will overlook that.

""The Chinese are very keen to just get back to any kind of talks,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt told CNN. The International Crisis Group's Northeast Asia project director says more than one Chinese source has suggested a repeat of the Nixon-Zhou scenario.

""The Chinese regularly tell me, if (President) Obama would just pick up the phone and talk to Kim Jong Un, we could solve this whole thing!""

Don't hold your breath. Obama is in lockstep with his regional allies vowing not to reward Pyongyang's bad behavior.

China is feeling more wanted than ever. The North Koreans have signaled their readiness to meet with anyone from Beijing. The U.S., Japan and South Korea have repeatedly and publicly declared that China holds the key to reining in the North. While Beijing raised its hand in the vote in favor of sanctions on Pyongyang, many believe it is staying that hand when it comes to enforcing them.

""If China is not active and China is not fully committed, I don't think this is an issue that can be resolved,"" says professor Lee Jung-Hoon of Seoul's Yonsei University.

China has shown disdain for Kim's recent outbursts. But Beijing's No. 1 priority is keeping his regime from collapse and millions of hungry North Koreans on his side of the border. China is arguably sympathetic to young Kim's predicament. That's the reason, says Kleine-Albrandt and others, that China will not go as far as the U.S. and its partners in Asia would like.

Understanding Kim Jong Un's predicament

""We think they're blackmailing us right now, we think they want money from us,"" said John Delury, a professor of Northeast Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""What we fail to understand is their profound insecurity.""

Delury recalled the six-party talks, when U.S. diplomats were trying to persuade the North Koreans to denuclearize. ""We said, look, you'll be safe without your nuclear weapons, look at Libya!""

While almost no one inside North Korea has access to the real Internet, we can safely assume that Kim is the exception. We should also assume that the young leader has watched the grisly videos of Moammar Gadhafi being lynched by a mob of his own people. Kim may see his own face in that video.

South Koreans are hardly sympathetic. ""There's growing public sentiment,"" says Lee Jung-Hoon, that ""we have to be very firm with this regime. It's good to have dialogue and, yes, we want to talk with North Korea. But it's a fading hope that somehow we could convince North Korea, through dialogue, to give up its nuclear weapons program.

""If that's the case, what's the point in engaging in dialogue? Shouldn't we now be focusing on beefing up our security so our deterrence, especially nuclear deterrence, is firm so we will not be vulnerable to these threats?""

Diplomacy to deal with North Korea is gathering momentum. But the vast difference in the positions of all the parties raises doubts about the outcome.

If it fails, many predict Pyongyang will immediately subscribe to another round of missile or nuclear tests and the familiar, and destabilizing, sequence will begin anew."

The Prime Minister indicated he is ready to consider using money from the UK's official aid budget to fund military operations to stabilise war-torn states.



But charities including Oxfam and ActionAid today insisted 'not a single penny' of aid money should be diverted into the military.



Mr Cameron said it is right to look for ways in which the Department for International Development (DfID) can work more closely with the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence.

Key charities have rejected his proposals, however.



ActionAid said defence needs should have 'no bearing on how aid is spent'.



Spokesperson Melanie Ward said: ""The purpose of UK aid is to reduce poverty and this is enshrined in law.



""To pilfer from aid to pay for defence would be morally wrong and practically misplaced.



""Of course, when UK forces are in action they should always coordinate closely with international development experts to make sure that the needs of local people are met, but a raid on aid would provide no solution.



""Instead it could well deprive some of the world’s poorest people of life-saving support and undermine UK efforts to promote human security globally.""



Oxfam echoed these sentiments, with their head of policy Max Lawson adding: ""We should not see a single penny diverted into the military.



""If the Government needs to raise more money it should clamp down on tax avoiders rather than make insane choices between the safety of a family and their health and education.""



Christian Aid voiced 'deep concern' over the plans, adding: ""Aid diverted to ‘security, peacekeeping and demobilisation’ could have long term implications.



""The blurring of the lines between military action and aid delivery could mean that aid workers become associated with those forces, meaning they are not only put at risk, but find it hard to gain the trust of the people they are trying to help.""



Any cut in the DfID budget would threaten to breach Mr Cameron's pledge to meet the United Nations target of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, which Britain will meet for the first time in 2013.



But NGOs fear that the PM may meet his pledge while reducing the funds available for aid activities, by reallocating some of the responsibilities of the MoD or Foreign Office to DfID.



Asked whether he felt there was room for money in the aid budget to be spent on defence activities, Mr Cameron said: ""I think we have to demonstrate that the DfID budget is spent wisely."""

But on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani set off a political storm here and in Iran, with an acknowledgment and condemnation of the Holocaust that landed him in precisely the kind of tangled dispute he had hoped to avoid.

Mr. Rouhani, in an interview on Tuesday with CNN, described the Holocaust as a “crime that the Nazis committed towards the Jews” and called it “reprehensible and condemnable.” It was a groundbreaking statement, given that his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denied the systematic extermination of Jews during World War II. Mr. Rouhani largely repeated his comments in a meeting with news media executives on Wednesday.

But a semiofficial Iranian news agency accused CNN of fabricating portions of Mr. Rouhani’s interview, saying he had not used the word Holocaust or characterized the Nazi mass murder as “reprehensible.” Mr. Rouhani spoke in Persian; officials at CNN said they used an interpreter provided by the Iranian government for the interview, which was conducted by Christiane Amanpour.

The dispute over his comments reflects the extreme delicacy of the Holocaust as an issue in Iranian-American relations. More broadly, it speaks to the political tightrope Mr. Rouhani is walking, trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States that will ease sanctions to please everyday Iranians, without provoking a backlash by hard-liners."

The paper, released by the Ministry of Defense, did not declare that the United States was responsible, but the message was clear.

Strongly alluding to the Obama administration’s policy to “pivot” toward a greater focus on the Asia-Pacific region, the paper said, “Some country has strengthened its Asia-Pacific military alliances, expanded its military presence in the region, and frequently makes the situation tenser.” Thus, China has an “arduous task to safeguard its national unification, territorial integrity and development interests.”

Presented at a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, the paper has mostly a symbolic significance, defense analysts say. It is useful as a way of understanding the way the Communist Party thinks defense issues should be presented to the public, they say. But it is scarcely looked at by China’s military officers.

Over all, the paper suggested that China should be satisfied with its strategic position and offered a congratulatory note, saying that China “has seized and made the most of this important period of strategic opportunities for its development, and its modernization achievements have captured world attention.” In particular, it singled out a better situation with Taiwan, saying, “Cross-straits relations are sustaining a momentum of peaceful development.”"

Sanger', 'Jodi Rudoren']",Split on Accord on Iran Strains U.S.-Israel Ties,"While the Americans say it “freezes” the Iranian program and rolls it back, the fact is that only some elements are frozen, and the rollbacks in the initial agreement are relatively minor. For example, Iran would continue adding to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, meaning uranium enriched to reactor grade, or less than 5 percent purity. But the United States maintains that under details of the agreement it cannot yet disclose, the overall size of Iran’s stockpile would not increase.

The reason appears to be that Iran would agree to convert some of its medium-enriched uranium — fuel enriched to 20 percent purity, or near bomb grade — into an oxide form that is on the way to becoming reactor fuel. But that process can be easily reversed, notes Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr. Netanyahu’s camp and some Israeli analysts say the Israeli leader’s unstinting opposition is both substantive and political. He truly believes that a deal lifting sanctions without fully halting enrichment and dismantling centrifuges is a terrible mistake. But he has also staked his premiership on fighting the Iranian nuclear threat, and the change in approach by his closest allies leaves him a bit rudderless.

“The situation has changed and everybody else except Israel understands that a deal means to be more flexible,” said Giora Eiland, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “Netanyahu speaks only about a good deal. The Americans are speaking about a reasonable deal, which is better than having no deal at all.”

For his part, Mr. Kerry has questioned publicly whether Mr. Netanyahu is aware of all the details in the agreement. And in some cases, Israeli officials appear to have distorted what Iran would get in return.

At a briefing with international journalists on Wednesday, Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, said the deal would directly erase $15 billion to $20 billion of what he estimated was the $100 billion the current sanctions are costing Iran annually, and lead to relief of up to $40 billion because of indirect effects. The State Department immediately debunked those numbers, noting the sanctions relief would be for only six months, not a year. And the Americans put the figure at under $10 billion. But Israeli leaders have continued to cite the higher estimates.

There are also different accounts of what would happen to a heavy-water nuclear reactor now under construction near the town of Arak. The facility is critical to Iran’s plans because, if operating, it could provide it with a steady supply of plutonium, the fuel North Korea and now Pakistan have used for their arsenals.

France stepped into the negotiations 10 days ago complaining that the draft accord would allow Iran to get too close to being able to insert fuel into that reactor — at which point it could not be bombed by Israel without risking a radioactive, environmental disaster. The proposed agreement has since been modified, American officials say, to make sure that Iran is months to a year from being able to put fuel in the reactor."

Portugal%27s unemployment rate is 17.6 percent

Protesters waved handkerchief as if bidding government farewell

Austerity measures aimed to compensate for %u20AC4 billion bailout

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Many thousands of demonstrators held marches in more than 20 cities in Portugal on Saturday to protest against government-imposed austerity measures aimed at lifting the ailing country out of recession.

Tens of thousands of people filled a Lisbon boulevard leading to the Finance Ministry carrying placards saying ""Screw the troika, we want our lives back."" The troika is a reference to the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, the lenders behind the country's financial bailout.

Many protesters were singing a 40-year-old song linked to a 1974 popular uprising known as the Carnation Revolution. Some waved handkerchiefs in a symbolic gesture, saying goodbye to the government.

""If the government pays attention to what is happening and understands that the people are against them, they should get out,"" said Serafin Lobato, 65. ""If not, this won't stop.""

Portugal is expected to endure a third straight year of recession in 2013, with a 2 percent contraction. The overall jobless rate has grown to a record 17.6 percent.

The marches were powered mostly by young people. Unemployment among people under 25 is close to 40 percent.

The country's largest trade union, the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers, with some 600,000 members, also supported the marches and swelled numbers.

After several years of tax increases and welfare cuts, austerity is poised to deepen as the government looks for another €4 billion ($5.2 billion) to cut over the next two years, with the national health service, education, pensioners and government workers likely to be the hardest hit.

""There is no future without education, there is no future without culture,"" said student Ana Julia, 23. ""We have to protest to get back what they are trying to take away from us.""

The government is locked into debt-cutting measures in return for the €78 billion ($102 billion) financial rescue set up in 2011. More tax hikes this year sliced another chunk off wages."

For decades America had defined its interests in utilitarian terms: regional stability, countering terrorism and nuclear proliferation (and, in the cold war years, Soviet influence), defending Israel’s security, assuring the free flow of oil and other commerce. That often meant alliances of convenience with brutal authoritarians.

“But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore,” the president said. The uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and Libya had affirmed “that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations, but in the self-determination of individuals. The status quo is not sustainable.” Without renouncing our commitment to those old interests, the president embraced a supplementary set of “core principles”: supporting universal rights, encouraging political and economic reforms, opposing violence and oppression.

“Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest,” he insisted. “Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal.”

In the excruciating test that Egypt has become, the president has largely failed to live up to his own eloquently articulated standard. In the two years since his speech — and most shamefully in the eight weeks since the army’s coup — America has seemed not just cautious (caution is good) but timid and indecisive, reactive and shortsighted, stranded between our professed commitment to change and our fear of chaos. One of the administration’s most acute critics, Vali Nasr of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, goes so far as to suggest that United States policy is, whether by design or inertia, coming full circle: back to a pre-Arab Spring, Islamophobic, order-at-all-costs policy that puts us in the cynical company of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Is it any wonder that the generals in Egypt feel they can get away with murder — or, for that matter, that Syria’s Assad thinks he can call our bluff and poison his people with impunity?"

Money is first round of Sandy aid approved by Congress

States say block grants offer flexibility

New York will get most of money

WASHINGTON – New York, New Jersey and other states hit by Superstorm Sandy will get $5.4 billion in the first wave of recovery money approved by Congress, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday.

The funds come from the Community Development Block Grant program of the the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). States have said that money will be critical for rebuilding because the block grant program offers them flexibility to use the money where it's most needed.

""The work it took to pass the Sandy aid bill is starting to pay off,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""We know there is desperate need and anxious waiting in the places hit by the storm, and we will be making sure that this money gets to homeowners, small businesses and communities as quickly as possible.""

New York will get 65% of the first round of block grant money, or $3.5 billion, with about half ($1.8 billion) going to New York City and the rest ($1.7 billion) going to other parts of the state.

The remaining $1.9 billion will be split among Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and Rhode Island.

States and New York City must submit plans to HUD explaining what they want to do with the money. Additional details will be released in mid-February on specific projects that will be funded.

The money comes from the $50.5 billion disaster relief bill passed by Congress and signed into law last month. That bill contained $16 billion for states through the block grant program, meaning about $10.6 billion remains to be allocated.

Tuesday's announcement comes more than three months after the Oct. 29 storm wiped out entire communities in coastal New York and New Jersey. It killed more than 100 people in 10 states — 41 in New York City alone — and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Mass transit systems were paralyzed and power was cut to more than 8 million homes."

“One does not sharpen the axes after the right time; after the time they are needed.” — Russian Proverb

The late Ukrainian violinist Mischa Elman is considered one of the greatest of all time, but he has nothing on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has played the Obama administration better than any musician.

Washington is astounded at what happened over two days on the Syria front.

First, there was a supposed faux pas on Monday in London by Secretary of State John Kerry, who said the only way Syria could avoid a military strike was to give up its chemical weapons.

While the State Department was busy walking back his comment, Putin said it was a great idea and offered to facilitate the handover, a proposal to which Walid al-Moallem, the Syrian foreign minister, quickly agreed.

More On This...

Then on Tuesday, things accelerated at warp speed. Al-Moallem said Syria was willing to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the international agreement banning the use of chemical weapons, which was the first admission his country possessed them.

While the United Nations was preparing to hold one of its toothless “emergency meetings,” Putin then added a caveat: The United States and its allies (meaning Israel) would have to agree that in exchange they would pledge not to attack Syria.

It was then announced that Secretary Kerry would meet before the end of the week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva to discuss Syria.

[pullquote]

Putin seems to have pulled a page from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to withdraw missiles it had placed in Cuba if the United States promised not to attack Fidel Castro’s communist island. President Kennedy agreed and potential nuclear war was averted. Cuba is an island. Syria is in a far different and unstable neighborhood.

In his nationally televised address Tuesday night, President Obama said little that was not already known. By my count he used the words “I,” “me” and “my” 30 times in his 15-minute address.

He personalizes everything, but delivers little, except uncertainty in his foreign policy. The world is becoming increasingly dangerous because we have a president who either does not know how to lead, or doesn’t want to lead in foreign affairs.

That House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would credit the president with a diplomatic triumph because of a pledge from two men whose promises aren’t worth the paper on which they have yet to be written, is funnier than the monologues of late-night comedians.

Shortly after Putin’s “diplomatic triumph,” which might have been expected given Syria’s puppet status with Russia, ABC News Online reported that Putin plans to meet Friday with Iranian President Hassan Rowhani to renew Russia’s offer of S-300 air defense missiles to Iran. Putin knows how to stir the pot to America’s detriment.

Iran, with or without its proxy war in Syria and its arming of Hezbollah, remains the major threat in the region. President Obama, who once said he would consider negotiating with Iran because America had become too “arrogant,” shows that, too, was a meaningless policy proposal.

You can’t negotiate with evil. Evil must be defeated.

By assuming the role of a bad character on the world stage, Russia is a threat to peace.

During last year’s presidential campaign, Mitt Romney said Russia is “our number one geopolitical foe; they fight for every cause for the world’s worst actors.”

Who sounds more presidential: a tentative Barack Obama, who speaks loudly and too often, but carries a small stick, or Mitt Romney, who clearly understood that for threats to be diminished or deterred a president must have credibility?

It certainly isn’t our president."

""The President and the First Lady have been able to spend time with the Bushes and with Secretary Clinton. And so I think it's a unique experience obviously,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters aboard the flight.

He added that the dignitaries had been reflecting on their interactions with the anti-apartheid icon.

""He is a leader that intersected with so many different American political leaders of both parties over the years, and so each of them has their own experience with Mandela,"" Rhodes said.

Reporters on the flight said George W. Bush visited the press cabin twice for off-the-record conversations, totaling about an hour and a half. His wife joined him for part of the time.

Attorney General Eric Holder, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett were also on the plane Monday.

The high-profile figures mostly congregated in the plane's conference room, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. When not in the conference room, the Obama's stayed in the President's cabin while the Bushes sat in the medical office located behind the Obama cabin. Clinton sat in the senior staff cabin behind the medical office, according to the White House pool report.

""It's a very I think enjoyable experience certainly for the President and First Lady. And they're both grateful to be able to have (the) former President and First Lady, former Secretary of State on board,"" Carney added.

The plane stopped in in Dakar, Senegal to refuel before making its way to Johannesburg, South Africa.

Former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea, as well as former President Jimmy Carter, are also slated to attend Mandela's memorial, but they're traveling separately from Air Force One. Former President George H.W. Bush, who is 89, is not scheduled to fly to South Africa.

Gordon', 'Eric Schmitt']",U.S. Sends Arms to Aid Iraq Fight With Extremists,"But the counterterrorism effort the United States is undertaking with Iraq has its limits.

Iraq’s foreign minister has floated the idea of having American-operated, armed Predator or Reaper drones respond to the expanding militant network. But Mr. Maliki, who is positioning himself to run for a third term as prime minister and who is sensitive to nationalist sentiment at home, has not formally requested such intervention.

The idea of carrying out such drone attacks, which might prompt the question of whether the Obama administration succeeded in bringing the Iraq war to what the president has called a “responsible end,” also appears to have no support in the White House.

“We have not received a formal request for U.S.-operated armed drones operating over Iraq, nor are we planning to divert armed I.S.R. over Iraq,” said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, referring to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. For now, the new lethal aid from the United States, which Iraq is buying, includes a shipment of 75 Hellfire missiles, delivered to Iraq last week. The weapons are strapped beneath the wings of small Cessna turboprop planes, and fired at militant camps with the C.I.A. secretly providing targeting assistance.

In addition, 10 ScanEagle reconnaissance drones are expected to be delivered to Iraq by March. They are smaller cousins of the larger, more capable Predators that used to fly over Iraq.

American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say they have effectively mapped the locations and origins of the Qaeda network in Iraq and are sharing this information with the Iraqis.

Administration officials said the aid was significant because the Iraqis had virtually run out of Hellfire missiles. The Iraqi military, with no air force to speak of and limited reconnaissance of its own, has a very limited ability to locate and quickly strike Qaeda militants as they maneuver in western and northern Iraq. The combination of American-supplied Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, tactical drones and intelligence, supplied by the United States, is intended to augment that limited Iraqi ability.

The Obama administration has given three sensor-laden Aerostat balloons to the Iraqi government, provided three additional reconnaissance helicopters to the Iraqi military and is planning to send 48 Raven reconnaissance drones before the end of 2014. And the United States is planning to deliver next fall the first of the F-16 fighters Iraq has bought."
http://news.yahoo.com/restored-rome-catacomb-frescoes-add-debate-women-priests-112948688--sector.html,,[],Restored Rome catacomb frescoes add to debate on women priests,"By Philip Pullella ROME (Reuters) - Proponents of a female priesthood say frescoes in the newly restored Catacombs of Priscilla prove there were women priests in early Christianity. The Vatican says such assertions are sensationalist ""fairy tales"". The catacombs, on Rome's Via Salaria, have been fully reopened after a five-year project that included laser technology to clean some of the ancient frescoes and a new museum to house restored marble fragments of sarcophagi. Art lovers and the curious around the world who cannot get to Rome can join the debate by using a virtual visit to the underground labyrinth by Google Maps, a first-time venture mixing antiquity and modern high technology. Built as Christian burial sites between the second and fifth centuries and meandering underground for 13 km (8 miles) over several levels, the Catacombs of Priscilla contain frescoes of women that have provoked academic debate for many years. One, in a room called the ""Cubiculum of the Veiled Woman,"" shows a woman whose arms are outstretched like those of a priest saying Mass. She wears what the catacombs' Italian website calls ""a rich liturgical garment"". The word ""liturgical"" does not appear in the English version. She also wears what appears to be a stole, a vestment worn by priests. Another fresco, in a room known as ""The Greek Chapel,"" shows a group of women sitting around a table, their arms outstretched like those of priests celebrating Mass. Organizations promoting a female priesthood, such as the Women's Ordination Conference and the Association of Roman Catholic Woman Priests, have pointed to these ancient scenes as evidence of a female priesthood in the early Church. But the Vatican contests these interpretations which have also appeared in books on women in Christianity, such as the ""The Word According to Eve"" published in 1998. ""FAIRY TALE"" ""This is an elaboration that has no foundation in reality,"" Barbara Mazzei of the Pontifical Commission on Sacred Archaeology told Reuters at the presentation of the restoration on Tuesday. ""This is a fairy tale, a legend,"" said Professor Fabrizio Bisconti, superintendent of religious heritage archaeological sites owned by the Vatican, including numerous catacombs scattered around Rome. He said such interpretations were ""sensationalist and absolutely not reliable"". Bisconti said the fresco of the woman in a gesture of priest-like prayer was ""a depiction of a deceased person now in paradise,"" and that the women sitting at the table were taking part in a ""funeral banquet"" and not a Eucharistic gathering. The Church teaches that women cannot become priests because Jesus willingly chose only men as his apostles. Giorgia Abeltino, head of public policy at Google Italy, said special instruments and smaller cameras were developed for the virtual tour project, which is similar to Google's street view except that it explores the bowels of ancient Rome. The Catacombs of Priscilla are also famous for a fresco which experts believe is the oldest known image of the Madonna and Child, dating to about 230 AD. Lost for centuries after its entrances were sealed in ancient time, the catacombs were re-discovered in the 16th century and plundered of many gravestones, sarcophagi and bodies. Excavations in modern times began in the 19th century. (Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Michael Roddy and Angus MacSwan)"

At the same time, in tranquil Tel Aviv, Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up a busy round of shuttle diplomacy, laboring to revive a three-decade-old attempt at peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. He insisted on Sunday that he had made “real progress.”

The new secretary of state’s exertions — reminiscent of predecessors like Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III — have been met with the usual mix of hope and skepticism. But with so much of the Middle East still convulsing from the effects of the Arab Spring, Mr. Kerry’s efforts raise questions about the Obama administration’s priorities at a time of renewed regional unrest.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, once a stark symbol and source of grievance in the Arab world, is now almost a sideshow in a Middle East consumed by sectarian strife, economic misery and, in Egypt, a democratically elected leader fighting for legitimacy with many of his people."

NEW DELHI: ITS THE semifinal before next years big fight and the BJP is cruising to a 4- 0 knockout of the Congress, an India Today Group- ORG poll says. The India Today Group- ORG poll in four of the five states that will have elections this winter projects the saffron party coming to power in all it has surveyed.



In other words, the BJP gets to keep Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and will eject the Congress from power in Delhi and Rajasthan. Mizoram, the fifth state to have elections this winter, was not included in the poll.



The 4- 0 verdict should serve as the perfect platform for the BJP to launch its national effort to take back Delhi, fuelled by the growing popularity of their prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.



The details of the opinion poll, however, suggest Decembers verdict will have less to do with Modi and Rahul than the successes and failures of satraps.



Madhya Pradeshs Shivraj Singh Chouhan is all set to become the BJPs model regional leader with a massive mandate in his third term at the helm, effectively becoming the partys next Modi without the political baggage the Gujarat chief minister comes with. The poll projects his tally at 143 seats, the same number the BJP currently has, but sees the saffron voteshare going up from 38 per cent in 2008 to 43 per cent this time, placing the welfareoriented BJP leader on firm ground.



Modi can breathe easy, at least for now. Madhya Pradesh respondents arent in favour of Chouhan going national just yet. When asked whether they would prefer Narendra Modi or their own chief minister as the next Prime Minister, only 31 per c ent pick Chouhan over the Gujarat leader.



Tight race



Chouhan's Chhattisgarh counterpart has more to worry about.



Although Raman Singh is more popular than his Congress challenger - 57 per cent of respondents prefer him to Ajit Jogi - the BJP doesn't seem to be reaping the benefits of his popularity.



The poll suggests a tight race with almost no change in vote shares from 2008, though it leaves the saffron party with 46 seats over the Congress 42. With only 90 seats in the Assembly, the balance could yet be tipped by the vagaries of candidate selection by either party.



Despite the neck- and- neck race of Rajasthan's grimy poll campaign, the poll finds Vasundhara Raje likely to snatch her throne back from Ashok Gehlot's scandal- ridden government.



It'll be deja vu all over again for Rajasthan's residents.



Five years after her 120- seat majority turned into a 78- seat Opposition, Raje is now projected to bag at least 105 seats over the Congress 76.



Rajasthan is staying true to see- saw politics, but the Capital could well see the end of the 15- year reign of Sheila Dikshit. The poll - slightly inconclusive, it may be argued, because the BJP announced a surprise chief ministerial candidate midway through the survey exercise - hands 36 seats in the 70- strong Assembly to the BJP, giving the Congress 22 and Arvind Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party eight. Dikshit remains the most popular chief ministerial candidate with 28 per cent preferring her to Arvind Kejriwals 22 per cent. With the Congress party having alienated labourers - 80 per cent want a change of government - Dikshit won't get a chance to leverage her personal popularity. The poll projects a BJP government with only one seat over the 35- strong threshold, meaning the selection of candidates could still throw a spanner in the works.



In a sign that should gladden the hearts of those helming Team Modi, more than 58 per cent of voters in all four states say they would choose to vote out the Manmohan Singh government in a Lok Sabha election, though the numbers change substantially when asked whether they would prefer the NDA to take over. The writing is on the wall: right now its more anti- Congress than pro- Modi.



The India Today Group- ORG poll in four of the five states that will have elections this winter projects the saffron party coming to power in all



TAKING its opposition to the opinion polls to a new level, the Congress has decided to pull out its spokespersons from television debates on pre- election surveys.



The Congress spokespersons stayed away from the Headlines Today panel discussion on the India Today- ORG opinion poll results. The poll has projected the Congress rout in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.



The party has instructed all its spokespersons not to participate in discussions on opinion polls.



Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had termed pre- poll surveys a ""farce"". The BJP, meanwhile, claimed that any ban on opinion polls would be unconstitutional.

By Fareed Zakaria

Last March, President Barack Obama spoke about how Syria’s use of chemical weapons would be a “game-changer.” It has, except not quite in the sense that he meant. It has been an event that has confused and confounded the Obama administration. Whatever your views on the larger issues, it’s hard not to conclude that the administration’s handling of Syria over the last year has been a case study in how not to do foreign policy.

The president started out with an understanding that the Syrian conflict is a messy sectarian struggle that cannot be influenced easily by American military intervention. He was disciplined in resisting calls to jump into a cauldron. But from the start he confused and undermined this policy with loose rhetoric, perhaps egged on by some of his advisors and critics to ""do something.""

So he announced just over two years ago that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had to go. Now a pundit can engage in grandiose speech. The president of the United States should make declarations like this only if he has some strategy to actually achieve them. He did not.

In truth, Obama – and many others – miscalculated. They believed that al-Assad’s regime was near the end, misreading both its strength and brutality, but also the level of support it has from several segments of Syria.

Then, just about a year ago, came the off-the-cuff remarks about a red line on chemical weapons, insufficiently thought through but now publicly stated and definitive. Since then, American foreign policy in Syria has largely been concerned about ensuring that Obama’s threat does not seem empty. It has been a complicated dance.

But what American national interest is being followed? The administration says it is upholding international law. Except, as Fred Kaplan pointed out in Slate this week, the institutions that embody international law and consensus – the United Nations and other international organizations – do not support this action. The United States plus France and Turkey cannot be considered the embodiment of international law and global public opinion.

The nature of the strike, we are told, will be short and symbolic – a shot across the bow. In the midst of a civil war in which both sides are in a high-stakes struggle for survival, does anyone think that this will make any difference?

And then, the strangest twist – an unplanned, last minute appeal to Congress, paving the way for further delay, weakening momentum, erasing what little surprise existed, and setting the stage for a potential defeat at home.

I don’t think that this strike, should it eventually take place, will be as damaging as its critics fear. The al-Assad regime will likely hunker down, take it, and move on. It will make little difference one way or the other. But the manner in which the Obama administration has first created and then mismanaged this crisis will, alas, cast a long shadow on America’s role in the world."

In a statement released over the weekend, the family of Merrill Newman said the State Department had informed them that the Swedish ambassador to North Korea visited Newman at a Pyongyang hotel Saturday and reported he’s in good health. Sweden handles consular issues for Americans in North Korea as the U.S. and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.

""We were very pleased to hear that the ambassador was allowed to pay this first visit to Merrill,"" the statement said. ""As a result of the visit, we know that Merrill is in good health. ... Merrill reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good.""

Newman's family said the ambassador's visit eased their concerns about his well-being, and pleaded with North Korean authorities to take his health and age into account and let him go as an act of humanitarian compassion. Newman suffers from a heart rhythm disorder

The family's statement came hours after North Korea claimed that Newman had apologized for ""hostile acts"" against that country during a recent trip and alleged crimes against North Korea during the Korean War.

The family did not comment on the apology, but a yellow ribbon was attached to the front door of the Pasadena, Calif., home of Jeff Newman, the veteran’s son.

North Korean authorities released video showing Newman wearing glasses, a blue button-down shirt and tan trousers, reading his alleged apology, which was dated Nov. 9 and couldn't be independently confirmed. Pyongyang has been accused of previously coercing statements from detainees, and the four-page statement Newman read was riddled with stilted English and grammatical errors, such as ""I want not punish me.""

""I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman purportedly wrote, adding: ""Please forgive me.""

The statement, carried in the North's official Korean Central News Agency, said the war veteran allegedly attempted to meet with any surviving soldiers he had trained during the Korean War to fight North Korea, and that he admitted to killing civilians and brought an e-book criticizing North Korea.

Newman ""masterminded espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK and in this course he was involved in killings of service personnel of the Korean People's Army and innocent civilians,"" North Korea's official KCNA news agency said, according to Reuters.

""He admitted all his crimes and made an apology for them,"" the news agency was quoted as saying.

During the war, Merrill Newman trained a group of partisan fighters known as the 'Kuwol Regiment,' or 'Kuwolsan' in Korean, according to a former member of that regiment, Reuters reported.

It was one of several groups of anti-communist partisans under the command of the U.S. Army 8240th Unit -- dubbed the 'White Tigers' -- which coordinated some of the most daring missions of the Korean War. The White Tigers reportedly embedded undercover agents deep in enemy territory and spied on and disrupted North Korean operations, according to documented histories of the regiment.

North Korea remains technically in a state of war with the South and with the U.S. because the war ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

""We remain deeply concerned about the welfare of the U.S. citizens held in custody in the DPRK,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, referring to Newman and missionary Kenneth Bae, the latter of whom has been in North Korean custody for more than a year.

“We continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant him amnesty and immediate release” Hayden continued, using the acronym for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. “We also urge the immediate release of Merrill Newman … given Mr. Newman's advanced age and health conditions.”

It’s unclear whether Vice President Joe Biden will ask for Chinese help in pressuring North Korea to release Newman, during his visit to Asia this week.

The North Korean statement alleges that Newman says if he goes back to the U.S. he will “tell the truth about the country” -- a possible indication that Newman could be released.

The apology can be seen as Pyongyang taking steps needed to release Newman, said Yoo Ho-Yeol, a professor of North Korea studies at Korea University in Seoul. North Korea likely issued the confession in the form of an apology to resolve Newman's case quickly without starting legal proceedings, Yoo said.

North Korea is extremely sensitive about any criticism and regularly accuses Washington and Seoul of seeking to overthrow its authoritarian system through various means -- claims the U.S. and South Korea dismiss. The State Department has repeatedly warned Americans about traveling to the country, citing the risk of arbitrary detention.

Newman is an avid traveler and retired finance executive, living in a retirement community in Palo Alto, Calif. He was taken off a plane Oct. 26 by North Korean authorities while preparing to leave the country after a 10-day tour. His traveling companion seated next to him, neighbor and former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to depart.

Jeffrey Newman said his father wanted to return to the country where he spent three years during the Korean War.

Lee Newman, the veteran's wife, said in a statement released last week that the family feels a misunderstanding led to his detention.

North Korea has detained at least six Americans since 2009, including two journalists accused of trespassing and several Americans, some of whom are of Korean ancestry, accused of spreading Christianity. Bae, a Korean-American missionary and tour operator, has been detained for more than a year. North Korea sees missionary work as a Western threat to its authoritarian government.

In a statement Saturday, Bae's family said it was thankful for the U.S. calling for the release of both men. ""Now we're including Mr. Newman in our prayers,"" the family said.

David Kirkpatrick is the Times reporter who wrote the story that forced the paper’s Editorial page editor to defensively declare on Monday that it has not chosen to endorse Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. The editor said that the paper had a reporter on the ground who was witnessing the attacks.

That admission is even in Kirpatrick’s story, which, as Breitbart News reported, has received considerable blowback for attempting to “whitewash the Benghazi tragedy.” The Times alleges that there was no al-Qaeda involvement in the attacks that killed four Americans (contradicting the paper’s own reporting), that murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens had “little understanding” of the region, and that the terrorists were motivated by an anti-Muhammed YouTube video:

Soon scores, if not hundreds, of others were racing to the scene. Some arrived with guns, some with cameras. The attackers had posted sentries at Venezia Road, adjacent to the compound, to guard their rear flank, but they let pass anyone trying to join the mayhem. Witnesses said young men rushing inside had left empty pickup trucks from Ansar al-Shariah, but also all the other big militias ostensibly allied with the government. There is no doubt that anger over the video motivated many attackers. A Libyan journalist working for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries outside, and he learned of the film from the fighters who stopped him. Other Libyan witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet.

Kirkpatrick tweeted Monday night that the Times had “a reporter on the scene talking to the attackers during the attack.” His tweet prompted those on Twitter, including a former U.N. spokesperson for George W. Bush, to wonder if the Times knew who the attackers were and whether the reporter who was on the ground witnessed the murder of a U.S. Ambassador without calling for help:

Pollak'],Another Missing Hagel Speech: Keynote Address to the U.S. Middle East Project Jan. 2008,"Former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), who awaits a vote this week on his confirmation as Secretary of Defense, had failed to provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with more than a few speeches dating to January 2008. Since then, at least two missing speeches within that timeframe have been identified: one to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, for which a video was eventually found, and the other to Georgetown University, of which no text or recording has been provided.

Now a third speech has surfaced: an address by Hagel to the U.S. Middle East Project (USMEP), which advocates aggressive U.S. pressure in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

Hagel delivered the keynote address to the Annual Meeting of the International Board of USMEP. Photographs of the event were published on the group’s website, including the one above (with Brent Scowcroft, former adviser to President George H.W. Bush, seated next to Hagel) but no video or text of Hagel’s speech was published.

In 2009, Hagel co-authored a USMEP report that called for U.S. troops to be deployed to Israel and Palestine in the future to patrol the boundaries of the new Palestinian state. The report also indicated that peace could be “imposed” from the outside, and that it should be pursued regardless of “certain domestic constituencies.” Hagel serves on the board of USMEP with a variety of individuals with a strong interest in Middle East diplomacy.

The president of USMEP, Henry Siegman, is known for making radical and inflammatory statements. He attacked Sen. Lindsey Graham for questioning Hagel about the former Senator’s comments on the “Jewish lobby” (Siegman sanitized Hagel’s remark as “Israel lobby”). In January 2010, Siegman wrote: “Israel has crossed the threshold from the Middle East’s only democracy to the only ‘apartheid regime’ in the Western world. Hagel has been alleged of using the same analogy to predict Israel’s future if a peace agreement is not reached."

http://news.yahoo.com/israel-holds-flight-exercise-ahead-iran-talks-181726179.html,,[],Israel holds flight exercise ahead of Iran talks,"JERUSALEM (AP) — In an apparent message to Iran, the Israeli military said Thursday it had carried out a ""special long-range flight exercise"" and posted rare footage of the drill online.

The military said its squadrons practiced refueling planes in midair this week and tested the air force's ability. The accompanying footage shows a tanker plane refueling a fighter jet midair, a key part of any long-range operation.

The release of the video comes just days before Western powers are to open new talks with Iran over its disputed nuclear program.

The U.S. and its allies accuse Iran of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop nuclear weapons. Israel has repeatedly warned that it would be willing to take military action if necessary to stop Iran from going nuclear.

The talks on Iran's nuclear program will be held next week with the five permanent U.N. Security Council members — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France — plus Germany, collectively known as the P5+1.

President Barack Obama disclosed in an interview with The Associated Press last Friday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran continues to be a year or more away from building a nuclear weapon, in contrast to Israel's assessment that Tehran is closer.

In recent speeches, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned against letting Iran drag the world along for talks while it continues to pursue a bomb. He's been on a media blitz of late to warn the West against President Hassan Rouhani's softer tone, which he dismissed as a trick aimed at removing crippling economic sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear program.

Israeli military officials said the drill took place over Greece, a key regional ally. The military has done similar drills in the past but releasing the footage appears aimed at sending a message to Iran before the talks that a viable military options remains.

Israel views a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its very existence, citing Iran's repeated calls for Israel's destruction, its long-range missile program and its support for violent anti-Israel groups like the Hezbollah in Lebanon."

The president had hoped to use the meeting of the Group of 20 nations to build pressure on Congress as it considers whether to authorize missile strikes against Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government.

Before leaving for Washington, Obama said at a news conference that he would make his case in an address from the White House on Tuesday, an acknowledgment that his plans remain divisive both abroad and at home.

“This is not something that I think a lot of folks around the world, you know, find an appetizing set of choices,” he said. “But the question is, do these norms mean something? And if we’re not acting, what does that say?”

The president had to settle for a carefully worded statement backed by representatives of 10 countries that said Assad should be held accountable for an alleged nerve gas attack on Damascus suburbs two weeks ago, but did not explicitly support military action or promise participation. Among those who did not endorse the statement was the summit’s host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s closest ally.

Obama and Putin pulled up two chairs in a corner and talked for more than 20 minutes Friday, almost entirely about Syria. The leaders have exchanged harsh words, but Putin called the talk “friendly” and Obama said it was “candid and constructive.” But it did not break their impasse over how to respond to the suspected chemical weapons attack or how to end the 21/2-year-old Syrian civil war.

“We both remained unconvinced by each other’s opinion,” Putin said at a news conference. “But there is a dialogue. We hear each other, we understand arguments, but we don’t agree with them.”

Putin added that Russia will continue to supply weapons to Assad in his battle against the rebel opposition. Local news reports said three Russian ships and possibly a fourth were headed to the eastern Mediterranean, where the United States has four guided missile destroyers and an amphibious ship with 300 Marines.

At a dinner that stretched into the morning hours Friday, world leaders vigorously debated Obama’s plan, with many saying the president should wait for the United Nations to complete a report on the Aug. 21 attack and sanction a response. Obama argued that the U.N. Security Council was paralyzed by disagreement. Russia and China, which have veto power, have blocked efforts at the Security Council to put pressure on Assad.

Obama’s plan for what he emphasizes would be “limited and not open-ended” strikes also remains unpopular in the United States. The statement and the heated discussion was a reminder of what Obama has called “a heavy lift” as he seeks to sell lawmakers and the American public on the need for a military response.

The Senate could take the first vote on the issue as soon as Wednesday, but the House should “expect a robust debate” and a vote in the “next two weeks,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said.

The Obama administration had resisted intervention in the war, but switched course after the alleged chemical weapons attack, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded killed more than 1,400 people.

On Friday, Obama compared his bid for action to humanitarian intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and the U.S. failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. He cast the international division as the result of war-weary leaders “rationalizing not making tough choices.” The United States alone, he said, shoulders the burden of enforcing international agreements on human rights and chemical warfare.

“There are times where we have to make hard choices if we’re going to stand up for the things that we care about. And I believe that this is one of those times,” Obama said.

But Obama did not persuade a single ally to endorse a specific action. Immediately after he spoke, the White House released the joint statement from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Turkey, as well as the United States. It found that evidence “clearly points” to Assad’s government as responsible for the attack, called for a “strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience” and asserted that “the world cannot wait for endless failed processes.”

The statement did not specifically endorse military action, but concluded, “We support efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.”

A White House official, however, said there was no question what that implied. “The president has been very clear about how he intends to do that with tailored military action,” a senior administration official said.

The president has insisted that he does not need congressional authorization, but reiterated Friday that it would make a U.S. response “more effective and stronger.”

Obama would not say whether he will launch missiles even if he loses the vote. Pressed on the issue, Obama was blunt. “You’re not getting a direct response,” he said. “I’m not going to engage in parlor games.”

In his absence from Washington on Friday, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough worked the phones; U.S. officials briefed members of Congress; and Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, gave a speech at a think tank, arguing, “The use of limited military force can strengthen our diplomacy and energize the efforts by the U.N. and others.”

No one doubts that the Taliban have stepped up their attacks, but what is less clear is whether they are trying — or able — to mount an all-out attempt to test the Afghan security forces as they begin to take over completely from withdrawing foreign forces. By early summer, Afghan forces plan to be in charge throughout the country, with American and other allies in a supporting role.

The American military, which last year publicized data on enemy attacks with meticulous bar graphs, now has nothing to say. “We’re just not giving out statistics anymore,” said a spokesman, Col. Thomas W. Collins, suggesting that the Afghan Ministry of Defense might do so.

At the ministry, Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, asked if he could divulge the number of enemy attacks that had occurred this spring, had only one word to say: “No.”"

But as ABC News Chris Good stated, “President Obama’s ‘red line’ on Syria isn’t quite as straightforward as it’s been made out to be.”

The President’s exact words were “We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized, ” …“ That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.” The press along with most interpreted this to mean military action. The President did nothing to dissuade that belief. In fact he sent out John Kerry with an almost definitive statement that leads everyone to believe America was gearing up for a strike. In fact he even sent the navy in a poised position to attack. It was all a Bush-like action.

The Left-Wing blogosphere along with most war weary Americans went berserk. Suddenly, the President changed his stance and decided to have Congress vote on authorizing a strike while still reserving his right to strike irrespective of Congress’ decision.

It seemed as if he was trying to convince Congress to give him the approval in earnest. But even as he tried to convince Congress that this would be a surgical and rather minimal strike, it ‘leaked’ that the strike plans were much more extensive than previously advertised. That would seem like a sabotage of a ‘yes vote’ in Congress domestically, while scaring the hell out of the Russians internationally. After-all, there would be a good chance that the Russians would lose their only naval base in the region.

After the President got back from Russia where the President had some talks with Putin, Secretary of State Kerry had a news conference where he let it ‘slip out’ that Syria could only avoid an attack if they gave up their chemical weapons. Russia gave support to that statement faster than bloggers even noticed it was a statement of consequence.

President Obama never wanted war if it could be avoided. This is the man that said the following in his speech against the Iraq War on Oct 2, 2002.

After Sept. 11, after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. I don't oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne. What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income — to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics.

That said, the President needed all sides to believe that he could be as reckless as Bush was. In doing so the Russians were bound to use any opportunity or window to grab on to. Secretary of State Kerry gave them the necessary nugget.

From dire straits to possibility, was this all luck? For those who refuse to acknowledge the accomplishments of this President irrespective of the head winds from an intransigent and irresponsible Republican Congress, the answer is likely yes. Deep thinkers are likely to see this as a chess match and not simply luck in retrospect.

In one chess match the President was able to make the rank and file Republicans seem like doves, the neocons look reckless, the Tea Party wing seem like flip flopping buffoons all while potentially shutting down Syria’s use of chemical weapons without firing a shot or dropping a bomb. The Right Wing would have none of it. They are so filled with that disease, that mental disorder called hate that they would rather praise Putin as he ‘played Obama’.

Here is the reality; the only ones that weren’t played in this whole scheme were the President and his administration. This President is so self-assured that unlike many he is capable of taking a barrage of incoming missiles without responding. He keeps his eye on the ball. That is real leadership. One hopes that as he approaches the twilight months of his presidency, he will use this same technique for middle class centric issues, immigration issues, and other Plutocrat busting issues.

USA TODAY

U.S. intelligence has vetted the rebel forces

NATO member Turkey has air bases and ports U.S. forces have used

U.S. presence in Syria will probably be very small

AMMAN, Jordan — Now that President Obama has decided to provide military assistance to Syrian rebels, the next step is not difficult, said a military analyst who's been studying the Syria conflict.

U.S. intelligence has vetted the rebel forces to determine who should get the arms, and it has a willing middleman in Turkey on Syria's northern border, said Christopher Harmer, an analyst with the Institute for the Study or War.

Turkey, a NATO member, has air bases and ports U.S. forces have used to move equipment and people to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.

Turkey's Incirlak Air Base, which is technically a NATO air base, is one likely hub for U.S.-supplied weapons intended for the rebels, Harmer said.

""The U.S. moves cargo through there all the time,"" Harmer said. Establishing a supply route to the rebels ""is not that hard.""

Tony Badran, an analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Syrian troop movements toward the major rebel stronghold Aleppo could disrupt that well-worn supply route in Syria.

""It's a very important area for weapons supplies because it's close to the border with Turkey, and the countryside along the border with Turkey is really where all those weapons come in,"" Badran said.

The United States has been sending communication equipment to rebels of the Free Syrian Army through Turkey. Rebels have picked up shipments in Istanbul and driven them across the border into Syria along secure routes.

Turkey has sea ports for larger shipments. Most of the arms rebel leaders have requested are light weapons, chief among them shoulder-fired missiles. The missiles are wanted to shoot down Syrian aircraft or disable Syrian tanks.

If the United States agrees to provide such weapons, they can be delivered to Turkey by air, Harmer said. Arms could then travel by truck or rail to the Turkish border with Syria, and that's where U.S. control over the weapons will probably end, Harmer said.

The effort depends on Turkish cooperation. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has allowed weapons from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to move through his country, and he supports the toppling of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.

The Syrian rebels control at least 20 miles of Syrian territory south of the Turkish border, ""so there's really no mechanical way for the Syrian government to stop them,"" Harmer said.

There is a risk that Syria will directly attack Turkey over the shipments. Syria has fired missiles into Turkish territory along the border to target weapons shipments and rebel fighters seeking protection. Turkey has hosted about 1 million Syrian refugees, and rebels have camps there as well.

The U.S. presence in Syria will probably be very small, limited to CIA or Special Forces operators, and focused on identifying rebel groups they can trust, Harmer said.

""We don't want to provide weapons to al-Qaeda affiliates"" who are also fighting the government in Syria, he said.

When the conflict started, the rebels' identity and motivations were not well understood. Harmer said two years have changed that situation. The Institute for the Study of War and other independent groups have completed extensive studies on the various rebel groups.

""We know from open sources, YouTube videos and interviews who are secular freedom lovers and who are the extremist religious types,"" Harmer said.

Rebel leaders have reported Syrian government forces moving toward Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north and a hub for rebel operations and supplies and fighters coming from Turkey.

The massing of troops for a possible offensive on Aleppo has led to ""a major freakout"" among rebel supporters about whether the divided city will fall to a combined assault by government forces and fighters from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia in Lebanon, Badran said.

Assad used a combination of total siege, artillery bombardment and hundreds of Hezbollah ground forces to overtake Qusair last week after a battle that lasted almost a month, but that approach will be much more difficult in Aleppo, Badran said.

Rebels control most of the countryside between Aleppo and Turkey to the north, and activists on the ground report that the Turks have secured all the border crossings, in preparation for weapons shipments to start flowing, he said.

The timing of Obama's announcement provides political cover to other U.S. allies, such as the British, French, Turks, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that are poised to start supplying rebels in earnest, he said.

""To lock down Aleppo like the regime did in Qusair is not going to be as easy,"" Badran said.

The Free Syrian Army has been complaining over a lack of weapons since last year. What they mainly have is small arms and grenades taken from regime forces or smuggled through from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, sometimes paid for by Gulf states such as Qatar.

""A couple of countries have been doing that already through Turkey or Jordan,"" said Hozan Ibrahim, a Syrian opposition activist based in Berlin. ""It is not an obvious cooperation, but they are doing that underground, undercover, and that is totally OK with us. And of course, in Turkey, there is the headquarters of the Syrian army.""

Commanders say that as the conflict has dragged on, more regime soldiers have defected and foreign fighters have joined the battle, rebels' technical know-how has grown.

""At the beginning of the revolution, we used to buy arms from the regime's shabiha (thugs),"" said Abu Jarah, leader of Al al-Bait Battalions in Binish-Idlib, part of the opposition forces. ""The regime wanted to get rid of all its damaged arms, so they pushed them onto the streets.

""We used to buy them for high prices because our need to defend ourselves was urgent. Meanwhile, they used that money to buy advanced, more lethal weapons. After that, some traders in Aleppo assisted us through Turkey, Lebanon and the Jordanian borders near Daraa.

""Now, we've started to manufacture and develop our own weapons,"" he said. ""The Syrian people get the means to defend themselves any way they can.""

Still, shortages are everywhere, and the FSA needs help. Qatar money has been drying up, and as Hezbollah has become increasingly involved, fewer arms are flowing across the Lebanese border.

""First of all, we need some international coalition of the willing,"" Ibrahim said. ""If the U.S. openly starts arming, then the other countries will have more courage to start arming us, too. Otherwise, we will continue where we are: a situation where nobody is willing to act really and people continue to die while the radicals are gaining more and more ground.""

http://news.yahoo.com/eu-no-deal-reached-nuclear-talks-iran-182548451.html,,[],EU: No deal reached at nuclear talks with Iran,"ALMATY, Kazakhstan (AP) — Iran and six world powers failed to reach agreement Saturday on how to reduce fears that Tehran might use its nuclear technology to make weapons, extending years of inconclusive talks and adding to concerns the diplomatic window on reaching a deal with Tehran may soon close.

Expectations the negotiations were making progress rose as an afternoon session continued into the evening. But comments by the two sides after they ended made clear that they fell far short of making enough headway to qualify the meeting as a success.

""What matters in the end is substance, and ... we are still a considerable distance apart,"" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's head of foreign policy, told reporters at the end of the two-day talks.

Ashton, the convener of the meeting, said negotiators would now consult with their capitals. She made no mention of plans for new talks — another sign that the gap dividing the two sides remains substantial. She said she would talk with chief Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili by telephone over further steps.

Jalili spoke of ""some distance between the positions of the two sides."" He suggested Iran was ready to discuss meeting a key demand of the other side — cutting back its highest-grade uranium enrichment production and stockpile — but only if the six reciprocated with rewards far greater than they are now willing to give.

Western negotiators noted an improved atmosphere from previous sessions, with Ashton speaking of ""a real back and forth between us when were able to discuss details, to pose questions, and to get answers directly.""

She described the better negotiating climate as a ""very important element.""

Still, the lack of forward movement in international negotiations that started a decade ago was certain to increase concerns that diplomacy was ineffective as a tool to stop Iran from moving toward nuclear-weapon making capacity.

Israel is most worried. The Jewish state says Iran is only a few months away from the threshold of having material to turn into a bomb and has vowed to use all means to prevent it from reaching that point. The U.S. has not said what its ""red line"" is, but has said it will not tolerate an Iran armed with nuclear weapons.

Story continues

""The Iranians are using the round of talks to pave the way toward a nuclear bomb,"" said Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli minister for intelligence and strategic affairs, in a text message to reporters. ""Israel has already warned that the Iranians are taking advantage of the rounds of talks in order to buy time to advance in uranium enrichment, step by step, toward a nuclear weapon.""

Urging the international community to set a ""short, clear and final timetable"" for further talks, he said ""the time has come for the world to show a more aggressive position and make it abundantly clear to the Iranians that their game of negotiations is coming to an end.""

Any strike on Iran could provoke fierce retaliation directly from Iran and through its Middle East proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, raising the specter of a larger Middle East conflict and adding to the urgency of keeping both sides at the negotiating table.

At the talks in the Kazakh city of Almaty, the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany were asking Tehran to greatly limit its production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20 percent, which is just a technical step away from weapons-grade uranium. That would keep Iran's supply below the amount needed for further processing into a weapon.

But the group views that only as a first step in a process. Iran is operating more than 10,000 centrifuges. While most are enriching below 20 percent, this material, too could be turned into weapons-grade uranium, although with greater effort than is the case for the 20-percent stockpile.

Tehran also is only a few years away from completing a reactor that will produce plutonium, another pathway to nuclear arms.

The U.N. Security Council has demanded a stop to both that effort and all enrichment in a series of resolutions since 2006. Iran denies any interest in atomic arms, insists its enrichment program serves only peaceful needs, says it has a right to enrich under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and describes U.N. Security Council demands as illegal.

The lack of progress at Almaty was a clear indication that Tehran wants greater rewards for any concessions that the six are ready to give. Among other incentives, they have offered to lift sanctions on Iran's gold transactions and petrochemical trade. But Iran demands much more substantial sanctions relief, including an end to international penalties crippling its oil trade and financial transactions

A senior U.S. official cited Iranian officials who described the six-power offer of limited sanctions relief in exchange for meeting their demands on 20-percent uranium as a ""turning point"" when the two sides met last month. The official said the U.S. administration was ""disappointed that this rhetoric did not carry over into our negotiations.""

The official demanded anonymity as a condition for participation in a post-meeting briefing for reporters.

Jalili in turn urged the six powers to demonstrate their ""willingness and sincerity"" by taking appropriate confidence-building steps in the future"" — shorthand for Iran's demand to lift major sanctions and offer other concessions.

At the same time, he suggested some potential give on the Iranian side, suggesting discussion on some curbs of 20-percent enrichment ""can be continued in the talks"" if the six ""move away from hostile treatment ... of the Iranian people.""

With Iran previously describing the crushing sanctions on its oil exports and financial transactions as hostile acts, his comments suggested that Iran would consider compromise only if those penalties were lifted. That is far more than the relief being offered, with the six prepared to remove sanctions only on Tehran's gold transactions and petrochemical exports.

In demanding recognition of its right to enrich, Iran may hope to exploit some differences among the six, with Russia in recent months pushing for concessions on that point as a way to break negotiating deadlock.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led his country's delegation at Almaty, said after the talks that Moscow ""considers that it's necessary to recognize all rights of Iran, including enrichment."" In exchange, he said Iran must accept more international monitoring of its nuclear program.

A British Foreign Office statement said ""a wide gap remains between the parties. Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough.""

Indirectly warning of further sanctions, the statement urged Tehran to ""consider carefully whether it wants to continue on its current course, and face increasing pressure and isolation from the international community, or to enter into meaningful negotiations.""

But Ryabkov described the meeting as ""undoubtedly a step forward."" Those remarks, and his comments on enrichment, both to Russian news agencies, suggested differences exist among the six, despite assertions by negotiators from Western nations of total unity at the negotiations.

Obama to take Syria case to Congress

Assad warns strike could trigger Middle East %27powder keg%27

Britain rules out new vote on Syria

– Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain left a Labor Day meeting at the White House saying they had greater confidence in President Obama's strategy on Syria. Both said that they would support Obama's resolution for military action, if the president can clarify his plan for bolstering the Syrian opposition forces.

– In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Syrian President Bashar Assad called the Middle East a ""powder keg"" and warned that Western military strikes on his country could spark a regional war. Assad also challenged the U.S. and France to present proof that his government was responsible for the Aug. 21 chemical attack in Damascus.

-- A French government report published Monday about Syria's chemical weapons program that found that at least 281 deaths could be attributed to the attack in areas outside Damascus. A French intelligence estimate alleges that the Syrian regime launched an attack Aug. 21 involving ""massive use of chemical agents,"" AP reported.

– Members of Congress in both parties said they would not be able to support the current draft of a resolution authorizing Obama to launch a military strike.

– Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, called U.S. information on the alleged chemical attack in Syria that may have killed 1,429, including at least 426 children, ""absolutl unconvincing."" Lavrov said: ""Yes, they showed us some findings but there was nothing specific there: no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.""

– Secretary of State John Kerry said on news programs Sunday that the U.S. has received hair and blood samples that have ""tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" a deadly nerve agent first developed in Germany in the 1930s.

– China said it is opposed to the U.S. acting alone in Syria and thinks any response must conform to the U.N. Charter and the basic principles underlying international relations.

– Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg ruled out another vote in Parliament over action in Syria. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Clegg said he could not ""foresee any circumstances"" under which MPs could be asked to vote again after rejecting a motion for a military strike last week. Clegg's comments came after London Mayor Boris Johnson said a new vote could take place if new and ""better"" evidence emerged.

– Australia said it supports the U.S. taking action in Syria but didn't offer to provide military assistance.

– The United Nations said that around five million people inside Syria have now been displaced and two million have fled to neighboring countries as a result of the civil war.

– NATO's chief says he is convinced that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people and insists a strong reaction is needed to show dictators around the world that such weapons cannot be used with impunity.

Debate surges in Peru,"Story highlights Authorities say Peru will likely hold a selective draft this May Those who don't want to serve can pay a $715 fine Critics say the measure allows the wealthy to avoid military service Military leaders say the new measure is not discriminatory

(CNN) —

Is paying a fine to get out of military service fair?

The question is at the center of a debate surging in Peru this month as the South American country’s government reveals new rules for a possible draft.

Authorities say if the government can’t fill thousands of vacancies with volunteers, it will start a draft this May. Men and women 18 and over are eligible. But those called up who do not want to serve can pay a fine of 1,850 soles ($715).

Critics say the measure will allow the wealthy to avoid military service and leave the poor with no other choice than to join.

Military leaders say the new measure isn’t discriminatory and that the draft is a necessary step to shore up dwindling ranks.

The option of paying a fine to avoid service has drawn sharp criticism from Peru’s government ombudsman. And opposition lawmakers have said they will summon Peru’s defense minister to testify over the matter.

An editorial in the El Comercio newspaper this week described the new policy as “discrimination against those who have the least.”

“This is a hurdle designed so that only the people who have economic resources can jump over it,” the editorial said.

Nearly a third of Peru’s population lives below the poverty line, according to government statistics. A minimum wage salary is 750 soles ($290) per month.

The debate over who serves in the military, and why they join the ranks, resonates far beyond Peru’s borders.

In Israel, thousands of demonstrators last year demanded an end to rules that make ultra-Orthodox Jews exempt from that country’s military draft.

For more than a decade U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel has been pushing a controversial proposal to reinstate a draft in the United States.

“Currently the burden of defending our nation is carried by less than 1% of the American population,” the New York Democrat wrote in an opinion column published on CNN.com in January. “The 2.2 million members of the armed forces in active duty, the National Guard and the Reserve have become a virtual military class that makes the ultimate sacrifice of laying down life and limb for our country.”

Bringing back the draft, he argued, “would compel the American public to have a stake in the wars we fight as a nation.”

Many countries around the world require military service. Colombia, which borders Peru, also fines those who refuse to serve after they’re called up.

In Peru, officials say sheer numbers have forced them to consider a draft, more than a decade after the country passed a law eliminating obligatory military service.

Jose Cueto, chief of the joint command of Peru’s armed forces, told the state-run Andina news agency that there has been a “drastic decrease” in the number of people who join the military since the country switched to a volunteer force.

In a carefully crafted address that was widely regarded as the centerpiece of his first trip to Israel as president, Mr. Obama spoke in lofty terms about Israel’s history and ideals, pointing out again and again how America had stood at its side and saying he remains unquestionably committed to Israel’s security. But the speech also seemed intended as an opportunity for Mr. Obama to appeal to a young generation of Israelis who do not necessarily share the hardened views of many of their elders, who are at best mistrustful of the Palestinians and wary of Mr. Obama himself.

“I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace, but question its underlying premise, and that’s a part of democracy and the discourse between our two countries,” Mr. Obama said in the speech at the Jerusalem Convention Center, which was televised live. “But it is important to be open and honest with one another. Politically, given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America, the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside and express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do.”

In what appeared to be a gentle swipe at the tough Palestinian policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Obama said he believed Israelis have a “true partner” in the administration of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, with whom he had met hours earlier in the city of Ramallah."
http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-kidnap-americans-commercial-ship-165734331.html,,[],Pirates kidnap Americans from commercial ship,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Pirates kidnapped two Americans working on a commercial ship near the coast of Nigeria, U.S. officials said Thursday. And the Nigerian navy ordered its forces to mount a rescue operation.

""We are seeking additional information so we can contribute to the safe resolution of the situation,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""Our principal concern now is the safe return of two American citizens.""

The captain and an engineer were taken away from an offshore supply vessel during an attack Wednesday in international waters off the Gulf of Guinea, said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the information.

The two were kidnapped from the U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot ship owned by Edison Chouest Offshore of Louisiana, the official said. The vessel and 11 other members of the crew were released and the two hostages were believed taken to shore in Nigeria, the official said.

Nigerian navy Capt. Kabir Aliyu confirmed that there was an attack. He said the Nigerian navy has directed its operational commands and bases ""to search (for) and rescue the crew members and the vessel."" Aliyu did not respond to a question asking whether the Nigerian navy was working with U.S. Marines who are in the area for training.

A spokesman for the U.S. company did not return multiple phone calls and emails seeking comment. It was unclear whether a ransom demand or any other demands had been made.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. has been concerned by ""a disturbing increase"" in maritime crime, including piracy, in the area.

Asked what the U.S. would do about the incident and about the long-term piracy issue in Nigeria, she said, ""At this point, we're still looking into it. ... We are concerned by this increase. We've worked and will continue to work with states on the Gulf of Guinea to help them respond effectively to maritime crime in these waters.""

The U.S. defense official said the U.S. Navy was monitoring the situation and that the closest military vessel was a Dutch navy ship in the Gulf of Guinea with 90 U.S. Marines aboard as part of an Africa training mission.

BJP Vice-President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi questioned whether the UPA is a government or a theatrical production. Is this a government or a theatrical production?

Rahul Gandhi earlier in the day said he personally felt that what the government is doing on the ordinance is wrong.

If we actually want to stop corruption then we cannot make these compromises,"" he added. The fate of the proposed ordinance to bypass the apex court's ruling on barring convicted MPs and MLAs looked uncertain yesterday after President Pranab Mukherjee summoned Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Law Minister Kapil Sibal to seek a clarification. The Union Cabinet had approved an ordinance to reverse the Supreme Court judgment mandating the immediate disqualification of lawmakers convicted for a criminal offence punishable with a jail term of more than two years. The ordinance seeks to reverse the Supreme Court judgement that had not only disqualified lawmakers convicted of offences with two years or more in jail, but also barred from contesting elections. The ordinance will allow convicted legislators to continue in office, if the appeal against the conviction is admitted by a higher court within 90 days. In a landmark verdict delivered on July 10, the apex court ruled that MPs or MLAs shall stand disqualified from holding the membership of the house from the date of conviction. ""The only question is about the vires of section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) and we hold that it is ultra vires and that the disqualification takes place from the date of conviction,"" said an apex court bench of Justices A.K. Patnaik and S.J. Mukhopadhaya. The apex court, however, said that its decision will not apply to MPs, MLAs or other lawmakers who have been convicted and have filed their appeals in the higher courts before the pronouncement of this verdict. According to the provision of Representation of the People Act, a lawmaker cannot be disqualified in the event of his conviction in a criminal case if he or she files an appeal in the higher court.

His whole budget strategy, after all, is directed almost entirely toward gently coaxing Republicans his way, without any concern as to whether what he is doing is demobilizing the very people he needs on his side now.

President Obama sounded genuinely outraged last week when he talked about the Kafkaesque situation at the Guantanamo prison camp, where the United States has been holding 166 men without trial for terms that are, at this point, officially endless. ""It's not sustainable,"" the president thundered. ""I mean, the notion that we're going to continue to keep over 100 individuals in a no man's land in perpetuity?"" But at least some of Obama's anger should be directed at himself, because his own silence and passivity on Guantanamo are part of the problem.

For nearly a quarter century, Howard Kurtz has served as hall monitor for Washington’s conventional wisdom, handing out demerits to independent-minded journalists who don’t abide by the mainstream rules. So, there is some understandable pleasure seeing Kurtz face some accountability in his ouster as bureau chief for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. However, the more salient point is that Kurtz, who continues to host CNN’s “Reliable Sources” show, should never have achieved the level of influence in journalism that he did. Throughout his career, he has consistently—and unfairly—punished journalists who had the courage to ask tough questions and pursue truly important stories."

http://news.yahoo.com/american-held-iran-writes-letter-john-kerry-133610555.html,,[],American held in Iran writes letter to John Kerry,"DETROIT (AP) — A former U.S. Marine held in Iran for two years said in a letter to the U.S. secretary of state that he has endured ""miserable prison conditions"" and believes Tehran is holding him hostage for use in a possible prisoner exchange.

Amir Hekmati's letter, handwritten and dated Sept. 1, was addressed to John Kerry and first published Wednesday by Britain's Guardian newspaper.

Hekmati, 30, wrote that he has been ""held on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions and prolonged periods of solitary confinement.

""This is part of a propaganda and hostage-taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges,"" he wrote in the letter that the Guardian said was smuggled from the prison.

Family spokesman Greg Romano told The Associated Press that Hekmati's sister, Sarah Hekmati, authenticated the letter, confirming that the handwriting is her brother's as is the letter's tone. Romano provided the AP with a copy of the letter.

The U.S. State Department said it had received the letter.

""We have asked ... Iranian authorities to permit a visit by officials of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran to determine the well-being of Mr. Hekmati and, of course, to release him,"" department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington on Wednesday.

Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran.

Hekmati has been detained in Iran on what the U.S. says are false espionage charges since his 2011 arrest. Hekmati's family says he traveled to Iran to visit his grandmothers.

The letter goes on to say that while Hekmati and his family ""have suffered greatly,"" he ""will accept nothing but"" an unconditional release.

The U.S. previously has requested assistance from new President Hasan Rouhani, who has stressed a more diplomatic approach to foreign affairs than did his hard-line predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The new president is scheduled to visit the United Nations later this month.

Story continues

""It's time for Amir to be released. It's time for him to come home to Michigan, to his family. My brother has committed no crime,"" Sarah Hekmati said in a written statement. ""More than two years in detention, much of which was spent in solitary confinement, is far too long. He has never been a spy for any country or entity or person. They have punished him enough. We hope Iran's new President Rouhani and his new government recognize this point.""

Hekmati was born in Arizona and grew up in Michigan. He carries U.S. and Iranian passports.

Iran accused him of being a CIA spy, then tried, convicted and sentenced him to death. Iran's Supreme Court ordered a retrial last year, but he remains imprisoned.

The Washington Times reported Monday on emails, from late 2011 to early 2012, obtained by the nonprofit Freedom Watch after the group filed suit in federal court. They detail discussions New York Times reporter David Sanger had with the State Department before the publication of a book that revealed classified information about the so-called Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities.

In one email, Sanger reportedly pressed the State Department to cooperate by noting the help he'd gotten from other wings of the Obama administration.

""I'm getting a bit concerned about the pace of our interviews -- or lack of pace, to be more precise -- for the book,"" Sanger reportedly said in the October 2011 message to a State Department press officer. ""The White House is steaming away; I've seen [National Security Adviser Thomas E.] Donilon many times and a raft of people below. Doing well at the Pentagon. But on the list I sent you starting on Sept. 12 we've scheduled nothing, and chapters are getting into final form.""

Donilon was the national security adviser at the time, before leaving the administration in July. He was replaced by former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The nature of his discussions with Sanger are unclear.

Fox News confirmed in late June that another high-ranking official, retired Gen. James Cartwright, is under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information on the Iran program. Cartwright was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time.

Larry Klayman, director of Freedom Watch, told The Washington Times that the emails show the Obama administration had a ""super-close relationship"" with Sanger and was ""literally force-feeding him.""

At the same time, the Justice Department is investigating that and other security leaks, after having appointed two U.S. attorneys to probe them last year.

The information about the anti-Iran program was first reported in a June 2012 New York Times article adapted from Sanger's book. It revealed behind-the-scenes details on the Stuxnet program, and concern that it had spread from Iran's nuclear facilities to the Internet.

Some lawmakers claimed that senior officials in the administration must have been complicit in leaking details about the program. The administration has rejected any suggestion that it authorized the leaks for political gain."
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130524-creating-our-cities-from-waste,2013-05-24 00:00:00,['Mitchell Joachim'],Turning waste into building blocks of the future city,"Cities were invented for a multitude of purposes. First was the need for the concentration of vital resources in a given region - then came their role as places for worship, trade, governmental control and military defence. But in our modern age, urban spaces were conceived and shaped primarily around mass market industrialisation.

Today the consequences of the post-industrial city have had an incredible impact on the environment. It is widely accepted cities impinge on areas well beyond their borders. Waste streams in cities are the leading factor in pollution of the areas outside their geo-political boundaries.

Urban waste must be reconfigured – our time has run out. Reports of garbage problems from Naples in Italy to Beijing in China underscore the size of the problem. Landfills are filled and incinerators have the potential to release poisons such as dioxin. We must have a new strategy towards refuse in urban places, one that includes the design of consumables in the first place. Many concepts exist already, but what are some of the most radical solutions to our wasteful ways?

Recently, the planet reached 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere for the first time since modern humans evolved. Reversing such wasteful habits will require tremendous effort, as minuscule changes will not alter this course. Humanity has reached its peak of one-way consumption.

Now is the time to design waste to regenerate our cities. What are the possibilities for urban environments after our aged infrastructure is recalibrated? How might bigger cities and waste mix? One key idea is that waste is not recycled through infrastructural mechanisms but instead up-cycled in perpetuity.

All over the globe municipal waste is on the rise. In China, the amount of municipal solid waste produced is rising by 6% per year. It has kept pace with the rapid urbanization in China. Many parts of South America are also rapidly urbanising and their waste has grown with it. Brazilian cities have had a steady 10% increase in waste headed for landfills. India will see a 500% increase in e-waste – materials from cell phones, TVs, refrigerators – destined for urban landfills. A lot of it is imported from developed countries. South Africa and China will also have to deal with 400% more garbage from foreign e-waste.

Mankind will have to solve our waste problem in cities. If we don’t, it’ll be the end of us. There are a number of possible solutions, and some of them are already being adopted.

Super-sized waste

The first credible step is to reduce trash by considering the life cycle of objects we make. Things that are designed for obsolescence should be outlawed. Additionally, products must be manufactured with the intent to reuse, disassemble, take back or upcycle. For instance, instead of tossing out bottles we could adapt them for use as planters, lighting fixtures, building wall elements.

Other cities have highly organised systems to solve these problems. In Zurich, the city requires individuals pay handsomely for waste that is simply discarded, while thorough recycling is encouraged by free citywide collection services. Therefore well over 90% of municipal waste inside Zurich is recycled and sent to incinerators to produce energy. Burning waste is not the answer but it does have opportunities in the mid-term. It requires substantial need for enforceable regulations, comprehensive industry controls, economic feasibility plans, and the latest ultra-expensive technology such as plasma gasification plants.

In similarly developed cities - Malmo, Tokyo, or Copenhagen – it makes sense to use a waste-to-energy processes. These prevailing urban populations are stable and easily taxed to support such a system – not so easy in developing cities such as Lagos or Jakarta.

Outreach programs that invite the public to observe civic waste systems as a spectacle are instrumental in spreading awareness. The Hangzhou Environmental Group in China has over 10,000 tourists a year visiting its landfill facility. Freshkills landfill in New York will be transformed into the largest public park in over 100 years that will showcase engineered nature from waste. Cuba, an island nation that has been cut-off from trade imports, has conserved almost everything through carful recycling of parts - from 1950’s cars to eyeglasses, nothing is wasted.

Look at how such a system might affect the US. America is the lead creator of waste on the earth, making approximately 30% of the world's trash and tossing out around three-quarters of a ton per US citizen per year. It seems value has devolved into rampant waste production: mega-products scaled for super-sized franchise brands, big-box retail, XXL jumbo paraphernalia and so on. The US mindset is typifying a throwaway consumer culture. Where does it all end up? Heather Rogers said in her investigative book Gone Tomorrow that throwing things away is unsustainable. The first step we must take is reduction – meaning a massive discontinuation of objects designed for obsolescence. Then we need a radical reuse plan. Our waste crisis is immense. What is our call to action?

New York City is currently disposing of nearly 33,000 tons of waste per day. Previously, most of this discarded material ended up in Fresh Kills on Staten Island, before operations were blocked. Manhattan’s inhabitants discard enough paper products to fill the Empire State Building every two weeks. Terreform ONE’s Rapid Re(f)use and Homeway projects strive to capture, reduce and redesign New York’s refuse infrastructure. The initiative imagines an extended city reconstituted from its own junked materials. The concept remakes the city by using all the trash entombed in the Fresh Kills landfill. Theoretically, the method should produce, at minimum, seven new Manhattan Islands. New York City’s premier landfill was started by the divisive urban planner Robert Moses and driven by apathetic workers and machines. Now, guided by a prudent community with smart equipment, we must reshape it.

‘Smart trash’

How could this work? Outsized automated 3-D printers could be modified to rapidly process trash and to complete the task within decades. These potential automatons would be entirely based on existing techniques commonly used in industrial waste compaction devices. To accomplish this job, nothing drastically new needs to be invented. Most technologies are intended to be off-the-shelf. Instead of machines that crush objects into cubes, compaction devices could benefit from adjustable jaws that would craft simple shapes into smart ‘puzzle blocks’ for assembly. The blocks of waste material could be predetermined, using computational geometries, in order to fit domes, archways, lattices, windows, or whatever patterns would be needed. Different materials could serve specified purposes: transparent plastic for fenestration, organic compounds for temporary decomposable scaffolds, metals for primary structures and so on. Eventually, the future city would make no distinction between waste and supply.

If you think this sounds familiar, it is. Think back to the 2008 Pixar animation WALL-E. At approximately the same time that Rapid R(e)fuse was initiated, the movie was announced. WALL-E’s name is an acronym: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth Class. Left behind by mankind, he toils with trillions of tons of non-recycled inner-city trash. He tirelessly configures mountains of discarded material. Why pyramids of trash? WALL-E’s daily perpetual feats seem almost futile. The film omits exactly why he is programmed to pile refuse; and there is the shortcoming.

There’s a deeper motivation for stacking refuse. What if the rubbish was refabricated to become real urban spaces or buildings? If it is plausible to adapt current machinery, how much material is available? At first sight, any sanitary landfill may be viewed as an ample supply of building materials. Heavy industrial technologies crush cars or to automatically sort out garbage are readily available. 3-D printing has exhausting capabilities if adjusted to larger scales. This is where Terreform ONE’s city began.

The envisioned city would be derived from trash; not ordinary trash, but ‘smart refuse’. A significant factor of the city composed from smart refuse is ‘post-tuning’ – and we would have to adapt this raw material for use. Integration into the city texture would be a learning process. In time, the responses would eventually become more attuned to the needs of the urban dweller. This new city may be built from trash, but it will also be connected via computers. The buildings blocks will learn.

Cities, unlike machines, are similar to a complex ecology. Ecology is capable of achieving a continuous harmonious state, or even further, a positive intensification. If ecological models are productively everlasting, urban models can logically follow.

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/09/israel-official-says-no-palestinian-state-in-67-lines/,2013-06-09 00:00:00,[],Israel official says government won't accept Palestinian state in '67 lines,"A senior Israeli official on Sunday said that the ruling Likud Party will not accept a Palestinian state with the borders favored by the Palestinians and the international community, a new hurdle to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's effort to restart peace talks in his latest visit to the region.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved to distance himself from the comments by his deputy defense minister, Danny Danon.

In a TV interview, Danon said ""there is certainly no majority"" in the Likud for establishing a Palestinian state based on Israel's borders before the 1967 Mideast war.

The Palestinians seek an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, areas captured by Israel in 1967. The Palestinians say final borders between Israel and a future Palestine must be based on the 1967 lines. Israeli hard-liners oppose a broad withdrawal from the West Bank on both security and religious grounds.

""A Palestinian state on the 1967 lines is something dangerous for Israel, and therefore I oppose that idea,"" Danon told Channel 2 TV. He said it was possible that the broader coalition government, which includes other hard-line parties, also opposes a return to the 1967 lines.

The international community, including the U.S., has endorsed the 1967 lines as the basis for border talks. While Netanyahu says he supports Palestinian independence, he has refused to commit to any borders, saying only that all issues of disagreement should be resolved in negotiations.

Officials in Netanyahu's office said that Danon had stated a personal opinion, and his comments did not reflect government policy.

In a veiled reference to Danon, Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday ""the government must function as one unit"" in order to confront the many challenges facing the country.

Netanyahu linked the recent troubles along Israel's front with Syria to the Palestinian issue, telling his Cabinet that the planned withdrawal of Austrian peacekeepers from the Golan Heights shows that Israel cannot rely on others to protect its security. Austria announced the pullout from a U.N. peacekeeping force along the Israeli-Syrian frontier after rebels briefly overran a border crossing.

The incident ""underscores the fact that Israel cannot depend on international forces for its security,"" Netanyahu said. ""they can be part of the arrangements. They cannot be the basic foundation of Israel's security.""

Netanyahu said he would raise this concern with Kerry. Netanyahu has previously rejected suggestions that international forces patrol areas that Israel relinquishes as part of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. The Palestinians have said they would accept international forces but would never allow the Israeli military to remain in their territory.

Kerry has been shuttling between the sides in recent months in hopes of finding a formula to restart negotiations. He is expected in the region this week on what would be his fifth visit since becoming Secretary of State early this year.

Netanyahu told the Cabinet that he will discuss the impasse with Kerry.

""Together we will try to advance a way to find an opening for negotiations with the Palestinians with the goal of reaching an agreement. This agreement will be based on a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state, and on solid security arrangements based on the Israeli military,"" he said.

Talks have been stalled since late 2008. The Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiations until Israel ends construction in territory it wants for a future state. Israel says that settlements, along with other core issues like security, should be resolved through talks and have frequently called for negotiations to resume immediately without preconditions.

Kerry has been searching for a formula that would curtail most settlement construction, provide security guarantees to Israel and economic incentives to the Palestinians. So far, there have been no signs of progress.

Israel's chief negotiator with the Palestinians, Tzipi Livni, said Sunday that she is working with the U.S to restart talks, despite those within the government that oppose it.

""It is true that within the Likud there are radical elements and within the government there are those that oppose an agreement,"" Livni told Israel Radio. ""The prime minister is the one who will have to decide whether he surrenders to radical elements or will promote his policy that he declared,"" she said.

Livni said Danon's comments ""look bad.""

The top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Danon's remarks reflect Israel's policy. ""I believe that a government that continues to tender settlements and rejects the two state solution will not go for peace,"" he said."

Obama is closing his first Mideast trip as president with a visit to Petra

Petra is Jordan%27s most popular tourist attraction

Obama spent the bulk of his time in Israel

PETRA, Jordan (AP) — Barack Obama is closing his first Mideast trip as president with a visit to Petra, Jordan's fabled ancient city.

An unexpected sandstorm that forced Obama to change some travel plans on Friday had led him to cautiously state that the tour of Petra would happen ""weather permitting.""

The weather cooperated on Saturday, allowing Marine One to touch down near Petra after an hour-long flight from Amman, Jordan's capital. Overcast skies in Amman threatened to upend Obama's travel plans but the weather improved during the flight across Jordan's rugged countryside.

Petra was carved into the rose-red stone by the Nabataeans more than 2,000 years ago. The ancient Arabs turned the city into a critical junction for the silk, spice and other trade routes that linked China, India and southern Arabia with Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome.

Petra is Jordan's most popular tourist attraction, drawing more than a half million visitors each year since 2007.

Obama's 24-hour visit to Jordan — he arrived in the country on Friday — is his final stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East, the first foreign excursion of his second term. It also was his first visit as president to Israel and Jordan.

Obama spent the bulk of his time in Israel, where held several meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought through a speech and other public remarks to reassure an anxious public that he is committed to the country's security.

He also made a brief stop in the West Bank city of Ramallah for meetings with Palestinian leaders.

In Amman, Obama met with King Abdullah II."

USA TODAY

Note: An earlier version of this post had a mistaken headline.

Things aren't exactly warming up between the Obama administration and Vladimir Putin, even as President Obama arrived in St. Petersburg for the G-20 summit.

Putin called Obama Secretary of State John Kerry a liar over Kerry's testimony this week before Congress.

The question may be al-Qaeda's influence on the Syrian rebels, an issue Kerry has downplayed.

Speaking to his human rights council Wednesday, Putin said, ""This was very unpleasant and surprising for me. We talk to them (the Americans), and we assume they are decent people, but he is lying and he knows that he is lying. This is sad.""

Putin has criticized Obama administration claims that Bashar Assad's government attacked the rebels with chemical weapons.

Last month, Obama canceled a summit meeting with Putin after a series of U.S.-Russian disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

As for the new flap over Kerry's testimony, the Associated Press reported:

""It was unclear exactly what Putin was referencing, but Kerry was asked Tuesday while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee if the Syrian opposition had become more infiltrated by al-Qaeda.

""Kerry responded that that was 'basically incorrect' and that the opposition has 'increasingly become more defined by its moderation.' ...

""In testimony Wednesday, Kerry said he didn't agree that 'a majority (of the opposition) are al-Qaeda and the bad guys.' Extremists amount to 15 to 25% of the opposition, he said, including al-Nusra and many other groups that are 'fighting each other, even now.'""

Asked about Putin's comments, National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes said, ""Well, we certainly would side with Secretary Kerry in that back-and-forth.""

State Dept. spokeswoman Jen Psaki called Putin's comment ""preposterous"" and said Kerry is a decorated combat veteran who has had more than words aimed at him, according to the Associated Press."

Obama’s remarks came after Secretary of State John Kerry laid out the most detailed U.S. case yet that Bashar Assad’s regime massacred more than 1,400 people last week with chemical weapons.

“We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act,” the president said as he hosted Baltic leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House.

“I have not made any decisions” about Washington’s precise response, he said, but “we’re not considering any open-ended commitment” or sending troops into Syria.

Obama said in a CNN interview last week that ordering military action without a United Nations mandate would raise questions about whether such an operation were legal.

And a growing chorus of lawmakers is saying that the president needs to get explicit congressional authorization before going to war.

The president addressed both issues and left absolutely no doubt that he does not believe he needs either body’s green light.

“We are confident that we can provide Congress all the information they can get, all the input that they need,” he said. “And we can have serious conversations with our allies and our friends around the world about this.”

“But, ultimately, we don’t want the world to be paralyzed,” he said. “A lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it.""

Russia, backed by China, has blocked every U.S attempt to get the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution that might set the stage for intervention in Syria.

The president acknowledged that he and other Americans are “war-weary” and diagnosed “a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq.”

But “it’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal,” he said. “That is a danger to our national security.”

And, Obama said, “The American people understandably want us to be focused on the business of rebuilding our economy here and putting people back to work — and I assure you nobody ends up being more war-weary than me.”

But he stressed that “this kind of attack threatens our national security interests by violating well-established international norms against the use of chemical weapons by further threatening friends and allies of ours in the region, like Israel and Turkey and Jordan, and it increases the risk that chemical weapons will be used in the future and fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us.”"

(CNN) —

The battering that the U.S. image is taking in Egypt these days reflects that the sources of anger against America in the Middle East run deep. We’re not the primary reason the Middle East is so screwed up. The Arabs themselves need to own up to that. Just take a look at Syria and Egypt.

But we are still a big part of the story. Some extremist Muslims hammer us because they don’t like Western values; others see the conspiratorial hand of America everywhere – sucking the life out of Arab and Muslim independence, pride and dignity.

But once you get away from the fringes, what you find is equally disturbing: Millions of Arabs and Muslims don’t like us not because of who we are but because of what we do. It’s our policies.

And since those are unlikely to change anytime soon, there’s a pretty good chance America will continue to lose the public image battle in the Middle East. And here’s why:

Minds and hearts: We’ve always had it backwards. It’s not hearts then minds at all. If you want to capture the imagination of people living in the Middle East and get them to warm to America, you don’t play to their emotions first. It’s as if a new pretty bow on a package with the same contents as ever is somehow going to help sell U.S. policy. It won’t.

First, capture people’s minds, appeal to their cognitive self-interest and then their hearts will follow. That would require a significant readjustment of U.S. policy: The U.S. would have to be much tougher on Israel on settlements and practices such as land confiscation, closures and withholding tax revenues in the West Bank.

The U.S. would have to be much fairer when it came to Palestinian issues, including supporting reasonable resolutions at the United Nations and taking positions in negotiations that really did try to find an equitable balance, instead of viewing reality through a pro-Israeli filter. The U.S. would still have a special relationship with our close Israeli ally, just not an exclusive one.

The U.S. would have to be much clearer about standing up to human rights abuses in the Arab world and much tougher on the Arab kings where America is reluctant to offend its conservative allies. People know where and what their interests are. And if we want to improve our credibility, we’d need to find a fairer balance between theirs and ours on many issues.

Values vs. interests: It’s stunning testament to the American predicament in the Middle East that within two years of Hosni Mubarak’s overthrow – handled relatively well by the Obama administration – we are being attacked for backing both Mohamed Morsy and the generals and criticized by just about everyone, even the secular opposition.

You can pick your favorite culprit. The U.S. ambassador, Secretary of State John Kerry’s yachting outing, Barack Obama’s naivete about the Muslim Brotherhood or his softness toward the military.

But none of them is the reason. We lost our footing in Egypt because the tension between our values and interests results in unpopular and inconsistent policies.

We back the democratically elected Morsy government, even though it behaves in an undemocratic manner; and when the military intervenes and cracks down, shooting 50 people, we react mildly.

To a great extent, these inconsistencies are a result of the chaos of Egyptian politics, but they also are related to our nation’s wariness of change. When stability in the region has been the guiding principle for half a century or more, it’s never easy to adjust, especially for the big power. Just look at Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.

But more than that, if Egyptians are confused, can’t get their own house in order and don’t produce big leaders or credible democratic institutions on which the U.S. can find a focal point for its policy, we’re going to continue to stumble and bumble around.

We backed Morsy because we believe in the almighty ballot box. And we backed the generals because we have other interests – the Eyptian-Israeli peace treaty, security for the Suez Canal, counterterrorism, containing Iran – that commend supporting the military, too. That we couldn’t reconcile the two in response to Egyptian realities should come as no great surprise. Nor should the reality that we earn the disfavor of so many frustrated Egyptians.

Great power hypocrisy: Great powers are big and strong enough that they can afford to behave inconsistently and hypocritically. And they do. It’s as if it were part of their job description.

But that inconsistency can confuse and disappoint. Our policies toward the Arab Spring are laced with contradictions. We support real political change in Egypt, but we won’t push it hard in Saudi Arabia or in Bahrain where oil, stability and U.S. bases reign supreme.

We’ll intervene militarily in Libya because it’s easier – but not in Syria, where the strength of al-Assad’s allies, military and a chemical weapons capacity make it much riskier.

And in the greatest paradox of all, our ties with the monarchies – Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco – are much closer than with the emerging and struggling democracies at a time when the Middle East yearns for democracy and freedom. It is indeed remarkable that the Arab kings have become our new anchors in a turbulent sea of political change.

Kerry has discovered Jordan as a key ally in this peace process policy. Earlier this year, the U.S. completed a huge arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worth billions.

Expectations for America run high in the world; and too often we help raise them, particularly in the Middle East. Obama came into office promising a new look in this region: more engagement, a greater sensitivity toward Islam and a pro-active policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.

And it’s a cruel irony that this putative transformer ended up tougher than his predecessor on drones and Iran and as cautious on Israeli-Palestinian peace.

But governing is about choosing. And Obama chose willfully and wisely not to chase windmills abroad but to concentrate on trying to fix America’s broken house.

Coming off the two longest wars in American history, where the standard for victory was not whether we would win, but when we could leave, who could blame him. For Obama the middle class was always going to be more important than the Middle East. And for better or worse, America’s standing in that region shows it.

Obama is considering how to respond to Syrian chemical attack

Official: Obama could be presented with options within days

A U.S. strike ""can't just be one and done,"" a Middle East analyst says

Few question that there was a major chemical attack in Syria last week, and the United States has made clear that it blames the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

Now, the question is how President Barack Obama will respond.

For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces.

However, last week's attack on a Damascus suburb that reportedly killed and wounded more than 3,000 people obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama was evaluating ""a response to the clear use on a mass scale with repugnant results of chemical weapons,"" adding that ""there is very little doubt that the Syrian regime ... used those weapons.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack ""inexcusable"" and ""undeniable,"" and said there was ""a clear reason that the world has banned entirely chemical weapons.""

He said that evidence ""strongly indicates"" chemical weapons were used in Syria and that ""we know the Syrian regime maintains custody"" of such weapons and has the rockets to use them.

Obama ""will be making an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use"" of chemical weapons, Kerry added, saying the president ""believes there must be accountability"" for those who use them.

Options available to Obama range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a ""do-nothing"" approach.

Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. Assuming the president decides to go ahead with a military response, any action could come as early as mid-week, though it could be later, the official cautioned.

Factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for Russia next week and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to Egypt because of the ongoing political turmoil there, the official explained. The administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons, the senior administration official said.

American officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any U.S. action, which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons. And three representatives of allied governments involved in those top-level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible.

""No one is talking about a long process,"" one European diplomat told CNN.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said any U.S. response would be ""a determination on how to respond to a blatant use of chemical weapons, and it's not necessarily to change the entire situation on the ground in Syria.""

That might be a mistake, said Michael Doran, an analyst at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy. A U.S. strike ""can't just be one and done,"" but should be part of a plan to remove al-Assad, he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

""The president has been very reulctant to get involved. Public opinion has been against it. There's not a lot of support on the Hill,"" Doran said. ""And yet, here we are again. Time and time again, we get dragged further and further in."" The result could be ""a Vietnam-type problem, where we kind of back our way into this, if we don't come up with a plan about how to win.""

Kerry spoke with his British, Jordanian, Qatari and Saudi counterparts Monday and with the secretary-general of the Arab League, Harf said.

""Obviously, the intelligence assessment is ongoing,"" she said. ""But he reiterated that the president is studying the facts and will be making an informed decision about how to respond going forward.""

The Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack, another senior administration official said. The declassification would happen before any U.S. military action would take place.

A senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the evidence ""includes but is not limited to"" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots.

Earlier Monday, a White House official ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime. The official insisted that all other options were under consideration by Obama but put no time frame on a decision.

Meanwhile, a senior Defense Department official told CNN's Chris Lawrence Monday that four U.S. Navy destroyers ""maintain readiness and, if required, could execute a mission within hours"" of being ordered to do so.

But the official added that the U.S. military remained ""in a holding pattern"" as Obama considers both military and nonmilitary options.

Also, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said while visiting Indonesia that any U.S. action ""will be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification.""

While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished, certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly China undermined the possibility that the Security Council would support a military mission.

Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners such as Germany, France and Britain -- all of which have called for action against Syria -- and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide the political backing needed by Obama to order U.S. missile strikes.

A senior administration official told CNN on Monday that the goals of any coalition military action would be to punish al-Assad and show him that there was a cost for using chemical weapons while preventing him from doing so again.

In addition, a military strike would seek to degrade the Syrian regime's capabilities enough to weaken it without causing it to fall to an opposition considered unprepared to assume power, the official said.

Possible coalition partners include NATO allies Britain, France, Germany and Canada, as well as regional powers Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts.

Dempsey's letter, dated July 19, listed U.S. assets in the region including Patriot missile defense batteries in Turkey and Jordan, as well as F-16 jet fighters positioned to defend Jordan from possible cross-border trouble. In addition, the Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region.

According to U.S. officials, updated options offered the president in recent days included:

• Cruise missiles fired from one of four Navy destroyers deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. The missiles would be used to strike ""command and control"" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers. There is no indication that the missiles would strike at actual chemical weapons stockpiles.

• Military jets firings weapons from outside Syrian airspace. This option carries additional risks and is considered less likely.

""They have to be careful to do this in concert with our allies,"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Sunday, adding that ""I don't think the White House is going to want to risk American lives by sending pilots over Syria, so that really limits our options to cruise strikes and think that's probably where the White House is going to go.""

Cruise missile strikes could be ""very punishing"" on al-Assad's missile supplies and aircraft without going after the chemical weapons stockpiles to risk dispersing them, Schiff said.

To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an ""avoider-in-chief"" regarding military involvement in Syria.

""It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action,"" Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday.

He said he expected a significant response that amounts to ""a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce, not one that turns pink.""

""It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere,"" Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time. ""The president's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country.""

Schiff agreed that Obama has little choice but to respond strongly.

""In terms of the credibility of the White House,"" he said, ""the cost of not acting now, I think, exceeds the cost of acting."""

USA TODAY

Thamsanqa Jantjie says he suffered schizophrenic episode

South Africa is investigating the allegations

Jantjie was paid %2485 to interpret at the ceremony

JOHANNESBURG — The South African sign language interpreter accused of using fake signs at Nelson Mandela's memorial service this week said he suffered a schizophrenic episode at the event, but another interpreter says it was not the first time Thamsanqa Jantjie has done bogus interpretations.

Jantjie, who has been called an imposter by sign experts, told Johannesburg's Star newspaper Thursday that he hallucinated and heard voices during the memorial service.

""There was nothing I could do. I was alone in a very dangerous situation,"" Jantjie said. ""I tried to control myself and not show the world what was going on. I am very sorry, it's the situation I found myself in.""

An interpreter with the Deaf Federation of South Africa says Mandela's service wasn't the first time Jantjie was criticized for his work interpreting at an event. Francois Deysel, a sign language interpreter with DFSA, said he watched a video of Jantjie signing at the 100th anniversary celebration of the African National Conference, South Africa's ruling party, in January 2012.

After watching the video, Deysel and his colleagues concluded, ""There was no sign language used. It was only slapping of hands and movement of arms.""

Deysel said the federation notified the ANC and recommended that Jantjie needed to get basic sign language training.

When Deysel saw that it was Jantjie interpreting at the Mandela memorial, ""my reaction was embarrassment for this country that we're going to go through by having this person on stage,"" he said.

The ANC says on its website that the government — not the ANC — hired Jantjie for the Mandela memorial. It said it ""had not been aware of any of (the) complaints regarding the quality of services, qualification or reported illnesses of Mr. Jantjie.""

In South Africa, sign language interpreters are not legally required to get certified, said Marion Boers, executive director of the South African Translators' Institute, the only organization in South Africa with a formal sign language certification program. In the entire country, only seven or eight interpreters are certified through SATI, and Jantjie is not one of them, Boers said.

The Mandela memorial incident prompted an apology Thursday by a South African Cabinet minister who said a mistake was made in hiring Jantjie. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu apologized to South Africa's deaf community during a news conference but denied that the country felt embarrassed by the controversy.

""I don't think he was just picked up on the street. He went to a school for the deaf,"" she said.

In a separate interview with the Associated Press, Jantjie said that while he was on stage at the FNB Stadium he saw visions of angels. He told the AP he has been violent and was hospitalized in a mental health facility for more than a year.

Jantjie stood approximately 3 feet from President Obama and other world leaders during Tuesday's ceremony to honor Mandela, and the state of Jantjie's mental health that day will raise serious security questions for South African authorities.

Jantjie told the Star newspaper he was paid R850, or about $85, to interpret at the ceremony.

""Life is unfair. This illness is unfair. Anyone who doesn't understand this illness will think that I'm just making this up,"" he said.

He said that as a result of the episode, his ability to hear and interpret was impaired, but he felt that given the gravity of the occasion, he couldn't leave.

On the day of the memorial service, Jantjie was due to get a regular six-month mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept at a mental health facility for treatment, the AP reported.

Sign language experts claim that Jantjie's interpretations for numerous dignitaries, heads of state and even members of the extended Mandela family amounted to ""gibberish.""

""He wasn't even doing anything, There was not one sign there. Nothing. He was literally flapping his arms around,"" Cara Loening, director of Sign Language Education and Development in Cape Town, told the Agence France-Presse news service.

Asked if he was happy with his performance by radio station Talk Radio 702 on Thursday, Jantjie said, ""Absolutely! What I have been doing, I think I have been a champion of sign language. I have interpreted many big events. Not only the event that's in question now.""

He said these events included political news conferences and the funeral of Albertina Sisulu, the widow of anti-apartheid activist and Robben Islander Walter Sisulu.

He refused to explain details of his qualifications and referred such questions to the company that booked him for the event, a company he called SA Interpreters. Not a lot is known about that company.

AP journalists who visited the address that Jantjie provided for SA Interpreters found a different company there where managers said they knew nothing about the firm.

Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said Thursday that government officials have tried to track down the company that contracted Jantjie for the memorial service but that the owners ""have vanished into thin air.""

See more of Robyn Curnow’s exclusive interview with former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush on CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” at 5 p.m. ET.

(CNN) —

Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, are in Africa this week, where they renovated a cancer screening clinic in Zambia and commemorated the victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania.

The clinic, which is designed help women fight cervical cancer, builds on the former president’s work fighting AIDS on the continent. While he was in office, Bush set up a plan that dramatically reduced the number of AIDS deaths in Africa.

“I’m really proud of the American people for their generosity,” he told CNN in an exclusive interview. “I wish Americans knew how many lives were saved. Someday, they will.”

Bush also told CNN why he respects Nelson Mandela, what he thinks about Edward Snowden and President Barack Obama, and how he’s not going to be around when his legacy is finally decided.

• On Snowden: “I think he damaged the security of the country.”

• On Mandela: “His legacy will last for a long time.”

• On Obama: “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda.”

Bush talked about Snowden, the computer contractor who leaked details about secret U.S. surveillance programs, to CNN’s Robyn Curnow in Zambia on Sunday.

He said he believes the Obama administration “will deal” with the fallout from the controversy unleashed by Snowden, who is now thought to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport after fleeing there from Hong Kong.

Snowden’s disclosures about the programs carried out by the National Security Agency have shaken the U.S. intelligence community and put the Obama administration on the defensive over accusations of government overreach into citizens’ privacy.

But Bush refrained from criticizing the current president.

“I don’t think it does any good,” he said. “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult. A former president doesn’t need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that’s mine.”

The White House has defended the surveillance programs as necessary tools to defuse terrorist threats. Obama has said he welcomes a debate over how to strike a balance between security and privacy.

“I think there needs to be a balance, and as the president explained, there is a proper balance,” Bush said.

Asked about an NSA program that tracks people’s Internet activity, Bush said, “I put that program in place to protect the country. One of the certainties was that civil liberties were guaranteed.”

I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. George W. Bush

Snowden has said he leaked information to journalists about the surveillance programs in the hope of ending what he called an excessively intrusive system.

The Bushes were at a renovated health clinic in Livingstone, Zambia, scheduled to open Monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center. They hope this will save the lives of thousands of women.

In his comments, George Bush touched on the subject of Mandela, who is on life support in a South African hospital.

“Sometimes, there are leaders who come and go. His legacy will last for a long time,” he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon.

Reminded by Curnow that Mandela had criticized him publicly about the war in Iraq, Bush said he didn’t bear a grudge.

“He wasn’t the only guy,” he said. “It’s OK. I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. I never held someone’s opinion against him; I didn’t look at him differently because he didn’t agree with me on an issue.”

Bush also initially said he wasn’t bothered about his ratings in opinion polls, even if some of them now put him at a similar level to Obama.

“The only time I really cared was on Election Day,” he said.

Then, drawing laughter from his wife, he checked himself and said, “You know, I guess it’s nice. I mean, let me rephrase that: Thank you for bringing it up.”

In any case, the former president said he doesn’t expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime.

“I won’t be around, because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up,” he said. “So I’m pretty comfortable with it, I did what I did; I know the spirit in which I did it.”

President', 'The American Jewish Congress', 'Israel Policy Forum', 'Co-Chair Of The Middle East Project Of The Council On Foreign Relations']","Israel, the Palestinians, and the Interim Nuclear Deal With Iran","No nation willingly takes action unless it believes that the action is in its own best interest. So, it is utter nonsense when we are told that Israel is reluctant to move forward on a deal with the Palestinians because it does not ""feel the love"" from America and the Obama administration in view of the secret American negotiations with Iran and the interim nuclear deal signed by Iran and the P5+1 powers. It is similarly baseless when we are told that the interim deal with Iran coupled with the effort to negotiate an end to the war in Syria demonstrate that Washington is preparing to turn its attention away from the region and somehow that provides a legitimate reason for Israel to back off its negotiations with the Palestinians.

The claim by those in Israel and in the American Jewish community that President Obama has ""thrown Israel under the bus"" in entering the interim deal with Iran just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. In narrowly framing the only deal that would be acceptable to Israel as one that would stop the Iranians from any kind of nuclear enrichment, Prime Minster Netanyahu has set the bar too high to be realistic. It is not credible that Iran would agree to such a deal, however strong the sanction regime. The result is that the only alternative to Netanyahu's deal would be a war with Iran, with all the uncertainties as to what would be accomplished and the possibilities of costly escalation. The Obama administration, fully reflecting the view of the American people, does not want a war unless every other possibility for a peaceful resolution has been explored and has failed.

What Israel, Saudi Arabia and those other nations opposed to the Iranian deal can contribute of great value is in depth intelligence, in carefully monitoring the actions of the Iranians to insure that they are indeed carrying out the terms of the deal and when the interim period has ended, determining whether Iran is closer to a nuclear capability than it was before. In addition, those nations in opposition can help the United States maintain the full force of the sanctions that have not been lifted under the terms of the agreement and apply pressure on nations and businesses not to allow sanctions to weaken during the interim period so that they can be fully reinstated if they have to be. As for the impact of the Iranian deal on Israel's relationship with the Palestinians -- long before the secret negotiations with Iran had begun, in these pages and elsewhere I, like others, questioned whether Prime Minister Netanyahu truly sought a two state solution with the Palestinians. We pointed to his personal history as well as the effect any deal would have in destroying his political coalition. And we also noted that the Palestinian issue was not in the forefront of concerns of the Israeli people, although a strong commitment from their leaders could probably convince them to accept a two state deal.

Now, that the period for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians set by Secretary Kerry is one third completed, it does not appear that the parties have made significant enough progress to lead to the belief that a deal ultimately can be reached. This has nothing to do with America's diplomatic efforts regarding Iran. In fact, the why of the failing negotiations does not really matter. What does matter is that they are failing and there is little hope for a negotiated resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The question now is what can replace that approach.

There are some in the United States and the region who would now call on the Obama Administration to offer bridging solutions to the parties. These proposals range from the President providing suggestions to resolve specific issues to his presenting a defined plan covering all the points and pressuring the parties to accept the plan as presented. In light of the political position that the President finds himself -- a difficult opposition looking for any reason to attack him and a declining popularity -- it would be surprising if he used what little leverage he has to provide any forcible action in this arena.

Another approach being suggested by some in Israel calls for a ""framework agreement"" that would outline some of the key elements of a final status agreement such as the percent of West Bank areas allocated to each party but not resolve all the claims. It is suggested that this approach be coupled with financial programs that help move the Palestinian closer toward a viable state. However, it is hard to believe that this approach will be acceptable to the Palestinians, even though it is offered coated with financial incentives. The Palestinian leaders will most likely see it as a further delay of their ambition for statehood, allowing Israel time to expand its settlement program, notwithstanding any commitment to the contrary in the agreement.

The other possibility is some form of unilateral withdrawal by Israel even without a mutual agreement. This solution would appeal to those like Israeli author Ari Shavit who argue that Israel should separate itself from the Palestinians for its own benefit but that it should not expect a ""peace"" between them ever to work effectively. For my own part, as a Zionist who has long advocated that Israel avoid a bi-national state or absorbing any large part of the Palestinian population to ensure that it maintains its position as a democratic and Jewish state (see my HuffPost blog A Message From A Long Standing Zionist To The Israeli People, 08/08/2013), I would personally support unilateral withdrawal if a two state solution was impossible to achieve. However, at this time, such a unilateral approach has no significant support in Israel and after the perception of the result of unilateral withdrawal in Gaza and Lebanon, notwithstanding the reality of the benefit of those actions, unilateral action is highly unlikely.

Unhappily, the failure of the effort by Secretary Kerry to bring the parties together will leave a vacuum and no one can predict what will fill it. We are already seeing the beginnings of violence on both sides and one can only hope that it does not erupt in a significant way as it has in the past. Most likely we will see a continued drift along current lines where Israel expands settlements and the Palestinians turn to the UN and International pressure on Israel in the form of boycotts and divestiture. One has to wonder whether this will cause more real damage to Israel than Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear capability. At least, in the latter situation Israel has the overwhelming nuclear capability to face Iran down and also has the United States umbrella of support. What will it have to protect it if somehow it is seen as engaging in apartheid actions? I hope that day never comes; but the expansionist course now being followed by Israel has that danger attached to it.

He Can Be Reached At Adam.Shaw Foxnews.Com.']",Pope Francis is the Catholic Church’s Obama – God help us,"Pope Francis is undergoing a popularity surge comparable to the way Barack Obama was greeted by the world in 2008. And just as President Obama has been a disappointment for America, Pope Francis will prove a disaster for the Catholic Church.

My fellow Catholics should be suspicious when bastions of anti-Catholicism in the left-wing media are in love with him.

Much is being made of his ‘compassion’ and ‘humility,’ but kissing babies and hugging the sick is nothing new. Every pope in recent memory has done the same, yet only now are the media paying attention. Benedict XVI and John Paul II refused to kowtow to the liberal agenda, and so such displays of tenderness were under-covered.

[pullquote]

But Francis is beating a retreat for the Catholic Church, and making sure its controversial doctrines are whispered, not yelled – no wonder the New York Times is in love.

More On This... Pope Francis’ unexpected Hanukkah gift

Just like President Obama loved apologizing for America, Pope Francis likes to apologize for the Catholic Church, thinking that the Church is at its best when it is passive and not offending anyone’s sensibilities.

In his interviews with those in the left-wing media he seeks to impress, Francis has said that the Church needs to stop being ‘obsessed’ with abortion and gay marriage, and instead of seeking to convert people, “we need to get to know each other, listen to each other and improve our knowledge of the world around us.”

This softly-softly approach of not making a fuss has been tried before, and failed. The Second Vatican Council of the 1960’s aimed to “open the windows” of the Church to the modern world by doing just this.

The result was the Catholic version of New Coke. Across the West where the effects were felt, seminaries and convents emptied, church attendance plummeted, and adherence to Church doctrine diminished.

John Paul II and Benedict XVI worked hard to turn this trend around, but now Pope Francis wants the bad old days to resume.

Proof of this is Francis’ aforementioned statement of the Church being obsessed with controversial issues and the need to rebalance by talking about it less.

That Francis didn’t see that this would be translated into headlines of “Pope tells Catholics to shut up about things that offend Sandra Fluke” by every left-wing media outlet shows a terrifying naivety.

Nor do his comments reflect reality.

For years, the majority of priests didn't dare cover controversial topics in their homilies in fear of getting angry letters from pick-and-choose Catholics outraged that their pastor dared to say something out of line with the Democratic Party.

Most parishioners therefore haven’t heard the Church’s argument on controversial topics. Consequently, usage of contraception is only slightly lower in Catholics than in the general population, and support of gay marriage is actually higher in Catholics than the general population. Perhaps talking about it even less isn’t the answer?

In trying to please the media and the modern world, Francis mistakes their glee for respect. Just like Obama thought he’d won over Putin by promising a reset, Francis thinks by talking vacuously about the poor, he will be respected. And it is vacuous -- the pontiff recently asked why it’s news that the stock market drops but not when an old person dies. When your leader is asking, “Why isn’t the newspaper a laundry list of obituaries?” you know you elected the wrong guy.

What effect is this having? For all we’re being told about how ‘disenfranchised’ Catholics are being brought back by Francis ‘reaching out,’ a recent Pew Research study showed that in America, the number of people who identify as Catholic has actually decreased. Lesson: rubbing the egos of Church-hating left-wingers doesn’t make more Catholics, it just makes the Church less respected.

Francis not only panders to enemies and professional grievance mongers, but also attacks his allies. Just as Obama snubs Britain and Israel, Pope Francis swipes at practicing Catholics.

So not only has he insulted, and severely damaged the work of, pro-life and pro-marriage groups with his comments, he has also gone on the attack, dismissing Catholics who attend the older rites in Latin as ‘ideologizing’ and being guilty of ‘exploitation.’ Apparently “Who am I to judge?” doesn’t apply here.

On world matters, Francis’ statements are embarrassing. About communism, a destructive ideology that slaughtered millions of Catholics, he said:

“Learning about it through a courageous and honest person was helpful. I realized…an aspect of the social, which I then found in the social doctrine of the Church.""

Not such kind words for the free market, however. In his recent apostolic exhortation he slammed unfettered capitalism, calling it ‘a new tyranny.’

Apart from the fact that there is no major nation practicing unfettered capitalism (like Obama, Francis loves attacking straw men) there is more real tyranny in socialist cesspools like Francis’ home of Argentina than in places where capitalism is predominant.

In the document he rejects the free market and calls for governments to overhaul financial systems so they attack inequality. In doing so he shows himself painfully misguided on economics, failing to see that free markets have consistently lifted the poor out of poverty, while socialism merely entrenches them in it, or kills them outright.

Like Obama, Francis is unable to see the problems that are really endangering his people. Like Obama he mistakes the faithful for the enemy, the enemy for his friend, condescension for respect, socialism for justice and capitalism for tyranny.

As a Catholic, I do hope Francis’ papacy is a successful one, but from his first months he seems hell-bent on a path to undo the great work of Benedict XVI and John Paul II, and to repeat critical mistakes of the past.

http://news.yahoo.com/karzai-accuses-u-cutting-afghan-military-supplies-security-181450071.html,,[],Karzai accuses U.S. of cutting Afghan military supplies,"By Hamid Shalizi KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai accused his U.S. ally on Sunday of withholding military supplies to press him to sign a bilateral security deal that will shape the U.S. military presence after most foreign troops leave in 2014. Washington, which swiftly denied the assertion, has said that unless the pact is signed promptly, it could pull out most of its troops, as it did in Iraq two years ago. ""The cutting of fuel supplies and support services to the Afghan army and police is being used as a means of pressure to ensure Afghanistan ... signs the Bilateral Security Agreement,"" a statement from Karzai's palace said. Karzai said last week he might refuse to sign the deal until after Afghanistan's presidential election in April 2014. U.S. officials said logistical problems in Pakistan might have given rise to the alleged delays in deliveries. ""There has been no stoppage in the delivery of requested fuel and we continue to process all orders as soon as they are received,"" the NATO-led force in Afghanistan said in a statement. Karzai's relationship with the United States has worsened since he invited thousands of elders to vote on the security deal last week and then ignored their advice, which was to sign it promptly. Even after the pact's terms were settled after about a year of wrangling, Karzai has since added conditions that include the release of all Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and an end to military operations involving Afghan homes. On Thursday Karzai denounced his Western allies for bombing an Afghan home and killing a child, an accusation the NATO-led force has promised to investigate. If the bilateral pact is not signed, Western aid running to billions of dollars will be in jeopardy and confidence in the fragile economy could collapse amid fears that Afghanistan will slip back into ethnic fighting or civil war. Diplomats said Karzai may have overplayed his hand, raising the risk of a complete U.S. withdrawal from a country where Western troops have fought Taliban militants for the past 12 years. Karzai's domestic critics say he is playing a dangerous game with Afghanistan's future security. The decade-long security deal would mandate the size and shape of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan once the NATO combat mission ends next year. Without it, the United States would be unable to keep troops in Afghanistan, and most other nations would be likely to withdraw theirs too. Afghanistan faces a potent Taliban insurgency and is still training its own military. (Writing by Jessica Donati and Dylan Welch; Editing by Alistair Lyon)"

http://news.yahoo.com/secret-must-rely-locals-abroad-080315565--politics.html,,[],Secret Service must rely on locals abroad,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the hours before President Barack Obama arrived at a Johannesburg soccer stadium to honor Nelson Mandela, the White House staff was in the dark on key details. Where would the president and Michelle Obama sit? When was Obama supposed to speak? Who else would be on stage when he did?

The result was an array of confusion and security risks that typically would not be tolerated by the Secret Service in the United States, underscoring how the agency is often at the mercy of foreign governments to make arrangements when the president travels overseas.

While there were metal detectors and x-ray machines at the stadium, they were not used on the initial crowds streaming in for the ceremony, according to Associated Press reporters on scene. Many people walked through with little or no screening. Inside the massive stadium there were few signs of the heavy security that routinely would accompany an event with the president and other world leaders.

The VIP section where Obama and dozens of other dignitaries sat, including former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, was protected by a short pane of protective glass that covered only those sitting in the first row of seats. Obama and his wife were seated several rows back. Large crowds were allowed to gather in front of where Obama sat, with no visible security nearby.

And when Obama made his way to the stage to deliver his speech, the South African sign-language interpreter who stood an arm's length away was a schizophrenic prone to violence. The interpreter has since been derided as a fraud and allegedly has a criminal background.

Secret Service officials say the South African government was responsible for the decision to place interpreter Thamsanqa Jantjie just inches from some of the most powerful people in the world during a four-hour memorial service.

""Program items such as stage participants or sign-language interpreters were the responsibility of the host organizing committee,"" said Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. ""For the purposes of this memorial service, this would include vetting them for criminal history and other appropriate records checks.""

Story continues

Brian Dube, a spokesman for the Ministry of State Security, declined to answer questions Saturday about what security measures were in place at the soccer stadium and what sort of background checks and screening were performed on Jantjie. Dube said those issues are part of the investigation into the hiring and use of the bogus interpreter, and he did not know when the investigation would be concluded.

Dube spoke a day after South Africa's government was confronted with a new, chilling allegation about Jantjie: He was reportedly accused of murder 10 years ago. Officials said they were investigating the revelation by the national eNCA TV news station. But they were unable, or unwilling, to explain why a man who says he is schizophrenic with violent tendencies and says he started to hallucinate during Tuesday's memorial service was allowed to get within arm's length of Obama and other world leaders.

Donovan said prearranged security procedures were in place Tuesday and agents were ""in close proximity,"" a standard security practice wherever the president is. He declined to discuss specific security details of Obama's trip to South Africa.

The Secret Service is charged with keeping the president, vice president and their families safe. And presidential trips, whether across the country or around the world, are meticulously planned with every imaginable detail within the agency's control managed and scheduled.

But once the president leaves the United States, the Secret Service isn't always entirely in control.

Joe Hagin, a former deputy White House Chief of Staff for former President George W. Bush, said that to some degree the Secret Service is at the mercy of a host government.

""There's a lot of diplomacy involved in one of these trips,"" said Hagin, now a partner at Command Consulting Group in Washington. ""The White House is very demanding. But there's a fine line in what you can demand and what you can't.""

Hagin said some security issues are simply nonnegotiable, including allowing the president to ride in any vehicle that hasn't been flown in by the Secret Service. The Secret Service also won't allow the president to leave his security detail.

""You manage the risks; you can never fully mitigate them,"" Hagin said.

It was apparent from Obama's arrival in South Africa that security was not up to Secret Service standards. Roadways are typically shut down for the president's motorcade. But the highway between the military base where Air Force One landed and the suburban Johannesburg hotel where he spent time before the memorial service was filled with morning rush hour traffic, forcing the motorcade at times to slow to a crawl.

If Secret Service officials aren't satisfied with security protocols for a foreign trip, the agency can and has advised against going, said Joseph LaSorsa, a retired Secret Service agent.

Hagin said that was the case when then President Ronald Reagan wanted to travel to Egypt for the funeral of Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated in Cairo in 1981.

""Reagan wanted to go and the Secret Service said no,"" said Hagin, who also worked in the White House under Reagan.

When Pope John Paul II died in Rome in 2005, Hagin said, the decision to have Bush travel to the Vatican was ""an easy one.""

LaSorsa, who is now a security consultant, said if anyone is to blame for allowing Jantjie on the dais Tuesday, it is the South African government staff member who selected him.

""I don't really see this as a Secret Service issue. It just highlights the risk of international travel,"" Hagin said.

USA TODAY

They're at it again at Spirit Airlines, where the discount airline's marketing staff has rolled out its latest in a growing list of off-color ads pegged toward unseemly current events.

Spirit's newest target is Toronto's mayor, who recently reversed months of denials and admitted that he smoked crack. Even since that admission, Mayor Rob Ford has remained in the news by offering what seems like an endless offering of tactless public statements. And on Friday he was stripped of key executive powers by the Toronto City Council.

The episode has been an embarrassment for Toronto, Canada's largest – and usually low-drama – city. But while Ford's behavior may be unwanted publicity for locals, Spirit sees an opportunity to sell airline tickets.

""We're not smoking crack...our fares REALLY are this low!"" Spirit crows in an advertisement for flights to New York's Niagara Falls International, a little-used airport 90 miles from Toronto that the ultra low-cost carrier bills as an alternative to the Canadian metropolis.

The ad shows the shadowy image of a man whose silhouette could pass for Ford's. The man depicted in the ad then exhales a puff of smoke, though the carrier stops short of showing an actual pipe.

Spirit's Ford-themed ad is just the latest in a long line of edgy ads that play off current events. Previous targets have ranged from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and a perceived debate gaffe to Anthony Weiner, who eventually admitted to texting lewd photos of himself to women other than his wife.

Not even airline rivals have been safe. Spirit mocked American Airlines by having a ""7.57% off"" sale when American had problems with seats coming loose on its Boeing 757 jets.

The latest ad targeting Toronto may be of questionable taste. But it could help Spirit raise its awareness in the populous southern Ontario region that abuts Toronto.

Spirit's ads already have drawn attention in Canada's largest media market, including a mention in some of the nation's most-read newspapers. Since Spirit doesn't actually fly to Toronto -- or even Canada -- any attention is likely helpful in getting the carrier to have customers consider Niagara Falls as an alternative for Toronto's Pearson and Billy Bishop airports.

In a trend that's developed during the past few years, a large number of Canadians living near the U.S. border have opted to make the drive to U.S. airports, where fares often are markedly lower than from those in Canada.



But even in its own home market of western New York, the Niagara Falls airport is a distant second to much-busier Buffalo Niagara International -- which itself counts on Canadians for more than a third of its passenger traffic.

The Niagara Falls airport has regular service on just two airlines: Spirit and leisure-oriented Allegiant."

“We had anticipated that at the outset, there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground,” Obama said at a news conference here with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Karzai’s office earlier in the day had abruptly canceled ongoing security negotiations with U.S. officials aimed at defining the U.S.-Afghan relationship after American-led foreign forces leave Afghanistan, a move scheduled for the end of next year.

His decision came a day after the Obama administration had announced that representatives of the United States and the Taliban would hold talks in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. U.S. officials said the talks were set to begin Thursday.

In a terse statement, the Afghan president’s office said the government would stop participating in the security talks given a “contradiction” between U.S. words and deeds on the peace process.

In a later statement, it added that Afghan officials wouldn’t attend the separate negotiations with the Taliban until they were “fully Afghanized,” and that the opening of a Taliban political office Monday in Doha, the Qatari capital, undermined earlier assurances made by the United States.

The statement didn’t say what those assurances were or how long the suspension would last.

Obama said misunderstandings aren’t surprising given the enormous mistrust between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but that it was still important to explore opportunities for a political reconciliation.

“Not only have the Taliban and the Afghan government been fighting for a long time, they’re fighting as we speak,” he said. “We’re in the middle of a war. And Afghans are still being killed and, by the way, members of the international forces there are still being killed. And that’s not abating as we speak.”

Obama said that as elusive as reconciliation with the Taliban may seem, it’s worth pursuing.

“I think that President Karzai himself recognizes the need for political reconciliation,” he told reporters, adding that it remains to be seen whether the process bears fruit. “That’s a question that only the Afghans can answer.”

“[That was] a really good speech by President Obama, but what Mexico was he talking about?” said Jose Carlos Cruz, 24, a graduate student in international relations. “Unfortunately in our country, the situation is terrible: There’s poverty, unemployment, and even worse, the future is anything but promising.

Advertisement

“How nice that he came to give inspiring speeches, but what’s happening in Mexico is far from what he talked about today,” Cruz said.

Alberto Rios Lara, 26, who is studying to be an economist, said: “Obama is a great speaker — it’s really impossible not to feel excited. However, the reality is different in Mexico. We need more action and fewer speeches.”

In the speech, delivered at National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Obama described Mexico as a nation that is “creating new prosperity,” has “lifted millions from poverty” and has institutions that are “more accountable to you.”

Many of his rosy assertions about Mexico weren’t incorrect. The media — in Mexico City, at least — are indeed feistier than in decades previous, when they were often subservient to government interests. Political parties do, in fact, “compete vigorously” and “transfer power peacefully.” And the country has emerged, as Obama noted, as an important manufacturer of automobiles, appliances and other goods, helping many Mexicans enjoy new middle-class lifestyles.

Advertisement

But the story is considerably more complicated. This week, the nonprofit Freedom House, in its annual report on the state of journalism globally, lumped Mexico in the category of nations where the press is “not free,” due to persistent threats and violence directed against reporters and news organizations.

Last year’s election of President Enrique Peña Nieto was marred by allegations of vote-buying by his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. And the World Bank notes that 46% of Mexicans continue to live in poverty.

In the tightly crafted, upbeat speech, which made references to the late Mexican writer Octavio Paz and 19th century Mexican hero Benito Juarez, Obama largely steered clear of the negative, making only a passing reference to the pervasive and often gruesome violence that continues to plague much of the country. Many of the attendees were high-school students, whom Obama described as “part of something new — a nation remaking itself.”

Rosa Castro, a 43-year-old college professor, said that the upbeat tone sounded curiously similar to the messaging of the new government, which has been seeking to downplay the issue of violence and drug cartels in favor of a narrative of modernization, reform and economic growth.

Advertisement

“My question is: Who wrote Obama’s speech — Enrique Peña Nieto’s team?” Castro asked. “Obama is fantastic, but I believe that today, he was talking about another country, not ours.”

Others were moved by Obama’s vision of a Mexico leaving behind its old ways and heading toward a brighter future. There was also a palpable sense of fascination with, and admiration for, the man himself: Obama, according to one recent poll, enjoys a 54% approval rating among Mexicans.

“It was incredible to see Obama; he really impressed me,” said student Maria Velazco, 18. “His way of speaking, of walking, of smiling. ... And I think that, like he said, a change is possible. A new Mexico is possible.”

Editor’s Note: Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, whom The Washington Post calls “the most famous rabbi in America,” is the author of the soon-to-be-published “Kosher Lust: Love is Not the Answer.” Follow him on Twitter @rabbiShmuley and on Facebook.

(CNN) —

Twenty-five years ago, nearly to the day, I arrived at Oxford University with my wife of six months to become the first rabbi in residence in decades. I had just turned 22. My mandate was simple: Deepen Jewish identity among the Jewish students and cultivate values-based leadership among the students at large.

What I never expected to be my mission, but what eventually became central to everything I did, was defending Israel against ferocious and unjust assault.

I quickly discovered that universities in general, and elite universities in particular, are breeding grounds for anti-Israel bias. We beat back many attempts over 11 years to slander Israel as an expansionist, neo-colonialist power and succeeded in portraying the true nature of the Middle East’s only democracy. We hosted six Israeli prime ministers and countless other eloquent defenders of the Jewish state.

But since I returned to the United States, the situation among academics has only become worse.

Shmuley Boteach

Just after Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters compared Israel to Nazi Germany, we have the American Studies Association, comprising about 5,000 academics, voting to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The group is refusing all collaborations with universities, although not individual scholars.

The reason, members say, is Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians and the occupation.

Opposing view: Boycott a sting to Israeli apartheid

The ASA has not boycotted any other country in a similar way. Not, say, China, which regularly jails political dissidents for lengthy sentences and commits them to near-slave labor without any judicial process. Liu Xiaobo, who won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is serving an 11-year sentence on fraudulent subversion charges. His wife, Liu Xia, has been held incommunicado under house arrest for three years even though she has never been charged.

So why would Israel, a thriving liberal democracy that guarantees the right of due process to all of its citizens, including minorities, be singled out?

If you argue that the reason is Israel’s “occupation” of Arab lands, the American Studies Association is surely aware of China’s brutal occupation of Tibet since 1950. China faces no existential threat. It does not have terrorists blowing up schools and buses and does not have a neighbor building a nuclear bomb threatening to annihilate it. Israel, by contrast, has all of these things.

Israel has been under the threat of extermination by its Arab neighbors for six decades, has lost countless citizens to terrorism and has a nuclear-inclined Iran threatening to wipe it off the map. Surely a group of scholars would understand the unique security situation facing a nation that has suffered a genocide of 6 million people just 70 years ago.

So why Israel?

That’s your reason? One has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be, yet again, the Jews? Shmuley Boteach

According to an article in the New York Post, ASA President Curtis Marez said that his group singled out Israel, knowing that many of Israel’s neighbors have worse human rights abuses, because “one has to start somewhere.”

At Oxford, I had the privilege of hosting and debating some of the world’s leading intellectuals. Never before have I read a more inane quote from a man claiming to be a scholar.

That’s your reason? One has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be, yet again, the Jews?

If it’s a matter of choosing a place to start, you could draw straws or perhaps throw dice or pull names from a hat. So, a group of academics just decided it was time to boycott some country and decided, arbitrarily, that Israel was as good as any?

This isn’t even a case of anti-Semitism so much as buffoonery, not a case of prejudice so much as stupidity.

Let’s state the real facts.

Israel is the Middle East’s only democracy, guaranteeing a free press and the right to worship, as well as the rights of women and homosexuals. Although the Arab nations that surround Israel commit unspeakable human rights violations every day, Israel struggles under existential threat to balance its security needs with the freedoms it cherishes.

The 1995 interim agreement says, “Israel and [the Palestinians] will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.” Yet Palestinian schools teach hatred of Israel. A U.S. government report finds that 84% of the references to Israelis in Palestinian textbooks are negative.

Palestinian universities promote extremism. In 2007, the Washington Institute reported in an article called “Teaching Terror” that university campuses are full of Hamas propaganda. Israel has roadblocks and builds fences solely because it got tired of seeing its citizens blown to smithereens.

Calling for an academic boycott of Israel for the steps it takes to defend itself is akin to calling for an academic boycott of Britain and the United States during World War II. And, mind you, Israel has never even come close to indiscriminately bombing civilian population centers the way the allies did in that war. Israel takes great care to protect the lives of innocent civilians even as it fights genocidal terror organizations Hamas and Hezbollah.

We Americans who cherish freedom, democracy and liberty should be ashamed that a group of our nation’s “scholars” have so viciously maligned a most humane nation.

Lindsey Graham says he will continue to try to block President Obama’s two nominees for high-level posts until he talks to survivors of the fatal Benghazi terror attacks.

Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he hopes there's a way to arrange interviews with five State Department employees so he can let the nominations move forward.

""All I want to do is talk to the survivors, protecting their security, protecting their identity, to find out exactly what did happen,” Graham told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Graham said he would stall the nominations after a ""60 Minutes"" story in late October in which a former contractor at a British security company falsely claimed to be at the scene of the Benghazi assault.

CBS News admitted on Friday that it was wrong to trust a source, but Graham says his position remains unchanged.

The South Carolina lawmaker has been among the most outspoken Capitol Hill lawmakers regarding the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

Among his original concerns was whether the attacks were indeed sparked by outrage over an anti-Islamic video, as former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and other administration officials originally said.

His pressure for answers eventually led to Rice withdrawing her name for consideration for the secretary of state job.

“Was it a protest? Was it an al Qaeda-inspired attack?” Graham asked again Sunday.

The two nominees are Janet Yellen for Federal Reserve chairman and Jeh Johnson for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

""I want to perform oversight,” Graham told CNN. “I'm not trying to prosecute a crime. I'm not trying to defend the British contractor.""

The 2012 raid killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Graham and others argue the Obama administration tried to mislead the American people in the heat of a presidential campaign by playing down a terrorist attack on Obama's watch. Republicans have accused the administration of stonewalling their investigations.

The State Department has told Graham that it was concerned about congressional interviews with the survivors of the attack because of Justice Department advice that the survivors could be witnesses in a criminal trial and any interviews outside the criminal justice process could jeopardize a case.

It is the first time since the founding of the People’s Republic of China that an official who has held such high office has been the focus of a formal corruption investigation, and in pressing his antigraft crusade to new levels, Mr. Xi has broken a longstanding taboo. Mr. Zhou was once a member of the Communist Party’s top rung of power, the Politburo Standing Committee, and even retired members of that body have always been spared such scrutiny.

The principal allegations against Mr. Zhou emerged from investigations over the past year into accusations of abuse of power and corruption by officials and oil company executives associated with him. Those inquiries have already encircled his son, Zhou Bin, and other family members, the sources said.

Mr. Xi and other leaders agreed by early December to put the elder Mr. Zhou directly under formal investigation by the party’s commission for rooting out corruption and abuses of power, the sources said. They said a senior official went to Mr. Zhou’s home in central Beijing to inform him about the inquiry, and Mr. Zhou and his wife, Jia Xiaoye, have since been held under constant guard."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama flies across the Atlantic on Wednesday for a trip that takes him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office.

The trip aims to bolster investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy.

It comes as China aggressively engages the continent. The Asian nation is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms, and replaced the United States in 2009 as the largest trading partner.

Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, will be in Africa at the same time.

Bush has made multiple visits to Africa since leaving office, and will be in Zambia next week, where he’s working with his global health initiative to renovate a cervical cancer screening and treatment center.

While the 44th and 43rd president are not scheduled to meet, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, will attend the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania on July 2.

Obama’s trip is being overshadowed by the declining health of South Africa’s revered former president, Nelson Mandela, who is in critical condition at a Pretoria hospital.

Mandela, who emerged from prison after 27 years to lead South Africa out of its dark days of apartheid, is considered the father of modern day South Africa.

Obama will be in Senegal Thursday and Friday. He arrives in South Africa on Saturday, where he will spend the weekend taking part in a host of activities, including meeting with the nation’s leaders and visiting Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term.

He will spend Monday and Tuesday in Tanzania, and is expected back in Washington on July 3.

The president made a brief trip to Ghana during his first term in July 2009.

Pollak'],"New 'Apology Tour,' Same Old Result: Turkey Reneges on Israel Deal","President Barack Obama was once criticized for his “apology tour” around the globe, in which he bowed to Islamic leaders and admitted America’s faults. Now, he is making other western leaders apologize. In a surprise move before leaving Israel, President Obama encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for the death of nine Gaza flotilla activists in 2010.

The media hailed President Obama’s achievement, calling it a “diplomatic win” and a “diplomatic coup.” Netanyahu’s apology “resolved a bitter three-year dispute,” the New York Times reported, “handing the president a solid accomplishment.” According to the terms of the deal, Turkey and Israel were to restore normal diplomatic ties, and Turkey was to drop its sensational prosecutions of Israeli generals over the flotilla incident.

On Friday, the White House released a statement hailing “the restoration of positive relations” between Israel and Turkey as a result of Netanyahu’s apparently forced apology over the flotilla raid. A day later, however, Turkey appeared to renege on the deal, with Erdogan telling the Turkish press that it was too soon to send a new ambassador to Israel or to stop the show-trial prosecutions, despite President Obama’s assurances.

Turkey appears to have pocketed Israel’s apology and changed the terms of the deal–or else the deal was never what reporters were led to believe. Instead of a diplomatic “coup,” what President Obama appears to have achieved is the humiliation of an ally for the simple act of having defended itself from terrorism. The principle that the apology has established could have negative security implications for Israel and the U.S. as well.

The deaths occurred in 2010 aboard the Mavi Marmara, which was attempting to run a blockade that Israel has established around Gaza to prevent shipments of weapons and weapons-making material to Hamas and other terror groups. There were several other ships in the flotilla, which Israeli commandos stopped and boarded without incident. But passengers on the Mavi Marmara, who included radical Islamists, attacked the Israelis.

The flotilla was organized by a Turkish organization calling itself the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH. The IHH calls itself a charity but operates as a front for jihadists and has a record of providing logistical support to terrorists as well as accepting money from terrorist financiers. It enjoys the protection and support of Erdogan and his ruling party, who supported the flotilla and its goal of breaking the blockade of Hamas in Gaza.

Similar flotillas and marches have been organized by international anti-Israel activists, including former Obama associates (and domestic terrorists) Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dorhn, who led a “Freedom March” to Gaza in late December 2009. Israel already lets humanitarian aid and some commercial goods into Gaza, but restricts specific materials that can be used to build the kind of deadly rockets fired during President Obama’s visit.

Relations with Turkey are important to Israel. The two once enjoyed close security ties, and both are concerned about the civil war in Syria and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Yet the Erdogan government has been steering Turkey in an Islamist direction, which includes hostility to Israel. That policy was not appeased by Netanyahu’s apology. Instead, the apology appears to have indicated to Erdogan that he can press for more concessions.

It is possible that Netanyahu may have agreed to apologize in exchange for support by President Obama for a potential pre-emptive strike on Iran. Regardless, it is clear that he would not have apologized without Obama’s involvement. In September 2011, Netanyahu flatly refused to apologize to Turkey for actions taken in self-defense, saying: “We do not need to apologize for working to defend our children, our citizens and our cities.”

It is now becoming equally clear that the gesture now described as a “diplomatic coup” by President Obama was anything but. The apology was merely a capitulation that is being celebrated by Hamas as well as Turkey, with Hamas calling it the first step to “ending the political and economic blockade.” What the New York Times called “a win-win for all sides” now looks like a win for radical Islam and terror at Israel and the West’s expense."

Iran's foreign minister says the meetings are ""something that we can build on""

EU official: ""Concrete progress has been achieved, but ... differences remain""

This marks the latest movement after years of stalemate on Iran's nuclear program

Three days of intensive talks about Iran's nuclear program concluded early Sunday without an agreement, though key players insisted they believed the process is moving in the right direction.

""A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain,"" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif echoed that sentiment, saying ""hopefully we will be able to reach an agreement when we meet again.""

""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Zarif said. ""And that gives us the impetus to go forward.""

The inclusion of top diplomats such as Zarif, Ashton and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry left some thinking that this latest meeting could lead to a breakthrough to satisfy the international community's desire that Iran not develop a nuclear weapon and, with that, a relaxation of crippling sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation.

That didn't prove to be the case this time, though the parties -- including Zarif and Ashton -- will meet again November 20.

Both Ashton and Zarif fielded questions posited on the assumption France blocked a resolution this time around. But neither singled out any one party, with the Iranian foreign minister saying differences among the countries are only ""natural ... when we start dealing with the detail.""

""We had a very good three days, a very productive three days,"" Zarif said. ""And it's something that we can build on.""

Kerry also voiced optimism, saying, ""I can tell you, without any exaggeration, we not only narrowed differences but we made significant progress. ...There's no question in my mind that we are closer now.""

At the same, the top U.S. diplomat cautioned against jumping into any agreement that everyone is not comfortable with -- especially given the complicated, technical details to deal with and the need to ""build confidence between countries that have really been at odds with each other for a long time now.""

""Diplomacy takes time, and all the parties here need time to fully consider the issues,"" Kerry said.

Iranian president: West shouldn't miss 'unique opportunity'

It is widely believed that Iran harbors aspirations to produce nuclear weapons. Repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors indicate that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research.

Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. Even though Iran has denied working toward nuclear weapons, it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program.

For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East.

Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack.

Iran has been under crippling U.N. sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006, and those sanctions have hobbled the nation's economy. The United States first sanctioned Iran over its nuclear program in 2000.

The relatively sudden progress in recent meetings -- after years of stalemate -- follows a slight thaw in relations between Iran and the West under the newly elected President Hassan Rouhani.

Rouhani, himself, weighed in Saturday from afar, taking to Twitter to say ""the West should not miss this unique opportunity.""

Saying the Iranian delegation was participating in Geneva ""with strong will & determination,"" Rouhani tweeted that ""one of the slogans the Iranian nation has embraced is that of 'constructive interaction with the world.'""

The Iranian president also spoke at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, contending that resolving the nuclear issue will ""help restore stability and tranquility to the entire region.""

""The negotiating parties should bear in their mind that this opportunity was created following recent presidential election in Iran as the Iranian peopled called for establishing a constructive interaction with the world,"" Rouhani said, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Israel: 'Bad deal'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned that an agreement is ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace.""

""It's a very bad deal,"" he said. ""Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing.""

A senior Israeli government official says Israel backs a diplomatic solution that would dismantle Iran's military nuclear program, ""dismantling all the centrifuges, the removal of the enriched uranium and the closure of the heavy water reactor.""

If Iran wants nuclear power ""for civilian purposes, as it claims, it has no need for centrifuges and heavy water. These are only required to produce nuclear weapons. Like 17 other countries in the world (e.g. Canada and Indonesia), she can do this without a centrifuge and without a heavy water reactor,"" the Israeli official said.

A heavy water reactor at Arak, which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons-grade plutonium, is under construction and could be activated early next year. Once the reactor is activated, it could be dangerous to incapacitate.

Responding to Netanyahu's remarks, British Foreign Secretary William Hague asked for trust and understanding.

""We haven't done the deal yet. We haven't made this deal yet. So I think everybody will have to comment on it if and when we reach a successful conclusion, and make their judgment about it then. So I'd ask everyone to be patient and to wait for us to arrive at that conclusion if we can.""

Hague stressed that any agreement would ""require some flexibility on all sides."" He is cautiously optimistic, citing the mood among diplomats.

""The atmosphere of these negotiations, as others have told you before, is completely different from the atmosphere of a few months ago. Clearly, dealing with these ministers from Iran is a different experience from the recent past. So a lot of progress has been made, but it's too early to say that we will reach a successful conclusion today,"" Hague said.

U.S. officials outline possible deal

Two senior U.S. administration officials said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree:

• to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity.

• to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel.

• not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges.

• not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak.

In turn, the P5+1 would agree:

• to unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas.

• to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals.

Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said.

One of the officials said the deal is designed to ""stop Iran's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon"" while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief to Iran.

That official cautioned that the deal is not done but said it could happen if the Iranians agree to the P5+1's demands.

Nations in every part of the world have traveled this difficult path. Europe, the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century, is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations.

And it is because of the progress that I’ve witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I’ve witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We’ve begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made -- from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan -- to put more power in the hands of citizens.

At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.

All these things give me hope. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of us, not the actions of leaders -- it is the people that I’ve seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away; the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind; the faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations; the young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women, and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.

So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That’s what we see on the news. That’s what consumes our political debates. But when you strip it all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people -- and not the other way around.

The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for people all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. That is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.

And I promise you this: Long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens’s legacy will live on in the lives that he touched -- in the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs that read, simply, “Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.”"

Rebel commanders disagree on the level of coordination they expect with the U.S. and its allies, and made it clear they hope the United States will do more than launch the limited strikes President Obama has proposed to deter Assad from using chemical weapons. The rebels have been disappointed by America’s reluctance to get involved more deeply in the conflict.

The issue is now before Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed an amended resolution Wednesday approving military action to change the battlefield momentum in Syria away from the government.

But many members of Congress, particularly in the House, have expressed deep skepticism about military involvement.

If the U.S. strikes, rebels said Thursday, they will be ready to take advantage, particularly around Damascus, the capital, where they say insurgents are infiltrating in preparation to attack.

“We are ready once the first rocket is launched,” said Col. Qassim Saad Eddine, spokesman for the Supreme Military Council, which oversees the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army. “We will attack the military sites, not just in one province, but all over Syria.”

Saad Eddine said Free Syrian Army chief of staff Gen. Salim Idriss and the rebel command have been told they would receive some notice of a U.S. attack, perhaps a few hours in advance, but have not coordinated targets with U.S. or allied military personnel.

“The targets are already known,” he said, referring to Syrian military and command installations.

But one opposition commander, Col. Abduljabbar Akidi, who heads the Free Syrian Army contingent in northern Syria’s Aleppo province, said by Skype that coordination on potential targets is already underway in joint operation rooms in Turkey and Jordan with “supporting countries,” including the United States.

“If they strike the regime with a crippling hit, we will finish them off,” Akidi said.

The Obama administration has long expressed concern about Al Qaeda-linked militants being a major force in the rebel movement, and several members of Congress have cited that concern in expressing doubts about U.S. military involvement.

A key question is whether rebel coordination would involve only the Free Syrian Army or extend to other factions in the fragmented opposition. In practice, disparate rebel brigades often unify in battle.

Some insurgents distrustful of the West worry that U.S military planners might try to attack Al Qaeda-linked rebel factions under the cover of an assault on Assad’s forces.

Nonetheless, after having been outgunned for more than two years, the rebels are clearly relishing the prospect of having U.S. firepower on their side. Commanders say they want to be in position to pounce, especially in Damascus, the seat of Assad’s power, which is expected to be the focus of any U.S. bombardment.

“We are going to be ready to take advantage of the areas after a strike,” said Abu Jamal, nickname for a commander with the Farouq Brigade, one of the largest insurgent groups.

In preparation for a possible U.S. attack, said one rebel spokesman, insurgents outside Damascus were sending fighters into the capital with light weapons to prepare to seize government buildings. Some are said to be stockpiling weapons for an offensive.

“All sides are working together to take Damascus if the American strikes are truthful, and if they are targeted at the regime,” said Abu Harith, nickname for a spokesman with the Ansar al Islam brigade in Damascus, one of the largest groups in the capital.

Assad’s forces have been fighting hard to clear Damascus’ suburbs of rebel forces. The Obama administration accuses government forces of launching chemical weapons attacks in suburbs Aug. 21.

The rebels are not the only ones making preparations. Syrian officials have also had time to get ready.

The opposition has reported that the Syrian military has been moving missiles, aircraft and other assets from exposed bases to less vulnerable sites. Witnesses say they have seen Syrian soldiers crowding into schools and other facilities in Damascus.

To be effective, the opposition says, U.S. strikes must hit key targets such as the Mezzeh military air base in the capital or the army’s 155th Brigade compound near Damascus, reported site of Scud missile launches.

Abu Jamal of the Farouq Brigade said there were indications that the government was sending in tanks, other armored vehicles and artillery from embattled Homs province to bolster the defense of Damascus.

Rebels are hoping for a surge in arms supplies before any U.S. strike, but the evidence so far is mixed. In southern Syria, one commander has reported an increased number of arms, including antitank weapons, arriving via neighboring Jordan. But there has yet to be any uptick in materiel from Turkey, said a commander in the north.

It was not clear whether there is any connection between the prospect of U.S. strikes and the reported defection to Turkey this week of a former Syrian general and ex-defense minister, Ali Habib Mahmoud, a member of Assad’s Alawite sect no longer considered a key player in the government or its defense apparatus.

And in few ways has that belief been more tested than in his frustrating private correspondence with the leaders of Iran, a country with which the United States has had no diplomatic ties for 34 years.

This week, Mr. Obama indicated that he might finally have found a pen pal in Tehran.

At the core of Iran’s recent diplomatic charm offensive — a process that has included the release of 11 prominent political prisoners and a series of conciliatory statements by top Iranian officials — is an exchange of letters, confirmed by both sides, between Mr. Obama and President Hassan Rouhani.

The election of Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, in June kindled hopes that diplomacy might end the chronic impasse with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. But the letters, and the cautious hope they have generated, suggest there is a genuine opportunity for change.

It is not the first time since entering the White House that Mr. Obama has put pen to paper to try to sway Iran’s leadership. Until now, he has had little to show for it: even under the pain of punishing economic sanctions, the Iranian government has shown little interest in negotiating a deal with Washington on its nuclear program."

Obama spoke as Russia offered a diplomatic proposal

Polls show public and congressional opposition to military action

WASHINGTON — President Obama told the nation Tuesday he is exploring a Russian diplomatic plan to end a chemical weapons dispute in Syria, but reserves the right to take military action if necessary.

""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed,"" Obama said during a White House address, but it is worth pursuing because of ""the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.""

During his nationally televised speech from the White House, Obama also said:

• He wanted to talk to the country ""about Syria, why it matters and where we go from here.""

• He resisted any intervention in Syria's civil war for months until Bashar Assad's government used chemical weapons against anti-government rebels on Aug. 21, killing numerous children.

• Use of these banned weapons increase the possibility of other chemical attacks in other parts of the world, perhaps even the United States.

• A lack of action would erode prohibitions on other weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.

• ""I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular;"" but any action in Syria would be specifically targeted on its chemical weapons programs.

• Syria does not have the ability to retaliate against the United States.

• He is encouraged by Russia's proposal to have Syria give up its chemical weapons, but added: ""I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.""

• Americans should review videos of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack now posted on the White House website, particularly the pictures of dead and dying children.

""Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong,"" Obama said. ""But when with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.""

Obama's speech capped a flurry of diplomatic activity, as American, British and French officials spoke with Russian counterparts about their idea to have Syria turn over their chemical weapons to international control for dismantling.

So far, they are at odds on the details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would only support a Syrian turnover if the Obama administration renounced the possible of use of force against Assad's government.

Obama declined to do that. In meetings with U.S. senators on Tuesday, and during his prime time speech, Obama said it's the potential for force that pressured Syria into negotiations about releasing its chemical weapons stockpile.

Officials said Secretary of State John Kerry would fly to Geneva, Switzerland, for a Thursday negotiation session with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Syria announced Tuesday it would accept Russia's offer, and said it is willing to join a global ban on chemical weapons.

Members of Congress, divided over a resolution authorizing military action against Syria, began exploring alternatives in light of the new diplomatic moves. The use-of-force resolution faces uphill battles in both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-run House.

Earlier on Tuesday, Obama attended separate meetings with Senate Democrats and Republicans in which he previewed his speech.

A bipartisan group of senators -- some of whom support intervention -- are working on an alternative that would require Syria to allow a United Nations team to remove chemical weapons within a certain time period, perhaps 45 to 60 days. If Syria doesn't comply, Obama would have the authority to launch military strikes.

Obama also spoke amid rising opposition in the public and in Congress to idea of a military strike against Syria.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday finds that nearly 60% of Americans want their member of Congress to oppose the use of military force in Syria."

Mỹ và Anh cảnh báo sẽ “đáp trả mạnh mẽ” nếu xác nhận ̣được Chính phủ Syria đã sử dụng vũ khí hóa học hồi tuần trước.

Thủ tướng Anh David Cameron và Tổng thống Mỹ Barack Obama đã có cuộc điện đàm kéo dài 40 phút vào thứ Bảy ngày 24/8, văn phòng ông Cameron cho biết.

Cả hai đều “quan ngại sâu sắc” trước việc “ngày càng có nhiều dấu hiệu cho thấy chính quyền Syria đã thực hiện nhiều cuộc tấn công sử dụng vũ khí hóa học.”

Chính phủ Syria và phe đối lập đã cáo buộc nhau về vụ tấn công này.

Quân nổi dậy và các nhà hoạt động đố́i lập cáo buộc các lực lượng ủng hộ Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad đã tấn công hóa học xung quanh thủ đô Damascus vào ngày 21/8, trong khi truyền hình nhà nước cáo ngược lại quân nổi dậy.

'Xem xét các lựa chọn'

“Hội đồng Bảo an Liên Hiệp Quốc đã kêu gọi cho các thanh sát viên của Liên Hiệp Quốc hiện đang ở Damascus tiếp cận hiện trường ngay lập tức,” thông cáo của Phố Downing cho biết.

“Việc Tổng thống Assad không chịu hợp tác với Liên Hiệp Quốc cho thấy chế độ này có điều gì đó phải giấu giếm.”

Thông cáo cũng cho biết Cameron và Obama đã “lặp lại rằng việc sử dụng rộng rãi vũ khí hóa học sẽ dẫn đến sự đáp trả mạnh mẽ của cộng đồng quốc tế và hai nhà lãnh đạo đã ra lệnh cho các quan chức xem xét tất cả các lựa chọn.

Tổng thống Obama trước đó đã cho triệu tập Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia để xem xét những sự lựa chọn hành động tại Syria.

“Tổng thống đã yêu cầu các cơ quan tình báo thu thập thông tin và chứng cứ để xác định điều gì đã xảy ra tại Syria,” một quan chức Nhà Trắng nói với hãng tin Pháp AFP.

“Chúng tôi đang có một số sự lựa chọn đã sẵn sàng vào lúc này, và chúng tôi sẽ hành động hết sức cẩn trọng để đưa ra những quyết định dựa trên lợi ích quốc gia cũng như những đánh giá của chúng tôi về việc làm thúc nào để thúc đẩy các mục tiêu ở Syria.”

Hôm thứ Bảy ngày 24/8, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Chuck Hagel nói Lầu Năm Góc đã trình các lựa chọn lên cho ông Obama và ông cũng cho biết quân đội Mỹ đã được di chuyển để chuẩn bị cho một hành động có thể nhằm vào Syria.

Thông tín viên chính trị của BBC, Iain Watson, nói ông hiểu rằng “đáp trả mạnh mẽ” nêu trong thông cáo trên không bao gồm “đổ quân trên bộ.”

Tuy nhiên những lựa chọn khác cũng không bị loại trừ, ông nói thêm, trong đó có khả năng không kích.

Watson cũng cho biết một số nghị sỹ Bảo thủ đã nói rõ rằng họ không muốn Thủ tướng Cameron can thiệp quân sự vào Syria nào mà không tham vấn họ trước tiên.

Triệu chứng thần kinh

Trong lúc này, Bác sỹ Không Biên giới (MSF) nói các bệnh viện họ hỗ trợ ở Syria đã chữa trị khoảng 3.600 bệnh nhân với triệu chứng của chất độc thần kinh và 355 người trong số này đã chết.

MSF, vốn nói họ không thể “xác nhận một cách khoa học” có hay không việc sử dụng vũ khí hóa học, cho biết các bệnh nhân đã được đưa đến ba bệnh viện ở Damascus hôm 21/8.

Tổ chức này cũng cho biết nhân viên tại các bệnh viện đã báo cáo về số lượng lớn các bệnh nhân đổ đến trong vòng chưa đầy ba tiếng đồng hồ, với các triệu chứng co giật, nhãn cầu bị giãn và khó thở.

Giám đốc điều hành MSF Bart Janssens nói các triệu chứng trên cùng với việc “các bệnh nhận ồ ạ̣t đổ vào trong thời gian ngắn”, là bằng chứng mạnh mẽ cho thấy nhiều người đã hít phải chất độc thần kinh trên diện rộng."

In a memo to the Cabinet, a local medical rights group said it had received at least 50 reports in just three days from hospitals complaining about equipment failures because of the blackouts. The Egyptian Center to Protect the Right for Medicine appealed for a quick solution, noting the diesel-powered generators at most public hospitals are old and unreliable.

A patient at the state-run Medical Research Institute in the coastal city of Alexandria reportedly died when the power failed in the intensive care unit. In Kafr El Sheik, a governorate north of Cairo, residents gathered outside a local hospital to help transfer newborns to another facility when 10 incubators stopped working recently.

The power cuts have also been a problem for thousands of students across the country who are preparing for their end-of-year exams. Governors in Cairo and other cities have urged authorities to refrain from cutting the electricity when students are taking the exams, but many complain it’s hard to study when the lights go out and there is no electricity to run the air conditioning.

“It’s difficult to focus when you’re frustrated. That’s the toughest challenge,” said 17 year-old Ahmad Belal, who wants to be a heart surgeon and needs top grades to get into medical school. “Trying to concentrate on your studies but being interrupted every two minutes because the weather is hot or because you’re angry you don’t have electricity for most of the day just makes it impossible.”

Belal lives in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, where he said the power cuts sometimes last more than four hours at a time. He studies by candlelight when the lights go out at home.

“Some of my friends go out to cafes, but it’s always very crowded and loud, and it’s also difficult to focus,” he said. “Plus, the lights go out in cafes too.”

Power disruptions are nothing new in Egypt, especially in the summer months, when consumption spikes. But this year’s blackouts are more frequent than in the past, often occurring several times a day and lasting for hours.

“God, I’m not asking you for a fancy villa, or the latest car model, or millions of pounds even … All I want is for the power not to go out,” wrote one frustrated Twitter user who goes by the handle @AmgdAboZeid.

The crisis is adding to the pressure on President Mohamed Morsi, who had promised to tackle the country’s ubiquitous power and fuel shortages, along with a host of other problems, in his first 100 days in office.

Hundreds of residents in Alexandria, Kafr El Sheikh, Aswan and other areas have taken to the streets in recent weeks to voice their displeasure, blocking roads and even railway lines while chanting anti-Morsi slogans, according to the independent daily Al Masry Al Youm. More demonstrations are planned June 30, to mark the first anniversary of Morsi’s presidency.

There have also been calls on social networking sites for Egyptians to refuse to pay their electricity bills until service improves, calls the electricity ministry said were “destructive.”

A popular meme doing the rounds on Facebook complains: “Egypt is the only country in the world that collects money for the garbage that is filling the streets and the electricity that is always out from the salaries of its unemployed citizens.”

Last week, the electricity ministry issued a rare apology, explaining in a statement that it had been forced to resort to load-shedding because consumption is outpacing production. It urged residents to ration their electricity use and said it was working with other departments to obtain the fuel needed to generate more power.

In a brief announcement Monday morning, Kerry appointed former ambassador Martin Indyk as the ""special envoy"" for the new round of Mideast peace negotiations. Keeping a cautiously optimistic tone, Kerry noted that as usual the talks will present both sides with ""difficult choices"" but said the consequences of inaction would be worse.

""It's no secret that this is a difficult process. If it were easy, it would have happened a long time ago,"" he said.

It is unclear whether Kerry will be able to surmount the issue that has vexed so many of his predecessors. The administration tried to jump-start peace talks during President Obama's first term, only to see both sides peel away from the negotiating table.

But Kerry spent much of his first six months as America's top diplomat in frenetic diplomacy trying to get the two sides to agree to resume peace talks that broke down in 2008. Since February, he has made six trips to the region shuttling between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to try to cajole them into returning to negotiations.

Obama, in a written statement, said the resumption of talks is a ""promising step forward, though hard work and hard choices remain ahead.""

Indyk's appointment has been carefully choreographed to come just hours before senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators sit down for a working dinner hosted by Kerry.

Kerry announced on July 19 in Amman, Jordan, that the two sides had reached a basis for returning to the table, but stressed that it still had to be formalized. On Sunday, the State Department announced that the two sides had accepted invitations from Kerry to come to Washington ""to formally resume direct final status negotiations.""

That followed a decision by Israel's Cabinet to free 104 long-held Palestinian prisoners, a longstanding demand of Abbas.

Abbas has been reluctant to negotiate with Netanyahu, fearing the hard-line Israeli leader will reject what the Palestinians consider minimal territorial demands. The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in 1967, but have accepted the principle of limited land swaps to allow Israel to annex some of the dozens of settlements it has built on war-won lands.

Abbas had repeatedly said he will only go to talks if Israel either freezes settlement building or recognizes the 1967 lines as a starting point for drawing the border of a state of Palestine.

Israel has made no such concessions, at least publicly, and the details of the framework for the talks brokered by Kerry remain shrouded in mystery.

Indyk, currently at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, served as former President Bill Clinton's ambassador to Israel and was a key part of the failed 2000 Camp David peace talks. He was also a special assistant to Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1995. And, he served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs in the State Department from 1997 to 2000.

Before working in government, Indyk was founding executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Indyk, 62, replaces David Hale, who had served as a place holder in the post until last month. He had replaced former Sen. George Mitchell as the Obama administration's first special Mideast envoy. Mitchell resigned in 2011 following two years of fruitless and frustrating attempts to get the Israelis and Palestinians to engage in serious negotiations.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-pledges-swift-reaction-nkorea-nuke-test-190205244--politics.html,,[],Obama pledges swift reaction to NKorea nuke test,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama reacted sharply to North Korea's nuclear test Tuesday, promising swift international action to bring the rogue communist regime in line. The detonation came hours before the president's State of the Union address, where he was expected to touch on U.S. plans to reduce its nuclear arsenal.

In a statement, Obama called Pyongyang's third nuclear test in seven years a ""highly provocative act"" that threatens U.S. security and international peace. The reaction from the White House was significantly stronger than it was after North Korea's long-range missile test in December, when the administration only promised ""appropriate action"" alongside America's allies.

""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community,"" Obama said in a statement early Tuesday. ""The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by telephone with the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan after the test, as well as China, and Obama called South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to assure him the U.S. would help defend his country.

North Korea said it successfully detonated a miniaturized nuclear device at a northeastern test site Tuesday. South Korean, U.S. and Japanese seismic monitoring agencies said they detected an earthquake in North Korea with a magnitude between 4.9 and 5.2.

North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the test was conducted safely but with ""great explosive power."" The test counters the ""ferocious"" U.S. hostility that undermines the North's peaceful, sovereign right to launch satellites, it argued. Last month, North Korea's National Defense Commission said the United States was its prime target for a nuclear test and long-range rocket launches.

""These provocations do not make North Korea more secure,"" Obama said. ""Far from achieving its stated goal of becoming a strong and prosperous nation, North Korea has instead increasingly isolated and impoverished its people through its ill-advised pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.""

Story continues

The Obama administration's options for a response are limited — even though it is committed to protecting America's key Asian allies, South Korea and Japan.

The U.S. already maintains severe unilateral sanctions against North Korea, and commerce between the two countries is nearly nonexistent. Tougher global sanctions are dependent on the participation of China, Pyongyang's primary trading partner, but Beijing has resisted measures that would cut off North Korea's economy completely.

At the U.N., the Security Council opened an emergency meeting Tuesday and condemned North Korea's action. But any new, binding international sanctions will now have to be worked out.

More forceful U.S. consequences, in the form of a military response, are highly unlikely even though the United States remains technically at war with the notoriously unpredictable North Koreans, whose opaque leadership has confounded successive American administrations. Only the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War keeps the U.S. and the North from hostilities, and some 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter potential aggression.

But with the South Korean capital of Seoul just 40 miles south of the nuclear-armed North's border and its million-man army, the risks involved in any military action are great. And just raising the rhetoric can even serve as a reward to North Korea's attention-seeking government, which starves its citizens while seeking to leverage any military advance it makes into much-needed aid.

The test occurred hours before Obama was to deliver his prime-time address to the nation. While the bulk of the speech will focus on the economy and job creation, the administration had sought to emphasize that it wants to work with Russia on further reducing the amount of deployable nuclear weapons each power maintains, building on the U.S.-Russian New START accord that took effect in 2011.

It's unclear how North Korea's test would affect the planning. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Obama would make the case Tuesday evening that the ""only way North Korea will rejoin the world community is if they stop these threats and live up to their international obligations.""

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland added that North Korea's test was unrelated to the president's position that the U.S. has ""more nuclear weapons than we need.""

""We're obviously talking about apples and oranges in the context of the U.S. having almost 1,700 nuclear weapons and we are working to prevent (North Korea) from having the effective ability to launch a far smaller amount,"" she said.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in remarks Tuesday morning to Pentagon workers gathered in the building's courtyard, said the U.S. is going to have to continue to deal with rogue states like North Korea.

""We just saw what North Korea has done in these last few weeks, a missile test and now a nuclear test,"" he said. ""They represent a serious threat to the United States of America, and we've got to be prepared to deal with that. ""

The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, California Republican Ed Royce, called for even tougher sanctions and demanded that the administration ""replace its failed North Korea policy.""

""Otherwise, the grave North Korean threat to the region and the United States will only grow,"" Royce said.

And House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., added that the U.S. must take a new approach to dealing with North Korea. ""The key to stemming North Korea's cycle of provocation is to seriously engage the Chinese in exercising leverage over their neighbor,"" he said.

On Tuesday, China expressed firm opposition to the test but called for a calm response by all sides.

The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose 2005 edict banning nuclear weapons is regarded as binding in Iran, told a group of visitors to his home in Tehran, the capital, that his country favored the worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons.

“We believe that nuclear weapons must be eliminated,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. “We don’t want to build atomic weapons. But if we didn’t believe so and intended to possess nuclear weapons, no power could stop us.” His comments were posted on his Web site, Khamenei.ir.

American officials say they believe that Ayatollah Khamenei exercises full control over Iran’s nuclear program. On Thursday, he rejected direct talks with the United States while it was “pointing a gun at Iran”; on Saturday he elaborated on the issue."

President Barack Obama just waged an unprecedented three-week PR campaign to sell Americans and Congress on the need to go to war — six television interviews in one night, a prime-time speech to the nation, and White House outreach to 93 senators and 375 representatives.

It’s enough to make those on the left looking for his help on issues such as gun violence, climate change, racial profiling, immigration and jobs wonder whether their causes rate this kind of White House commitment. Is there an intensity gap?

“I raised this issue to the president the other day,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told Yahoo News in a telephone interview.

Sanders, who for years has been calling for Washington to get its act together and take steps to boost job creation, said he prodded Obama when the president made a rare trip to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to make his Syria case to senators.

“It’s one thing to give a speech which most people know really is not going to translate into terribly strong action,” Sanders said. “Intensity is the key issue. Is he prepared to fight?”

Sanders declined to describe the president’s response.

But a Democratic aide who does not work for Sanders said the exchange was a bit combative, with the senator asking, in effect, “Why the hell aren’t we talking about jobs?”

The director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington Legislative Office, Laura Murphy, said that if she “could wave a magic wand,” she would conjure up a Syria-style presidential blitz to curb racial profiling in federal law enforcement.

“Of course it would create controversy — but Syria creates controversy,” she said.

“On racial profiling, he has intensity, even though it’s sporadic, but he doesn’t have the action to back it up,” Murphy said. “On Syria, he’s proposing arming the rebels, he’s getting the CIA involved. He’s doing things: He’s going to the United Nations Security Council, he’s laying out the case.”

Story continues

What about overhauling America’s immigration policy? Should Obama go “full Syria”? Not so much, according to some activists, because it might only stiffen Republican opposition.

“I think these things have to be calibrated. I think if he went all-out Syria it would most likely backfire,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the America’s Voice advocacy that favors an overhaul. “Could he ratchet up the pressure in a strategic way? Yes. Should he? Yes.”

But “if he went on a barnstorming campaign across the country, it arguably would make it harder for Republicans to get to yes,” Sharry said.

“They've dug themselves into an anti-Obama position, and if he were to say the sky is blue, they would disagree,” agreed Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasury of the potent SEIU union and head of its immigration reform campaign.

So would activists turn down a six-television-interview campaign? “Of course not, all of that helps,” said Medina. “But I’m not sure that there is a lot of convincing that he can do.""

For Natural Resources Defense Council communications director Ed Chen, Obama “has been great in terms of talking about climate issues” and “put a lot of time, public time, in promoting this issue.” So, would a Syria-style campaign help?

“No, because frankly on Syria the message has been mixed,” Chen said. “Every news cycle he’s had a different position. On climate he’s been straight and true.”

Obama, who faces a tough decision on the Keystone pipeline, has set new automobile fuel-efficiency standards, and new emissions rules for power plants.

“We just need him to press on and keep his foot on the gas pedal — so to speak. A hybrid of course,” Chen said.

The White House countered that Obama has been pushing these issues just as much as Syria — just over a longer time frame, stretching back years in some cases.

“What’s unique about the Syria situation, at least until a few days ago, is that we were operating under an unusually compressed time frame,” a senior Obama aide told Yahoo News on condition of anonymity to speak more candidly.

Obama campaigned for re-election on the need for jobs creation and gave an address to the nation on the issue in September 2011 — to a joint session of Congress, the aide underlined.

“Short of the national address, we have basically done all of that stuff on immigration reform,” the aide added. “Television interviews? We’ve done far more than six. We’ve had at least as many meetings — they’ve just been stretched over a longer period of time.”

On gun violence, the official observed wryly, “I’m not sure that another meeting at the White House is going to change the vote of someone in Congress who voted against 80 percent of the American people and against closing background-check loopholes.”

Still, the official said, Obama is “ready for all of these groups to make their case to the public.”"

Kerry might be wishing he had one of those old red hotline phones to Moscow after it took six days for Russia’s foreign minister to return a call.

Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke for nearly 30 minutes Sunday about the civil war in Syria and North Korea’s recent nuclear test, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. The two agreed to look for a date in the next several weeks for their first meeting since Kerry took over as the top U.S. diplomat, Nuland added.

Kerry had called Lavrov on Feb. 11, hours after North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions approved by Russia, the United States and other nations. Lavrov, who was traveling in Africa, didn’t call back that day, nor the next, nor for several more days in which State Department reporters had fun ribbing Nuland about the snub.

On Thursday, Nuland insisted Kerry was “relaxed” about the unusual silence from Russia, a difficult partner whose cooperation Kerry will need on numerous international diplomatic problems.

“From our perspective, the secretary would like to talk to him. It’s up to him whether he wants to take that opportunity,” she said.

On Friday, one reporter asked Nuland whether Kerry had found his “missing in action” counterpart.

“They have not connected,” Nuland replied.

“This is getting kind of ridiculous, isn’t it?” another reporter asked.

“As I’ve been saying all week, we’re making it clear that we would like to talk if they want to. If they are too busy or otherwise engaged, the offer stands, and we’ll continue to do other diplomacy,” Nuland responded.

Kerry and Lavrov had spoken once during Kerry’s first week on the job, a courtesy call during which both men agreed to keep lines of communication open, Nuland said at the time.

Lavrov is famously prickly and has a history of needling American counterparts of both political parties. His relationship with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Republican, was cordial on the surface, but her face turned stony when Lavrov lectured her during joint public appearances. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton laughed off Lavrov’s sometimes condescending tone, but took the opportunity on the day of their last meeting to criticize what she said was a Russian effort to “re-Sovietize” its neighbors.

The Obama administration has sought Russian help on Syria for more than a year, with little to show for it. Russia remains Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s most influential ally and arms merchant, and Russia has refused to back stiffer international sanctions or condemnations at the U.N. Security Council. Russia has also apparently refused to intercede with Assad to persuade him to cut a deal with the increasingly powerful rebels trying to unseat him.

“They discussed the importance of the U.S. and Russia using their respective influence on the parties in support of a viable political transition process” in Syria, Nuland said Sunday."

Obama is closing his first Mideast trip as president with a visit to Petra

Petra is Jordan%27s most popular tourist attraction

Obama spent the bulk of his time in Israel

PETRA, Jordan (AP) — Barack Obama is closing his first Mideast trip as president with a visit to Petra, Jordan's fabled ancient city.

An unexpected sandstorm that forced Obama to change some travel plans on Friday had led him to cautiously state that the tour of Petra would happen ""weather permitting.""

The weather cooperated on Saturday, allowing Marine One to touch down near Petra after an hour-long flight from Amman, Jordan's capital. Overcast skies in Amman threatened to upend Obama's travel plans but the weather improved during the flight across Jordan's rugged countryside.

Petra was carved into the rose-red stone by the Nabataeans more than 2,000 years ago. The ancient Arabs turned the city into a critical junction for the silk, spice and other trade routes that linked China, India and southern Arabia with Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome.

Petra is Jordan's most popular tourist attraction, drawing more than a half million visitors each year since 2007.

Obama's 24-hour visit to Jordan — he arrived in the country on Friday — is his final stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East, the first foreign excursion of his second term. It also was his first visit as president to Israel and Jordan.

Obama spent the bulk of his time in Israel, where held several meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought through a speech and other public remarks to reassure an anxious public that he is committed to the country's security.

He also made a brief stop in the West Bank city of Ramallah for meetings with Palestinian leaders.

In Amman, Obama met with King Abdullah II."

Story highlights NEW: Egypt is bracing for mass rival rallies on Friday A coup determination would force the administration to cut military aid to vital Mideast ally Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was ousted July 3 by the military after mass protests Obama administration has delayed delivery of fighter jets to Egypt

(CNN) —

The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN’s Jill Dougherty on Thursday.

A coup determination would force the United States to end military aid to Egypt.

“The law does not require us to make a formal determination as to whether a coup took place and it is not in our national interest to make such a determination,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

The administration sees continuing aid to Egypt – more than $1 billion annually – to be “consistent with our law” and necessary to further U.S. national security interests, the source said.

The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy’s supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military.

Morsy, Egypt’s first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution.

Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and thousands injured since Morsy’s ouster, some of them in confrontations with authorities and others in clashes with those on the other side of the political spectrum.

Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of Egypt’s military, has called for mass demonstrations Friday to support the country’s armed forces. He is calling the protests a “mandate” for the military after weeks of violence that he has blamed on Morsy’s supporters, primarily the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, issued its own call for protests.

The group has refused to recognize the ouster, saying Morsy is the legitimate president.

Al-Sisi warned that any violence “will be confronted with the resolve and strength” of the military.

“We call upon various political faction to avoid any act of provocation,” he said in statement released Thursday.

There has been growing concern about among world leaders about the increase in violence since Morsy’s ouster.

The country is considered a vital regional ally for the United States, which signaled its displeasure with Morsy’s ouster on Wednesday when the Pentagon said it was delaying the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets.

It’s not clear what conditions would be imposed before the aircraft would be cleared for shipment. The Pentagon said, however, that it was not suspending overall arms sales to Egypt at this time.

The United States and Iran have embarked on a new phase in their relationship. It is marked by bilateral negotiations, handshakes, smiles, side-by-side flags and significant compromise, including United States acquiescence to a “mutually defined enrichment program” for Iran in any long-term agreement and an Iranian commitment that “under no circumstances” will it “ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons.”

The six-month interim deal between major powers and Iran, renewable for a further six months pending a full accord (for a period to be defined), freezes Iran’s nuclear program about where it is — at a technologically advanced point short of militarization. But it fast-forwards American-Iranian relations and may thereby redraw the strategic map of the Middle East.

This explains Israel’s over-the-top “nyet,” its insistence that a deal heading off escalation makes the region more dangerous. Israel is the status-quo Middle Eastern power par excellence because the status quo cements its nuclear-armed domination. Any change is suspect, including popular Arab uprisings against despotism. As changes go, this U.S.-Iranian breakthrough is big, almost as big as an Israeli-Palestinian peace would be.

Just as the United States has had to adapt to a world where its power is unmatched but no longer determinant, Israel will have to do the same. With enlightened leadership this adaptation could strengthen the Jewish state, securing the nation through integration in its region rather than domination of it. For now Israel is some way from this mind-set. Its overriding prism is military. It was important that President Obama set down a marker, as he has through this deal, one that may spur new strategic reflection in Israel. (An Israel already alarmed by isolation is not about to embark on a Samson-like military strike against Iran.)"

Russian law banning adoptions by U.S. citizens was rushed through parliament in December

Tens of thousands of people rallied in central Moscow on Sunday to protest the law

All such adoptions must be approved by a Russian court

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's ombudsman for children's rights sought on Thursday to reassure American would-be adoptive parents that they will be allowed to take their children back to the United States. But some Americans with court rulings in their favor say they're still in legal limbo.

A Russian law banning adoptions by U.S. citizens was rushed through parliament in December, and sped to President Vladimir Putin's desk in less than 10 days in retaliation over a U.S. law calling for sanctions on Russians identified as human-rights violators.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in central Moscow on Sunday to protest the law, which the demonstrators say victimizes children to make a political point.

All such adoptions must be approved by a Russian court, and 52 U.S. families had won such rulings before the ban was enacted. But many of these families have told The Associated Press that authorities in Russia are still refusing to turn over these children.

Children's rights ombudsman Pavel Astakhov said Thursday that Russia would honor the court decisions but did not elaborate on the timeline or say what the families should do now. ""All the children who have been approved to be adopted will be able to leave for the U.S.,"" he said.

Astakhov vehemently defended the new law, saying that it would not be revoked ""however big the protests are.""

Dozens of American families are in legal limbo because of the ban.

Brian and Rebecca Preece and Jeana Bonner, whose adoption of children with Down's syndrome had received court approvals, have been in Moscow for days but officials this week refused to turn over children to them, quoting the new law.

Astakhov on Thursday blamed local officials for the bureaucratic cul-de-sac that's been created and quoted his conversation with them. ""What are you doing?"" he said. ""You're making a scandal. There are court decisions in place — go and enforce them.""

But Brian Preece, who is waiting to adopt a 4-year-old boy, told the AP on Thursday that they have still not received any news from Russian authorities. ""They've been quiet to us,"" he said.

The Russian government says there are 654,000 children without parental custody in Russia and 105,000 of them live in orphanages."

(CNN) —

The plea of a pregnant woman to be granted an abortion has gripped El Salvador for months: She wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby would not survive outside the womb and that her life was at risk.

But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador, and on Wednesday, the country’s Supreme Court denied her petition.

Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman, known only as “Beatriz,” argued that the mother’s life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated.

Ill woman at center of abortion debate in El Salvador

In a 3-1 vote, the justices ruled the risk to Beatriz’s life was not imminent but a possibility in the future.

“This court finds that the rights of the mother cannot be prioritized over those of the (fetus) nor vice versa,” the ruling said.

The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life, and to the unborn baby, too.

Beatriz is suffering from lupus and kidney problems, and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull. She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life, but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they wouldn’t be prosecuted, her attorneys said. Doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth.

She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old.

Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws.

“The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception, and anything that tries to end a life is murder,” lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling.

Women’s rights groups who have held rallies in support of Beatriz said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision.

“There has to be a prudent period (to make a decision) that doesn’t take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis,” said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER.

The court’s decision is not the end of the Beatriz’s options. Her family has said she is considering traveling outside the country to a place where an abortion can be carried out legally.

Christiane Amanpour interviews Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on AC360, tonight 8 p.m. ET

(CNN) —

Iran is prepared to engage in nuclear talks and nuclear weapons have no place in his country’s security, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday.

In a speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he said that Iran would be willing to “engage immediately in time-bound and result-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties.”

“Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran’s security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions,” Rouhani said.

He decried international sanctions against Iran.

“Sanctions, beyond any and all rhetoric, cause belligerence, war-mongering and human suffering,” he said.

“Iran seeks to resolve problems, not to create them,” Rouhani said, pushing for the “rejection of violence and extremism.”

Alongside fears facing the world, there are “new hopes,” he said. “The hope of universal acceptance and the elite all across the globe of yes to peace and no to war. And the hope of preference of dialogue over conflict, and moderation over extremism.”

Striking a conciliatory tone, Rouhani said that Iran “does not seek to increase tensions with the United States.”

Rouhani said he listened carefully to U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech and hoped that the United States “will refrain from following the short-sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups” so that the two nations “can arrive at a framework to manage our differences.”

Earlier Tuesday, two senior administration officials said that Obama and Rouhani wouldn’t be shaking hands or meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Such an encounter proved too complicated for Iran back home, the officials told reporters.

Both presidents spoke on the first day of the annual gathering of world leaders in New York. Obama made clear in his morning remarks that the United States was committed to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

“We will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

At the same time, Obama welcomed what he called positive signals from Iran that it was ready to negotiate with the international community on how it can develop a peaceful use of nuclear power without creating any weapons.

“We are not seeking regime change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy,” Obama said. “Instead, we insist that the Iranian government meet its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and U.N. Security Council resolutions.”

He noted that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, and Rouhani “just recently reiterated that the Islamic Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon.”

“These statements made by our respective governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement,” Obama said, adding that “to succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed those comments, but said that his country “will not be fooled by half-measures that merely provide a smokescreen for Iran’s continual pursuit of nuclear weapons.”

“Iran thinks that soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb. Like North Korea before it, Iran will try to remove sanctions by offering cosmetic concessions, while preserving its ability to rapidly build a nuclear weapon at a time of its choosing,” Netanyahu said.

Secretary of State John Kerry will join his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, at a Thursday meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Discussions will surround restarting talks on Iran’s nuclear program.

One European Union official expressed optimism over the chance for concrete progress.

“In terms of whether we’re on the verge of a breakthrough, I would put it like this: I was struck as I said by the energy and determination the foreign minister demonstrated to me,” said Catherine Ashton, high representative for foreign affairs and security policy of the European Union.

But no one is expecting an overnight solution to Iran’s alleged effort to build a nuclear weapon, an effort Tehran has so far denied, insisting its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

“The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested,” Obama said.

Iran president brings ‘charm offensive’ to U.N.

Syria a point of contention

Iran’s recent overtures signaling cooperation, though, likely stop short at the topics of Palestine and Syria. Iran is Syria’s closest ally in the region.

In his speech Tuesday, Rouhani blasted what he described as the “structural violence” against Palestinians. While he never mentioned U.S. ally Israel by name, the intention of his comments was clear.

“Palestine is under occupation; the basic rights of the Palestinians are tragically violated, and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes, birthplace and homeland,” he said. “Apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression against the innocent Palestinian people.”

On Syria, he said that the common objective of the international community regarding that country “should be a quick end of the killing of the innocent.”

“We defend peace based on democracy and the ballot box everywhere, including in Syria, Bahrain and other countries in the region, and believe that there are no violent solutions to world crises,” Rouhani said.

“While condemning any use of chemical weapons, we welcome Syria’s acceptance of the Chemical Weapons Convention,” he said, stressing that extremists’ access to chemical weapons was the “greatest danger to the region.”

Syria is under U.S.-led pressure to give up its chemical weapons arsenal in the aftermath of the August 21 attack on suburban Damascus that Washington and its allies blame on the al-Assad regime.

Obama said Tuesday that Syria’s use of chemical weapons tested the relevance of the United Nations in the modern world, and he rejected contentions by the al-Assad regime and its main ally, Russia, that rebel forces were responsible for the attack.

“It is an insult to human reason – and to the legitimacy of this institution – to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack,” Obama said.

Russia has blocked U.S. efforts to secure a strong Security Council resolution authorizing possible military force if Syria fails to comply with international regulations on turning over its chemical stockpiles. Obama argued Tuesday that such a resolution was vital.

“There must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there must be consequences if they fail to do so,” he said. “If we cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the U.N. is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the 21st century, and that this body means what it says.”

At the same time, Obama announced an additional $340 million in U.S. aid “to meet humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries,” referring to war refugees and other victims. The additional money increases the total U.S. commitment in humanitarian aid to $1.3 billion.

But Farah Atassi, activist with the opposition Syrian National Coalition, said Obama did not go far enough.

“The president did not address the core issue behind the Syrian crisis, which is holding the Assad regime accountable” – including for its use of conventional weapons, she said in a CNN interview. More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, the vast majority from conventional weapons, according to U.N. figures.

Obama is letting Syria’s ally Russia lead, she said. “We don’t trust the Russians.”

“We want the U.S. to step forward and take the leadership right now to push for Assad to step down and allow for a transitional government from the opposition.”

Emphasizing that the opposition has not asked for “boots on the ground,” Atassi said U.S. military action should remain “on the table.” And, she said, the rebels are looking to Washington for help empowering moderate elements of the opposition.

“We are not terrorists,” she said.

Militant groups make up part of the Syrian opposition.

In his remarks to open the General Assembly on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the Syrian government to “fully and quickly” honor its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which calls for turning over control of its stockpiles.

Ban also appealed to all sides to stop supplying any weapons to all parties in the Syrian civil war while urging both the Syrian government and the opposition to respect international humanitarian law.

Russia and Iran, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, are providing military backing to the al-Assad regime while the United States and some European allies have started supplying light arms to rebel fighters.

Meanwhile, U.N. weapons inspectors will be back in Syria on Wednesday to assess at least six claims of chemical weapons use in Syria by the regime or rebels, a spokesman for Ban said Tuesday.

Al-Assad hinted at potential trouble for inspectors coming into Syria, saying other countries may order terrorists to attack them.

“Those militants might want to stop (the) experts’ arrival. We know that those terrorists are under the control of some countries,” he said in an interview Sunday with Chinese television. “And those countries may encourage the terrorists to stop experts from arrival, so that they could accuse the Syrian government for violating the agreement.”

Despite al-Assad’s veiled threat, positive progress has been made on the Syrian chemical weapons deal brokered by the United States and Russia in Geneva. Over the weekend, the United States said it was pleasantly surprised by the extent of Syria’s initial declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile reported to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The United States is pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution this week in New York to enforce the Geneva deal.

Brazil outrage over U.S. surveillance

Obama faced criticism Tuesday from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who used her U.N. speech to call allegations of U.S. surveillance of her country “totally unacceptable.”

Rousseff referred to classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that made public how the U.S. government had access to phone and Internet records, including foreign information.

She said the U.S. surveillance intercepted private details of Brazilian citizens and businesses, along with “communications by Brazilian diplomatic representation offices, including the permanent mission of Brazil with the United Nations and even the very presidency of the republic of Brazil.”

“Meddling in such a manner in the life and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and such is an affrontment to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,” she said, adding Brazil would propose U.N. action intended to prevent the manipulation of cyberspace as “a weapon of war.”

Because of the surveillance controversy, Rousseff postponed a state visit to Washington that had been planned for next month. The White House said the postponement was a joint decision.

As part of the deal, the South Korean government has requested American approval to enrich uranium and to reprocess nuclear fuel originally bought from the United States.

This technology, which is prohibited in the current agreement, would enable South Korea to produce its own nuclear fuel and bring it closer to making nuclear weapons. Granting that approval would be a serious mistake. A United States-South Korean nuclear agreement was first negotiated in 1974 and expires in 2014. The agreement has enabled resource-poor South Korea to become the sixth-largest producer of nuclear energy. The nuclear industry says South Korea is running out of space to store the spent fuel rods from the country’s 21 power reactors and that it wants to recycle the rods for use again as fuel.

Rising tensions with North Korea are a factor in South Korea’s increased interest in reprocessing nuclear fuel and possibly having the option of producing nuclear weapons. It dabbled with developing a secret weapons program in the 1970s until that was abandoned under American pressure. Allowing the South to produce nuclear fuel would make it even harder for the United States to argue credibly for restraining weapons-related nuclear fuel programs in North Korea and Iran.

Such a decision could also give impetus to Japan to pursue nuclear weapons development; it has had American approval to reprocess fuel for energy purposes since 1988 and is considering whether to open a new reprocessing plant that could produce enough plutonium to make 1,000 to 2,000 bombs a year."

By day’s end, outraged Bolivian officials, insisting that Mr. Snowden was not on the plane, were accusing France and Portugal of acting under American pressure to rescind permission for President Evo Morales’s plane to traverse their airspace on the way back to Bolivia. Low on fuel, the plane’s crew won permission to land in Vienna.

“They say it was due to technical issues, but after getting explanations from some authorities we found that there appeared to be some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane,” the Bolivian foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, told reporters after the plane touched down in Vienna, where Mr. Morales was spending the night.

“We don’t know who invented this big lie,” the foreign minister said at a news conference in La Paz, Bolivia. “We want to express our displeasure because this has put the president’s life at risk.”"

* Network says it is suing AT&T for breach of contract

* Early coverage ""not much different"" from cable rivals-Kurtz

* Defining mission clearly is crucial for Al Jazeera-advertisers

* Channel may need to pay distributors to reach more viewers-media exec

By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine

Aug 20 (Reuters) - New cable network Al Jazeera America introduced itself to viewers on Tuesday with reports on political strife in Egypt and the impact of climate change on U.S. cities, shortly after a major pay TV distributor declined to carry the channel.

The decision by AT&T's U-verse pay-TV service stemmed from a contract dispute over terms to carry the new network, AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said. Al Jazeera responded by suing AT&T for breach of contract in Delaware Chancery Court.

Globally, Al Jazeera is seen in more than 260 million homes in 130 countries. But the new U.S. channel funded by the emir of Qatar has so far had difficulty getting distributors, in part because Al Jazeera was perceived by some as being anti-American during the Iraq war.

Before AT&T's announcement, Al Jazeera America said it would be available in more than 40 million homes, about 40 percent of U.S. pay TV households and roughly half the reach of Time Warner Inc's CNN. U-verse was launched in 2006 and had 5 million video customers at the end of June in markets such as Texas and California.

""We could not reach an agreement with the owner that we believed provided value for our customers and our business,"" AT&T spokesman Siegel said.

Al Jazeera America said in a statement AT&T had ""unilaterally"" deleted the network and ""presented us with circumstances that were untenable - an affiliate that has willfully and knowingly breached its contractual obligations.""

The network said it had ""no choice"" but to file a lawsuit over the matter.

Defining the new channel's mission clearly will be crucial for Al Jazeera to gain a foothold in the United States, according to advertisers, executives and industry experts.

In its first hour at midafternoon, Al Jazeera pledged to cover ""issues that matter to America and the world beyond."" Anchors said they would provide in-depth coverage of stories ignored by other media outlets, with bureaus in cities they considered underserved such as Nashville and Detroit.

Al Jazeera America hired ABC news veteran Kate O'Brian to be its president and hired on-air talent like CNN veterans Ali Velshi and Soledad O'Brien.

Its news coverage kicked off with reports on Egypt, a Georgia elementary school shooting and wildfires in the western United States, topics covered by cable news competitors on Tuesday. Al Jazeera America also reported on a hunger strike by inmates protesting conditions in California prisons and Kodak's plan to rebound from bankruptcy.

It turned to sports with an interview of retired slugger Gary Sheffield about baseball's steroids scandal. A show called ""Inside Story"" explored the impact of climate change on U.S. cities and working conditions in Bangladeshi factories.

Audience ratings data were not yet available.

COVERAGE DESCRIBED AS BALANCED

Media critic Howard Kurtz, speaking on rival Fox News Channel, said Al Jazeera America's early coverage was ""not much different, at least so far, than what you might see on Fox News, CNN or MSNBC."" One top story on Egypt was ""right down the middle"" in terms of balance, he said.

The network is airing six minutes of commercials per hour, below the 15 to 16 minute average on other cable news outlets. Executives indicated they are willing to lose money in the near term.

Advertisers on Tuesday included Procter & Gamble Co's Gillette for its Fusion razors and phone service provider Vonage .

U-verse is the second TV provider after Time Warner Cable to drop the network since it acquired Current TV in January and replaced it with Al Jazeera America. Comcast, DirecTV, Dish and Verizon are carrying the network.

Merrill Brown, a former media executive who helped launch cable news network MSNBC, said Al Jazeera America may need to pay distributors if it wants to reach more viewers, particularly since it is not owned by a media conglomerate that can package it with other channels to gain leverage in negotiations.

""It's hard to believe they are going to get this thing nationally distributed without paying for carriage,"" Brown said."

Obama called on international community to address Syria conflict



President working with Congress to provide Jordan with %24200M in aid

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Anxious to keep Syria's civil war from spiraling into even worse problems, President Barack Obama said Friday he worries about the country becoming a haven for extremists when — not if — President Bashar Assad is ousted from power.

Obama, standing side by side with Jordan's King Abdullah II, said the international community must work together to ensure there is a credible opposition ready to step into the breach.

""Something has been broken in Syria, and it's not going to be put back together perfectly immediately — even after Assad leaves,"" Obama said. ""But we can begin the process of moving it in a better direction, and having a cohesive opposition is critical to that.""

He said Assad is sure to go but there is great uncertainty about what will happen after that.

""I am very concerned about Syria becoming an enclave for extremism,"" Obama said, adding that extremism thrives in chaos and failed states. He said the rest of the world has a huge stake in ensuring that a functioning Syria emerges.

""The outcome is Syria is not going to be ideal,"" he acknowledged, adding that strengthening a credible opposition was crucial to minimizing the difficulties.

STORY:Israel apologizes to Turkey over flotilla deaths

Eager to resolve another source of tension in the region, the president earlier Friday helped broker a phone call between the Israeli and Turkish prime ministers that led to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Obama had come to Jordan from Israel, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu placed a call to Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan to apologize for the deaths of nine Turkish activists in a 2009 Israeli naval raid on a Gaza-bound international flotilla.

""The timing was good for that conversation to take place,"" Obama said.

Obama, at a joint news conference with Abdullah, said his administration is working with Congress to provide Jordan with an additional $200 million in aid this year to cope with the massive influx of refugees streaming into the country from Syria.

Abdullah said the refugee population in his country has topped 460,000 and is likely to double by the end of the year — the equivalent of 60 million refugees in the United States, he said.

Obama also said he would ""keep on plugging away"" in hopes of getting the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a peace agreement.

""The window of opportunity still exists, but it's getting more and more difficult,"" the president said. ""The mistrust is building instead of ebbing.""

On Iran, Obama reiterated that the U.S. is open to ""every option that's available"" to keep the country from developing a nuclear weapon.

He said it would be ""extraordinarily dangerous"" for the world if Iran does become nuclear capable, and he expressed his desire for using diplomatic means to halt Iran's nuclear aspirations. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

""My hope and expectation is that among a menu of options, the option that involves negotiations, discussions, compromise and resolution of the problem is the one that's exercised,"" Obama said. ""But as president of the United States I would never take any option off the table.""

Obama arrived in Jordan on Friday evening, the final stop on a four-day visit to the Middle East that included his first stop in Israel as president.

He began his visit to Amman with an apology.

""I apologize for the delay,"" Obama told Abdullah after arriving about an hour behind schedule. ""We ended up having a dust storm.""

The two leaders headed to dinner after their news conference. On Saturday, Obama planned several hours of sightseeing, including a tour of the fabled ancient city of Petra, before the return trip to Washington.

Before leaving Israel, Obama paid his respects to the nation's heroes and to victims of the Holocaust. He also solemnly reaffirmed the Jewish state's right to exist.

Accompanied by Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, Obama laid wreaths at the graves of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism who died in 1904 before realizing his dream of a Jewish homeland, and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.

He also toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, declaring afterward that it illustrates the depravity to which man can sink but also serves as a reminder of the ""righteous among the nations who refused to be bystanders.""

Friday's stop at Herzl's grave, together with Thursday's visit to see the Dead Sea Scrolls, the ancient Hebrew texts, were symbolic stops for Obama that acknowledged a rationale for Israel's existence that rests with its historical ties to the region and with a vision that predated the Holocaust. Obama has been criticized in Israel for his 2009 Cairo speech in which he gave only the example of the Holocaust as a reason for justifying Israel's existence.

""Here on your ancient land, let it be said for all the world to hear,"" Obama said. ""The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a holocaust will never happen again.""

Obama and Netanyahu met for two hours over lunch. An Israeli official said that they discussed Israel's security challenges and that, in addressing the peace process with Palestinians, Netanyahu stressed the importance of security. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic protocol.

Obama also squeezed in a stop in Bethlehem in the West Bank to visit the Church of the Nativity.

He had been scheduled to take a helicopter to Bethlehem but had to change plans due to unusually high winds. The route gave Obama a clear look at Israel's separation barrier with the West Bank, which runs south of Jerusalem and is the subject of weekly protests by Palestinians.

About 300 Palestinians and international pilgrims gathered near the Nativity Church, awaiting Obama's arrival. But a knot of protesters along the route held up signs stating: ""Gringo, return to your colony"" and ""US supports Israeli injustice.""

At a nearby mosque, Mohammed Ayesh, a Muslim religious official in Bethlehem, issued a plea to Obama in a speech to worshippers: ""America, where are your values? Where are the human rights? Isn't it time that you interfere to make it stop?""

Amid high security, Obama toured the church with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. They stopped at the Grotto of the Nativity, which is said to stand where Jesus Christ was born. About 20 children waving U.S. and Palestinian flags greeted Obama in a courtyard outside the sanctuary. He posed for photographs with Abbas and Bethlehem's mayor, Vera Baboun.

At Yad Vashem, Obama donned a skull cap and was accompanied by Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, a survivor of the Buchenwald Concentration camp who lost both parents in the Holocaust. Among his stops was Yad Vashem's Hall of Names, a circular chamber that contains original testimony documenting every Holocaust victim ever identified.

""Nothing could be more powerful,"" Obama said."

USA TODAY

President Obama is still considering the ""zero option"" in Afghanistan -- no U.S. troops there after 2014.

While the two countries have talked about keeping a residual U.S. force in Afghanistan after combat operations end in 2014, The New York Times reports Tuesday that Obama is ""giving serious consideration"" to pulling out all U.S. troops after next year because of frustration over his dealings with Afghanistan counterpart Hamid Karzai.

The latest source of Obama-Karzai friction: New U.S. peace talks with the Taliban.

Administration officials have discussed the possibility of the so-called ""zero option"" in Afghanistan throughout the year.

During a conference call with reporters in January, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said ""we wouldn't rule out any option"" on post-2014 troop levels, including zero.

""The U.S. does not have an inherent objective of 'X' number of troops in Afghanistan,"" Rhodes said at that time.



From The New York Times:

""Mr. Obama is committed to ending America's military involvement in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, and Obama administration officials have been negotiating with Afghan officials about leaving a small 'residual force' behind. But his relationship with Mr. Karzai has been slowly unraveling, and reached a new low after an effort last month by the United States to begin peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.

""Mr. Karzai promptly repudiated the talks and ended negotiations with the United States over the long-term security deal that is needed to keep American forces in Afghanistan after 2014.

""A videoconference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai designed to defuse the tensions ended badly, according to both American and Afghan officials with knowledge of it. Mr. Karzai, according to those sources, accused the United States of trying to negotiate a separate peace with both the Taliban and their backers in Pakistan, leaving Afghanistan's fragile government exposed to its enemies."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/new-york-times-obama-syria_n_3949419.html,2013-09-18 00:00:00,['Senior Media Reporter'],"New York Times Editors, Columnists Met With Obama During Syria Push","NEW YORK -- In his new book, The Message, MSNBC.com editor Richard Wolffe describes how the Obama White House grew frustrated in 2011 with The New York Times after some negative editorials ran in the paper. President Barack Obama ended up calling Andy Rosenthal, the paper’s editorial page editor, and a couple weeks later Rosenthal and the Times editorial board went to the White House for an off-the-record meeting with the president.

But that wasn’t the last time Obama met with Times editorial board members. On Aug. 29, the president again sat down for an off-the-record discussion with Rosenthal and some members of the editorial board, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat also attended, but editors for the paper's news pages did not.

The meeting came amid the White House’s push for military intervention in Syria, one of the topics discussed that day. The Times editorial board hadn't explicitly come out for or against a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad before the meeting, and soon after the paper still expressed concerns about the administration taking action without congressional approval and broad international support.

On Aug. 26, The Times editorial board had stressed that the White House should try exhausting diplomatic efforts before striking Syria. The paper noted that while “Assad’s use of chemical weapons surely requires a response of some kind, the arguments against deep American involvement remain as compelling as ever.”

Two days later, The Times editorial board wrote that more answers were needed from the administration on Syria. ""Obama has yet to spell out how that response would effectively deter further use of chemical weapons,"" the paper said.

On the afternoon of Aug. 30, Secretary of State John Kerry made the case that Syria had used chemical weapons, signaling that U.S. retaliation for crossing a ""red line"" drawn by Obama could be imminent. But the Times still seemed unconvinced that immediate action was the best course.

In an editorial posted online Aug. 30 and in the next day's paper, Times editors wrote that “even in the best of circumstances, military action could go wrong in so many ways; the lack of strong domestic and international support will make it even more difficult.”

The Times also noted that Obama's “approach on Syria now seems wholly at odds with the strong position” he took as a candidate in 2007. Obama had told the Boston Globe at the time that “the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”

On the evening of Aug. 30, Obama reportedly decided to seek congressional approval for a strike during a talk with chief of staff Denis McDonough. He announced his decision publicly the following day.

Rosenthal did not respond to requests for comment about the Aug. 29 meeting and a Times spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of that gathering or the the 2011 meeting reported by Wolffe.

“We did meet with the Obama White House about two years ago and that meeting was off the record,” a Times spokeswoman said. “We met with them again recently under the same restriction, which we intend to honor.”

Throughout his presidency, Obama has held off-the-record meetings with prominent news anchors, columnists and commentators, including Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein, MSNBC host Ed Schultz and Arianna Huffington, president, chair and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group.

But the Obama White House has long seemed particularly interested in getting its point of view across in the Times, and the president has said he reads all the paper's columnists. In April, a former adviser said the Times is the only paper Obama reads.

In his book, Wolffe describes how after each negative Times editorial, ""the president would summon his communications team to discuss the critical coverage."" He also included a 2011 anecdote about the White House communications team wondering whether calling Rosenthal through the Times' directory would lead to an announcement over the paper's general PA system. (It wouldn’t.)

The anecdote is surprising given that Rosenthal has spoken in the past about the Obama White House's efforts to reach out to him.

In March 2009, Rosenthal told this reporter that he had already received “more unsolicited offers for participation from the Obama people in 45 days” than during the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency."

Just as hopes emerge for new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the official Facebook page of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah political party is lauding a convicted terrorist for killing 61 “Zionists” in a series of attacks.

The two sides' perceptions of Abdallah Barghouti, the bomb-making mastermind behind the infamous 2001 Sbarro attack and at least four other suicide bombings, is as good a measure as any for how far apart they are. Arrested in 2003, Barghouti is serving 67 life terms in solitary confinement in an Israeli prison. But to the party that rules the West Bank, Barghouti is a hero.

""The brave prisoner, Abdallah Barghouti, who has the longest [prison] sentence in the history of the Palestinian cause,"" reads the Facebook page, first reported on by Palestinian Media Watch.

Through its social media presence, Fatah glorifies five of the suicide bombings Barghouti organized between 2000 and 2003, including the attack at a Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem that killed 15 people on Aug. 9, 2001.

[pullquote]

The bombings were “self-sacrificing activity” and “martyrdom-seeking operations,” according to the Facebook page.

James Phillips, a Middle East analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said he found the posting to be “extremely troubling” ahead of possible peace talks.

“It’s extremely troubling that Fatah, which is purportedly committed to peace with Israel, continues to not only laud past terrorists, but to incite future terrorist attacks at the same time it’s supposedly negotiating the possibility of talks,” Phillips told FoxNews.com. “This just underscores the questionable commitment to genuine peace by Palestinian organizations that some say are ready for peace.”

The posting, Phillips said, is “one more instance” of confusing, sometimes conflicting messages emanating from Palestine.

“It’s another example of Palestinian leaders saying one thing in English that they know Westerners want to hear and another thing in Arabic to their own followers to continue terrorism against Israel,” he continued.

Officials at the Anti-Defamation League said they could not confirm the Facebook page's connection to Fatah, but said the organization has embraced terrorists and anti-semitism before.

“It is disturbing that some elements within the Fatah organization continue to venerate terrorists and acts of terror against Israeli civilians,"" said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ""We hope that through the peace process the United States will make it clear that, as part of any settlement, Palestinian incitement to terrorism must end.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday that he’ll fast-track legislation allowing him to put any peace deal with the Palestinians to a national referendum. Netanyahu made the remarks three days after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said progress had been made toward a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which were stalled for five years.

Kerry has invited Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington for preliminary talks, though wide gaps remain on the framework of the actual negotiations. Netanyahu said Monday that a referendum is necessary to prevent a rift in Israeli society, particularly among hard-liners in his party and coalition government.

Polls have suggested a majority of Israelis support the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but many groups are vehemently opposed, including those among Israel's West Bank settlers.

""Any agreement that is not approved by the people is not worthy of being signed,"" Netanyahu said in an announcement from Israel's parliament. On an issue as fateful as a peace deal, ""it is desirable that it be presented to every single citizen to decide,"" he said.

Also on Monday, Abbas reiterated that he would also put any peace deal to a referendum. Speaking to the Jordanian daily Al Rai, Abbas warned that ""all options are open"" if Kerry's efforts fail — an apparent attempt to pressure Israel to accept the Palestinian terms for a resumption of talks.

Palestinian officials have said key issues still need to be ironed out before the actual talks can begin, including a freeze on construction in Israeli settlements. They also want Netanyahu to accept Israel’s pre-1967 war lines and to release dozens of longtime Palestinian prisoners.

Netanyahu has so far refused to start border talks from 1967 lines and has also rejected a settlement freeze.

Phillips said he expects any agreement Israel theoretically signs with Palestine is likely to be “torpedoed” by Hamas within days. He said Kerry would be better served to focus his attention on other pressing U.S. foreign affairs matters, including the ongoing crisis in Egypt, the Syrian civil war and the looming confrontation with Iran regarding its nuclear program.

“It’s just not in the cards as long as Hamas has a stranglehold on Gaza,” Phillips said of peace in the region.

More than 200 people have been arrested after thousands of demonstrators clashed in an anti-Vietnam war protest outside the United States embassy in London.

The St John Ambulance Brigade said it treated 86 people for injuries. Fifty were taken to hospital including up to 25 police officers.

The trouble followed a big rally in Trafalgar square, when an estimated 10,000 demonstrated against American action in Vietnam and British support for the United States.

The mood at the rally was described as good humoured. The violence broke out when the protesters marched to the US embassy in Grosvenor Square.

The embassy was surrounded by hundreds of police. They stood shoulder to shoulder to cordon off the part of the square closest to the embassy.

Tensions rose as the crowd refused to back off and mounted officers rode at the demonstrators.

The protesters broke through the police ranks onto the lawn of the embassy, tearing up the plastic fence and uprooting parts of a hedge.

During a protracted battle, stones, earth, firecrackers and smoke bombs were thrown.

One officer was treated for a reported serious spinal injury, another for a neck injury.

One officer had his hat knocked off and was struck continuously on the back of the head with a stick from a banner as he clung, head down, to his horse's neck.

Earlier the actress Vanessa Redgrave was allowed to enter the embassy with three supporters to deliver a protest.

She had been one of the speakers at the rally in Trafalgar Square.

Labour MP Peter Jackson, has said he will be tabling a private question for answer by the Home Secretary about what he called ""police violence"".

He told The Times newspaper: ""I was particularly outraged by the violent use of police horses, who charged into the crowd even after they had cleared the street in front of the embassy."""

Russian law banning adoptions by U.S. citizens was rushed through parliament in December

Tens of thousands of people rallied in central Moscow on Sunday to protest the law

All such adoptions must be approved by a Russian court

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's ombudsman for children's rights sought on Thursday to reassure American would-be adoptive parents that they will be allowed to take their children back to the United States. But some Americans with court rulings in their favor say they're still in legal limbo.

A Russian law banning adoptions by U.S. citizens was rushed through parliament in December, and sped to President Vladimir Putin's desk in less than 10 days in retaliation over a U.S. law calling for sanctions on Russians identified as human-rights violators.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in central Moscow on Sunday to protest the law, which the demonstrators say victimizes children to make a political point.

All such adoptions must be approved by a Russian court, and 52 U.S. families had won such rulings before the ban was enacted. But many of these families have told The Associated Press that authorities in Russia are still refusing to turn over these children.

Children's rights ombudsman Pavel Astakhov said Thursday that Russia would honor the court decisions but did not elaborate on the timeline or say what the families should do now. ""All the children who have been approved to be adopted will be able to leave for the U.S.,"" he said.

Astakhov vehemently defended the new law, saying that it would not be revoked ""however big the protests are.""

Dozens of American families are in legal limbo because of the ban.

Brian and Rebecca Preece and Jeana Bonner, whose adoption of children with Down's syndrome had received court approvals, have been in Moscow for days but officials this week refused to turn over children to them, quoting the new law.

Astakhov on Thursday blamed local officials for the bureaucratic cul-de-sac that's been created and quoted his conversation with them. ""What are you doing?"" he said. ""You're making a scandal. There are court decisions in place — go and enforce them.""

But Brian Preece, who is waiting to adopt a 4-year-old boy, told the AP on Thursday that they have still not received any news from Russian authorities. ""They've been quiet to us,"" he said.

The Russian government says there are 654,000 children without parental custody in Russia and 105,000 of them live in orphanages."

In a brief announcement Monday morning, Kerry appointed former ambassador Martin Indyk as the ""special envoy"" for the new round of Mideast peace negotiations. Keeping a cautiously optimistic tone, Kerry noted that as usual the talks will present both sides with ""difficult choices"" but said the consequences of inaction would be worse.

""It's no secret that this is a difficult process. If it were easy, it would have happened a long time ago,"" he said.

It is unclear whether Kerry will be able to surmount the issue that has vexed so many of his predecessors. The administration tried to jump-start peace talks during President Obama's first term, only to see both sides peel away from the negotiating table.

But Kerry spent much of his first six months as America's top diplomat in frenetic diplomacy trying to get the two sides to agree to resume peace talks that broke down in 2008. Since February, he has made six trips to the region shuttling between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to try to cajole them into returning to negotiations.

Obama, in a written statement, said the resumption of talks is a ""promising step forward, though hard work and hard choices remain ahead.""

Indyk's appointment has been carefully choreographed to come just hours before senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators sit down for a working dinner hosted by Kerry.

Kerry announced on July 19 in Amman, Jordan, that the two sides had reached a basis for returning to the table, but stressed that it still had to be formalized. On Sunday, the State Department announced that the two sides had accepted invitations from Kerry to come to Washington ""to formally resume direct final status negotiations.""

That followed a decision by Israel's Cabinet to free 104 long-held Palestinian prisoners, a longstanding demand of Abbas.

Abbas has been reluctant to negotiate with Netanyahu, fearing the hard-line Israeli leader will reject what the Palestinians consider minimal territorial demands. The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in 1967, but have accepted the principle of limited land swaps to allow Israel to annex some of the dozens of settlements it has built on war-won lands.

Abbas had repeatedly said he will only go to talks if Israel either freezes settlement building or recognizes the 1967 lines as a starting point for drawing the border of a state of Palestine.

Israel has made no such concessions, at least publicly, and the details of the framework for the talks brokered by Kerry remain shrouded in mystery.

Indyk, currently at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, served as former President Bill Clinton's ambassador to Israel and was a key part of the failed 2000 Camp David peace talks. He was also a special assistant to Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1995. And, he served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs in the State Department from 1997 to 2000.

Before working in government, Indyk was founding executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Indyk, 62, replaces David Hale, who had served as a place holder in the post until last month. He had replaced former Sen. George Mitchell as the Obama administration's first special Mideast envoy.

http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-trip-brazil-colombia-could-chilly-072328629.html,,[],"Kerry trip to Brazil, Colombia could be chilly","BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Monday with Colombian officials negotiating with the nation's largest guerrilla army to find peace in the South American country for the first time since 1964.

Kerry is visiting Colombia and Brazil this week in an attempt to build warmer relations with two U.S. allies in Latin America. But the visits may be hindered by resentment after reports about an American spy program that widely targeted data in emails and telephone calls across the region.

Disclosures by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden could chill talks on several fronts. Those include trade, energy, counternarcotics, and even discussions about the Oct. 23 state dinner that President Barack Obama is hosting for Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff.

Kerry arrived late Sunday in Bogota, the Colombian capital. The country is holding peace talks to end a half century-old conflict with the Western Hemisphere's most potent rebel army, a rebel force diminished in strength thanks in considerable measure to U.S. military and intelligence support.

Later Monday, Kerry planned to meet with Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos.

Santos said last week that he wanted clarification from Washington on whether U.S. intelligence-gathering in Colombia had overstepped the countries' joint operations against drug traffickers and illegal armed groups. The U.S. has supplied Colombia with eavesdropping equipment, technicians and aerial surveillance.

Santos said in an interview with The Associated Press that Vice President Joe Biden called him about the issue following revelations by Snowden that U.S digital snooping has targeted allies as well as foes. Santos said Biden offered a series of technical explanations. Asked if he was satisfied with them, Santos replied, ""We are in that process.""

Biden also called Rousseff to express what Brazil's communications minister, Helena Chagas, said was ""his regret over the negative repercussions caused by the disclosures."" Biden invited Brazilian officials to Washington to get details about the spy program.

Story continues

Rousseff told Biden that the privacy of Brazilian citizens and the country's sovereignty cannot be infringed upon in the name of security, and that Brazil wanted the U.S. to change its security policies and practices.

During Kerry's visit, the U.S. wants to show its support for the peace talks between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which are taking place in Cuba. Kerry also will raise the case of Kevin Sutay, a former member of the U.S. Army who is being held by rebels.

Colombia is one of the United States' closest allies in the region, but the reports about the spying program have rankled Colombian officials.

Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported last month that citizens of Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and other countries were among the targets of a massive NSA operation to secretly gather information about phone calls and Internet communications worldwide. The reports were based on information provided by Snowden.

Last week, Brazil's Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota was at the United Nations with counterparts from other South American nations to express their indignation about the spy program to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The Obama administration has worked to forge stronger ties with Latin America. In May, Obama took a three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. Biden has visited Colombia and Brazil, where he said stronger trade ties and closer cooperation in education, science and other fields should usher in a new era of U.S.-Brazil relations this year.

Brazil has received much attention in recent months because of Pope Francis' visit and preparations for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro.

Thousands of demonstrators have staged anti-government protests since June demanding better public services in return for high taxes they pay. Under considerable domestic pressure, Rousseff announced a $4 billion program to improve transportation, sewage and public housing in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city.

The protests have weakened her domestic support, but she can bolster her poll numbers with a strong stand against the U.S. over the spying allegations, said Carl Meacham, former Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

""I think the tone of the visit will be a bit tense because of these issues raised by the surveillance (program) and I think Secretary Kerry will have to speak to that,"" he said.

That assessment was shared by Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue

""I don't think this is going to be a warm 'abrazo,'"" said Shifter, using the Spanish word for ""hug."" ''I think it will be businesslike."""

In More Than Three Decades At The Paper', 'She Has Served As Bureau Chief In Latin America', 'In London']","Alan Gross, former USAID contractor jailed in Cuba, appeals to Obama to intervene","On the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment in Cuba, former U.S. government contractor Alan Gross said he fears his country has “abandoned” him and appealed to President Obama to personally intervene in his case.

In a letter to the president, sent via the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana, Gross describes his isolation from the world, adding that his daughter and mother have been stricken by cancer, his wife has had to sell the family home in Maryland, and “my business and career have been destroyed.”

Indirectly critical of what his family views as lackluster efforts to secure his release, Gross notes that this administration and its predecessors “have taken extraordinary steps to obtain the release of other U.S. citizens imprisoned abroad.” But unlike in those cases, Obama has sent no special emissaries nor agreed to negotiate over him.

The letter, a copy of which was provided to The Washington Post, is to be delivered to the White House on Tuesday — the anniversary of Gross’s 2009 arrest in Havana. It is part of a new strategy by his family to direct pressure at Obama, including in a demonstration Tuesday outside the White House led by his Gross’s wife, Judy.

Gross’s disenchantment with the administration over his treatment is shared by a growing number of U.S. lawmakers, who see him as one of the last victims of the Cold War and the decades-long freeze in U.S.-Cuba relations that has persisted despite Obama’s early pledges to work toward a thaw.

In a letter to the president last month, a bipartisan group of 66 senators, spearheaded by Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), called Gross’s case “a matter of grave urgency” and urged Obama to “act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain his release.” The senators told Obama that they “stand ready to support your administration in pursuit of this worthy goal.”

A week earlier, a separate group of 14 lawmakers, led by Cuban American Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), exhorted Obama to continue his policy of demanding Gross’s “immediate and unconditional release.”

In a statement Monday, Leahy countered that “instead of simply demanding Mr. Gross’ unconditional release — which has achieved nothing in four years, and which his family regards as a death sentence — they should not shrink from the obligation to negotiate for his freedom.”

Gross, a 64-year-old Maryland native, was detained while distributing communications equipment to Jewish groups in Cuba under a contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in 2011 of crimes against the Cuban state and sentenced to 15 years.

His continued imprisonment comes as the administration has eased restrictions on American travel to Cuba and held direct negotiations over a range of issues, including immigration, postal services and cooperation on possible oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida.

Although critical of the Cuban government’s restrictions on civil rights and personal freedom, Obama has indicated that he has little enthusiasm for the trade embargo and economic sanctions imposed on Cuba more than a half-

century ago.

“The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel doesn’t make sense,” he said at a Miami fundraiser last month. “We have to find new mechanisms and new tools.”

But Cuban American lawmakers have consistently opposed negotiating with the island’s communist government. Although public opinion in that community has begun to shift away from a hard line on Cuba, any high-level talks remain politically dicey for Obama.

Progress on the Gross case also has been stymied by Havana’s demands for the release of five Cubans arrested in Florida in 1998 and given lengthy prison sentences after being found guilty of acting as Cuban agents. Havana has acknowledged that the five were spying on Cuban exile organizations and U.S. military installations but said the surveillance was part of an attempt to prevent what had been a series of exile-

organized attacks on the island.

One of the five was paroled in 2011 and returned to Cuba. A second is eligible for parole in February. Being a Cuban national, the “greatest likelihood is that he would be deported almost immediately,” said a U.S. official who was familiar with the case.

The official, who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there is some hope within the administration that the anticipated release could bring progress on the Gross front.

Gross’s attorney, Scott Gilbert, said in an interview that the Cubans “have made very clear to the United States, and to us directly to pass on, that they’re willing to sit down and meet with no preconditions to discuss Alan’s release.”

Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said, “Some very senior people in this administration have put their minds and attention on trying to get Alan Gross out of prison, as well as some senior members of Congress. In the end, it is up to the Cubans, and they have not been responsive.”

“We continue to urge the Cuban government to release him immediately,” she said.

In his letter to Obama, Gross wrote: “I find myself asking the same question — why? Why am I still here? With the utmost respect, Mr. President, I fear that my government — the very government I was serving when I began this nightmare — has abandoned me.”

A November lawsuit filed by Gross and his wife in federal court was dismissed this year. They sought to hold USAID and his employer, Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc., “accountable for their role in Mr. Gross’ detention and imprisonment, including their abject failure to advise, train and protect him.”

At the time of his arrest, Gross was on his fifth trip to Cuba, where he had been subcontracted to secretly distribute Internet equipment to the island’s small Jewish community under a U.S. democracy-­building program. Although the Internet is now available to Cuban citizens on a limited basis, it was prohibited at the time for all but government-sanctioned officials and individuals.

The suit contended that Gross, who does not speak Spanish, was not informed of the possible danger of the mission and was left poorly prepared."

But it appears to have done little to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, curb illegal Jewish settlement-building or craft a unified strategy to keep nuclear weapons out of Iranian hands.

It was a diplomatic mission with a strikingly unambitious agenda, Middle East experts say, and one that failed to exceed low expectations.

Obama’s prods to Israelis and Palestinians to abandon intransigent positions blocking the path to peace were so gentle as to have passed almost unnoticed. He appealed to young Israelis to “put yourself in their shoes” and acknowledge that Palestinians live in repressive occupation with no state of their own. To the Palestinians who have refused to resume peace talks while the Israeli government bulldozes forward with its construct-and-conquer housing strategy, Obama chided that “there is no point for negotiations” if they insist on resolving what divides them as a precondition for returning to the table.

PHOTOS: President Obama’s first trip to Israel

Most worrisome, say those who monitor the volatile region, was a sense that the Obama administration was simply checking off a neglected foreign policy matter from its second-term to-do list. Having tried, however feebly, to break the stalemate in pursuit of a two-state solution to end decades of conflict, the White House can now pass off the task to Secretary of State John F. Kerry and return its attention to the mountain of domestic challenges.

Obama’s popularity among Israelis has plumbed new depths for an American president since his 2009 visit to Cairo, a gesture aimed at opening a fresh chapter in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Israeli polls show a meager 10% approval rating for the U.S. president.

Political conservatives who dominate the Israeli government see Obama as reluctant to back immediate and credible threats of punitive airstrikes against Iran if the Persian state continues to pursue nuclear weapons capabilities. And Netanyahu’s obvious preference for Republican Mitt Romney in last year’s presidential election did little to dispel the impression that neither leader cares much for the other.

Carefully scripted appearances in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem allowed Obama to recast himself as emissary of Israel’s closest political friend. He and Netanyahu traded jovial one-liners in the presence of media microphones and were pointedly seen putting their heads together for a serious chat during Wednesday night’s state dinner. Beyond the atmospherics, though, the two-day visit left little changed.

“If there was any clear message, it was that peace is not going to be achieved by this generation of Israeli leaders,” said George Bisharat, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and senior scholar at the Institute for Palestine Studies think tank.

Obama chose to direct his one impassioned appeal for peace and justice to university students on Thursday, signaling that he has given up on the prospects for progress with Netanyahu and his newly installed coalition dominated by hard-liners, Bisharat said.

Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in territory seized from Palestinians during the 1967 Middle East War has accelerated to the point where there is no hope of creating a viable Palestinian state, Bisharat said. Despite the U.S. leader’s visit, he added, “there is nothing on the political horizon that promises to slow the Israeli colonizing juggernaut.”

Obama’s appeal to Israelis to respect Palestinian rights to self-determination, freedom of movement and pursuit of a prosperous life “might have somewhat heartened” the Palestinians, Bisharat said. But he expressed dismay at Obama’s reference to a two-state solution in which Israel would be for the Jews and Palestine for the Muslims, calling it “the equivalent of declaring support for a white South Africa” in the era of apartheid.

Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of the Jewish Voice for Peace group that promotes democracy, justice and human rights for all in Israel, was likewise disappointed, though not surprised, by the visit’s failure to convey that many American Jews are opposed to the hard-line rhetoric and divisive policies thwarting a negotiated peace.

“There were no new initiatives unveiled, no next step to come out of it. I felt like he was just checking off a box,” said Vilkomerson of the visit, which she likened to “Kabuki theater.”

Those opposed to the “extremist agenda” of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that dominates the shaping of U.S. policy on Israel have despaired of seeing Washington take the initiative in fostering peace, she said.

“The European Union is starting to lead on this issue, with the rise of the BDS approach, the Palestinian call for an anti-apartheid movement in the South African model,” Vilkomerson said, referring to the Boycotts-Divestment-Sanctions strategy aimed at punishing Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands.

Hopefully, she added, pressure will mount on Washington to use its clout with Israel to rekindle the peace process, “but I don’t think it will happen in this administration.”

“He’s not even trying to move the ball. This visit is an investment, a restoration, a reset” of stilted U.S.-Israeli relations, said Robert Danin, senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“Obama is not at a stage where he is going to roll up his sleeves and do it himself to get things going, he’s not going to expend the political capital that would take,” Danin said, referring to the congressional gridlock and pressing economic matters awaiting his return home.

“This visit has a going-through-the-motions quality to it,” Danin said. “It’s like campaigning -- he hates it but it’s got to be done.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department on Thursday warned Americans not to travel to Pakistan and ordered non-essential government personnel to leave the U.S. Consulate in Lahore because of a specific threat to that diplomatic mission.

In a travel warning, the State Department said the presence of several foreign and indigenous terrorist groups posed a potential danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan.

The personnel drawdown at the Lahore consulate was a precautionary measure and wasn't related to the recent closures of numerous U.S. diplomatic missions in the Muslim world, two U.S. officials said. The consulate in Lahore was scheduled to be closed for the Eid holiday from Thursday through Sunday and no reopening had been scheduled, one of the officials said.

The officials were not authorized to discuss the order by name and requested anonymity.

A spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Meghan Gregonis, said, ""We received information regarding a threat to the consulate. As a precautionary measure, we are undertaking a drawdown of all except emergency personnel.""

The U.S. is evacuating staff to Islamabad, said Gregonis. Emergency personnel will stay in Lahore and the embassy officials do not know when the consulate in Lahore will reopen. The U.S. will continue to evaluate the threat reporting.

Gregonis said the threat was specific to Lahore.

Earlier this week, 19 U.S. diplomatic outposts in 16 countries in the Middle East and Africa were closed to the public through Saturday and non-essential personnel were evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Yemen after U.S. intelligence officials said they had intercepted a recent message from al-Qaeda's top leader about plans for a major terror attack.

None of the consulates in Pakistan nor the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad was affected by the earlier closures."

The report by Iranian media recalled for many the early days of space flight, when both the United States and the Soviet Union launched animal-bearing spacecraft as a prelude to human space travel.

But State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington on Monday that the reported mission raises concerns about possible Iranian violations of a United Nations ban on development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

“If they have launched anything using ballistic missile technology, it’s of serious concern,” Nuland said.

There was no immediate comment from Tehran, which for some years has had a space exploration and satellite-launching program.

The West and Iran are at odds over Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran says is strictly for peaceful uses, such as generation of energy and creation of cancer-treating isotopes. U.S. and Israeli officials suspect Iran wants to produce nuclear weapons.

Nuland said she could not confirm if the Iranian reports of successfully sending a primate into the atmosphere were true. “I saw the pictures of the poor little monkey preparing to go to space,” Nuland said.

[Updated 9:40 a.m. Jan. 29: Animal activists were also upset with the launch.

“We are appalled by photos of a visibly terrified monkey crudely strapped into a restraint device in which he was allegedly launched into space,” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said in a statement, calling Tehran’s action a throwback to the “cruelest days” of space exploration. “Monkeys are highly intelligent and sensitive animals who not only are traumatized by the violence and noise of a launch and landing but also suffer when caged in a laboratory before and — if they survive — after a flight.”]

Iran said its spacecraft — dubbed Pishgam, or Pioneer — was launched Sunday and took the primate-bearing capsule to a height of 72 miles, before the craft returned to Earth.

In a clip from Press TV, Iran’s English-language service, a helicopter is seen apparently bringing the space capsule back to a site in central Iran where cheering scientists awaited its return. In footage shown on Iranian television, ecstatic scientists hugged each other and shouted, “Long live Iran!”

The Iranian press carried several photos and video clips of the monkey. In one shot, it is seen in the arms of a glove-wearing scientist, apparently after returning to Earth. In another, it is seen strapped into a car seat-like contraption, evidently designed for the trip aloft. The animal is also seen swaddled in a green blanket and seemingly befuddled about all the attention.

Iranian officials lauded the flight as a bringing the nation closer to human space travel.

“Sending a spacecraft and returning it is a first step toward sending humans to space in later stages,” Iran’s defense minister, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, told Press TV.

The space-bound monkey was placed in a sealed capsule equipped with machinery to produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, Iranian Space Agency Director Hamid Fazeli told Press TV.

“This kind of monkey’s physiology is very similar to humans,” Fazeli noted, without identifying what species of money was recruited for the mission. “We are [using] this monkey to test life support systems and flight conditions.”

The animal’s vital signs were to be monitored and transmitted to Earth, the Iranian space chief said, while cameras inside the cabin recorded the event.

Almost two years ago, Iranian press reports noted, Iran sent a “bio-capsule” containing a turtle, a mouse, worms and live bacteria into the heavens and successfully returned the menagerie back to Earth alive.

For all the global attention, and controversy, the simian sojourn did not create a lot of buzz inside Iran, where the ongoing economic crisis is the nation’s major preoccupation.

“It is something to be proud of,” agreed Sohrab Ahmadi, a technology student, who voiced the hope that such projects could create more jobs in science. He said he was in favor of “any way we can get financial help in this field from government.”

Less impressed was Salar Mirzaei, a chemistry engineering student. “For me,” Mirzaei said, “economic achievement and ... increasing purchasing power is more important than sending monkeys into space.”

Or that military action, in some way, will assist in solving them. This is the great problem in American foreign policy. American policymakers conclude much too often that foreign affairs should be conducted with military force as the cornerstone and backbone of policymaking.

This manner of doing business with the world, with American weaponry at the forefront, limits creative decision making and forces us into increasingly costly and ineffective options. We discount or ignore other non-lethal yet aggressive tools like subterfuge, secret diplomacy, bribery, and deception. We fail to deploy some of our greatest social assets in conducting foreign affairs, such as the appeal of our popular culture, our technological ingenuity, or business acumen. We fail to think of how to creatively deploy the full arsenal of American soft power, while relying too much, too often on the hard. Into the vacuum steps others, whose power to persuade seems to go further and prove more enduring than our power to kill.

I always think of Fadl Shaker. Fadl Shaker, if you don't know him, was one of the biggest pop singers in the Middle East. Huge number of hits, millions of records sold. A dozen hit albums. Influential to young men and women from Rabat to Baghdad. Especially women. Fadl is a handsome crooner, with a buttery voice that sang of love and lust. Fadl would have been just the sort of person America would have been well to contact. The kind of influential person who could have been invited to the United States and strategically placed in some silly romantic comedy alongside some Hollywood starlet or whatever. But we didn't get to him. One of the Sunni militant sheikhs, Ahmed al-Azeer, did. Fadl is now a militant Salafist soldier. Al-Azeer has called for Jihad in Syria against the Shia and Christians. Fadl is now singing about doing just that. I can imagine, not long after we have bombed something fierce, that he will be singing about a similar Jihad against America.

There are occasions where the strategic use of military force can have a positive effect on self-defense or defense of allies. Our long-standing military deployment in Germany, for example, backing up the NATO treaty alliance has created a long stretch of almost unheard-of peace in Western Europe. But there is a good argument to be made that the Marshall Plan, perhaps the most shining example of the effective use of American soft-power, was even more effective than establishing permanent bases in the heart of Europe.

The United States can't expect to solve every problem in the world, be it genocide or civil war or terrorism, solely through the dangerous and unpredictable nature of war. Not that there isn't a place for war. In self-defense or in defense of treaty allies, war is the only solution to a military attack. This is the primary reason we have a military force, to do what what it is trained to do: protect and defend territory. Not to conduct foreign policy."

Gordon'],Aim of U.S. Attack: Restore a ‘Red Line’ That Became Blurred,"WASHINGTON — The goal of the cruise missile strikes the United States is planning to carry out in Syria is to restore the smudged “red line” that President Obama drew a year ago against the use of poison gas.

If carried out effectively, the strikes may also send a signal to Iran that the White House is prepared to back up its words, no small consideration for an administration that has proclaimed that the use of military force remains an option if the leadership in Iran insists on fielding a nuclear weapon.

But the military strategy that the Obama administration is considering is not linked to its larger diplomatic strategy of persuading President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to yield power and support negotiations that would end the bloody civil war.

Even if the American-led attack includes allied aircraft, the options that appear to be under consideration by Mr. Obama for Syria — one or two days of cruise missile strikes from at least four United States Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea — would not amount to the sort of open-ended campaign that might compel Mr. Assad to negotiate a transfer to a transitional government."

It's possible. At next month's NATO summit here, Afghan President Hamid Karzai and global leaders will discuss an exit strategy for foreign troops fighting the Taliban, a task no doubt complicated by the news last week that U.S. soldiers posed for photos with dead insurgents. The war, which began after the Sept. 11 attacks, will soon become the longest in U.S. history. Here are 10 facts onAfghanistan's war:

1 The U.S. has authorized $557 billion to fund the war in Afghanistan — enough for every man, woman and child in Chicago to buy 20 iPads, 30 Kindle Fires, Bulls season tickets, a campaign fundraiser photo with Michelle Obama and dinner at Alinea every night for a year.

2 CIA operatives have occasionally offered Viagra to elderly tribal chieftains to secure their cooperation.

3 Very little is known about the elusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar — except that he has one eye. According to Abdul Salam Zaeef, a former high-ranking member of the Taliban, Omar lost his eye fighting the Soviets in vicious, hand-to-hand street fighting in the 1980s. Zaeef wrote that the next day, Omar had to be persuaded to get treatment rather than continue the fight.

4 The story of Pat Tillman, who quit a $3.6 million NFL contract to join the U.S. Army, was often obscured after his death in Afghanistan. The military covered up the fact that he died from friendly fire, and speakers at his memorial service invoked the deity even though Tillman was either an agnostic or atheist and had requested no chaplain at his funeral. Also little publicized after his death was the fact that he was opposed to the war in Iraq. Writing about Iraq in his diary, he declared that ""we have little or no justification other than our imperial whim.""

5 More than four dozen countries have committed troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. But while the United States has deployed 90,000 service personnel in ISAF, others are less invested: Austria has kicked in 3 troops, compared withIceland's4,Ireland's7,Luxembourg's11 andEl Salvador's24.

6 Afghanistan lost two popular leaders at a crucial time. Two days before the Sept. 11 attacks, anti-Taliban guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud was killed by assassins posing as journalists. Sept. 9 is a now Massoud Day, a national holiday in Afghanistan. Seven weeks after Massoud's death, another admired leader, Abdul Haq, was captured and executed by the Taliban after riding into the country on horseback to lead a popular revolt without U.S. support.

7 A ""jingle truck"" or a ""jingly"" is a vehicle used by Afghans to deliver goods to Western troops. Often brightly painted, they have trinkets or tassels hung from the truck frame so that they jingle. Some troops also use the term ""jinglies"" to refer to the Afghans themselves.

Speaking at a news conference, he said that the United States would defend its South Korean and Japanese allies if there was conflict, that the international community would never accept the North as a nuclear weapons state, and that Washington was willing to resume long-stalled negotiations but only if the North Koreans agreed to move seriously on denuclearization.

But the window into North Korea’s nuclear intentions and American policy in response was as blurry as ever. The Defense Intelligence Agency rang alarms bells on Thursday with a report that it had concluded with “moderate confidence” that the North was capable of launching a missile with a nuclear warhead. Mr. Kerry and other officials later dismissed the report as premature.

On Friday, in a background briefing for journalists, a senior American official played down an expected North Korean missile test, saying it might provide the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, with an “off ramp” to save face and de-escalate tensions. Hours later, Mr. Kerry used a news conference to warn Mr. Kim not to proceed with the test in an “already volatile, potentially dangerous situation,” saying Mr. Kim “needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be.”

In that climate, Mr. Kerry’s reaffirmation of American interest in negotiations could get lost, especially since he put the responsibility on the North to act first, by seriously committing to denuclearize, and seemed inclined to let South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, move ahead first on her call for dialogue with North Korea."

http://news.yahoo.com/congress-split-cutting-off-aid-egypt-162943396.html,,[],Congress split on cutting off aid to Egypt,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of Congress are split over whether the U.S. should cut off military aid to Egypt, highlighting the difficult choices facing the Obama administration amid spiraling violence on the streets of an important Middle East ally.

Democratic leaders have generally supported the president's approach. But on Sunday, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said he would end aid to Egypt. Ellison is the first Muslim elected to Congress and is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

""I would cut off aid but engage in intense diplomacy in Egypt and in the region to try to say, look, we will restore aid when you stop the bloodshed in the street and set up a path towards democracy that you were on before,"" Ellison said. ""In my mind, there's no way to say that this was not a coup. It is. We should say so. And then follow our own law, which says we cannot fund the coup leaders.""

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said funding for Egypt remains under review.

""As we've made clear, all of our assistance to Egypt is currently under review, and we will consider additional steps as we deem necessary,"" Hayden said. ""At this point, no additional decisions have been made regarding assistance. That review process is ongoing.""

Among Republicans, there were growing calls to eliminate military aid to Egypt. But others were more hesitant.

Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., said curtailing aid could reduce U.S. influence over Egypt's interim government, which controls access to strategic resources, including the Suez Canal.

""We certainly shouldn't cut off all aid,"" said King, who chairs the House panel on counterterrorism and intelligence.

King said there are no good choices in Egypt. Ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was democratically elected. But, King said, the group has not demonstrated a commitment to democracy.

""The fact is, there's no good guys there,"" King said. ""But of the two, I think there is more opportunity to protect American interests if we work with the military and continue our relationship with the military.""

Story continues

The split among members of the same political party illustrates the uncertainty facing President Barack Obama as he tries to navigate volatile developments in Egypt, where crackdowns last week left more than 600 people dead and thousands more injured.

Obama has denounced the violence, canceled joint military exercises scheduled for September and delayed the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets. But the White House has refused to declare Morsi's removal a coup — a step that would require Obama to suspend $1.3 billion in annual military aid. The president insists that the U.S. stands with Egyptians seeking a democratic government. But he says America cannot determine Egypt's future.

Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call Sunday to stop aid as the Egyptian military continues to crack down on protesters seeking Morsi's return.

""For us to sit by and watch this happen is a violation of everything that we stood for,"" said the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""We're not sticking with our values.""

The military ousted Morsi July 3 after millions of Egyptians took to the streets to demand he step down, accusing him of giving the Brotherhood undue influence and failing to implement vital reforms or bolster the ailing economy.

But Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he supports the president's approach.

""These are very, very difficult choices,"" said Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I'm very unhappy, obviously, with the crackdown. But we essentially have two choices in Egypt. And that's a military government, which hopefully will transition as quickly as possible to civilian government, or the Muslim Brotherhood. I don't think the Muslim Brotherhood is a choice.""

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Congress should give the president flexibility in dealing with Egypt.

""I do believe we have to change our aid,"" said Reed, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I think also we have to have included in the legislation a national security waiver, because we have to give the president not only the responsibility to deal with the government of Egypt but also flexibility.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said U.S. aid to Egypt was more likely to ""buy a chateau in Paris"" for an Egyptian military leader than ""bread in Cairo"" for the poor.

""I don't think we're buying any friendship with the Egyptian people,"" Paul said, especially when people see tanks supplied by the U.S. to the Egyptian military on the streets of Cairo.

""We are not winning the hearts and minds of the Egyptian people,"" said Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""The aid has to end.""

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., had resisted calls to cut off aid. But on Sunday, he switched positions.

""I think we need to look at the tiers of our aid,"" said Corker, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Let's face it, most of the aid has gone out the door this year.""

Corker said he expects Congress to debate next year's aid this fall, after lawmakers return from their summer recess.

""Look, I condemn what's happened with the military, but I also condemn what in essence was a political coup by the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Corker said. ""And we need to move this debate along and this fall, hopefully, again, focus on what is our national interests. And there still are things within Egypt that are very much in our national interest. And we need to keep the lines of communication open.""

McCain spoke on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" King and Paul made their comments on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Reed spoke on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and Engel, Ellison and Corker appeared on ABC's ""This Week.""

The United States has supplied humanitarian aid and diplomatic pressure. But our reluctance to arm the rebels or defend the civilians being slaughtered in their homes has convinced the Assad regime (and the world) that we are not serious. Our fear that arms supplied to the rebels would fall into the hands of jihadis has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because instead of dealing directly with the rebels we left the arming to fundamentalist monarchies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and they are predictably using lethal aid to appease the more radical Islamists.

It might have been easier to intervene a year ago, before the opposition was so fragmented. But back then the president was busy ending foreign engagements and in no mood to start a new one. Besides, everyone was preoccupied by the dramas of Iran’s nuclear program, Egypt’s revolution and Ohio’s electoral votes. Since then, Assad has been sly about escalating his savagery by degrees — artillery, then aerial bombardment, then Scud missiles and now, apparently, chemical weapons — while staying just below whatever threshold of horror might shame us into responding.

What you hear from the Obama team is that we know way too little about the internal dynamics of Syria, so we can’t predict how an intervention will play out, except that there is no happy ending; that while the deaths of 70,000 Syrians are tragic, that’s what happens in a civil war; that no one in the opposition can be trusted; and, most important, that we have no vital national interest there. Obama conceded that the use of poison gas would raise the stakes, because we cannot let the world think we tolerate spraying civilians with nerve gas. But even there, the president says he would feel obliged to respond to “systematic” use of chemical weapons, as if something less — incremental use? sporadic use? — would be O.K. This sounds like a president looking for excuses to stand pat.

In contemplating Syria, it is useful to consider the ways it is not Iraq.

First, we have a genuine, imperiled national interest, not just a fabricated one. A failed Syria creates another haven for terrorists, a danger to neighbors who are all American allies, and the threat of metastasizing Sunni-Shiite sectarian war across a volatile and vital region. “We cannot tolerate a Somalia next door to Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey,” said Vali Nasr, who since leaving the Obama foreign-policy team in 2011 has become one of its most incisive critics. Nor, he adds, can we afford to let the Iranians, the North Koreans and the Chinese conclude from our attitude that we are turning inward, becoming, as the title of Nasr’s new book puts it, “The Dispensable Nation.”"

Syrian National Coalition%27s stand is in direct conflict with the peace talks push by the U.S.

Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Syrian government to attend the proposed peace talks

Iran%2C a chief ally of Syria%27s Bashar Assad regime%2C may attend the negotiations

ISTANBUL — The Syrian opposition said Wednesday it welcomes the promise of increased U.S. involvement in finding a solution to two years of war, but that it would not accept peace talks if top members of the regime of Bashar Assad are involved.

The stand of the country's leading opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, is in direct conflict with the peace talks that the Obama administration are seeking to help organize next month in Geneva.

Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Syrian government Wednesday to attend the proposed peace talks that would also include Russia, a chief patron of Syria that has refused to support rebel demands that Assad be forced out in return for peace.

""We hope the U.S. will lead the international role to solving the conflict,"" said Khaled Saleh, spokesman for the Syria National Coalition. ""The coalition welcomes any solution as long as it meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people but it must start with the departure of Assad.""

Saleh repeated that the rebellion needs the United States and other Western nations to impose a no-fly zone over Syria to stop Assad's warplanes as well as strategic military strikes on government positions. Kerry on Wednesday threatened to give non-lethal aid, such as medical kits and food, to the rebels if Assad did not join talks.

The back-and-forth seems to indicate that Kerry's endeavor on behalf of President Obama will satisfy none of the principals involved in the conflict. Kerry met with Arab leaders in Jordan on Wednesday to win backers for the peace talks.

The finer details of the proposed Geneva talks have yet to be ironed out while the presence of Iran, a chief ally of the Assad regime, has not been ruled out. Speaking in Cairo, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations-Arab League mediator, said that both the opposition and regime are preparing to take part in the conference.

Diplomacy has so far failed to stop the violence in a conflict the United Nations says has cost the lives of more than 80,000 people and forced more than 1 million to flee Syria's borders. SNC members will gather in Istanbul on Thursday for a three-day meeting to elect a president and decide if it will attend the Geneva conference.

Speaking with USA TODAY last week, interim SNC President George Sabra said he held little hope for the joint U.S.-Russian diplomatic effort and would not commit to attending talks before seeing who would be invited from the regime's side. Russia has made statements that Assad's regime was overreaching in its attempts to stay intact, but it has not said it would seek to force the leader out.

""Assad is threatening the entire region as we've seen in Turkey and Lebanon recently and I think Russia is starting to recognize it is making a mistake,"" Saleh said. The (Geneva) conference is an example of that.""

Analysts said the call for talks represents a change in U.S. policy by not insisting that Assad agree to vacate his position immediately.

""The goal of the U.S. is to help bring about a solution by bringing the regime and the opposition together,"" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ""This is a major shift — the U.S. no longer insisting on Assad's departure as a precondition to talks.""

""It's important because what John Kerry is trying to do now is to convince America's regional allies and the allies of the opposition, in particular Turkey and Qatar, to at least convene in Geneva and to convince the political opposition to take it seriously and form a negotiating team to go to Geneva,"" he said. ""The U.S. is acting now because it's afraid that war could expand into regional war."""

Syria is not the only Saudi grievance against the Obama administration. With Egypt, the Saudis were angry that Washington turned on its longtime ally, President Hosni Mubarak, and accepted the election of an Islamist, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudis were again upset that the United States suspended some aid after the military overthrew Mr. Morsi in July.

While Washington may have felt it had no choice but to support the millions who poured into the street calling for Mr. Mubarak’s ouster and to show some displeasure with a military takeover, the Saudis saw the United States as having let down an ally in support of the Islamists, twice.

The Saudis also feel slighted by Washington’s seeming eagerness to reach a nuclear deal with Iran — negotiations they feel they should be a part of. Iran is Saudi Arabia’s nemesis in the region, and the Saudis are worried that Washington is again being naïve in trusting that Iran will offer a sincere and verifiable compromise with its nuclear program.

But Syria has been a special concern for Saudi Arabia’s monarch, King Abdullah, Saudi officials say, for two reasons. He feels responsible for halting the wide-scale killing of his fellow Sunni Muslims. And Syria has become the most important battleground, in Saudi eyes, for the perennial conflict with Iran, which is seen here as almost an existential threat to the kingdom because of its goal of exporting its own brand of revolutionary Shiite Islam across the Muslim world.

“Saudi Arabia cannot afford to be encircled by Iran, from Iraq and Syria. That is out of the question,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, a political sociology professor at King Saud University who has called for Saudi Arabia to become less dependent on the United States.

The Saudis were initially reluctant to provide military support to the rebels in Syria after the uprising turned into an armed opposition movement in 2011. The interior minister, Muhammad bin Nayef, was against it, and cited the concern that money and arms could flow to jihadists, according to a Western diplomat who spoke with him at the time.

The Saudis began funneling arms to the rebels in 2012, but provided light weapons only, largely out of concern that heavier weapons could get into the hands of jihadists. They mostly worked through middlemen, including Lebanese political figures who had long been part of their patronage network. But that approach hampered their effectiveness, with much of the money landing in foreign bank accounts instead of buying weapons for the rebels."

(CNN) —

Facing the threat of U.S. military action, Syria said Monday that it welcomes a Russian proposal to hand over its stockpiles of chemical weapons.

The United States has accused Syria’s government of using those weapons in an August 21 attack outside Damascus, a strike Washington says killed more than 1,400 people. Syria denies the accusation and says its own troops have faced poison gas attacks by rebel forces in the civil war that began in 2011.

Here’s a quick look at what Syria is believed to have and what may be involved in its elimination.

What’s in Syria’s arsenal?

• International observers believe that Syria has both blister agents such as mustard gas, which inflicted horrific casualties in World War I, and the nerve gases sarin and VX, which cause convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure.

• Syria confirmed its possession of some unconventional weapons capability in 2012 but provided no details.

• U.S. intelligence believes that Syria has about 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, most of it sarin and VX stored as unmixed components, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday. But it also includes finished mustard gas, rockets and shells filled with sarin and “other things I can’t go into here,” Kerry told the House Armed Services Committee.

What do those weapons do?

• Mustard gas, also known as sulfur mustard, inflicts chemical burns on the skin, eyes and lungs. While mustard gas can be fatal, it also can disable victims and can cause cancer or permanent blindness. It can also remain in the environment for days or even weeks, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

• Sarin, which is suspected in the August 21 attack that triggered the current crisis, evaporates quickly, mixes easily with water and can contaminate food, water and clothing, according to the CDC.

• VX is considered the most toxic nerve agent and poisons more easily through skin contact than sarin, the CDC says. It evaporates very slowly, at about the same rate as motor oil. Like sarin, it can be emitted from clothing for up to half an hour after exposure.

How much does Syria have?

• Before the war began in 2011, Syria had research and production facilities near Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Latakia and Hama that turned out hundreds of tons of chemical agents a year, according to the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which catalogs the world’s arsenals of weapons of mass destruction.

• Syria could deliver chemical agents through a variety of ammunition, such as bombs dropped from aircraft, Scud surface-to-surface missiles, artillery shells or rockets, according to Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Didn’t everyone ban this stuff?

• Syria has never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, the current international treaty against the use of poison gas. But it did sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical and bacteriological warfare, according to the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. That pact forbids both the first use and retaliatory use of chemical or biological weapons against other countries.

• The organization, which monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, says Syria has ignored several attempts to get it to sign the current treaty. Experts from the agency were part of the U.N. team that collected evidence from the site of the August 21 attack.

How would a weapons transfer work?

• The Russian proposal is in its infancy, and Washington immediately expressed skepticism about the idea. But when Libya renounced its chemical weapons program in 2004, it declared what it had to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; the agency sent its own inspectors to Libya to verify the declaration, and then Libya’s production plants were dismantled and its stockpiles began to be destroyed.

• Two weapons plants were torn down and a third was turned into a pharmaceutical factory before the revolution that toppled longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. More than half of its 24 tons of mustard gas and about 40% of its precursor chemicals had been destroyed before the revolution halted that work, which remains incomplete.

• But the process could be far more dangerous in the middle of an armed conflict like Syria’s, former U.N. and U.S. weapons inspector David Kay said. “Doing this in peacetime is difficult. Doing this in the middle of a war may be impossible,” he said.

• Moving stocks of chemical weapons is dangerous, and other countries may not be willing to take in the agents, Kay added. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq’s chemical weapons stockpiles had to be destroyed there because no company wanted to receive them: “I suspect that’s what you would have to do in Syria,” he said.

• “Dissuade yourself from the idea that you’re going to move these chemical weapons to someplace outside of Syria. That’s probably the least safe thing to do. And where would you move them?” Kay asked.

• And there’s still the question of whether any disclosure is complete. After Gadhafi’s fall, Libya’s new government reported finding more mustard gas and artillery shells capable of launching it, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says.

PRETORIA, South Africa – President Obama met privately Saturday with relatives of former South African president Nelson Mandela, the 94-year-old anti-apartheid icon who has been hospitalized more than three weeks with a lung infection.

In a statement released by the White House, Obama referred to Mandela as ""Madiba,"" which is Mandela's tribal name.

""I expressed my hope that Madiba draws peace and comfort from the time that he is spending with loved ones, and also expressed my heartfelt support for the entire family as they work through this difficult time,"" Obama said. ""I also reaffirmed the profound impact that his legacy has had in building a free South Africa, and in inspiring people around the world — including me.

Obama met with Mandela's daughters Makaziwe (Maki) Mandela and Zindzi Mandela Hlongwane and eight of his grandchildren at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg on Obama's first day in South Africa after arriving from Senegal.

Obama did not meet with Mandela, but told reporters on the flight to South Africa that he was grateful that he, his wife and daughters had a chance to meet Mandela previously, the Associated Press reported. Obama has a photo of the introduction he had to Mandela in 2005 in his office at the White House; it was their only meeting, when Obama was a senator. He calls Mandela a ""personal hero.""

""If and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages,"" Obama said Thursday.

Some were disappointed Obama and Mandela wouldn't be meeting again.

""I think (Mandela) wants to see the black (American president),"" said Alac Mojela, 45, a chauffeur in Pretoria. ""Before he can leave this world, he must say something to Obama.""

Meanwhile, outside the hospital, South Africans held prayer vigils, left gifts and waited for news of Mandela condition, which his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had showed ""great improvement"" compared with a few days ago.

Obama on Saturday called on the continent's leaders, including in neighboring Zimbabwe, to take stock of Mandela's willingness to step down after one term despite his immense popularity.

""We as leaders occupy these spaces temporarily and we don't get so deluded that we think the fate of our country doesn't depend on how long we stay in office,"" Obama said during a news conference.

South African President Jacob Zuma said Obama and Mandela ""both carry the dreams of millions of people in Africa and in the diaspora who were previously oppressed.""

Obama, Zuma and other dignitaries held a moment of silence for Mandela during a dinner Saturday night.

In a video made in captivity and released by As-Sahab, the media arm of al-Qaeda, Warren Weinstein urges the Obama administration to negotiate for his release. (As-Sahab)

A U.S. government contractor kidnapped by al-Qaeda militants in Pakistan in 2011 has recorded a video message calling on the Obama administration to negotiate with his captors, saying he feels “totally abandoned and forgotten.”

Warren Weinstein looked ashen and sounded lethargic as he pleaded for renewed interest in his case and asked the U.S. government to consider releasing

al-Qaeda militants in its custody. The 72-year-old development expert from Rockville, Md., began his address by urging President Obama to step up efforts to get him released.

“You are now in your second term as president of the United States and that means that you can take hard decisions without worrying about reelection,” said Weinstein, who was recorded sitting against a white wall wearing a gray tracksuit top and a black woolen hat. No one else appeared in the video.

The video, which included the yellow logo of As-Sahab, al-Qaeda’s media production outlet, was sent in an anonymous e-mail to several journalists who have reported from Afghanistan. Included were links to a handwritten note that purports to be from Weinstein, saying “Letter to Media” at the top. The note is dated Oct. 3. It is not clear when the video was made.

A State Department spokeswoman and a member of Weinstein’s family said Wednesday night that they had not independently received the note or video. The Washington Post provided a copy to both of them.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf later said that U.S. officials were “working hard to authenticate” the contents of the message.

“We reiterate our call that Warren Weinstein be released and returned to his family,” she said in a statement. “Particularly during this holiday season — another one away from his family — our hopes and prayers are with him and those who love and miss him.”

Al-Qaeda leader Ayman

al-Zawahri said in a statement issued in December 2011 that Weinstein would be freed if Washington stopped launching air strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. He also demanded the release of all imprisoned members of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The following year, Zawahri urged followers to kidnap Westerners to gain more leverage in al-Qaeda’s bid to get prominent jihadists freed from U.S. custody. Among the top priorities for the group is the release of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind Egyptian who was convicted of orchestrating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

The Obama administration has said it will not negotiate with al-Qaeda for Weinstein’s release. The United States as a matter of policy generally does not negotiate with kidnappers, but the government devotes resources to finding Americans kidnapped overseas.

The new video appeared to be the captive’s first proof of life since a video statement released in September 2012. In that statement, Weinstein appealed to Israel’s prime minister “as one Jew to another,” asking him to help build support to meet al-Qaeda’s demands for his release.

Weinstein did not say what specific steps the Obama administration could take to secure his release. He did say, however, that his captors have agreed to arrange for relatives to visit him in custody if the United States releases unspecified prisoners as part of a “quid pro quo.”

Weinstein also addressed Secretary of State John F. Kerry, telling him his captors have kept him abreast of peace deals that the top U.S. diplomat has sought to broker. Weinstein said a “first step” to getting him released would require taking “action with respect to their people who are being held as prisoners.”

“If anyone in the Obama government can understand my predicament it is yourself,” Weinstein said. “I hope that one day soon I will be able to meet you as a free man and thank you for your efforts.”

Weinstein appeared troubled that the media have not covered his case more extensively. The handwritten note pleaded with journalists to keep his case in the news, to ensure “that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic.”

At the end of the video, he addressed his relatives, saying: “I would like them to know I love them very much and I think about each and every one of them every moment of every day.”

Weinstein was the Pakistan director of J.E. Austin Associates, a USAID contractor, when he was taken hostage in Lahore, Pakistan, on Aug. 13, 2011.

Weinstein said in the video that he is suffering from a heart condition and acute asthma.

“The years have taken their toll,” he said."

USA TODAY

The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons

U.N. inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program

Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb in as little as a month, according to a new estimate by one of the USA's top nuclear experts.

The new assessment comes as the White House invited Senate staffers to a briefing on negotiations with Iran as it is trying to persuade Congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions against Iran.

""Shortening breakout times have implications for any negotiation with Iran,"" stated the report by the Institute for Science and International Security. ""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further.""

David Albright, president of the institute and a former inspector for the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency, said the estimate means that Iran would have to eliminate more than half of its 19,000 centrifuges to extend the time it would take to build a bomb to six months.

The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb.

Bernadette Meehan, an NSC spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council, said the intelligence community maintains ""a number of assessments"" regarding potential time frames for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one weapon or a testable nuclear device.hi

""We continue to closely monitor the Iranian nuclear program and its stockpile of enriched uranium,"" Meehan said.

World powers are seeking an agreement ""that ultimately resolves all of the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" she said. ""The ultimate goal is a comprehensive agreement that is credible, transparent, and verifiable.""

In the report, Albright said negotiations with Iran should focus on so-called ""breakout"" times, or the time required to convert low-enriched uranium to weapons-grade.

Albright, who has testified before Congress, said the negotiators should try to find ways to lengthen the breakout times and shorten the time that inspectors could detect breakout. ISIS' analysis is based on the latest Iranian and United Nations reports on Iran's centrifuge equipment for producing nuclear fuel and its nuclear fuel stockpiles.

Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched uranium has nearly doubled in a year's time and its number of centrifuges has expanded from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today.

Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican whose Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation to tighten Iran sanctions, said the report shows that Iran is expanding its nuclear capabilities under the cover of negotiations.

""The Senate should move forward immediately with a new round of sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring an undetectable breakout capability,"" he said.

The White House has said new sanctions legislation should wait while current negotiations — scheduled to resume officially in Geneva next month — are moving forward.

The White House said Thursday it will continue consulting with Congress ""so that any congressional action is aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons but that producing nuclear fuel is Iran's right. His foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has said Iran will not ship its nuclear stockpile to a third country.

However, Iran has blocked international inspectors from some suspected nuclear facilities to verify they are being used for peaceful purposes, access required under international agreements it has signed.

United Nations inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program in violation of Iran's commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The USA and the U.N. Security Council have implemented crippling economic sanctions on Iran to sway it to take steps to assure the world it is not developing a bomb.

Israel, which sees an Iranian nuclear bomb as a threat to its very existence, has said it will take military action to prevent Iran from getting a bomb.

ISIS estimated in October 2012 that Iran could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for a bomb within two to four months. The new estimate is based on an analysis of the latest reports by Iran and the the IAEA.

ISIS considered various scenarios, including if Iran decided to build a covert enrichment plant like it has under a mountain in Fordow, near the city of Qom, that was designed for optimal efficiency and minimal time to enrich enough uranium for bomb making. Such a facility built with current Iranian technology could produce enough material for a bomb in a week, according to the ISIS report.

""If they did that and they were caught it would be a smoking gun of a nuclear weapons program,"" Albright said.

If Iran moves ahead with installation of its more efficient, second generation centrifuges, it would be able to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb with so few of them, between 2,000 and 3,300 centrifuges, that they could fit in a small warehouse, Albright said."

USA TODAY

Korean War veteran Merrill Newman was removed from his flight Oct. 25

China%2C Sweden and former N.M. governor Bill Richardson are trying to help

The wife of an elderly Korean War veteran seized from a plane in North Korea after touring Pyongyang pleaded for his release Friday and Secretary of State John Kerry called his detention ""disturbing.""

Lee Newman, wife of Merrill Newman, asked that North Korea ""return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family,"" according to the San Jose Mercury News.

Newman left his home in Palo Alto, Calif., last month to visit North Korea with a friend, Bob Hamrdla, a retired history professor at Stanford University. They toured parts of the country with official tour guides.

But when departing by plane on Oct. 26 a uniformed North Korean officer boarded, asked Newman for his passport, then told a stewardess Newman had to leave the plane, according to his son, Jeffrey Newman. Hamrdla said his detention ""has to be a terrible misunderstanding.""

The detention is one of multiple ""disturbing choices by the North Koreans,"" Kerry told MSNBC on Friday. The North Korean government ""needs to recognize the dangerous steps it has been taking on many fronts,"" including the ""treatment of its citizens, the start-up of its nuclear reactor, (and) its rededication to a nuclear policy,"" he said.

The country ""needs to figure out where it's heading"" and to realize that the USA is not threatening or acting in a bellicose manner against it, he said.

Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and 2008 presidential candidate in the Democratic primary, told USA TODAY he too has tried to help Newman, who has not been heard from since he was pulled from his flight.

""I contacted the North Koreans a couple of days ago and expressed my concern and they promised to get back to me and they haven't gotten back to me,"" Richardson said while visiting South Africa for a conference. ""There will be more phone calls with other parties and intermediaries in the days ahead.""

Richardson helped secure the release American Evan C. Hunziker from North Korea in 1996.

Noel Clay, a spokesman for the State Department, said he could provide little about the case because of privacy concerns. The USA and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.

The Embassy of Sweden in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang represents the interests of U.S. citizens in that country and is working ""to resolve the issue,"" Clay said.

Americans who travel to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea face a restrictive experience unmatched by almost any other tourist destination.

There are many restrictions on people who visit North Korea, according to rules published on the web site for New Korea Tours, a Connecticut-based company.

""You will be under close scrutiny from the guides and security,"" the site says. ""You can only take a photograph of what the guides allow.""

Prohibited are photos of poverty, soldiers and checkpoints. Any outdoor excursion, even around the hotel grounds, require permission.

Newman studied Korean before the trip and while there sent postcards describing ""good times, good weather and knowledgeable guides,"" Lee Newman said. Before his detention, Newman had talked to North Korean officials about his experiences during the Korean War, said Jeffrey Newman, who described the conversation as ""difficult.""

Packing for an international trip is tough, but it's even more stressful when you're the first lady. Michelle Obama took her famous wardrobe on the road this week, spending two days in Ireland with Sasha and Malia while President Obama attended the G8 Summit.

We haven't seen FLOTUS pack for an extended trip since her annual Hawaii winter vacation. But she hasn't lost the magical ability to pack for every kind of occasion and level of formality with seemingly no ""basics"" in the mix. Does the woman even own a white tee?

There was an awesome printed Lela Rose vest, an on-trend Burberry trench coat and a covetable utility jacket (seriously, we'd like to steal it). While we didn't love the oversized tunic she chose for a Riverdance performance, Michelle generally maintained a strong enough fashion game to compete with her increasingly-trendy daughters. Have you seen those girls' colorful flats and skinnies?

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']",George F. Will: Better a contained Iran than an all-out war,"Critics of the agreement with Iran concerning its nuclear program are right about most things but wrong about the most important things. They understand the agreement’s manifest and manifold defects and its probable futility. Crucial components of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remain. U.S. concessions intended to cultivate the Iranian regime’s “moderates” are another version of the fatal conceit that U.S. policy can manipulate other societies. As is the hope that easing economic sanctions would create an Iranian constituency demanding nuclear retreat in exchange for yet more economic relief. Critics are, however, wrong in thinking that any agreement could control Iran’s nuclear aspirations. And what critics consider the agreement’s three worst consequences are actually benefits.

The six-month agreement, with ongoing negotiations, makes it impossible for the United States to attack its negotiating partner. Hence the agreement constrains Israel, which lacks the military capacity to be certain of a success commensurate with the risks of attacking Iran. Therefore there is no alternative to a policy of containment of a nuclear Iran.

Iran’s claim that its nuclear program is for power generation and medical uses is risible. So is the notion that negotiations have any likely utility establishing the predicate for containment of an Iran with nuclear weapons or with the capacity to produce them quickly.

There is a recently published primer for the perplexed: “Unthinkable: Iran, the Bomb, and American Strategy” by Kenneth M. Pollack of the Brookings Institution. Measured in his judgments, scrupulous in presenting arguments with which he disagrees, Pollack comes to this conclusion: “Going to war with Iran to try to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear arsenal would be a worse course of action than containing Iran, even a nuclear Iran.”

Some advocates of war seem gripped by Thirties Envy, a longing for the clarity of the 1930s, when appeasement failed to slake the dictators’ thirst for territorial expansion. But the incantation “Appeasement!” is not an argument. And the word “appeasement” does not usefully describe a sober decision that war is an imprudent and even ultimately ineffective response to the failure of diplomatic and economic pressures to alter a regime’s choices about policies within its borders.

Israel’s superb air force is too small, when striking over great distances at hidden and hardened targets, to do more than set back Iran’s program a few years, at most. And an attack might cause Iran to expel the international inspectors or accelerate the crumbling of the sanctions, thereby speeding the reconstitution of the weapons program.

A U.S. attack could do much more damage but could not prevent reconstitution. So, if stopping the program is important enough for war, is it important enough for an invasion of a nation with almost three times the population of Iraq and nearly four times the size?

In December 2011, Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, said that if Iran were seen “proceeding with developing a nuclear weapon” or had decided to do that, the United States would “take whatever steps are necessary to stop it.” In March 2012, Barack Obama said: “Iran’s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” His “red line” was the weaponization of fissile material.

Yet in his Nov. 23 statement celebrating the new agreement, Obama spoke of wanting to be able to “verify” that Iran “cannot build a nuclear weapon.” If so, he rejects not only containment but allowing Iran to stop near — “a screwdriver’s turn away from” — weaponization. But Pollack, writing many months before the recent agreement ratified Iran’s right to enrichment, said:

“As long as Iran is left with the capacity to enrich uranium, the right to perform some enrichment activity, and a stockpile of LEU (low-enriched uranium) . . . then Iran will have a breakout capability. It could be a breakout window as wide as many months, perhaps even a year, but Iran will have the capability to manufacture the fissile material for a nuclear weapon.”

The agreement will not stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons; only a highly unlikely Iranian choice can do that. The agreement may, however, prevent a war to prevent Iran from acquiring such weapons. If Pollack is right, and he certainly is persuasive, we have two choices, war or containment. Those who prefer the former have an obligation to clearly say why its consequences would be more predictable and less dire than those in the disastrous war with Iraq.

Barack and Michelle Obama had a pint of Guinness when visiting Moneygall in the Republic of Ireland in 2011.

Eight of the world's most powerful leaders will meet next month in a Fermanagh hotel.

Away from prying eyes, the G8 will discuss the issues of the day.

But out of Cameron, Merkel, Putin, Obama, Hollande, Abe, Napolitano and Harper, it looks like Obama might be the most popular.

He's the only one invited to a pint and a GAA game, anyway.

Cavan man Dean Arrowsmith has invited the world leader to sample Gaelic football for himself.

Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote You may think this is a joke email...” End Quote Dean Arrowsmith Email to the White House

The Ulster quarter-final takes place on Sunday 16 June at the 18,000-seater Brewster Park in Enniskillen.

Perhaps a bit of Obama's 'Yes We Can' spirit will be all the Cavan players need to help them beat Fermanagh.

It was after Cavan's 1-15 to 1-11 win over Armagh at the weekend that Mr Arrowsmith wrote his email to the White House.

""If you have time in your hectic schedule,"" it reads, ""I would like to invite you to attend the game with myself and a few friends, I will even pay in to the game for you (it's only €15), and let you experience the national game of our country for the first time.""

The 24-year-old, who used to promote Dundalk FC in the Airtricity League, told Obama he would ""buy you a pint of Guinness and discuss the trials and tribulations of what occurred on the field.""

Cavan forward Martin Dunne was named man of the match at the weekend's game against Armagh.

He said: ""I know you probably won't want to offend your native Offaly folk but we will also give you a Cavan jersey as a memento for the occasion.""

On Obama's 2011 visit to Ireland, he had a pint of stout in his ancestral home town of Moneygall, Co. Offaly, where his great-great-great-grandfather once lived.

The pint was ""delicious"", the president said.

There has been no response from the White House just yet.

But Mr Arrowsmith says that if he knew his way around county stereotypes, he would hotfoot it to Brewster Park.

""Cavan people are known for being a little bit tight"", he said. ""So if a Cavan man offers to buy you a pint and a ticket, you take him up on it.""

His email to the White House finished with: ""You may think this is a joke email, but I assure you, we would love for you to come cheer on the Boys in Blue with us.""

President Obama is not due to get to the UK until the day after the big game.

But there are still three weeks left until the G8 - still time for Cavan to win a new, high-profile fan, Mr Arrowsmith hopes."

Speaking on ""The Boiling Frogs Show,"" Tice claimed the intelligence community had ordered surveillance on a wide range of groups and individuals, including high-ranking military officials, lawmakers and diplomats.

""Here's the big one ... this was in summer of 2004, one of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with a 40-something-year-old wannabe senator for Illinois,"" he said. ""You wouldn't happen to know where that guy lives right now would you? It's a big white house in Washington, D.C. That's who they went after, and that's the president of the United States now.""

Host Sibel Edmonds and Tice both raised concerns that such alleged monitoring of subjects, unbeknownst to them, could provide the intelligence agencies with huge power to blackmail their targets.

""I was worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on,"" Tice said.

After going public with his allegations in 2005, Tice later admitted that he had been a key source in a bombshell New York Times report that blew the lid off the Bush administration's use of warrantless wiretapping of international communications in the U.S. The article forced Bush to admit that the practice was indeed used on a small number of Americans, but Tice maintained that the NSA practice was likely being used the gather records for millions of Americans. The NSA denied Tice's allegations.

In the wake of recent reports detailing the extent of the NSA's data surveillance programs, Tice has again come out as a skeptic of the administration's response. While defenders of the program have insisted that there is nothing to suggest the government has the authority -- or desire -- to listen in on people's phone calls without a warrant, Tice told The Guardian that he believes the NSA has developed the capability ""to collect all digital communications word for word.""

On%20the%20country%27s%20independence%20day%2C%20Martelly%20called%20for%20unity

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Thousands of critics of Haiti's President Michel Martelly staged protest marches Monday that turned violent as people threw rocks and shots were fired in the air.

It appeared at least one person was shot. An Associated Press reporter heard several gunshots, and then a crowd loaded a man onto a motorcycle and took him to an ambulance. The ambulance driver said the man was shot in the back. His condition wasn't immediately clear.

The marches were among the biggest demonstrations against Martelly since he took office in 2011, and the crowd in the capital swelled as protesters passed each neighborhood. Their complaints ranged from the cost of living to high levels of corruption.

Protesters lit fiery barricades of discarded tires on one of the busiest streets as they called for Martelly's departure from office. Demonstrators also smashed car windows and tore down posters and billboards bearing the leader's face and burned those too. Pro-Martelly groups held separate marches, and the two sides took turns throwing rocks at each other as riot police dispensed canisters of tear gas.

""We are moving forward to removing him from power and won't stop until he leaves,"" said demonstrator Jean Daniel.

Martelly, his prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, and the first lady attended a church ceremony in the northern city of Cap-Haitien, the site of another, smaller protest Monday, a national holiday that commemorates Haiti's final battle before it secured independence from France in 1804.

In a speech that followed at a historic site where the fight apparently took place, Martelly appealed for unity. ""If we didn't put our heads together, we wouldn't have had the Battle of Vertieres,"" he said. ""If we didn't have our heads together, we wouldn't have a Haitian state.""

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti on Saturday urged Martelly and opposition parties to sort out their differences in a peaceful manner. The world body also dispatched armed troops for the demonstration to join riot police with shields and helmets.

The mounting tension between Martelly and his opponents stems in part from the government's failure to hold legislative and local elections that are two years overdue. The U.N., U.S. and others have been overly supportive of the Martelly administration but relations seemed to be straining in recent months because of the delayed vote. The election was supposed to have been held before year's end, but it most likely won't happen until next year.

""The international community should take notes,"" said Moise Jean-Charles, a senator and vocal critic of the government. ""The people are rising for a change. Martelly and Lamothe aren't doing anything for the country but stealing money."""

Syrian opposition: Obama has given false hope to those suffering

The Obama administration pushed forward Sunday on a new path toward military action in Syria, urging Congress to support the president's call

Tests found signatures of sarin gas in blood and hair samples collected from the Damascus site of an alleged chemical weapons attack, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union.

The samples were collected separately from a United Nations investigation into the August 21 attack and provide further proof that the Syrian regime attacked its own people, Kerry said.

With ""each day that goes by, this case is even stronger,"" he said, arguing that the United States must act.

""If you don't do it, you send a message of impunity,"" Kerry said. Iran, North Korea, and Hezbollah ""will look at the United States and say 'Nothing means anything' -- that's what's at stake here,"" he said.

Syria denies using chemical weapons on its people and blames the rebels.

Kerry called the evidence ""overwhelming"" Sunday, and the Arab League issued a statement blaming the Syrian government for the attack.

But the United Nations argued that world leaders should wait until U.N. investigators determine whether chemical weapons were used.

""The U.N. mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said repeatedly at a news conference.

So when will the results be ready? The U.N. won't give a timeline, Nesirky said. ""It's being done as fast as it is possible to do within the scientific constraints.""

Samples will be delivered to laboratories Monday, he said.

The investigation involves a strict chain of custody and clear guidelines, he said, adding that two Syrian government officials monitored the process.

But even when it's done, the U.N. will only say whether chemical weapons were used -- not who was responsible.

Obama's last-minute Syria switch

U.S. military action appeared imminent until Saturday, when Obama announced he would first seek lawmakers' approval.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said Saturday. The 1973 War Powers Act technically allows him to strike without such approval.

Lawmakers officially come back from recess on September 9.

But some members of Congress arrived on Capitol Hill Sunday for a classified briefing on Syria with White House, State Department and Pentagon officials.

Jim Himes, D-Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of skepticism, frankly, about whether or not this was an attack carried out by the Syrian regime. While nobody would say that it's been proven, the vast bulk of the evidence suggests that this was an attack carried out by the Assad regime.""

Sen. John McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Obama had invited him to a Monday meeting at the White House to discuss the next steps in Syria. McCain, who has been pushing for military intervention in Syria, said he had questions for the president.

""I want to find out whether there is a plan and a strategy. I want to find out whether this is just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America,"" McCain told CNN. ""But I will say that if Congress overrules a decision of the president of the United States on an issue of national security, that could set a catastrophic precedent in the future. It would be a very dangerous precedent to be setting.""

Global debate surges over Syria

At a meeting in Cairo Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers condemned the chemical weapons attack, urging the international community to take action and calling for the prosecution of those responsible.

""The Syrian regime bears full responsibility for the use of chemical weapons (in) this heinous crime,"" foreign ministers from the regional organization said in a statement, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

""The council also called for providing the required forms of support for the Syrian people to defend themselves and the need for concerted Arab and international efforts to help them,"" the statement said.

Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby said in a Twitter post that the league was calling for the United Nations Security Council to ""assume its responsibility and take all the deterrent and needed measures against this crime and all crimes of genocide"" in Syria.

But the statements Sunday did not directly refer to the United States, and it's unclear how much international support the U.S. government would have if it chooses to strike Syria.

At the Arab League meeting, Saudi Arabia called for international action, but Egypt said it was opposed to foreign intervention in the Syrian crisis.

Britain has voted against taking any military action in Syria, and France said it won't act without the United States as a partner.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle tweeted Sunday that the time gained waiting for U.S. congressional approval ""must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the U.N. Security Council.""

The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are warning of a higher risk of cyberattacks after months of disruptions by hackers known as the Syrian Electronic Army , and authorities say more attacks are likely.

Opposition: Obama gave false hope

The shift to ask for approval from Congress left some analysts scratching their heads.

""The decision-making has been so confused and muddled that it's difficult to put the word 'wise' in front of anything they're doing right now,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said on Sunday. ""The administration has hesitated between nonintervention and intervention, and it is caught between those two.""

The Obama administration, Zakaria said, ""seems to want to have it both ways, but it can't.""

Others praised the president for taking a step to get more buy-in at home and abroad.

""Frankly, I think he looks prudent, and I don't doubt his resolve on this,"" John Negroponte, who served as director of national intelligence for two years under President George W. Bush, told CNN's State of the Union. ""I don't think he's looking for an excuse to get out from a box or a situation that he painted himself into.""

While some praised the president for giving Congress a chance to weigh in, a key group of Syrian dissidents said it was surprised and concerned by Obama's new approach.

""We can't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds, giving them false hope, then change your mind and say let's wait and see,"" the Syrian National Coalition said.

Iran, a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime, warned the United States will pay a price if it strikes Syria.

Syria reacts

The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against the regime.

Maria Saadeh, a member of Syria's parliament, told CNN on Sunday that she sees no justification for a U.S. strike on Syria.

""There is no legitimacy to make this attack,"" she said, accusing rebel groups of using chemical weapons and committing other crimes against humanity.

Syrian state media have been packed with critiques of the U.S. position since Obama's announcement Saturday. An editorial in the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper Sunday said that Obama had declared ""the beginning of a historic American retreat.""

Meanwhile, the opposition Syrian National Coalition issued a statement aimed at U.S. lawmakers.

""The Syrian National Coalition calls on the American congress to carry their historical responsibility towards the Syrian people and take the right decision to support the American government approach to stop the killing machine of the Syrian criminal regime,"" the statement said.

Sarin allegedly used previously in Syrian civil war

World leaders have said previously that sarin has been used in the Syrian civil war.

In April, the United States said it had evidence sarin was used in Syria on a small scale.

In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicion s that rebel forces used the deadly nerve agent."

Authorities in Iran hanged 16 ""anti-Iran"" rebels Saturday in response to deadly overnight clashes between bandits and border guards in southeast Iran, the country's Fars news agency reported.

Local attorney-general Mohammad Marzieh said the 16 were hanged Saturday morning in the city of Zahedan, in Sistan and Baluchestan province, the semi-official news agency said.

""We had issued warnings previously that bandits and anti-Iran group members who commit acts causing damage to innocent people or security and military personnel will face reciprocal action by us,"" he is quoted as saying.

""This morning, in retaliation for the martyrdom of border guards at the town of Saravan, we hanged 16 members of of these anti-Iran groups. The judiciary will absolutely not tolerate such actions by these groups.""

Official news agency IRNA said 14 Iranian border guards were killed in the clashes in the Saravan city area, near Iran's border with Pakistan's Balochistan province. Six more were injured and three taken hostage, the news agency said. It earlier said as many as 17 security personnel had died.

Ali Abdollahi, Iran's deputy interior minister, told IRNA that the provincial governor had sent a team to investigate the incident.

He told the news agency that only authorized reports by the interior ministry regarding the killing of the soldiers and border guards should be trusted.

Abdollahi said the ""terrorist activities"" in Saravan appeared to have initiated over the border in Pakistan. Iran expects Pakistan to do more to secure its borders in line with mutual agreements, he said.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani urged the interior ministry to take strong measures to deal with terrorism, IRNA said.

He also called on the foreign ministry to work out a deal with Pakistan to avoid this kind of incident happening again, the news agency said.

Rouhani also expressed his condolences to the families of the border guards killed in the incident.

Additional security and military forces from elsewhere in the province have been sent to the border area, the news agency said."

(Associated Press)

President Obama says the U.S. has agreed to provide Iran with ""modest relief"" from sanctions as part of a deal on the country's nuclear program. (Associated Press)

Iran and six major powers agreed early Sunday on a historic deal that freezes key parts of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for temporary relief on some economic sanctions.

The agreement, sealed at a 3 a.m. signing ceremony in Geneva’s Palace of Nations, requires Iran to halt or scale back parts of its nuclear infrastructure, the first such pause in more than a decade.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hailed the deal, which was reached after four days of hard bargaining, including an eleventh-hour intervention by Secretary of State John F. Kerry and foreign ministers from Europe, Russia and China.

“It is important that we all of us see the opportunity to end an unnecessary crisis and open new horizons based on respect, based on the rights of the Iranian people and removing any doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program,” Zarif told reporters in English. “This is a process of attempting to restore confidence.”

The deal, intended as a first step toward a more comprehensive nuclear pact to be completed in six months, freezes or reverses progress at all of Iran’s major nuclear facilities, according to Western officials familiar with the details. It halts the installation of new centrifuges used to enrich uranium and caps the amount and type of enriched uranium that Iran is allowed to produce.

Iran also agreed to halt work on key components of a heavy-water reactor that could someday provide Iran with a source of plutonium. In addition, Iran accepted a dramatic increase in oversight, including daily monitoring by international nuclear inspectors, the officials said.

(Nuclear pact’s fine print: A temporary halt in advances)

The concessions not only halt Iran’s nuclear advances but also make it virtually impossible for Tehran to build a nuclear weapon without being detected, the officials said. In return, Iran will receive modest relief of trade sanctions and access to some of its frozen currency accounts overseas, concessions said to be valued at less than $7 billion over the six-month term of the deal. The sanctions would be reinstated if Iran violates the agreement’s terms.

Not long after the accord was reached, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said the deal recognizes Tehran’s “right” to maintain an enrichment program.

Rouhani said, “Let anyone make his own reading, but this right is clearly stated in the text of the agreement that Iran can continue its enrichment, and I announce to our people that our enrichment activities will continue as before.”

But Kerry said in response on Sunday that the deal does not recognize a “right to enrich.”

“There is no inherent right to enrich,” Kerry said on ABC’s “This Week.” “And everywhere in this particular agreement it states that they could only do that by mutual agreement, and nothing is agreed on until everything is agreed on.”

In an address from the White House after the deal was announced, President Obama praised the negotiators’ work. “Today, that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure — a future in which we can verify that Iran’s nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon,” he said. “While today’s announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal. For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program, and key parts of the program will be rolled back.”

The agreement is a long-sought victory for the Obama administration, which from its earliest days made the Iranian nuclear program one of its top foreign policy priorities. The administration, helped by its overseas allies as well as Congress, achieved unprecedented success in imposing harsh economic sanctions that cut Iran’s oil exports in half and decimated the country’s currency. It was hoping to quickly finalize an agreement in the face of threats by Congress to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran.

A number of Congress members expressed skepticism about the deal Sunday, including an influential member of the president’s own party, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “In my view, this agreement did not proportionately reduce Iran’s nuclear program for the relief it is receiving,” Menendez said in a statement. “Given Iran’s history of duplicity, it will demand ongoing, on the ground verification.”

But Menendez also suggested that Congress would not impose new sanctions during the six-month interim agreement period.

“I expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on Iran, but will at the same time be immediately available should the talks falter or Iran fail to implement or breach the interim agreement,” his statement sad.

Speaking in the predawn hours after the announcement, Kerry said the goal of the talks was to “require Iran to prove the peaceful nature of its program and ensure that it cannot acquire a nuclear weapon.”

He called the agreement a “serious first step” toward resolving world doubts about Iran’s program. Kerry then addressed Israeli concerns directly. “It will make our partners in the region safer. It will make our ally Israel safer.”

He said it is too soon to tell whether the agreement can help turn the page from more than three decades of animosity and suspicion between the United States and Iran. “This is potentially a significant moment,” he said, “but I’m not going to stand here in some triumphal moment and suggest to you that this is an end unto itself. It is not.”

Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the deal “a positive step” and added that it is “vital that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in a peaceful way.”

Still, the agreement is likely to face heavy opposition from key allies — chiefly Israel and Saudi Arabia — as well as congressional skeptics who have demanded much greater concessions from Iran, including the dismantling of its enrichment program.

Obama plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday to discuss the agreement, according to a senior administration official. The official also said that the White House had begun calling lawmakers Saturday night and would continue to do so in coming days.

Republican lawmakers characterized the agreement as not going far enough.

“I have serious concerns that this agreement does not meet the standards necessary to protect the United States and our allies,” Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “Instead of rolling back Iran’s program, Tehran would be able to keep the key elements of its nuclear weapons-making capability. Yet we are the ones doing the dismantling — relieving Iran of the sanctions pressure built up over years.”

Others, however, hailed the successful conclusion of a deal that eased a crisis that brought the Middle East to the brink of armed conflict.

Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and Iran expert, called the deal “a huge win for Obama.”

“You have to give it to these guys: They put in place the most effective sanctions regime in memory and leveraged it into a deal,” Kupchan said.

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said diplomacy had “delivered the U.S. and Iran from the brink of a disastrous war and placed the two countries at the beginning of a brighter, more sustainable path forward.”

Among the technical aspects of the deal, Iran agreed to halt enriching uranium to a level above 5 percent purity, a level used for nuclear reactor fuel but not approaching the 90-percent purity needed for nuclear weapons.

While Iran would be allowed to continue some uranium enrichment, it could not install new centrifuges or use thousands of others that it has manufactured but not placed into service. Iran’s total stockpile of enriched uranium would not be allowed to grow during the six-month period.

Iran also agreed to stop producing a type of more highly enriched uranium — up to 20 percent purity — and committed itself to eliminate its stockpile of this material by converting it to metal fuel rods or blending it with natural uranium.

On the key issue of Iran’s partly constructed heavy-water reactor, a potential source of plutonium, Iran agreed to halt production of fuel for the reactor and refrain from installing further reactor components.

Assuring compliance with the agreement, U.N. inspectors would be granted daily access to Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as access to data from remote cameras and sensing equipment.

According to a senior Obama administration official, U.S. officials held a series of bilateral discussions with Iranian officials throughout the fall to develop ideas that could become part of the accord reached by broader negotiations between Iran and the group of six nations.

This week the marathon discussions with Iran were described by Western diplomats as “very difficult” and “intense.” Several officials had sought to lower expectations that a resolution could be reached before Sunday, when Kerry and the other foreign ministers were due to depart.

Negotiations over the deal had remained snarled late into Saturday evening, with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the European Union and the United States huddled in a hotel conference room.

Several of the diplomats met earlier in the day with Iran’s Zarif, who told reporters that the parties remained divided on key details of the six-month deal.

Kerry, Zarif and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met late Saturday, but the session ended with no announcement of progress. Instead, Iran’s deputy foreign minister hardened his position on Iran’s right to enrich uranium, a matter of deep national pride.

Although “98 percent” of the deal was done, Iran said it could not accept any agreement that does not recognize enrichment rights, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters.

“Any agreement without recognizing Iran’s right to enrich, practically and verbally, will be unacceptable for Tehran,” Araghchi said, according to Reuters.

Western officials balked at recognizing a legal right to uranium enrichment, hoping instead to craft language that acknowledges the right of all countries to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Zarif appeared to endorse that approach publicly this month.

(CNN) —

The battering that the U.S. image is taking in Egypt these days reflects that the sources of anger against America in the Middle East run deep. We’re not the primary reason the Middle East is so screwed up. The Arabs themselves need to own up to that. Just take a look at Syria and Egypt.

But we are still a big part of the story. Some extremist Muslims hammer us because they don’t like Western values; others see the conspiratorial hand of America everywhere – sucking the life out of Arab and Muslim independence, pride and dignity.

But once you get away from the fringes, what you find is equally disturbing: Millions of Arabs and Muslims don’t like us not because of who we are but because of what we do. It’s our policies.

Courtesy Aaron Miller Aaron David Miller

And since those are unlikely to change anytime soon, there’s a pretty good chance America will continue to lose the public image battle in the Middle East. And here’s why:

Minds and hearts: We’ve always had it backwards. It’s not hearts then minds at all. If you want to capture the imagination of people living in the Middle East and get them to warm to America, you don’t play to their emotions first. It’s as if a new pretty bow on a package with the same contents as ever is somehow going to help sell U.S. policy. It won’t.

First, capture people’s minds, appeal to their cognitive self-interest and then their hearts will follow. That would require a significant readjustment of U.S. policy: The U.S. would have to be much tougher on Israel on settlements and practices such as land confiscation, closures and withholding tax revenues in the West Bank.

The U.S. would have to be much fairer when it came to Palestinian issues, including supporting reasonable resolutions at the United Nations and taking positions in negotiations that really did try to find an equitable balance, instead of viewing reality through a pro-Israeli filter. The U.S. would still have a special relationship with our close Israeli ally, just not an exclusive one.

The U.S. would have to be much clearer about standing up to human rights abuses in the Arab world and much tougher on the Arab kings where America is reluctant to offend its conservative allies. People know where and what their interests are. And if we want to improve our credibility, we’d need to find a fairer balance between theirs and ours on many issues.

Values vs. interests: It’s stunning testament to the American predicament in the Middle East that within two years of Hosni Mubarak’s overthrow – handled relatively well by the Obama administration – we are being attacked for backing both Mohamed Morsy and the generals and criticized by just about everyone, even the secular opposition.

You can pick your favorite culprit. The U.S. ambassador, Secretary of State John Kerry’s yachting outing, Barack Obama’s naivete about the Muslim Brotherhood or his softness toward the military.

But none of them is the reason. We lost our footing in Egypt because the tension between our values and interests results in unpopular and inconsistent policies.

We back the democratically elected Morsy government, even though it behaves in an undemocratic manner; and when the military intervenes and cracks down, shooting 50 people, we react mildly.

To a great extent, these inconsistencies are a result of the chaos of Egyptian politics, but they also are related to our nation’s wariness of change. When stability in the region has been the guiding principle for half a century or more, it’s never easy to adjust, especially for the big power. Just look at Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.

But more than that, if Egyptians are confused, can’t get their own house in order and don’t produce big leaders or credible democratic institutions on which the U.S. can find a focal point for its policy, we’re going to continue to stumble and bumble around.

We backed Morsy because we believe in the almighty ballot box. And we backed the generals because we have other interests – the Eyptian-Israeli peace treaty, security for the Suez Canal, counterterrorism, containing Iran – that commend supporting the military, too. That we couldn’t reconcile the two in response to Egyptian realities should come as no great surprise. Nor should the reality that we earn the disfavor of so many frustrated Egyptians.

Great power hypocrisy: Great powers are big and strong enough that they can afford to behave inconsistently and hypocritically. And they do. It’s as if it were part of their job description.

But that inconsistency can confuse and disappoint. Our policies toward the Arab Spring are laced with contradictions. We support real political change in Egypt, but we won’t push it hard in Saudi Arabia or in Bahrain where oil, stability and U.S. bases reign supreme.

We’ll intervene militarily in Libya because it’s easier – but not in Syria, where the strength of al-Assad’s allies, military and a chemical weapons capacity make it much riskier.

And in the greatest paradox of all, our ties with the monarchies – Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco – are much closer than with the emerging and struggling democracies at a time when the Middle East yearns for democracy and freedom. It is indeed remarkable that the Arab kings have become our new anchors in a turbulent sea of political change.

Kerry has discovered Jordan as a key ally in this peace process policy. Earlier this year, the U.S. completed a huge arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worth billions.

Expectations for America run high in the world; and too often we help raise them, particularly in the Middle East. Obama came into office promising a new look in this region: more engagement, a greater sensitivity toward Islam and a pro-active policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.

And it’s a cruel irony that this putative transformer ended up tougher than his predecessor on drones and Iran and as cautious on Israeli-Palestinian peace.

But governing is about choosing. And Obama chose willfully and wisely not to chase windmills abroad but to concentrate on trying to fix America’s broken house.

Coming off the two longest wars in American history, where the standard for victory was not whether we would win, but when we could leave, who could blame him. For Obama the middle class was always going to be more important than the Middle East. And for better or worse, America’s standing in that region shows it.

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday.

But in a Facebook post called “Let Allah Sort it Out,” the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee-turned-Fox News personality let President Obama have it.

It was Obama, she said, who painted himself into a corner a year ago when he said that chemical weapons represented a “red line” that Syria’s president should not cross. (His actual statement was slightly more vague than what many people recall. But he did use the phrase “red line” and it did appear that Syria crossed it on Aug. 21, when some 1,400 Syrians died in Damascus suburbs as a result of chemical bombs.)

In nine typically antagonistic paragraphs, Palin managed to sum up the feelings of many Americans on both sides of the partisan divide who believe that Obama has not yet laid out a persuasive case for American military intervention in yet another strife-torn Middle Eastern nation.

“So we’re bombing Syria because Syria is bombing Syria? And I’m the idiot?” wrote Palin, apparently still stinging at some of the barbs directed at her intellect during the 2008 presidential campaign and after, when she became a heroine of the tea party wing of the GOP.

“We didn’t intervene when over 100,000 Syrians were tragically slaughtered by various means, but we’ll now intervene to avenge the tragic deaths of over 1,000 Syrians killed by chemical weapons, though according to the White House we’re not actually planning to take out the chemical weapons because doing so would require ‘too much of a commitment.’”

(She seems to be referring to Obama’s statement Friday during a meeting with Baltic leaders in which he spoke of the need to take a “limited, narrow act” against Syria. “Again, I repeat, we’re not considering any open-ended commitment. We’re not considering any boots on the ground approach.”)

In any case, like many Americans, Palin wondered what the ultimate American goal in Syria would be: “President Obama wants to do what, exactly? Punish evil acts in the form of a telegraphed air strike on Syria to serve as a deterrent? If our invasion of Iraq wasn’t enough of a deterrent to stop evil men from using chemical weapons on their own people, why do we think this will be?... Do we really think our actions help either side or stop them from hurting more civilians?”

On Saturday, bowing to pressure that included a letter signed by 200 bipartisan members of Congress, the president unexpectedly announced he would seek congressional approval before deciding whether to bomb Syria in retaliation for what Secretary of State John Kerry called a “crime against humanity.”

House Speaker John Boehner, the Ohio Republican, said that the House of Representatives would take up the matter the week of Sept. 9, after its summer recess.

Palin, whose statement on Facebook had garnered more than 77,000 “likes” by early Saturday evening, ended with a familiar snarky sentiment that she has expressed in the past:

“If we are dangerously uncertain of the outcome and are led into war by a Commander-in-chief who can’t recognize that this conflict is pitting Islamic extremists against an authoritarian regime with both sides shouting ‘Allah Akbar’ at each other,” wrote Palin, “then let Allah sort it out.”

(CNN) —

This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.

Federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday.

The United States based the extradition request on the criminal complaint and a treaty between the United States and Hong Kong that covers the surrender of “fugitive offenders” and their extradition.

Washington already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

“If Hong Kong doesn’t act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong’s commitment to the rule of law,” the administration official said.

The complaint charges Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal Espionage Act.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leaking of classified documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain’s Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month. The Guardian revealed Snowden’s identify at his request.

The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents.

There is a question about whether the espionage charges will be considered political offenses. The U.S. agreement with Hong Kong makes an exception for political offenses, in which case the treaty would not apply to Snowden.

Hong Kong Executive Council member Regina Ip said authorities can arrest Snowden if his actions qualify as a crime under Hong Kong law, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Sunday.

But if his actions are deemed to be political charges, she told Xinhua, then Snowden will not be extradited.

“We will work under the framework of Hong Kong law, and won’t allow any illegal or unfair judgment,” Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen told Xinhua.

Prominent U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the espionage charge complicates the case.

“I think it’s a dumb decision by the Justice Department to charge him with espionage,” Dershowitz told CNN. “That’s a political crime under the extradition we have with Hong Kong. It gives Hong Kong an excuse to say we don’t have to extradite him.

“They should have indicted him only for theft and conversion of property. Then Hong Kong would have to comply with the extradition treaty and turn him over.”

The revelation of the leaks rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties.

Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach.

They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content – listening to the call itself.

In interviews earlier this month, Snowden said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamiliton. The company has since fired him.

A series of blog posts this week purportedly by Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened “abusive” practices, instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate.

However, Obama “closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,” a blog post said. The Guardian newspaper and website identified the author as Snowden.

Snowden said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and The Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post, he said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has “faith in Hong Kong’s rule of law.”

The U.S. signed the extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996, seven months before the British colony was handed back to China. Hong Kong’s extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty.

This new treaty established an agreement under what is known as “one country, two systems”: Hong Kong has autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.

Snowden told the South China Morning Post, in an interview published Sunday, that the U.S. government is hacking Chinese mobile phone companies to steal millions of text messages. The Guardian also reported Snowden’s latest claims.

Last week, Snowden told the Post that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world, including in China, for years.

The new secretary of state’s exertions — reminiscent of predecessors like Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III — have been met with the usual mix of hope and skepticism. But with so much of the Middle East still convulsing from the effects of the Arab Spring, Mr. Kerry’s efforts raise questions about the Obama administration’s priorities at a time of renewed regional unrest.

Circuit Court,"WASHINGTON -- The White House officially withdrew President Barack Obama's nomination of Caitlin Halligan to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. A statement issued on Friday comes after repeated attempts to confirm the former New York state solicitor general were filibustered by Senate Republicans.

In a statement, Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that a minority of senators had blocked Halligan's nomination for almost two and a half years, and called the vacancies on what is arguably the country's second-highest federal court ""unacceptable.""

""Today, I accepted Caitlin Halligan's request to withdraw as a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""This unjustified filibuster obstructed the majority of Senators from expressing their support. I am confident that with Caitlin's impressive qualifications and reputation, she would have served with distinction.""

Republicans objected to Halligan's nomination because of what they claim is her history of legal advocacy, having focused specifically on a lawsuit in which she participated that would make gun manufacturers legally accountable for criminal acts of gun violence.

The most recent GOP filibuster incidentally came on the same day that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gained national media attention for his 13-hour talking filibuster. Democrats fell short of the required 60-vote threshold to end debate and bring Halligan's nomination to a vote, with only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) breaking from her party in support of invoking cloture. Halligan was nominated on Sept. 29, 2010, to fill the long vacant D.C. Circuit seat previously held by current Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts; her nomination was first filibustered in 2011.

Shortly after the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Halligan would ""bring that activism to the court.""

""Because of her record of activism, giving Ms. Halligan a lifetime appointment on the D.C. Circuit is a bridge too far,"" McConnell said.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called it a ""shame"" that Republicans had succeeded in blocking an ""extraordinarily well-qualified"" woman, who he said would've made an ""outstanding judge.""

""Caitlin Halligan is a woman who is extraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most qualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration,"" Leahy said in a statement. ""It is a shame that narrow, special interests hold such influence that Senate Republicans for two years blocked an up-or-down vote on her confirmation.""

The Nov. 8 gala for the International Medical Corps is expected to be attended by several hundred people who are donating as much as $100,000 each to the nonprofit. Hollywood titans and major Democratic fundraisers Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg and their wives are among the hosts of the benefit. Katzenberg is expected to be a key donor for an independent effort that hopes to boost Clinton’s bid for the White House if she decides to run. That entity, Priorities USA, was crucial to President Obama’s campaign.

The group that will benefit from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel event was founded in 1984 to provide humanitarian aid during global crises. It also trains local residents in 30 countries to help their communities. An International Medical Corps official said it is honoring the former secretary of State because of her work on behalf of women and children.

“She’s a longtime advocate for women’s health and women and children refugees,” said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications, adding that invitations are expected to go out in coming days.

Clinton saw the group’s efforts firsthand in the Congo, and has been an advocate for its mission, she said.

“She’s been a real champion of women’s issues, which is central to what we do,” Aguirre said, citing Clinton’s efforts to increase access to healthcare and education.

The visit will be Clinton’s fourth to California in recent months, as she debates whether to mount a second presidential bid. Since she stepped down from her secretary of State post in February, Clinton’s trips to the Golden State and across the nation have been a mix of awards and paid speeches. In August, she spoke to a business travel group in San Diego and the American Bar Assn. in San Francisco. In May, she accepted an award named after the late Secretary of State Warren Christopher from the Pacific Council on International Policy, also at the Beverly Wilshire.

The Beverly Wilshire holds a bit of history for the Clintons. Mickey Kantor, President Clinton’s former trade representative and Commerce secretary, noted in May as he introduced Hillary Clinton at the Pacific Council gala at the hotel that her husband held a sparsely attended presidential fundraiser in the same ballroom in 1992.

“On that night 21 years ago … we knew Hillary Clinton would be a ground-breaking first lady, but I doubt any of us imagined she would follow in [Christopher’s] footsteps to the State Department,” he said. “And what extraordinary things she would do, tirelessly traveling the globe, patiently working for peace, standing up to the bullies of the world, empowering and inspiring women and girls everywhere.”

“And Hillary continues to be in focus and even the subject of some speculation,” he said to cheers and applause at the pointed reference to her future options.

The November award will take place in the same spot, and will almost certainly be the subject of the same speculation.

About 125 people attended the meeting with Sen. John McCain in Phoenix

He had a second meeting the same day in Tucson%2C will have another Friday in Prescott%2C Ariz.

Full Senate vote on a Syria resolution is expected next week%3B House timing less certain

PHOENIX — Sen. John McCain felt the heat of opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria during a town hall meeting here that exposed the emotions and ethic and religious tensions connected to the crisis in the Middle East.

During his opening remarks to the more than one-hour session Thursday, McCain, R-Ariz., had just begun to say that he was against ""having a single American boot on the ground"" in the Syrian civil war when war opponents shouting ""not good enough"" and ""not good enough at all"" interrupted.

""You don't respect our view! We didn't send you to get war for us. We sent you to stop the war,"" one man yelled from the audience of about 125 people.

Throughout the meeting, critics of the plan to strike Syria told McCain that the United States shouldn't get involved when Syria's neighbors are refusing ""to lift a finger"" to help, that the U.S. public is against a new war, and that the U.S. has domestic priorities to focus on instead of an attack. One noted that Saddam Hussein's Iraq used chemical weapons in the 1980s without a similar response from the United States.

The crowd waved signs with messages such as ""Don't Bomb Syria!!!"" and ""Shame on McCain!"" The scene was largely repeated later Thursday at a second town hall meeting in Tucson, Ariz., although a few Syrian-Americans argued for intervention, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

President Barack Obama has asked Congress to authorize a limited military strike against Syria in response to the administration's conclusion that Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his own people.

As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, McCain voted Wednesday to support a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria. The full Senate is expected to vote next week; House timing is less certain.

""First of all, I understand your skepticism,"" McCain told the at-times hostile crowd in Phoenix, which leaned strongly against attacking Syria. ""I understand your concern about the United States of America getting involved in another conflict the way that we got involved in Iraq, telling the American people that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason to commit our American blood and treasure, and it turned out it was not true.""

However, McCain said the situation is serious because it is clear that Assad's regime used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people.

""I'm sure that all of you have seen those graphic and terrible pictures on television, of those children's bodies stacked up,"" McCain said. ""It breaks our heart to see that kind of thing happening to innocent women and children.""

McCain emphasized that no one contemplates American troops on the ground in Syria because Congress wouldn't agree to it and the American public wouldn't stand for it.

To the point about Syria's neighbors, McCain said some of them ""are the only ones right now ... that are providing weapons to the (opposition) Free Syrian Army.""

Unless the U.S. acts, Assad would get ""a green light to use chemical weapons again,"" and Iran and North Korea also would be emboldened, he said. Doing nothing could lead to bigger problems for the U.S. in the future.

""There's no good option here. If I had a good option for you, I would tell you exactly what it is,"" McCain said.

But Jumana Hadeed, a Syrian-American who lives in Phoenix, said the best option is ""diplomacy and negotiation, not bombs.""

Hadeed told McCain that an 18-year-old cousin of hers was killed 10 days ago ""by the so-called rebels and al-Qaeda,"" adding that foreign fighters are streaming into Syria. But she warned against U.S. intervention.

""Enough is enough. We do not want another engagement in the Middle East,"" she said. ""Whether you like Bashar Assad or not — I am not a fan, either — but at least he has a secular government going on over there.""

After the town hall meeting, which will be repeated Friday in Prescott, Ariz., McCain told members of the media that he is listening to his constituents. He said some in the audience support intervention in Syria and ""there's passion on both sides.""

As McCain was speaking to reporters, one Assad critic from Chandler, Ariz., who identified himself only as ""Ra'ed"" urged him to make the point that Assad was responsible for American military deaths in Iraq.

McCain called on Obama to better communicate to the American people why the action against Syria is necessary.

""I think that it's clear that the American people are frustrated by Iraq, and understandably so,"" McCain said. ""I think they're very reluctant for what may appear to be further American involvement that would endanger any American boot on the ground. And I think that the president of the United States, speaking from the Oval Office, can provide the American people with the assurance that is necessary. And the president is the only person who can do that.""

McCain grew impatient with a journalist who asked a question suggesting that he had made up his mind on Syria.

""Do you think I would be having a town hall meeting if I had my mind totally made up? Do you?"" McCain responded. ""Well, you're asking a dumb question. You're really asking dumb questions."""

The handover of the base in Wardak province’s Nerkh district to Afghan commandos and army troops removes another source of recent heightened tension between Washington and Kabul.

It came a week after the United States officially — and belatedly — ceded control of its main military prison to Afghanistan following Karzai’s repeated demands. U.S. and Afghan officials had originally agreed to the prison handover last September.

Wardak residents and officials had accused U.S. commandos and their Afghan allies of operating outside the national government’s authority and of torturing, kidnapping and summarily executing Nerkh locals suspected of militancy.

U.S. officials, including the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., have rejected those allegations and had ignored an original deadline set by Karzai for pulling the elite forces from the province. But in the face of mounting public anger and Karzai’s sharp comments, they later agreed to a gradual handover of security responsibility for Wardak to Afghans.

The strategically important and insurgent-plagued province lies some 18 miles to the west of Kabul.

“As we pledged, our forces have transitioned Nerkh District to Afghan National Security Forces and they have now assumed full responsibility for security in this key district,” Dunford said in a statement.

“The rest of Wardak will continue to transition over time as Afghan forces continue to grow in capability and capacity,” the statement said.

Two weeks ago, the government-funded Ulema Council, Afghanistan’s top religious body, warned that the American “infidels” would be treated as invaders if they failed to heed Karzai’s demands.

The pullout of the U.S. commandos coincides with the start of spring, traditionally the beginning of the fighting season in Afghanistan.

The Afghan Defense Ministry said that despite the U.S. elite forces’ departure from Nerkh, the national forces stationed there will rely on U.S. air support when needed.

“We will make the request for air power from them for bombing non-residential areas where the insurgents show up,” the ministry’s chief spokesman, Zaher Azimi, said."

A decision to supply weapons would mark a reversal for the Obama administration, which has resisted repeated proposals to deepen its involvement in Syria’s 2-year-old conflict, which, according to the United Nations, has killed more than 70,000 people, mostly civilians.

The contradictory signals reflect the growing dilemma for Obama. His administration is struggling to show resolve and build pressure on Syrian President Bashar Assad and Syria’s Russian and Iranian allies, even as the White House seeks to avoid getting drawn into another war in the Muslim world.

The administration also is considering supplying nonlethal military equipment such as armor, communications gear, night-vision goggles and vehicles to Syrian insurgent groups, officials said.

“We continue to consider all other possible options that would accomplish our objective of hastening a political transition,” said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council.

Another senior U.S. official, who declined to be identified when speaking on a sensitive issue, said arming the rebels was “on the table — and has been for some time — but there’s a ways to go before any decision is made.”

At a White House news conference, Obama appeared to raise the bar for U.S. military involvement. If evidence conclusively shows that Syrian forces used poison gas, he said, he “would rethink a range” of retaliatory options that might not include military action. He also suggested that he would require international collaboration for any military operation, saying the burden of a response is not America’s alone.

“What’s happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally,” he said. Confirmed use of poison gas by Syrian forces would be “a game changer not simply for the United States, but for the international community.”

Obama was asked directly if that meant his administration would take military action.

“By ‘game changer’ I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us,” he said. If the White House obtains conclusive proof of poison gas use, “that means that there’s some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would ... strongly consider.”

The president’s comments came after a huge bomb exploded Tuesday in a busy central square in Damascus, the Syrian capital. The official Syrian news agency reported that at least 13 people had been killed and more than 70 injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

The explosion occurred a day after an apparent car bomb targeted the convoy of Syrian Prime Minister Wael Halqi in Mezzeh, a district of Damascus. Halqi was unharmed, the government said, but reports indicated that several people were killed.

The two bombings, after a relative lull in attacks in the capital, have rattled nerves on the eve of a six-day holiday that begins Wednesday. Several mortar strikes also were reported Tuesday in Damascus.

“I guess all these days were only the calm before the storm,” said a retired lawyer in Damascus. “God help us with what’s coming tomorrow.”

Rebels seeking to overthrow the government frequently use car bombs and have fired mortar rounds into civilian areas of the capital. Government artillery and warplanes also have targeted civilian districts where rebel presence is suspected.

Obama first warned Assad in August that use of chemical weapons, or transfer of such stockpiles to terrorist groups, would cross a “red line.” He left ambiguous what kind of response he might take, although it seemed to imply U.S. military action.

But since the White House last week announced that U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded with varying degrees of confidence that sarin, a nerve gas, had been released in Syria, Obama has made it gradually clearer that he is far from embracing a military option.

Obama emphasized Tuesday that investigators had yet to determine if Syrian government forces intentionally used the gas, if it was accidentally released or if insurgents or other groups fired the weapons. The president said conclusive proof was necessary to win international support for action.

“If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we may find ourselves in the position where we can’t mobilize the international community to support what we do,” he said. “There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action.”

Obama is dispatching Secretary of State John F. Kerry to Moscow in the next few days to try to convince the Kremlin to end its support of the Assad regime.

Each side in the Syrian conflict has accused the other of deploying chemical weapons in a series of disputed incidents. On Tuesday, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, told reporters that rebels used “chemical material” in Idlib province on Monday to make it appear that the government had deployed chemical weapons.

A U.N. investigation of the alleged use of chemical weapons has stalled amid a disagreement with Damascus about access in Syria.

Some members of Congress and other advocates have urged the administration to begin arming the rebels, to create no-fly zones to protect refugees, or to use military force to destroy or seize Syria’s huge stockpile of chemical weapons.

But White House and senior Pentagon officials fear that U.S. weapons shipments could end up in the hands of Islamic militants, who are playing a growing role in the revolt, or could increase the suffering in Syria without resulting in Assad’s ouster.

Conservative lawmakers and their allies say Obama has raised the bar so high that it is unlikely he will take action. They argue that Iran and North Korea will view his response as a signal that U.S. threats can be ignored.

(CNN) —

Israel has agreed to free a limited number of Palestinian prisoners in a goodwill gesture, an Israeli minister said Saturday, a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a step toward revived peace talks.

An agreement has been reached that “establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between” Palestinians and Israel, Kerry said Friday in Amman, Jordan.

“This is a significant and welcome step forward,” Kerry said.

The announcement came as Kerry visited the Middle East this week and came up with a formula for reanimating peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian territories, a source close to the talks said.

Israel’s defense minister said Saturday that his government expressed its intention to begin talks with the Palestinians immediately.

“We are getting to the negotiations with clean hands and great desire to get to an arrangement that will end the conflict,” Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon said.

Kerry has been working intensely with the Palestinian side to get them on board, and he met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as chief peace negotiator Saeb Erakat.

Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s Minister of Strategic Affairs, spoke of the prisoner release Saturday morning during a discussion in Ramat Gan, said his spokesman, Yair Cohen.

“As the negotiations proceed, Israel agrees to free, as a goodwill gesture, a limited number of prisoners during the period of the negotiations,” Steinitz said.

It is not yet clear how many prisoners will be released and who they will be.

Caught by surprise?

A senior Palestinian official, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation, told CNN there was much uncertainty over the latest developments.

“It looks like all the Palestinian leadership were taken by surprise regarding the decision and announcement by Mr. Kerry and the decision by President Abbas,” he said. “There is nothing clear and we need clarifications.”

The official said all prisoners being held in Israeli jails should be freed, but that no information has been given on who might be released.

Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator and leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, a political party, told CNN that the negotiations “are bound to fail sooner than later” if there is no commitment to clear terms of reference and a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territory.

Kerry’s declaration “reveals a very fragile situation which could collapse at any moment because of internal differences in the Israeli government, which refuses to commit to internationally accepted 1967 borders, and which is refusing to stop the settlement construction and activities,” he said.

On prisoners, Barghouti said: “We welcome any release of prisoners, especially who were arrested before 1993.” But, he added, “It makes no sense if Israel releases 200 prisoners and arrests 250 in the same month.”

’Courageous leadership’

Speaking in Amman, Kerry said that if everything goes as expected, representatives for the two sides will join him in Washington “for initial talks within the next week or so, and a further announcement will be made by all of us at that time.”

Kerry praised the “courageous leadership” of both Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying they had chosen to make difficult decisions.

“They have courageously recognized that in order for Israelis and Palestinians to live together side by side in peace and security, they must begin by sitting at the table together in direct talks.”

Kerry thanked Jordan’s King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Nasr Judeh for their help during his visit, as well as the Arab League for its support of the peace initiative.

King Abdullah arrived in Cairo on Saturday to brief Egyptian officials about the agreement reached between the Palestinians and Israel on resuming peace talks, Jordan’s royal court press office said.

His visit is the first to Egypt by a foreign head of state since the July 3 ousting of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy.

Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces and the U.S. European Command are scheduled to hold a bilateral aerial exercise Sunday by both of their air forces, Israeli officials said. The regularly scheduled exercises will last about two weeks.

’Right for our future’

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni lauded the prospect of peace.

“These past few months were long, filled with doubt and cynicism,” Livni said in a statement Friday. “But now, four years of political stagnation are coming to an end.

“I know that, despite this being an opportunity, once the negotiations begin they will be complex – but I am convinced with all my heart that this is the right thing for our future, our security, our economy and Israel’s values.”

She expressed respect for Netanyahu “for making the decisions representing Israel’s important interests, as well for American Secretary of State, John Kerry, which led us and the Palestinians into the negotiations room.”

In the Palestinian territory of Gaza, however, Hamas dismissed the renewed effort for peace talks.

“This negotiation will be useless. It is not going to achieve anything for the Palestinian people. It will not help the prisoner issue, the border issue or the land issue,” the group said in a statement. Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza shortly after Hamas was elected to run its government in 2006.

Talks based on land swaps, pre-1967 borders?

Kerry urged people to wait for all the elements of the agreement to be formalized, rather than guess at the detail.

“Any speculation or reports you may read in the media … are conjecture … because the people who know the facts are not talking about them,” he said.

One of the reports Kerry may have been referencing was a Reuters report quoting an Israeli official who said the Jewish state agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps.

It would be in line with a decades-old United Nations resolution calling on Israel to release territories it gained during a war, a demand that Israel has historically fought. But it would help create contiguous borders for a future Palestinian state that would coexist next to a Jewish state.

Israel’s official reaction to the report has been denial.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-ponders-canceling-moscow-talks-putin-081728149.html,,[],Obama ponders canceling Moscow talks with Putin,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is considering canceling a fall summit between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, a move that would further aggravate the already tense relationship between the two leaders.

The White House is dangling that option over the Russians as Moscow considers a temporary asylum petition from Edward Snowden, the American accused of leaking information about classified U.S. intelligence programs. But officials have privately signaled that scrapping the bilateral talks would also be retaliation for other areas of disagreement with Russia, including its continued support for Syrian President Bashar Assad's attacks against civilians.

Regardless of what happens with Snowden, the White House says Obama will still attend an international summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. But officials have gone out of their way in recent days to avoid publicly committing to the meetings in Moscow.

""The president intends to travel to Russia for the G20 Summit,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""And I have no further announcements to make beyond what we've said in the past about the president's travel to Russia in the fall.""

By simply considering cancellation of the trip, the Obama administration is indicating its concern the Kremlin will allow Snowden to take refuge in Russia. The White House has called on Russia to return the 30-year-old former government contract systems analyst to the U.S. where he is facing espionage charges.

Snowden, in a temporary asylum request submitted by his lawyer Tuesday, claimed he faces persecution from the U.S. government and could face torture or death.

Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the White House's cancellation threat could be effective leverage over Putin, who likely wants to avoid an embarrassment on the world stage.

""When the spotlight of the world is on him and Russia, he doesn't want that spotlight to reveal a lot of negative things which are going to be distractions,"" Kuchins said.

Story continues

Pulling the plug on the U.S.-Russia talks would deepen the tensions between the two leaders. And it would likely make it even more difficult for the two countries to find common ground on areas of disagreement that plague the relationship.

The U.S. accuses Russia of providing military support to Assad that has allowed him to cling to power during more than two years of clashes with rebels seeking to overthrow his government. The U.S. deeply angered Russia earlier this year when it announced sanctions against 18 Russians as part of a law named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was arrested in 2008 for tax evasion after accusing Russian police officials of stealing $230 million in tax rebates. Russia also announced last year that it was banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children, a move seen as a retaliation for the Magnitsky act, passed last year.

On Thursday, the White House also said it was ""deeply disappointed and concerned"" by the conviction of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who challenged the Kremlin with exposures of high-level corruption and mocked the leadership with biting satire. He was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday in a verdict that fueled street protests near Red Square and drew condemnation from the West.

Kuchins said that while granting Snowden asylum would certainly be the impetus for canceling Obama's Moscow trip, it would not be the only reason.

""It would be saying at least two things to the Russians,"" Kuchins said. ""That granting asylum to Edward Snowden was a bridge too far, and secondly that we don't feel like we're actually losing so much out of the cancellation of the summit because we didn't expect to get much out of it.""

Some U.S. lawmakers are calling on Obama to go beyond simply canceling his talks with Putin. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has also called on the U.S. to boycott next year's Winter Olympics scheduled for Sochi, Russia.

Special to USA TODAY

EU%27s foreign policy chief says Yanukovych %27intends to sign%27 deal

The West has increased pressure on Yanukovych

Protesters signal they may be unmoved even if Yanukovych agrees to sign

KIEV, Ukraine – A European Union official said Thursday that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych intends to sign an agreement with the European Union, but some of those protesting in support of the deal said that won't stop their demonstrations.

""If the deal is signed now, I won't leave the protest,"" said Dmitry Zhuk, 24, a Kiev resident who has joined the protests after his workday almost every day since they started last month. ""I don't think anyone will leave.""



Earlier Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Yanukovych, who had rejected the proposed deal in recent weeks, ""made it clear to me that he intends to sign the association agreement.""

The about-face from Yanukovych could help ease tensions after three weeks of protests and building occupations in the capital city of Kiev, but experts and the protesters themselves said that in the wake of a violent crackdown that broadened the protesters' demands, they are unlikely to immediately disperse.

""People want to keep on building pressure definitely until the 17th of December,"" said Orysia Lutsevych, a non-resident fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think-tank.

Yanukovych is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential strategic partnership on that date, Lutsevych said, adding that protesters remaining out on the streets could deter Yanukovych from signing any kind of agreement with Russia.

Protests have been taking place in Kiev's central Independence Square for weeks, and in the past week, violent clashes have erupted after large numbers of police and security forces tried to clear roadblocks and occupy buildings and the square itself.

The protests were sparked by Yanukovych's surprising decision, prompted by Russian pressure, not to sign a far-reaching trade and cooperation pact with the European Union at a summit in late November in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.

The parties have a chance to get talks back on track, but the frayed relationship between Ukraine and its would-be partners in the EU could hamper an agreement, Lutsevych said.

""The main story is that the EU, as always, says, 'We are open,' but they were also disgusted, and I'm sure the trust is lowering every day,"" she said. ""After Vilnius, it was very low, and now after all the violence they used overnight on the protesters … think about it.""

Lutsevych said the violent crackdowns against the protest were ""a kind of tipping point.""

The protesters ""saw that this government is not willing to listen to people and is trying to pretend it's business as usual,"" she said. ""But it's not business as usual for them.""

Zhuk echoed that sentiment.

""At first, it was indeed the protest for signing the association agreement with EU, but after what happened — all the force used against protesters — only someone who is completely ignorant can say, 'OK, now everything will change to the best' and go home,"" he said.

Lutsevych said a pact with the EU would entail far more than an agreement from Yanukovych to pursue it.

The status of former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, whose arrest in 2011 and ongoing incarceration for abuse of power, which many in the EU establishment view as politicized, sits atop the list of potential issues.

""The EU agreement will not happen until Tymoshenko is released and all these things are done,"" Lutsevych said. ""They may have a declaration of intention to do something, but that's not enough.""

She said she expected the EU to ask Ukraine to make certain changes to the electoral code and to the prosecutor's office. The Ukrainian government is trying to ""divert attention to only economic things.""

On the streets, Ukrainians overwhelmingly supported accession to the EU. There were a few dissenters.

""The protesting students heard a fairy tale about Europe being a heaven, about a visa-free regime and about secure life for elderly people,"" said Anna Shyshkova, who witnessed protests in the southern Ukrainian city of Simferopol. ""But many of them don't even think about the price that Ukraine will have to pay to sign (the) association agreement.

""I don't want a Greece scenario for Ukraine, with 300 billion-euro debt, production quotas and destroyed vineyards,"" she said."

Tens of thousands of world leaders, family members, friends and mourners crowded into FNB Stadium in Johannesburg in the cold rain Tuesday to pay tribute to South Africa's anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.

Here are some quotes from the memorial service:

• ""Nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, persistence and faith. He tells us what's possible not just in the pages of dusty history books, but in our own lives as well."" — President Obama

• ""His life was just an extraordinary journey, from beginning to end, with such an effect, both on his own country, and on the rest of the world. So, enjoy today, enjoy and celebrate what he achieved. We may not see his like again."" — former British prime minister Gordon Brown

• ""Mr. Mandela was the pride of the African people. He has dedicated his entire life to the development and progress of the African content."" — Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao

Initial %24100%2C000 made available for health care%2C water%2C sanitation

First responders on the ground to assess damages%2C needs

Americans urged to make cash donations to reputable charities

Help is on the way to areas of the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development and humanitarian relief groups.

The Obama administration made an initial $100,000 available Saturday to provide basic health care, clean water and sanitation following the Philippines government's request for international assistance. That figure is likely to grow as damage and humanitarian needs are assessed.

At the request of the Philippine government, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel directed U.S. Pacific Command to deploy ships and aircraft to support search-and-rescue operations and airlift emergency supplies, according to a statement released by the Defense Department press office.

USAID, the lead agency for the international humanitarian response, deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to the area to make those assessments. The team's early surveys in some of the country's hardest-hit areas found severe damage, particularly in the towns of Tacloban and Ormoc on the island of Leyte, which were virtually wiped out by the storm. One of the first supplies delivered was plastic sheeting to be used for emergency shelter.

""Today our hearts go out to the Filipino people,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""The United States can and must do everything in our power to assist our friend and ally in dealing with the devastating consequences of this storm, and to help meet the needs of the Filipino people in addressing this disaster.""

The American Red Cross deployed staff members to the area and activated its family tracing services for people seeking to locate missing family members. With phone lines down across the area, the agency urged people to be patient and keep trying to make contact.

Google has launched a person finder for survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, where friends and family can search for information on a loved one or enter information about a person's whereabouts so others know they are safe.

Private aid groups said there was an immediate need for rice, canned foods, clean water, medicine, clothes, shelter and blankets. But U.S. officials said that, just as in other disasters, the best thing Americans can do is donate cash to reputable humanitarian organizations.

Those seeking to send help can go to website for InterAction, a consortium of 180 non-government organizations involved in global assistance programs. Among the members are the American Red Cross, AmeriCares, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Save the Children, U.S. Fund for UNICEF and World Food Program USA.

In addition, USAID operates a Center for International Disaster Information, which helps prospective donors get the most bang for their bucks."
http://news.yahoo.com/iran-nuclear-talks-hit-snag-u-sanctions-move-152811100.html,,[],"U.S. sanctions move angers Iran, Russia sees threat to nuclear deal","By Fredrik Dahl and Steve Gutterman VIENNA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A breakthrough agreement to end the standoff over Iran's nuclear program appeared to face its first major difficulty on Friday with Russia warning that expanding a U.S. sanctions blacklist could seriously complicate the deal's implementation. Russia, which, along with the United States, is among the six world powers that negotiated the November 24 interim accord with Tehran, echoed Iranian criticism that it violated the spirit of the deal and could ""block things"". The United States on Thursday blacklisted additional companies and people under existing sanctions intended to prevent Iran from obtaining the capability to make nuclear weapons. Iran denies any such aims. Diplomats said Iran, in what appeared to be a response, interrupted technical talks in Vienna with the six nations over how to implement the agreement, under which Tehran is to curb its atomic activities in return for limited sanctions easing. The developments highlighted potential obstacles negotiators face in pressing ahead with efforts to resolve a decade-old dispute between the Islamic Republic and the West that has stirred fears of a new Middle East war. Western diplomats said the inconclusive outcome of the December 9-12 expert-level discussions should not be seen as a sign that the deal hammered out nearly three weeks ago was in trouble. But Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iran's semi-official Fars news agency in reaction to the U.S. decision that it was evaluating the situation and would ""react accordingly"", adding, ""It is against the spirit of the Geneva deal."" Russia also made its concerns clear. ""The U.S. administration's decision goes against the spirit of this document,"" said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, referring to the Geneva agreement between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany. ""Widening American 'blacklists' could seriously complicate the fulfillment of the Geneva agreement, which proposes easing sanctions pressure."" In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she did not think the blacklistings announced on Thursday had made the negotiations more difficult. ""No, I don't. I think it was always going to be very complicated,"" Harf told reporters, adding the United States had told Iranian officials in Vienna that more designations were coming. DEAL OPPONENTS Russia built Iran's first nuclear power plant and has much better ties with Tehran than Western states. It supported four rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear program but has criticized the United States and Europe for imposing additional sanctions. U.S. officials said the blacklisting move showed the Geneva deal ""does not, and will not, interfere with our continued efforts to expose and disrupt those supporting Iran's nuclear program or seeking to evade our sanctions"". The new measure, the first such enforcement action since Geneva, targeted entities that are suspected of involvement in the proliferation of materials for weapons of mass destruction and trying to evade the current sanctions. Some U.S. lawmakers want further sanctions on the Islamic state. But the administration of President Barack Obama has campaigned to hold off on new measures for now to create space for the diplomatic push to settle the nuclear dispute. Iran's ambassador to France said expanding the blacklist played into the hands of those opposing the deal - including hardliners in Iran irked by the foreign policy shift and apprehensive that they are losing influence over Iran's most powerful man, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ""This agreement has opponents both inside Iran and outside Iran,"" Ali Ahani told reporters at a meeting of business and political leaders in Monaco. ""We are determined to keep to our commitments, but we have to be sure that on the other side they are serious, and that we can show to our people that we can trust them and that the West is a viable partner."" ""The contents of this accord are quite clear. It was decided not to add sanctions. This type of decision blocks things,"" added Ahani, speaking on behalf of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who pulled out of the World Policy Conference after his mother was taken ill. 'NOT PANICKING' The Geneva deal was designed to halt Iran's nuclear advances for six months to buy time for negotiations on a final settlement. Scope for diplomacy widened after Iran elected the pragmatic Hassan Rouhani as president in June. He had promised to reduce Tehran's isolation and win sanctions easing. Under the agreement, Iran will restrain its atomic activities in return for some easing of the international sanctions that have battered the major oil producer's economy. But one diplomat said the Iranian delegation in Vienna suddenly announced late on Thursday - hours after Washington made its blacklisting decision public - that it had received instructions to return to Tehran: ""It was quite unexpected."" An EU diplomat said he did not believe the decision was linked to the issues under discussion in Vienna, but rather ""their reaction to moves in the U.S. on sanctions"". The hope was that it was a temporary problem: ""The Iranians have been committed to making this work. We are not panicking."" Iranian officials were not available for comment. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected the implementation talks to resume in the coming days. ""We have been hard at it in Vienna ... we are making progress but I think that they're at a point in those talks where folks feel a need to consult and take a moment,"" he said during a visit to Israel. ""There is every expectation that the talks are going to continue in the next few days and that we will proceed to the full implementation of that plan."" A spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who coordinates the discussions with Iran, also said they were expected to resume soon. ""After four days of lengthy and detailed talks, reflecting the complexity of the technical issues discussed, it became clear that further work is needed,"" Michael Mann said.

USA TODAY

The White House fired back at Russian President Vladimir Putin for his op-ed article Thursday, saying Russia's own actions prove that the United States is an ""exceptional"" nation.

""Unlike Russia, the United States stands up for democratic values and human rights in our own country and around the world,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Carney said The New York Times publication of Putin's column underscores the American commitment to freedom of expression, and ""that is not a tradition shared in Russia ... And it is a fact freedom of expression has been on the decrease over the past dozen or so years in Russia.""

Putin challenged the notion of American exceptionalism in a Times op-ed in which he said that a military strike at Syria ""would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism.""

An attack could also ""undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa."" Putin added.

Putin also said his relationship with President Obama ""is marked by growing trust,"" but he criticized Obama's claims of ""American exceptionalism.""

""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" Putin wrote. ""There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too.""

Playing to American opinion, Putin also referenced recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan:

""It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you're either with us or against us.'""

Back at the White House, Carney said the op-ed underscores the fact that Russia's ""prestige and credibility"" is on the line as Putin calls for Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to international control.

""It is also worth noting,"" Carney said, ""that Russia is isolated and alone in blaming the opposition for the chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21."""

But that’s what President Obama seemed to go out of his way to do at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service Tuesday. Although Castro has imprisoned American Alan Gross for four years now, CNN alternately applauded and made excuses for the handshake.

Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.

Obviously worried that shaking hands with a dictator might hurt Obama politically, the media were quick to play goalie. CNN’s Chris Cuomo went so far as to read Obama’s mind and report on the president’s true intent:

And that handshake obviously was a huge moment. But not to be misunderstood, the handshake with Raul Castro, the president of Cuba, we believe was President Obama showing respect to Nelson Mandela and the occasion of today, the spirit of reconciliation. Of course, it will be dissected politically. …

No matter the ongoing political disputes, on this day, it was about something bigger. It was about forgiveness and reconciliation, because it was about a man who was bigger: Nelson Mandela. And that is what the tribute has been all about today.

Cuomo never bothered to mention that Castro is a dictator.

UPDATE: Reporting during the 9am hour, CNN’s Jim Acosta said that it “would have been sort of impolite” for Obama not to shake hands with Raul Castro. Carol Costello suggested that the handshake “surely helps” to thaw the Cold War mentality between Cuba and America. Acosta reminded Costello that Cuba is in its fourth year of holding American Alan Gross. At no time did Costello or Acosta correctly refer to Castro as what he is: a dictator.

The Weekly Standard grabbed CNN video of an excited Chrstiane Amanpour: “Castro, he’s shaking hands with Raúl Castro! … This is a man, it is so true, who brought people together in life and he continues to bring people together today.”

Because everyone in the elite media either coordinates or thinks alike (it has to be one or the other), moments later the USA Today’s Susan Page tweeted out the exact same spin.

Fifa has lifted its global ban on Cameroon after a normalisation committee began its work on Monday to run the country's football federation.

It is being headed by former Minister of Education, Sports, Joseph Owona.

Earlier this month, Fifa banned Cameroon for governmental interference into the running of the country's football.

The condition for the lifting of the ban was that the committee was allowed to begin work.

Fifa said in a statement: ""As requested by the Fifa Emergency Committee, the normalisation committee that was appointed on 20 July 2013 was able to take up its duties this Monday... at the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot) headquarters, with Fifa and Confederation of African Football (Caf) observers present.

""The lifting of the suspension means that Fecafoot's clubs, officials and other representatives can immediately resume their activities, which had been interrupted.""

The normalisation committee will be working under the supervision of Fifa's Primo Carvaro and Caf representative Prosper Abega.

Cameroon will now be free to play their crucial 2014 World Cup qualifier away to Libya in September, with the winner advancing to the final play-off round.

Meanwhile, club side Coton Sport will also be allowed to continue their African Champions League campaign - having failed to take part in their opening Group B match this weekend because of the ban.

The move follows a recent visit to meet Fifa president Sepp Blatter by a delegation from Cameroon that included current Sports Minister Adoum Garoua.

The normalisation committee will now act as the electoral body and will revise the statutes of the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot).

It will also organise federation elections to be held by 31 March next year.

Members of the committee will not be eligible for any of the open positions at Fecafoot.

There had been confusion within Cameroon football before the ban with federation elections postponed on several occasions.

When the elections did go ahead, Iya Mohamed was re-elected president despite the fact he is being detained by the authorities in Cameroon.

He is being investigated after being accused of embezzling money at state-owned Cotton Development Company.

Soon after the election results were announced, Fecafoot's elections appeals committee declared them void.

In the aftermath, John Begheni Ndeh announced himself head of the federation and started work with the help of police, which was deemed as political interference by Fifa.

Regarding institutional derangements, he is the infection against which he pretends to be an immunization.

In the Illinois legislature, he voted “present” 129 times to avoid difficulties; now he stoops from his executive grandeur to tutor Congress on accountability. In Washington, where he condescends as a swan slumming among starlings, he insists that, given the urgency of everything he desires, he “can’t wait” for Congress to vote on his programs or to confirm persons he nominates to implement them. The virtues of his policies and personnel are supposedly patent and sufficient to justify imposing both by executive decrees.

In foreign policy, too, he luxuriates in acting, as most modern presidents have improvidently done, without the tiresome persuasion required to earn congressional ratifications. Without even a precipitating event such as Syria’s poison gas attack, and without any plausible argument that an emergency precluded deliberation, he waged protracted war against Libya with bombers and cruise missiles but without Congress.

Now, concerning Syria, he lectures Congress, seeking an accomplice while talking about accountability. Perhaps he deserves Congress’s complicity — if he can convince it that he can achieve a success he can define. If success is a “shot across the bow” of Syria’s regime, he cannot fail: By avoiding the bow, such a shot merely warns of subsequent actions.

Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has advertised his skepticism about intervening in Syria. His very public intrusion into a policy debate may exceed what is proper for the uniformed military, but he seems to have played Obama as dexterously as Duke Ellington played a piano. Dempsey assured Obama that the military mission could be accomplished a month from now. (Because the bow will still be there to be shot across?) This enabled Obama to say that using the military to affirm an international norm (about poison gas), although urgent enough to involve Congress, is not so urgent that Congress’s recess required abbreviation.

Britain’s Parliament inadvertently revived the constitutional standing of Congress when British Prime Minister David Cameron’s incompetent management of the parliament’s vote resulted in the body refusing to authorize an attack. His fumble was a function of Obama’s pressuring him for haste. If Parliament had authorized an attack — seven switched votes would have sufficed — Obama probably would already have attacked, without any thought about Congress’s prerogatives. The Financial Times’s Gideon ­Rachman reports that, in an Aug. 24 telephone conversation with Cameron, Obama “made it clear that he wanted a swift military response — before global outrage dissipated and Bashar al-Assad’s regime had the chance to prepare its defenses.”

Many Republicans are reluctant to begin yet another military intervention in a distant and savage civil war. Other Republicans, whose appetite for such interventions has not been satiated by recent feasts of failure, will brand reluctance as “isolationism.”

Reluctant Republicans can invoke Dwight Eisenhower. He, who in 1961 enriched America’s lexicon with the phrase “military-industrial complex,” sought the presidency in 1952 to prevent its capture by what he considered an isolationist, or at least insufficiently internationalist, Republican faction represented by “Mr. Republican,” Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. Yet after one look as president-elect at the front line in Korea, Eisenhower ended that war. To advisers urging intervention on France’s behalf in Vietnam, he said (this from his memoirs): “Employment of airstrikes alone to support French troops in the jungle would create a double jeopardy: it would comprise an act of war and would also entail the risk of having intervened and lost.” He was not an interventionist regarding the 1956 Hungarian revolution, and he not only refused to support the 1956 British-French-Israeli attack on Egypt, he ruthlessly forced its termination. About his brief and tranquil intervention in Lebanon, he wrote: “I had been careful to use [about U.S. forces] the term ‘stationed in’ Lebanon.”

Obama’s sanctimony about his moral superiority to a Congress he considers insignificant has matched his hypocrisy regarding his diametrically opposed senatorial and presidential understandings of the proper modalities regarding uses of military force. Now he asks from the Congress he disdains an authorization he considers superfluous. By asking, however reluctantly, he begins the urgent task of lancing the boil of executive presumption. Surely he understands the perils of being denied an authorization he has sought, and then treating the denial as irrelevant.

http://news.yahoo.com/us-military-evacuates-embassy-personnel-yemen-122432888.html,,[],US military evacuates embassy personnel from Yemen,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military evacuated non-essential U.S. government personnel from Yemen on Tuesday due to the high risk of attack by al-Qaida that has triggered temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Middle East and Africa.

The State Department said in a travel warning that it ordered the evacuation ""due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks"" and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave immediately because of an ""extremely high"" security threat level.

""As staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,"" the travel warning said. The U.S. Embassy is located in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen.

Yemeni security officials said a suspected U.S. drone strike at about 2 a.m. local time Tuesday killed four alleged al-Qaida members in a volatile eastern province of the country. The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said. It wasn't immediately clear if the decision to evacuate the embassy, made earlier, was connected to the drone strike.

The Yemeni officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the media, said they believe one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a senior al-Qaida member. It's the fourth drone attack in the past two weeks to hit a car believed to be carrying al-Qaida members.

Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said the U.S. Air Force transported State Department personnel out of Sanaa early Tuesday. ""The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,"" Little added.

A senior defense official said Tuesday that between 50 and 100 diplomatic personnel were flown out of Sanaa in a C-17 military transport as dawn broke and were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said dozens of military troops remain in the country, including those who were doing security at the embassy and others conducting training with Yemeni troops.

Story continues

Britain's Foreign Office also announced that it had evacuated all staff from its embassy in Yemen due to security concerns. The office said the British embassy staff were ""temporarily withdrawn to the U.K."" on Tuesday, but declined further comment. Previously, the U.K. had said the embassy would be closed until the end of the Muslim festival of Eid later this week.

A U.S. intelligence official and a Mideast diplomat told The Associated Press that the current shutdown of embassies in the Middle East and Africa was instigated by an intercepted secret message between al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri and Nasser al-Wahishi, the leader of the Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, about plans for a major terror attack. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The State Department on Sunday closed a total of 19 diplomatic posts until next Saturday. They include posts in Bangladesh and across North Africa and the Middle East as well as East Africa, including Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius.

Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a separate statement issued early Tuesday that the department issued the order for Yemen because of concern about a ""threat stream indicating the potential for terrorist attacks against U.S. persons or facilities overseas, especially emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.""

The statement said U.S. citizens who choose to stay in Yemen despite the travel warning should limit nonessential travel within the country and make their own contingency emergency plans.

AQAP, gathered in small cells scattered across Yemen's vast under-governed regions, has proven to be a tenacious enemy.

Officials say al-Zawahri, who took over for Osama bin Laden and works from Pakistan, has reached out to the Yemeni branch, cementing their ties and further signaling the AQAP is once again looking to target U.S. and Western interests after a sustained period of more local and regional focus.

For puzzled Americans who've been told that al-Qaida is on the decline, the latest warnings raise questions about how successful America's war on terror has been and whether the terror group has been able to reorganize and reconstitute itself since bin Laden's death in May 2011.

And, although U.S. officials agreed a year ago to restart military aid to Yemen, it's unclear how much of the new aircraft and weapons have arrived. After aid to Yemen was frozen for some time, the U.S. military is once again on the ground there training Yemeni special operations forces and has delivered more than a dozen helicopters to the Yemeni military and provided training for them, U.S. defense officials said.

But other weapons and equipment are still in the pipeline, according to a Mideast official.

The latest terror alert was triggered in part when the secret message between al-Zawahri and al-Wahishi was intercepted several weeks ago.

There long has been movement of fighters between Pakistan and Yemen, and discussions between the two groups, but the latest communication triggered worries and prompted the U.S. to take steps to boost security. The embassy closures came one day after a meeting between President Barack Obama and Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi.

AQAP has been widely considered al-Qaida's most dangerous affiliate for several years. Even though the group lost Anwar al-Awlaki — one of its key inspirational leaders — to a U.S. drone strike in 2011, al-Wahishi and the group's master bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, remain on the loose and determined to target the U.S. and other Western interests.

The group is linked to the botched Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights a year later — both incidents involving al-Asiri's expertise.

In recent years, however, AQAP has been focused more on making gains at home, taking advantage of an unstable government and overstretched military that was forced to concentrate on protecting the political center in Sanaa. As a result, said a senior defense official, AQAP was able to expand its foothold in the south, capture more weapons and gain control of additional territory.

(CNN) —

Even if the Senate backs President Barack Obama’s call for military action against Syria, a wall of outright opposition or skepticism from Democrats and Republicans in the House makes approval there very difficult.

House Speaker John Boehner, who backs Obama on the issue, welcomed news on Friday that the president would deliver a national address on Tuesday to try to sway public opinion, which now opposes such a step.

But Boehner’s spokesman signaled that the votes aren’t in the House for passing a resolution authorizing force against Syria and the GOP is placing the burden squarely on Obama’s shoulders.

“Only a president can convince the public that military action is required. We only hope this isn’t coming too late to make the difference,” Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

Still, senior House Republican aides find it difficult to see a path for passage.

Boehner’s top deputy, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, also supports the president and is talking to members and urging them to review classified materials that administration officials say bolsters their case for military action.

Cantor penned an editorial in his hometown Richmond paper explaining why he believes military action is needed.

“America has a compelling national security interest to prevent and respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction, especially by a terrorist state, and to prevent further instability in a region of vital interest to the United States,” he said.

’Constructive’ talks but little headway on crisis

But rank and file House GOP members have frequently ignored their leaders and the vote in favor of action is stalled in the single digits, including the support expressed by senior leadership, a CNN tally showed.

One senior GOP House aide said prospects for meaningful additional Republican support is “bad” and “momentum is with the ‘nay’ vote.”

Congress is ending its summer recess and members formally get back to work next week.

In a memo to House Republicans outlining the fall schedule, Cantor suggested the timetable for the vote, which Boehner initially planned for next week, could slip a week.

“Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next two weeks” Cantor wrote.

But House GOP leaders are leaving open the possibility the House will not bring up the resolution if it fails in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted on Friday that the necessary votes were in the Democratic-led chamber to pass a resolution calling for limited force.

The House plans to wait to see if something passes the Senate before making final decisions on the language or timing of any House vote, according to multiple Republican sources.

One undecided GOP member, Rep Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, returned for a briefing on Friday. He told CNN that he came back to hear details about the military objectives directly from the administration instead of through the media.

Obama to address American people on Tuesday

Although his constituents are “very opposed” to military action, Hudson said he would base his vote on what he thought was best for the country and “let the politics sort itself out later.”

The lack of GOP support places enormous pressure on House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was one of the chief critics of the Iraq war, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.

The two will need to persuade well over a majority of the 200 House Democrats to stand behind Obama, also a Democrat.

Top House Democratic aides counter that it’s too soon to predict defeat because most Democrats are reserving judgment until they hear details in a classified briefing on Monday evening.

The administration is dispatching top officials to make a final push before Obama’s speech.

Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey will conduct the joint House-Senate session in the Capitol.

“We’re not going to know until our members get back into town. A lot of people haven’t had access to the briefings or the classified documents,” one of Democratic aide noted.

But for many House members who already have attended classified meetings on Syria this week, the sessions seem to raise more questions.

Syria’s rebels: 20 things you need to know

Hawaii Democratic Rep Tulsi Gabbard, a former Iraq war veteran, told reporters she was undecided and then ticked off remaining questions she had after a two-hour session with top administration officials.

“What are the unintended consequences? What are the outcomes? What are the next moves that could potentially occur that would involve U.S. interests, U.S military, costs - both in human lives, as well as in resources?” Gabbard asked.

A senior administration official told CNN that top officials reached out to more than 125 House members through a variety of conference calls and one-on-one conversations over the past two weeks.

But the “flood the zone” White House approach hasn’t prevented a steady list of members from voicing outright opposition or criticism that the case for military action is thin.

The fact that so many members in his own party remain undecided or publicly opposed illustrates that Obama’s political capital in Congress is quite low.

California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu participated in a conference call with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on Wednesday and remains undecided.

While she said there’s no question that the al-Assad government used chemical weapons she outlined a laundry list of outstanding questions.

She wants details about contingency plans if Syria retaliates, the lack of international support, reasons why diplomatic efforts can’t be explored, and the direct cost to taxpayers.

Chu says her constituents “overwhelmingly … want me to vote ‘no’ on this.”

She described House Democrats as “war weary. We just came from Iraq and Afghanistan wars. We are war skeptical,” Chu said.

Rep Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who remained undecided, highlighted the stakes for Obama to change minds or persuade Democrats to back him on Syria.

He called it “certainly one of the most important speeches in his career as the president of the United States.”"

The blast reflected the deep insecurity in the North African nation, where multiple armed militias run rampant -- many of them dominated by Islamic militants -- and the central government is too weak to rein them in.

The violence is particularly sharp in Benghazi, the country's second largest city, which has seen frequent killings of Libyan security officials and a string of attacks on diplomatic facilities, most notably the Sept. 11, 2012 storming of a U.S. diplomatic post that killed the ambassador and three other Americans.

The attack comes in the wake of a U.S. special forces raid last weekend that snatched an al Qaeda suspect from the streets of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, spiriting him off to custody in a U.S. warship. Many militiamen and Islamic militants were angered by the raid, blaming the Libyan government -- and on Thursday, gunmen briefly kidnapped the country's prime minister.

Some militiamen have hinted of retaliation against Americans -- or other foreigners -- but there was no immediate sign Friday's bombing was linked to the raid.

The Swedish and Finnish consulates are among the few foreign diplomatic posts still operating in Benghazi.

A Libyan security official said the car bomb was detonated by remote control on Friday in the upscale neighborhood of Benghazi. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.

The morning blast heavily damaged the windows and facade of the building, but there were no reports of injuries, Ursula Ahlen of the Swedish Foreign Ministry in Stockholm said. The facility was closed for business since Friday is a weekend day in Libya.

""All the doors were ripped up by the blast. When I walked out to the stair case it had been blackened by soot,"" the former honorary consul, Anders Nilsson -- who still lives at the site with his sister, the current honorary consul, told Swedish broadcaster SVT by telephone from Benghazi. Nilsson said he had just returned from morning shopping and was in the kitchen when the blast went off. He said eight or nine people were in the building at the time.

Finland's honorary consul was also in the building at the time but was not hurt, the Foreign Ministry in Helsinki said.

The consulates perform diplomatic functions like issuing visas and citizen services, but they are headed by ""honorary consuls"" -- nationals who were already residing in the city and were named by their home governments to represent the nations, as opposed to members of the diplomatic corps assigned there.

Foreign diplomats have been repeatedly targeted amid Libya's continuous instability, particularly in Benghazi, where Islamic militants are particularly strong among militias. The 2012 attack on the American diplomatic post has been blamed on militants believed to be linked to al Qaeda.

In January, militants opened fire on the car of the Italian consul in Benghazi. He was not hurt in the attack. In June 2012, the British ambassador's vehicle was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, injuring two of his bodyguards, as he visited the city.

Last week, a mob attacked the Russian Embassy in the capital, Tripoli, climbing over its walls, pulling down a gate and firing in the air, prompting Moscow to evacuate its diplomats and their families. The attack was sparked when a Russian woman was arrested for allegedly killing a Libyan air force officer and his mother.

Libya's central government has struggled to impose its authority over the country since the 2011 ouster of autocrat Muammar Qaddafi. It has been helpless to rein in militias, which originated as rebel brigades against Qaddafi but have mushroomed into powerful forces of their own while the army and police remain weak, under-equipped and under-paid.

Militiamen abducted Prime Minister Ali Zidan from his residence in a Tripoli hotel before dawn on Thursday. He was freed hours later by another militia.

But outrage against Zidan continues among many Islamists over Saturday's U.S. raid that captured al Qaeda suspect Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known by his alias Abu Anas al-Libi. Many militiamen and militants accuse Zidan of cooperating with the Americans in the operation, though the government has denied having any prior knowledge of the raid.

Al-Libi is accused by the U.S. in connection with the 1998 bombings of its embassies in Tanzania and Kenya."

Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced legislation to create a special select committee to investigate both the terrorist attack and subsequent actions by President Barack Obama’s administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Wolf’s bill has 161 co-sponsors. House GOP Leadership has not scheduled a vote on the bill.

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) plans to harness the support for Wolf’s bill into a “discharge petition” that would force a floor vote on the bill. The petition would need to be signed by 218 members of the House.

“I’m going to describe what a discharge petition is because a lot of people have asked me questions exactly what it is,” Stockman said at the Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building. “It’s to ask our leadership or actually demand from our leadership that we have a vote on Frank Wolf’s bill. [Wolf is] a congressman from Virginia who has a long history of being here and is articulate in demanding that we have an independent investigation.”

Stockman added, while gesturing to blown up photographs behind him of the four Americans murdered in Benghazi, “if Congress is silenced,” then “the blood of these folks behind us is on our hands.”

“We can’t be silent any more,” he said. “It’s been a year going by that we haven’t had justice. These folks demand justice. They cry out for justice. Silence is not an option any more. We’re going to challenge them. We’re going to have a discharge petition. I encourage you to contact your congressman to sign the discharge petition.”

Stockman expects most or all of the 161 members on Wolf’s bill to support the discharge petition, and at the press conference specifically said House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) is supportive of circumventing House Leadership via the discharge petition.

Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Dick Brauer, the founder of Special Operations Speaks, said the combination of Wolf’s bill and Stockman’s discharge petition “would be done to fully investigate, something that has not been done to date, the national tragedy in Benghazi, where we lost four great citizens in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.”

“You will hear this from me and others today but we need your help and your friends’ help and everybody else’s to make this happen because it’s our one chance to do something before the anniversary of that tragedy which will occur about seven weeks from now,” Brauer said.

At the press conference, Brauer’s group unrolled an enormous scroll of a petition that includes the signatures of about a thousand special forces veterans joining the call for this investigation. “What you see on my left is a one of a kind. I don’t think it’s ever been done before: a four-foot-by-sixty-foot copy of the Special Operations Speaks petition that we sent to the House of Representatives on the Eighth of April asking for this select committee with subpoena power,” Brauer said. “The scroll is signed by nearly 1,000 special operations veterans, from the rank of Lieutenant General Three Stars down to every other rank you can imagine, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, all of them passionate about what we’re trying to do.”

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), a congressman who supports the discharge petition, said at the press conference that he was asked by a reporter recently about Benghazi: “Gee, that was so long ago. Do we really want to pursue this now?”

“I told the reporter that when I was a judge handling felony cases, I had defendants ask me that question – ‘that was so long ago, do we really need to get into all this now?’ I can tell you when the blood of American patriots cries out, when the blood of individuals who were sent there into harm’s way, knowing how dangerous it was in Benghazi, and especially two former SEALs who were even told to ‘Stand Down’ but they wouldn’t have it,” Gohmert said. “They went to save lives and that’s exactly what they did. They even recruited another State Department man, a former army ranger, to go up there on the rooftop with them. What they knew from the first moment mortars were fired was that this was an organized, well-prepared attack on our people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Their blood cries out for that.”

Former Florida Republican Rep. Allen West concurred with the others there, adding: “If it’s more important to some people in Washington, D.C., to protect President Obama and to protect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I say shame on you. Every single member of the United States House of Representatives should have their name on this discharge petition. If their name is not on that discharge petition, you are complicit in this cover-up of what happened.”

Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy said that if the truth is not uncovered in Benghazi, a terrorist attack like it is likely to happen again. “I believe that this is not likely to be an isolated incident,” Gaffney said at the press conference “If we don’t learn the lessons of what happened in Benghazi, how we got to there, what we did on the occasion and what has happened in the aftermath, you can be sure there will be other Americans who end with the same fate.”

Bob Adams, the president and founder of grassroots group Revive America which has been rallying members of Congress behind the calls for a real investigation into Benghazi, placed the blame for the lack of a real investigation at the feet of House GOP leadership.

“When Revive America first joined this fight back in March, only 48 House Republicans had mustered the courage to stand as cosponsors of this bill,” Adams said. “Frankly, the level of support at that time was an embarrassment.

Pakistani officials said that they were releasing seven Taliban prisoners to facilitate the peace process, while Afghan officials said they had requested the releases and welcomed the move.

Afghan officials complained, however, that Pakistani officials had backed down on the expected release of one Taliban prisoner, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, formerly the top military commander of the insurgents’ movement. Afghan officials have long sought Mr. Baradar’s release, viewing him as crucial to restarting peace talks.

Separately, Afghan officials confirmed Saturday that the day before they had exchanged 11 Taliban prisoners to obtain the release of a female member of the Afghan Parliament, who had been kidnapped by the insurgents last month, according to an Afghan official involved in the prisoner exchange, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media."

For more than a decade, the media group has published hard-hitting coverage of military corruption and Myanmar’s dismal human rights record, and many saw its arrival as a bellwether of the regime’s tolerance.

Recent days, however, have brought growing industry concern about backsliding after the government sent a draft press law to the parliament March 4: It bears an unsettling resemblance to the draconian 1962 media law still in effect, which has long been used to jail, torture and harass journalists.

“If they go with this law, there will be big noises and confrontation again with the press,” Sein Win, Mizzima’s chief editor, said in a sparse office on the fourth floor of a high-rise apartment that has seen better days. “We don’t want to go back to that again.”

Media organizations here say the measure’s vague wording — submitted without consulting media industry leaders — opens journalists to abuse, as do provisions that include a six-month jail sentence for license violations and a ban on criticizing the military-drafted constitution.

In late January, the government also quietly established a committee staffed with members of the military and the Information and Home Affairs ministries to oversee journalists.

“That’s two strikes against them,” said Shawn Crispin, the Bangkok, Thailand-based Asia representative of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group. “Seemingly, authorities have gotten cold feet on what it would mean to have a free and open press.”

Another media group, Reporters Without Borders, ranked Myanmar 151 out of 179 countries in its 2013 Press Freedom Index.

Political analysts say the nominally civilian government elected in 2011, which is still controlled by the military, is afraid of losing control. After a honeymoon period of glowing coverage of its release of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, more open policies and freed political prisoners, the government is facing increasingly negative reports about ethnic conflict, corruption and land grabs.

And although President Thein Sein recently held the first government news conference in decades and newly elected Information Minister Aung Kyi appears relatively open-minded, critics say officials are finding it difficult to alter their mind-set after decades of absolute power and censorship.

“The Ministry of Information understands it has to change its image,” said Ye Naing Moe, director of the Yangon Journalism School, who has conducted media training courses for officials in the capital, Naypyidaw. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not still running the show.”

Perhaps most striking in these courses, he said, is a near-complete lack of basic news understanding among officials overseeing the media.

“I had to start with ‘What is news?’” he said. “For them, news means a sheet from bureaucrats you’re told to publish.”

One trainee asked Ye Naing Moe what would happen to society if independent news media were allowed. The official registered near-disbelief at his response: You’d be able to read seven newspaper versions, not just one.

“It’s a bit like Chicken Little thinking the sky is falling in,” Ye Naing Moe said. “I tried to encourage them to come out of their cave.”

Another challenge for the government is transforming its long-standing state-run mouthpieces into “public service” media that people want to read or watch.

A trainer who recently worked at the government’s MRTV network said passivity among the technologically challenged staff members was deep-seated after decades of being told what to do. “They still write scripts out by hand!” he said.

At the New Light of Myanmar newspaper — once nicknamed the New Lies of Myanmar — the government has introduced advertising and color production and has tried to shake up coverage, which traditionally has featured articles such as “Lost air conditioner found in paddy field” and “Religious Affairs minister deals with religious matters.”

But some are skeptical. “Forget about the central government, they don’t even dare touch local issues,” said editor Sein Win. “How can they ever be ‘public service’?”

It isn’t just the government that’s finding its feet, however. Companies are also grappling with rapid change after decades of a sheltered existence. This month, the state has approved eight “temporary” licenses for private daily newspapers, something that’s been banned for decades.

Advertisement

That sparked a rapid expansion in an industry with little experience, critics say.

“We need more than freedom, we need professionalism,” said Ma Thida, executive editor of the Myanmar Independent News Journal, a private weekly. “Many editors don’t know how to edit, and no one cares about language. There are so many mistakes.”

Advertisement

Industry structure is also a concern. About 70% of the country’s print media is based in Yangon, much of it controlled by ex-military officials or their relatives, leaving little coverage in rural areas, where most Burmese live.

“Most journals are owned by tycoons and cronies, so I don’t have much faith in them,” said Ko Aung Soe, a farmer in Kankone, outside Mandalay. “I believe in true media, but there’s none around.”

At the offices of the recently opened House of Media & Entertainment multimedia group, founders U Zaw Thet Htwe and comedian Maung Thura “Zarganar,” both former political prisoners, say overt intimidation is being replaced by overly vague guidelines that can be used as authorities see fit. Guidelines issued in August warned against articles with “destructive views of state policy,” those “detrimental to international friendship” or any that might “frighten the public.”

There’s also widespread concern that the government could use defamation lawsuits — the mining ministry filed one last year before withdrawing it — in lieu of censorship, taking a cue from Singapore.

Advertisement

Zarganar and other editors said the industry was walking a fine line: It wants to be aggressive but worries that pushing too hard could return hard-liners to power before reforms are institutionalized.

“This is an opportune moment,” said Thiha Saw, editor of the weekly newspaper Open News. “But our concern: All these guys are former military generals. Is it real or is it just to attract international investment? We’re going to push reforms as far away from the old 1962 law as possible, so it’s hopefully beyond the point of no return.”

The pending wave of releases has revived one of the most caustic — and seemingly resolved — issues between the allies just as relations have hit a new low over Mr. Karzai’s refusal to sign a long-term security agreement with American officials. Officials from both countries who support the security deal say they are worried that the mass release of militants with American blood on their hands could scuttle talks altogether and lead to a complete Western withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014.

It was out of concern that dangerous militants might be too easily returned to the battlefield that American military commanders initially resisted Mr. Karzai’s demands in the spring to hand over all detention operations. As the Americans relented, they said they had received his personal assurances that security would be maintained.

Suddenly, it is a major issue again, though the releases have not been made final.

The Afghan commission charged with reviewing detainee cases at the main military prison near Bagram Air Base, a coalition hub north of Kabul, is planning to release more than 85 prisoners who the coalition and Afghan defense officials say should face trial. The plans were detailed by American and Afghan officials alarmed by the move, and have been confirmed by commission members."

He was a relatively obscure army officer when he took part in a successful but bloody coup against Ethiopia's Haile Selassie in September 1974.

The emperor had failed to come to grips with a poor harvest, and the situation escalated into a devastating famine.

The young officers formed the Dergue, which Mengistu took control of three years later, after a power struggle. Mengistu showed a ruthless streak, shooting a fellow officer who wanted to make peace with the province of Eritrea, which was seeking independence.

The president's dream was to turn Ethiopia into a Soviet-style workers' state.

Thousands of intellectuals, professionals and other perceived opponents of socialism and the regime were killed during the ""Red Terror"" years.

Soviet alliance

At the time, the country was embroiled in a war with Somalia, which was armed and backed by the Soviet Union. Mengistu encouraged Moscow to switch sides.

An alliance was formed, which saw the Soviet Union pour more than $10bn of military aid into the country during the 1980s.

For years, Mengistu relied on the Soviet Union for his economic thinking.

He saw himself as a Third World champion of communism. Alongside portraits of Lenin, Engels and Marx, he hung huge portraits of himself leading the masses to victory.

He spent much of his leisure time reading Marxist-Leninist tracts and wore Soviet-cut military jackets and caps.

Sent to the US

Mengistu was born in 1937 in Walayitta, Ethiopia.

He joined the army and graduated from military academy in 1966.

He was sent for advanced training to the United States. There, he became anti-American, sympathising with the American black nationalist movement. It was also in the US that his Stalinist philosophy took shape.

In 1971, he returned to Ethiopia. Six years later, he was in charge of the country.

Initially, he made social and economic changes in the country, replacing the ancient feudal society with a socialist one-party state.

But his ruling Workers' Party became extremely unpopular for harsh social policies as well as the forced wholesale transfer of population.

The drought of 1984-5 brought the country to economic ruin and he was forced to reassess his Marxist rhetoric. An estimated 1m people starved to death during the famine.

In 1990, Moscow cut its military aid and Mengistu began abandoning his Marxist policies.

The Dergue was overthrown in 1991, and Mengistu fled as the combined Eritrean and Tigrayan forces were on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.

He found a safe haven in Zimbabwe, with help from American officials who hoped his departure might stop the fighting.

He has lived a lavish but reclusive life in exile in Zimbabwe ever since. His only trip abroad was in 1999 when he visited South Africa for medical treatment. There was pressure on the government to extradite him - but he returned quickly to Zimbabwe."

Their commander had been killed and beheaded by an Al Qaeda-linked group a month earlier, the rebels said. Now these surviving FSA fighters were hiding here near the Turkish border.

Such mainstream rebel groups, formed to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad, increasingly find themselves in a battle against a different foe.

Walid Shawkan, the new commander of the displaced group, said fighters with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria attacked his men in the town of Dana after a dispute over weapons. The Islamists seized the arms and declared the fighters from the Hamza Lion of God brigade to be apostates.

“They are not coming to fight the regime,” Shawkan said. “They are coming to fight us. We’re going to fight them first and then the regime.”

As the third year of the Syrian conflict drags on, the ambitions of extremist Islamic groups are growing. The presence of those militants has played an important role in the U.S. debate over the Obama administration’s plan to launch missile strikes against Syria to punish the government for its suspected use of chemical weapons. Some opponents say it puts the U.S. squarely on the side of groups aligned with Al Qaeda.

When the Islamist fighters emerged last year, many in the Syrian opposition accepted their help while also predicting a post-Assad battle with them because their vision for the country was deeply at odds with that of the mainstream rebels. This year, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria publicly broke with Al Nusra Front, which had been the main Islamist and Al Qaeda-linked group in the country.

Since then, the Islamic State, which has more foreign fighters than other such groups, has grown more confrontational toward some of the rebel militias. Consequently, it seems that the battle with the Islamic State won’t wait.

In July, a senior FSA commander, Kamal Hamami, was shot and killed by the Islamic State in what the Supreme Military Council, the nominal head of the FSA, called an assassination. At the time, Col. Qassim Saad Eddine, spokesman for the council, said a member of the Al Qaeda-linked group had called him and threatened to kill all 30 council members.

The Islamic State has since routed three FSA groups from their northern communities — Jarabulus, Dana and, most recently, Raqqah province — part of its practice of establishing itself in areas already controlled by the opposition.

Advertisement

“They have opened a new front line for us; they work for the regime because they have distracted us from our fight against the regime,” said Ibrahim Hanano, commander of the Martyrs of Dignity’s Armor militia, which had given the Dana group refuge.

The emergence of the Islamist forces has also hurt the mainstream rebels by making the U.S. and other Western powers worry that if they provide military aid it could end up in the hands of terrorists.

Advertisement

Had it not been for the extremists in Syria “cutting off heads,” Saad Eddine said, the rebels would have been given weapons long ago.

In making its case for missile strikes, Obama administration officials have argued that the Islamist militants’ range and influence are limited.

Advertisement

“The opposition has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership and more defined by its adherence to some ... democratic process,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.

In an attempt to ensure Western military support, the Supreme Military Council is forming what it bills as a professional and secular opposition army. Fighting groups are being divided into battalions that are numbered rather than given Islamic names.

Advertisement

Yet even as they seek to distance themselves from the Islamic State, mainstream rebel groups face a complex military landscape: the Islamic State has taken part in some of the biggest victories by the opposition, including the capture of the Mannagh air base near the Turkish border and advances in Latakia province.

Efforts by the FSA leadership to turn rebel groups against the Islamic State — akin to the Awakening movement spearheaded by the U.S. in Iraq — would probably fail in Syria, said Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a Shillman-Ginsburg fellow at the Middle East Forum and a columnist at Jihadology.net, who tracks the group online.

Advertisement

“It’s just so much more fragmented and complicated than what happened in Iraq,” Al-Tamimi said. “It would be hard to coordinate a unified Awakening movement against them, especially as long as the regime is around.”

Some rebel leaders gladly fight side by side with the Al Qaeda-linked figures.

“Our position is that our only enemy is the regime,” Col. Abduljabbar Aqidi, head of the Aleppo Military Council, said recently at his headquarters. He said he thought the differences between the two groups could be resolved through dialogue.

After several rebel groups, including the Islamic State, seized the air base, Aqidi stood in front of a damaged helicopter there. To his left was a commander of the Islamist group, and Aqidi thanked the “immigrants” for helping liberate the base.

Advertisement

The Al Qaeda-linked group, meanwhile, has been clear that its goal is to establish an Islamic state, “not a sectarian, nationalistic or ethnic” one, a group spokesman said in response to written questions.

When Al Nusra Front entered the conflict last year, the mainly Syrian fighting force began dabbling in social services: restoring water and electricity and providing flour to bakeries.

Advertisement

The hearts-and-minds campaign waged by the Islamic State — whose members come from Tunisia, Chechnya, Libya and Saudi Arabia, among other places — is far more rudimentary.

At the intersection of three narrow streets in an Aleppo neighborhood, Islamic State member Abu Waqas Tunisi held up a knife in front of a rapt crowd of children. Behind him hung a mass of black Al Qaeda flags along with colorful balloons and beach balls.

“Where’s the cantaloupe?” asked Tunisi. “Whoever finishes the cantaloupe first will get a prize.”

Two young boys volunteered for the melon-eating contest and soon their faces were covered with fruit as religious songs played loudly on scratchy speakers.

Advertisement

“Show your prize to the people,” Tunisi instructed the winner, who was holding a paddle. “What do you say to the Islamic State?”

“May God protect you,” the boy said.

Advertisement

“And what else?”

The boy paused for a few moments, fingering his prize, then said hesitantly, “And ... and God make you victorious.”

Advertisement

“The Islamic State is going to start here and you will be part of it,” Tunisi said.

A few weeks later, the group held a similar event at a square in Dana, where more than a month earlier protesters had called for their ouster and the town’s FSA group was banished.

Advertisement

Though the Islamic State uses religion as the basis of its outreach — in addition to toy drives, it regularly holds Koran memorization contests — the FSA council is trying to move in the other direction, toward a secular army that world powers can support.

On a recent Sunday, Saad Eddine met with more than a dozen Syrian military defectors to record a video statement announcing the formation of three battalions under the council’s command.

Advertisement

When he finished, several officers instinctively yelled out, “God is great!”

“No, no, none of that,” Saad Eddine said. “Let’s start again.”

Advertisement

Later he said, “In any army there isn’t all this [God is great] or Koranic verses. We don’t insert religion into politics and the military.”

Months ago, several brigades in Aleppo’s western neighborhoods joined together to form a moderate Islamic coalition to counter the extremist groups.

Advertisement

A commander, who didn’t want his name published to avoid problems with the Islamic State, said the extremists were more violent. Though other FSA groups had clashed with them, so far his group hadn’t, he said.

For now, he said, the two sides were working together.

“I don’t like to think about what comes after because it hurts my head,” he said, but added, “The people who rose up to oust Bashar have the ability to oust any other Bashars who come after.”

Report%3A Iran is developing and installing new and advanced centrifuges that can make bomb in month

President Obama has said Iran is a year or more away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb

A new report that says Iran may need as little as a month to produce enough uranium for a nuclear bomb is further evidence for why Israel will take military action before that happens, an Israeli defense official said Friday.

""We have made it crystal clear – in all possible forums, that Israel will not stand by and watch Iran develop weaponry that will put us, the entire Middle East and eventually the world, under an Iranian umbrella of terror,"" Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA TODAY.

Iran is developing and installing new and advanced centrifuges that enable Iran to enrich even low-enriched uranium to weapons grade uranium needed for nuclear weapons within weeks, Danon said.

""This speedy enrichment capability will make timely detection and effective response to an Iranian nuclear breakout increasingly difficult,"" he said.

""Breakout"" refers to the time needed to convert low-enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium. On Thursday, the Institute for Science and International Security issued a report stating that Iran could reach that breakout in as little as one month based in part on Iran's own revelations about its nuclear program.

""If they use all their centrifuges ... and their stockpiles of low- and medium-enriched uranium, that would take one to 1.6 months,"" said David Albright, president of the institute and a former inspector for the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency.

The report comes as the White House is trying to persuade Congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions on Iran to force it to open up its program to inspection. The White House on Thursday invited senate staffers to a meeting on Iran strategy for negotiations that are to resume next month with Iran, it said.

In discussing Iran strategy, President Obama has said Iran is a year or more away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb.

Bernadette Meehan, an spokeswoman for the administration's National Security Council, said the intelligence community maintains ""a number of assessments"" regarding potential time frames for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one weapon or a testable nuclear device.

""We continue to closely monitor the Iranian nuclear program and its stockpile of enriched uranium,"" Meehan said.

In the report, Albright said negotiations with Iran should focus on lengthening Iran's breakout time. ISIS' analysis is based on the latest Iranian and United Nations reports on Iran's centrifuge equipment for producing nuclear fuel and its nuclear fuel stockpiles.

Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched uranium has nearly doubled in a year's time and its number of centrifuges has expanded from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today.

Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican whose Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation to tighten Iran sanctions, said the report shows that Iran is expanding its nuclear capabilities under the cover of negotiations.

""The Senate should move forward immediately with a new round of sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring an undetectable breakout capability,"" he said. The House has already passed legislation to toughen sanctions.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons but that producing nuclear fuel is Iran's right. However, Iran has blocked international inspectors from some suspected nuclear facilities, making it impossible to determine whether it is complying with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it has signed.

United Nations inspectors say they have found evidence of a weapons program in violation of Iran's commitment under the treaty. The USA and the U.N. Security Council have implemented economic sanctions on Iran to persuade it abide by its obligation and verify it is not developing a bomb.

Albright says negotiations with Iran should focus on establishing protocols that lengthen the time period that it would take Iran to convert uranium to weapons grade uranium.

""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further,"" stated the report by the Institute for Science and International Security.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court.

He Can Be Reached At Adam.Shaw Foxnews.Com.']",Obama has only himself to blame for Britain’s Syria snub,"The Obama administration is today still reeling from Thursday’s enormous setback to the Syria intervention effort, as the UK voted to reject military intervention in the war-torn nation.

It is difficult to overestimate just how devastating this is to the President’s foreign policy.

Britain has stood side by side with America in almost every post-war conflict. The one major exception was the Vietnam War, arguably America’s biggest ever defeat. Put simply, America wins when it goes in with Britain, it loses when it does not. And Britain almost always stands shoulder to shoulder with its strongest ally.

So what happened? The Obama administration must be scratching their heads in wonder at how such a seemingly easy vote could go disastrously wrong. A relatively popular UK Prime Minister leading a Conservative Party that voted both for Afghanistan and Iraq, who seems to be on good terms with President Obama, facing off against a weak, divided left-wing opposition. To use an Americanism, it should have been a slam-dunk.

Additionally, unlike Iraq, where the evidence was highly contentious, it seems fairly reasonable to conclude Bashar Assad has attacked his people with chemical weapons. So why did the House of Commons say “nay” not “aye”?

More On This...

To see this no vote as just about Syria does not fully explain the mentality in the UK. Instead, we must look at the state of the Anglo-American alliance. For most interventions do not directly serve British interests, but American. Britain therefore goes into battle because America is Britain’s strongest ally, and a strong America means a strong Great Britain.

For instance, although Britain recognized that Al Qaeda posed a serious threat to the UK, we intervened in Afghanistan because, as Tony Blair succinctly stated at the time, an attack on America was seen as an attack on Britain, such was the strength of the Special Relationship.

With Iraq throughout the nineties and in 2003, when America decided Hussein needed dealing with, Britain stepped up. When Clinton expressed broader foreign policy objectives and decided Milosevic needed taking care of in Serbia, Britain was there. There were other reasons too, but Britain’s attitude was “where our ally goes, we go.”

But not now. Why?

The answer lies in that Special Relationship. First re-established by President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980’s after neglect during the Carter years, it has gone from strength to strength through multiple Prime Ministers and Presidents for decades. Then President Obama took the White House.

Obama's occasional photo ops with Cameron mask a horrifying truth underneath, that President Obama has obliterated the Anglo-American alliance since he took office, and is arguably one of the most anti-British Presidents of all time.

When President Obama took office, one of his first moves was to remove a bust of Churchill that Bush had been given by Tony Blair in the wake of 9/11. It was a symbol that Britain stood by America, and Obama’s disposal of it spoke volumes. The Anglo-American alliance was a relic of the Bush era, and would be swept away.

Other swipes, such as Obama’s false reference to BP as “British Petroleum,” his declaration that America had “no stronger ally” than France, the senior State Dept. official who said about Britain, “You’re just the same as the other 190 countries in the world. You shouldn’t expect special treatment” and the fact that not a single senior member of the Obama administration attended the funeral of Margaret Thatcher, all give indications about how Britain is seen in Obama’s America.

Yet the most galling snub to Britain comes in the form of the Falkland Islands dispute. Although British territory for centuries, and in the face of a population that consistently votes over 98% in favor of remaining British, Argentina have attempted to claim the Islands as their own.

After losing a war against Britain in the 1980’s, Argentina adopted a new tactic, calling for ‘negotiations’ to the sovereignty of the Islands, hoping to at least get a chunk of the land. The Obama administration, speaking through then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sided against their best ally, and with Kirchner’s Argentina, demanding Britain sit down with Argentina and negotiate sovereignty of the British territory under the pretense of neutrality.

All this contributes to a strong signal from the Obama administration that Britain is really not that important to America anymore.

If that is the case, then why should Britain stick its neck out, and put British lives on the line in a conflict that does not directly serve British interests? The argument that Britain has a duty to support its ally is simply not compelling enough in the Obama era.

Long ago President Obama decided that America didn’t need Britain anymore. As a consequence, Britain has now discovered that it doesn’t need America either. Mr. Obama is now paying for his poor judgment, and America is significantly weakened as a consequence."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/08/24/Christian-and-Muslim-Egyptians-Protest-Obama-Policies-at-White-House,2013-08-24 00:00:00,['John Rossomando'],Christian and Muslim Egyptians Protest Obama Policies at White House,"Hundreds of Egyptians – Christian and Muslim alike – gathered outside the White House Thursday afternoon to call attention to the plight of Coptic Christians and denounce what they see as the Obama administration’s tepid response to a recent spate of church burnings.

“Down, Down with Ikhwan!” they chanted in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt’s army cracked down on Muslim Brotherhood protesters, the Islamist group and its supporters have torched dozens of churches and attacked Christians.

Muslim women in hijabs could be seen mingling among their Christian neighbors and joining in the chants.

Protesters later marched to the headquarters of the Washington Post and CNN to express anger at the lack of coverage given to the attacks on Egyptian Christians. Then they went to the Council on American Islamic Relations’ (CAIR) headquarters. Protest organizers consider CAIR to be the Muslim Brotherhood’s “embassy” in Washington.

The sight of hundreds of angry protesters outside its building prompted theWashington Post to lock down its lobby.

Protesters defended the Egyptian military’s decision to forcefully clear out the Muslim Brotherhood protesters staging sit-ins in Cairo, and they chided the Obama administration for condemning the military’s action.

“Egypt right now is dealing with terrorists,” said protester Sherif Mina. “I mean, he’s talking about peaceful demonstrations in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood. Is it peaceful when you carry machine guns, and artillery weapons – and all these kinds of torture that they’ve done to the Egyptian people, and the neighborhoods that they were sitting in?”

Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the popular Egyptian belief that the military intervened at the request of the people. But talk of cutting off U.S. aid in the wake of the army’s crackdown – in which hundreds were killed – seems to have reinforced protesters’ perceptions that the Obama administration has sided with the Brotherhood.

Many Egyptians now consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization that destroyed the fabric of Egyptian society during its year in power, protesters said. That belief was proven by street protests against President Mohamed Morsi – the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate – which drew an estimated 30 million Egyptians. American foreign policy should back the majority of Egyptians who do not want the Muslim Brotherhood back, protesters said.

They also called for a secular, free and democratic Egypt.

Basic necessities became scarce under Muslim Brotherhood rule, electricity became sporadic, gas lines were common, and poor Egyptians were being hurt by the declining value of the Egyptian Pound by the time 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to say they had enough.

As the army violently clamped down, Islamists turned to Egypt’s Christian minority as easy scapegoats or accused the military of promoting “Islamophobia.” But that didn’t fly with Muslims who joined Thursday’s protest in Washington.

“All of the Egyptians they are found the Muslim Brotherhood they are just failures and liars about everything they are told us they will do it in my country,” said Nessma Salem, an Egyptian Muslim woman who came from New York to attend the rally. “Unfortunately they make a lot of other things. They don’t want to even admit they are liars. So the problem is all the Muslims, and all the Christians, and all of the Egyptian people they are just go to all of the street again after two years. They told us they do not want the Muslim Brotherhood to control the whole country again because they are failures and unfortunately they are support definitely terrorists.”

Other protesters shared her angst about the damage done to Egypt’s economy under Muslim Brotherhood rule. Given the massive popular outcry, Morsi’s removal from office was not a coup.

“[30] million people came out in the street saying we don’t want this regime. It’s a terror regime – a terrorist regime killing everyone,” said protester Fred Soliman. “They tried to rule the country by themselves and not share it with anyone else, so the whole country, the whole country [30] million people all over Egypt. They say no to that regime.”

President Obama has not mentioned Coptic Christians by name since the violence began. The closest he came was a brief, veiled reference to churches being attacked by Islamists last week. “We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches,” he said. The State Department has issued several statements condemning the attacks on the over 60 churches over the past week, but the Copts feel these statements have not been forceful enough.

These tepid statements, together with the perception that the Obama administration was excessively deferential to the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in power, fueled their resentment.

“We as the Coptic Christians of Egypt would like to live in peace, would like the Egyptians to decide their future. We don’t want anyone to interfere in our future, would like the American government as well to the media to listen to all of the parties and to decide it by themselves,” said Fr. Mikhail E. Mikhail of St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Seven Hills, Ohio. “…We are here to say that what happened in Egypt is a revolution from the people, not a military rebellion.”

“The army is not going to rule in Egypt,” Mikhail said. “They chose a Supreme Court judge to be in the transition period, and at the same time they have a plan to give it to a civilian government. We want Egypt to be civilian and for Egypt to separate between religion and state like you do here in the United States of America.”"

SEOUL, April 15 (Reuters) - North Korea made new threats of military action on Monday as the reclusive nation celebrated the anniversary of its founder's birth, stoking tension on the peninsula with a new ""ultimatum"" to South Korea in the stand-off over its nuclear program.

The latest statement from Pyongyang followed threats of nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and Japan, after new U.N. sanctions were imposed in response to Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon in February.

""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Monday, noting actions would ""start immediately.""

The statement was issued by the official North Korean news agency KCNA after signs that Pyongyang may be presenting a less warlike stance on the ""Day of the Sun,"" the date the North's founder Kim Il-Sung was born.

Although many Pyongyang watchers had expected a big military parade to showcase North Korea's armed forces, the day was marked in Pyongyang with a festival of flowers named after Kim.

The United States has offered talks, but on the pre-condition that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. North Korea deems its nuclear arms a ""treasured sword"" and has vowed never to give them up.

Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.

""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang,"" he said. ""North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""

On Sunday evening, Kerry appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearization steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.

But on Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said North Korea would have to ""commit itself in a verifiable way to denuclearization"" first, which has long been the U.S. position.

""If North Korea shows that it's serious about pursuing that path, then negotiations are the course through which that can be achieved,"" Carney told reporters.

Earlier, Kerry said he believed China, the North's sole economic and political benefactor, should put ""some teeth"" in efforts to persuade Pyongyang to alter its policies.

The Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, warned on Monday that tensions could get out of control.

""It does not matter if it is intentional or accidental, even the smallest thing could cause the situation to change rapidly and perhaps get totally out of control,"" the paper said.

ON GUARD

South Korean and U.S. officials said last week North Korea appeared set to test-launch a medium-range missile as a show of strength linked to Monday's anniversary of the birth of North Korean state founder Kim Il-Sung.

North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.

South Korea said it remained on guard against any missile launch and it regretted the North's rejection of an offer of talks made last week by President Park Geun-hye. It said the offer would remain on the table.

Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions, which were expanded after its third nuclear test, in February.

President Barack Obama is under pressure from Republicans in Congress to respond forcefully should North Korea launch a missile.

""I maintain that the United States should treat any North Korean missile launch as a threat to our national security and our allies, and that we should shoot it down once it leaves North Korean airspace,"" said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is influential on defense issues.

The aim of the North's aggressive acts, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson of the nation's founder, or to force the United States to hold talks with the North.

The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a ""hostile"" act. The United States dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part.

Yoji Koda, a former commander in chief of the Japanese naval fleet, told Reuters he believed North Korea's threats were part of a ""calculated provocation"", not a prelude to an attack.

He said indications the United States was softening a forceful stance to the North had given its leader Kim Jong-un the opportunity to tone things down.

""This has enabled North Korea to declare victory and sheathe its swords,"" he said.

Kim Il-Sung led his country from its founding in 1948 through the 1950-53 Korean War and until he died in 1994. His son, Kim Jong-il, then took over.

KCNA, the North's news agency, reported that people were flocking to a statue of Kim Il-Sung, saying, ""My father, our great leader"".

""This sincere expression comes from the bottom of their hearts,"" it said.

Kim Jong-un, the third Kim to rule in Pyongyang, attended a midnight celebration of his father's and grandfather's rule with top officials, including his kingmaker uncle Jang Song-thaek.

North Korean defectors said army units were expected to contribute for the celebration of Kim's birthday and in turn, the government, which has struggled to feed its people, had handed out extra rations of rice and corn.

""People are decorating streets for political events. It's never like war time,"" said Seo Jae-pyoung, a defector who lives in South Korea who spoke last week to an acquaintance in the North. ""The government, which normally can't distribute rice, has already given about one week or two week's special rations.""

North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it fears the United States wants to invade it and has manipulated the United Nations to weaken it. During the weekend, the North rejected the overture by new South Korean President Park as a ""cunning"" ploy.

""We will expand in quantity our nuclear weapons capability, which is the treasure of a unified Korea ... that we would never barter at any price,"" Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's titular head of state, told a gathering of officials and service personnel applauding the achievements of Kim Il-Sung.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24093997,,[],"Russia deal an 'important step', says Obama","US President Barack Obama has welcomed an agreement between the US and Russia which says Syria's chemical weapons must be destroyed or removed.

He said that America has a duty to keep the world free of the fear of chemical weapons.

America and Russia agreed a deal to remove or destroy all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014, otherwise military action could still take place.

China, France, Britain and the UN all say they're satisfied by the agreement.

A statement from the US warned that they expected Syria ""to live up to its public commitments"".

An outline of the US-Russian document says that Syria must provide details of its weapons within a week.

This happened after three days of intensive talks about how to respond to the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed hundreds of people in Syria last month.

The US had been considering firing missiles at Syrian weapons factories but Russia favoured a handover of illegal gas and firearms instead.

The main points

America's Secretary of State John Kerry agreed a plan with Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, that they'll now handover to the United Nations.

It has several main points:

The Syrian government must hand over a full list of the weapons it has within a week.

Syria must give UN weapons inspectors immediate access to all their factories.

All chemical weapons must be destroyed or removed from the country by mid-2014.

If Syria's government fails to do any of the above then the UN could impose punishments on them, including the possibility of military action.

Britain's Foreign Minister William Hague has welcomed the deal and France, which was the only country willing to join the US in taking military action against Syria, has also backed it.

Different ideas

America and Russia have had very different ideas about how to respond to the suspected poisonous gas attacks that killed hundreds of Syrians in Damascus last month. American thinks Syria's president Bashar al-Assad was responsible but he's denied it.

But after the Syrian president announced on he was willing to hand over the weapons on Thursday talks between Russia and America were stepped up to try and achieve a peaceful outcome.

Nasr'],Forcing Obama’s Hand in Syria - The New York Times,"For the past two years the Obama administration has resisted entanglement in Syria, but now this grisly civil war has become an unavoidable international problem and a defining moment for American foreign policy.

Having concluded “with high confidence” that the Syrian government carried out a deadly chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21, the Obama administration has no choice but to enforce the “red line” the president laid out a year ago. To maintain American credibility — and his own — President Obama has to do so quickly and decisively. He also has to explain to the American people and to the world what is at stake in Syria and how the United States will lead in ending this crisis.

Mr. Obama has understandably viewed any involvement in Syria as a slippery slope to an expensive war that Americans do not want and will not support. Even after President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, his administration has been slow to react, and after much back-and-forth it has decided to punish Mr. Assad — but only in a discrete operation that would not have a direct bearing on the outcome of the civil war, and only, as Mr. Obama suggested on Saturday, if Congress gives its blessing.

The world will not see this as prudence but rather as dithering — reinforcing the perception that the United States is hiding behind its economic woes and, hounded by the ghosts of Iraq, is no longer keen on leading the world. That will embolden America’s adversaries and deject its friends. America could soon find itself alone in standing up to Iran or North Korea, or in pushing back against China and Russia, which have used their veto power on the Security Council to block United Nations authorization for intervention in Syria."

(CNN) – The Air Force One flight from the U.S. to South Africa on Monday was historic not only for its final destination, but for its passenger list.

Joining President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for the trip to Nelson Mandela's memorial was former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

""The President and the First Lady have been able to spend time with the Bushes and with Secretary Clinton. And so I think it's a unique experience obviously,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters aboard the flight.

He added that the dignitaries had been reflecting on their interactions with the anti-apartheid icon.

""He is a leader that intersected with so many different American political leaders of both parties over the years, and so each of them has their own experience with Mandela,"" Rhodes said.

Reporters on the flight said George W. Bush visited the press cabin twice for off-the-record conversations, totaling about an hour and a half. His wife joined him for part of the time.

Attorney General Eric Holder, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett were also on the plane Monday.

The high-profile figures mostly congregated in the plane's conference room, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. When not in the conference room, the Obama's stayed in the President's cabin while the Bushes sat in the medical office located behind the Obama cabin. Clinton sat in the senior staff cabin behind the medical office, according to the White House pool report.

""It's a very I think enjoyable experience certainly for the President and First Lady. And they're both grateful to be able to have (the) former President and First Lady, former Secretary of State on board,"" Carney added.

The plane stopped in in Dakar, Senegal to refuel before making its way to Johannesburg, South Africa.

Former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea, as well as former President Jimmy Carter, are also slated to attend Mandela's memorial, but they're traveling separately from Air Force One. Former President George H.W. Bush, who is 89, is not scheduled to fly to South Africa.

Newspaper criticizes Obama%27s decision to seek congressional approval

Newspaper says move is %22the start of the historical American retreat%22

Al-Thawra is a Syria government newspaper

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — A Syrian state-run newspaper on Sunday called President Obama's decision to seek congressional approval before taking military action against Syria ""the start of the historic American retreat.""

The gloating tone in the front-page article in the Al-Thawra daily followed Obama's unexpected announcement on Saturday that he would ask Congress to support a strike punishing the President Bashar Assad's regime for the alleged use of chemical weapons. The decision marked a stark turnabout for the White House, which had appeared on the verge of ordering U.S. forces to launch a missile attack against Syria.

""Whether the Congress lights the red or green light for an aggression, and whether the prospects of war have been enhanced or faded, President Obama has announced yesterday, by prevaricating or hinting, the start of the historic American retreat,"" Al-Thawra said.

The paper, which as a government outlet reflects regime thinking, also claimed that Obama's reluctance to take military action stems from his ""sense of implicit defeat and the disappearance of his allies."" The daily said the American leader worries about limited intervention turning into ""an open war has pushed him to seek Congress' consent.""

The U.S. Navy moved warships over the past week into the eastern Mediterranean as the Obama administration considered its options. With everything in place, Obama said Saturday that he had decided the U.S. should take military action and that he believes that he has the authority as commander-in-chief to ""carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization."""

Tens of thousands of U.S. troops were stationed in the Philippines after it was liberated from Japanese occupation after World War II. The giant bases that harbored U.S. sailors and airmen, Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Force Base, were shuttered by the end of 1992. A constitution written shortly after the Americans were pushed out now forbids any permanent foreign military presence in the islands that were once a U.S. colony.

Under a 2002 agreement between the United States and the Philippines, several hundred U.S. counter-terrorism troops have been in the country to train Philippine soldiers for operations to contain Al Qaeda-allied insurgents plaguing the southern island of Mindanao. The Visiting Forces Agreement limits the troops’ number and length of stay.

“The Philippines will shortly enter into consultations and negotiations with the United States on a possible framework agreement that would implement our agreed policy of increased rotational presence,” Defense Minister Voltaire Gazmin and Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario announced in a letter released to news media in the region Thursday.

Del Rosario told reporters at a Manila news conference that he hoped the talks would begin as soon as possible to work out the “modalities and parameters” necessary to beef up the U.S. presence in the country.

The Philippines, like other U.S.-allied Asian nations, has been confronted in recent years by an increasingly aggressive China that has laid claim to disputed islands and resources in the East and South China seas. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia also are engaged in tense standoffs with Beijing over natural assets in the region.

Gazmin said the increased U.S. presence was desired “for the protection of our West Philippine Sea,” the name Filipinos use for the South China Sea waters surrounding disputed islands, fishing grounds and rich oil and natural gas deposits.

Philippine ships last year were forced to back off from their traditional fishing area at Scarborough Shoal after Chinese sailors erected a barricade to block entrance to the disputed waters.

The Associated Press in Manila reported Thursday that it had seen confidential Philippine military surveillance reports that 61 Chinese vessels had been sighted over a six-day period last month off the disputed Spratly Islands. China since 1995 has also occupied the Mischief Reef, which Manila also claims, and it has converted it to a base for Chinese patrol vessels.

Philippine President Benigno Aquino III made clear last month that the expanded deployments would remain temporary and that the visitors would have to operate from existing Philippine national bases and not reopen or rebuild their own.

The Philippines was a U.S. colony from 1898 until it was granted partial autonomy in 1935. It was occupied by Japan during World War II, and its sovereignty was recognized by the United States in 1946.

It was unclear from the announcements how soon the two sides might sit down to hammer out an agreement to expand the number of U.S. forces in the Philippines, nor were any target figures mentioned. But the Philippines’ desire for more protection from an ascendant China dovetails with the United States’ plans for a “pivot to Asia,” in which it hopes to relocate defense resources from Europe and the Middle East to enhance its clout in the region.

In a statement released over the weekend, the family of Merrill Newman said the State Department had informed them that the Swedish ambassador to North Korea visited Newman at a Pyongyang hotel Saturday and reported he’s in good health. Sweden handles consular issues for Americans in North Korea as the U.S. and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.

""We were very pleased to hear that the ambassador was allowed to pay this first visit to Merrill,"" the statement said. ""As a result of the visit, we know that Merrill is in good health. ... Merrill reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good.""

Newman's family said the ambassador's visit eased their concerns about his well-being, and pleaded with North Korean authorities to take his health and age into account and let him go as an act of humanitarian compassion. Newman suffers from a heart rhythm disorder

The family's statement came hours after North Korea claimed that Newman had apologized for ""hostile acts"" against that country during a recent trip and alleged crimes against North Korea during the Korean War.

The family did not comment on the apology, but a yellow ribbon was attached to the front door of the Pasadena, Calif., home of Jeff Newman, the veteran’s son.

North Korean authorities released video showing Newman wearing glasses, a blue button-down shirt and tan trousers, reading his alleged apology, which was dated Nov. 9 and couldn't be independently confirmed. Pyongyang has been accused of previously coercing statements from detainees, and the four-page statement Newman read was riddled with stilted English and grammatical errors, such as ""I want not punish me.""

""I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman purportedly wrote, adding: ""Please forgive me.""

The statement, carried in the North's official Korean Central News Agency, said the war veteran allegedly attempted to meet with any surviving soldiers he had trained during the Korean War to fight North Korea, and that he admitted to killing civilians and brought an e-book criticizing North Korea.

Newman ""masterminded espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK and in this course he was involved in killings of service personnel of the Korean People's Army and innocent civilians,"" North Korea's official KCNA news agency said, according to Reuters.

""He admitted all his crimes and made an apology for them,"" the news agency was quoted as saying.

During the war, Merrill Newman trained a group of partisan fighters known as the 'Kuwol Regiment,' or 'Kuwolsan' in Korean, according to a former member of that regiment, Reuters reported.

It was one of several groups of anti-communist partisans under the command of the U.S. Army 8240th Unit -- dubbed the 'White Tigers' -- which coordinated some of the most daring missions of the Korean War. The White Tigers reportedly embedded undercover agents deep in enemy territory and spied on and disrupted North Korean operations, according to documented histories of the regiment.

North Korea remains technically in a state of war with the South and with the U.S. because the war ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

""We remain deeply concerned about the welfare of the U.S. citizens held in custody in the DPRK,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, referring to Newman and missionary Kenneth Bae, the latter of whom has been in North Korean custody for more than a year.

“We continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant him amnesty and immediate release” Hayden continued, using the acronym for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. “We also urge the immediate release of Merrill Newman … given Mr. Newman's advanced age and health conditions.”

It’s unclear whether Vice President Joe Biden will ask for Chinese help in pressuring North Korea to release Newman, during his visit to Asia this week.

The North Korean statement alleges that Newman says if he goes back to the U.S. he will “tell the truth about the country” -- a possible indication that Newman could be released.

The apology can be seen as Pyongyang taking steps needed to release Newman, said Yoo Ho-Yeol, a professor of North Korea studies at Korea University in Seoul. North Korea likely issued the confession in the form of an apology to resolve Newman's case quickly without starting legal proceedings, Yoo said.

North Korea is extremely sensitive about any criticism and regularly accuses Washington and Seoul of seeking to overthrow its authoritarian system through various means -- claims the U.S. and South Korea dismiss. The State Department has repeatedly warned Americans about traveling to the country, citing the risk of arbitrary detention.

Newman is an avid traveler and retired finance executive, living in a retirement community in Palo Alto, Calif. He was taken off a plane Oct. 26 by North Korean authorities while preparing to leave the country after a 10-day tour. His traveling companion seated next to him, neighbor and former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to depart.

Jeffrey Newman said his father wanted to return to the country where he spent three years during the Korean War.

Lee Newman, the veteran's wife, said in a statement released last week that the family feels a misunderstanding led to his detention.

North Korea has detained at least six Americans since 2009, including two journalists accused of trespassing and several Americans, some of whom are of Korean ancestry, accused of spreading Christianity. Bae, a Korean-American missionary and tour operator, has been detained for more than a year. North Korea sees missionary work as a Western threat to its authoritarian government.

In a statement Saturday, Bae's family said it was thankful for the U.S. calling for the release of both men. ""Now we're including Mr. Newman in our prayers,"" the family said.

A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement.

Whether Mr. Obama follows through on his promise to retaliate for the use of chemical weapons is a test of his commitment, ultimately, to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb — as long as the retaliation does not become a full-scale intervention in Syria.

“If it’s Iran-first policy, then any diversion to Syria is not fruitful,” said Aluf Benn, editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “From the Israeli point of view, the worst scenario is mission-creep in Syria and America gets entangled in a third war in the Middle East, which paralyzes its ability to strike Iran and limits Israel’s ability to strike Iran as well.”

This spring, when an Israeli official called for an international response to what he said were earlier Syrian chemical attacks, he was muzzled and reprimanded for appearing to pressure the White House. Now, said Eyal Zisser, a historian at Tel Aviv University who specializes in the region, “it’s clear that Israel does not want to appear as somebody that is pushing the United States for a deep involvement.”

There are significant differences between Israel and the United States on Syria. There was widespread criticism here of Mr. Obama’s decision to delay responding to the chemical attack, with the quote “When you have to shoot, shoot, don’t talk” from “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” becoming a common refrain. One Israeli dentist even took out a large newspaper ad promoting his implant services with a picture of Mr. Obama captioned, “He doesn’t have teeth?”

There has also been a broader debate about how best to respond to the war in Syria.

When the uprising began, many here saw Mr. Assad, who like his predecessor and father had maintained quiet on the border, as “the devil you know,” and therefore preferable to the rebels, some of whom were aligned with Al Qaeda or Sunni militants like the Palestinian Hamas faction.

As the death toll has mounted, more Israelis joined a camp led by Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, who argues that the devil you know is, actually, a devil who should be ousted sooner rather than later.

That split remains. But as hopes have dimmed for the emergence of a moderate, secular rebel force that might forge democratic change and even constructive dialogue with Israel, a third approach has gained traction: Let the bad guys burn themselves out."

If the U.N. Security Council were to pass a Russian resolution with Russian support, Chinese support trying to destroy Syria's chemical weapons' stockpiles, that would certainly offer the president of the United States a way out of this current crisis. He could come out and say, look, there are not going to be any more chemical weapons attacks if all of this is serious.

He could. It’s a blow for the administration's strategy, though, because they really wanted to use this attack as a way of sending a signal, a very strong signal, about the use of chemical weapons. They point out, Secretary Kerry says, that al-Assad has used these weapons perhaps in the teens, that is several times.

It’s also clear that this was an occasion the administration was going to use to shift the balance of power away from al-Assad and toward the rebels. So they lose that option and they lose that ability to degrade al-Assad's air power, in particular six airfields they were planning to strike.

The whole thing, however, does demonstrate something very striking. That is, if you take this Syrian acceptance of this Russian proposal and you add to it al-Assad's interview [with Charlie Rose] that we have seen clips of, what I'm struck by is quite different from Saddam Hussein or many Arab leaders. Al-Assad is not engaging in a lot of bravado or kind of crazy talk if you think of Gadhafi's interview on the eve of that campaign. Al-Assad has been very cool, very calculating, very clever in what arguments he uses.

In the interview, he talked about how there wasn't public support for this. He reminded people of the Colin Powell speech at the United Nations. He talked about the fact that the rebels are linked to al Qaeda. This was not a kind of bizarre rant about American imperialism and Israel. It was clearly designed to weaken the American public's support. And so, you add to it this acceptance of a proposal, and it all strikes me as suggesting that the Syrians are playing a very clever game of counter offensive.

You’ve been skeptical of a lot of this current crisis, on what the U.S. needs to do. What would you want to hear from the president that would reassure you, that would convince you it's the right thing to go ahead and launch these air strikes against targets in Syria?

I think the most important thing with any strategy is what is your objective? What are we trying to do here? And once you figure that out, you can then use whatever tools you have. But you also then know when you've achieved that objective. And I think the problem with the administration's strategy is it's not entirely clear what the objective is. John Kerry calls this a Munich moment, invoking the path to World War II and Adolf Hitler's attempt to conquer the world. But if it's a Munich moment, are we really going to do two days of air strikes that the president describes as a shot across the bow, which is really a warning?

So, you know, if he is going to pursue a very limited – almost symbolic – strike, it needs to be clear that is what the strategy is, what the objective is, when we will know that we have achieved it, and when we can then say, this is done or is there a much broader strategy with much broader objectives at work. I think that this is partly why there isn't as much public support, because people wonder which of these two strategies is being pursued."

The amnesty bill, proposed by Mr. Thaksin’s party, easily passed one house of the bicameral Parliament on Friday.

Mr. Thaksin, a billionaire tycoon, was ousted by the military in a September 2006 coup and later sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for abuse of power. He has lived abroad in self-imposed exile since 2008. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now prime minister, and the proposed law offers a broad amnesty for actions and people related to the coup and its aftermath.

If passed, the law might also restore to Mr. Thaksin part of his fortune that a court seized in 2010 on the ground that the money had been illegally obtained through his political influence."

In February 2013, Dotcom, creator of online storage locker Mega and its ill-fated predecessor MegaUpload, announced that his company was going to launch an encrypted email service. Then the declaration had the weight of history behind it: Dotcom himself was arrested in 2012 on piracy charges in New Zealand based on information gathered illegally by the New Zealand government at the behest of U.S. authorities. (A New Zealand judge later ruled the search warrants invalid.)

Now, in the wake of yet more government spying revelations and the loss of other encrypted options, Mega CEO Vikram Kumar reminded ZDNet's Rob O'Neill that Mega is still committed to building an encrypted email service. According to Kumar, Mega is ""doing some hugely cutting-edge stuff.""

Kumar's statement has generated a lot of attention on tech blogs across the web -- not all of it complimentary. Evan Dashevsky of TechHive called the rumored email service just the latest resume padding in Dotcom's ""history of troublemaking."" But Lauren Hockenson of Gigaom remarked that Dotcom was really going all-in on privacy. In addition to filling the void left by other shutdown services, she wrote, he's also ""creating a VC [venture capital] firm that brings up encryption-focused companies.""

Admittedly, the news seems far more exciting in the current context than it was when Dotcom first announced he was building encrypted email in February. Back then, the world was awash in encrypted email services: Tormail; Silent Mail; Lavabit, Snowden's reported service. Now those services are gone, and Lavabit's webpage bears a warning from Ladar Levinson, its founder: ""Without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.""

Mega's email service, if it comes to fruition, might tempt many of the privacy-conscious now bereft of a satisfactory alternative. Since his unfortunate brush with spying, Dotcom has started making a name for himself as an encryption advocate. Mega calls itself ""the Privacy Company"" and automatically encrypts every file uploaded to it.

In a January interview with the English-language TV station Russia Today, Dotcom spoke strongly about online privacy. ""My goal is, within the next five years, I want to encrypt half of the Internet,"" he said. ""Just reestablish a balance between a person -- an individual -- and the state.""

And true to the advice of Levinson, Mega's servers aren't hosted in the United States. The storage service is currently based in New Zealand. If that country's surveillance policies become too invasive, Dotcom told TorrentFreak, he'll move his company's infrastructure to Iceland."

(CNN) —

Hours before the top diplomats from his nation and the United States begin a high-stakes meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria and jab his U.S. counterpart.

Using an op-ed “to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders … at a time of insufficient communication between our societies,” Putin made a case much like U.S. President Barack Obama did Tuesday night – although their arguments could hardly have been more different.

Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in a piece that went online Wednesday night, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran’s nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism.”

Moreover, the Russian leader said such action without the U.N. Security Council’s approval “would constitute an act of aggression.”

“It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance,” Putin said.

Contrast this to Obama’s assertion that failing to act in Syria opens the door to more chemical weapons attacks in Syria and in other nations – as well as among terrorist groups – by giving the impression that the international community won’t act in the face of blatant violations on bans of their use.

READ: Putin comments cause a stir

And whereas the U.S. president blamed the August 21 sarin gas attack that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people squarely on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Putin wrote “there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists.”

READ: Syria’s weapons: Mission impossible?

Calling Syria’s ongoing civil war an “internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition,” Putin cautioned against siding with an opposition in Syria he says includes “more than enough (al) Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes.” (He did not mention the fact Russia has long supplied arms to Syria’s government, or that U.S. officials have said they are funneling aid only to members of what they call the “moderate opposition.”)

The Russian president ended his op-ed – just after mentioning a “growing trust” between him and his U.S. counterpart – with a swipe at a remark Obama made Tuesday contending that “with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run.”

“I believe we should act,” Obama said then. “That’s what makes America different. That’s what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.”

Putin challenged the statement, saying, “It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.”

“We are all different,” the Russian leader concluded, “but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.”

Reacting to that remark and Putin’s op-ed generally, a senior White House official said Wednesday night “that’s all irrelevant.”

“He’s fully invested in Syria’s (chemical weapons) disarmament and that’s potentially better than a military strike, which would deter and degrade but wouldn’t get rid of all the chemical weapons,” the official said.

“(Putin) now owns this,” the official added of the Russian plan to have Syria’s leadership give up its chemical weapons. “He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver.”

All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks in Geneva

It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. Russian President Vladimir Putin

Putin’s piece went online around the time U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry headed to Geneva, Switzerland, to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Their two days of talks will revolve around a Moscow proposal to avert a U.S.-led strike in Syria by having the Syrian government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control.

In his speech Tuesday, Obama said he was willing to test the seriousness and feasibility of the initiative before resuming his push for congressional authorization for military action, which at the moment appears unlikely to succeed.

Kerry is taking the lead in dealing with the Russians. That includes regular conversations with Lavrov, including Wednesday when the two talked by phone about “their shared objective of having a substantive discussion about the mechanics of identifying, verifying and ultimately destroying Assad’s chemical weapons,” said a senior State Department official.

“It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,” Obama said in his prime-time address to a war-weary public skeptical of another military venture in the Middle East.

“But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.”

Russian officials have submitted a plan to the United States, Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday, citing a Russian diplomatic source.

Yet White House spokesman Jay Carney said that while conversations have taken place, he was unaware of a full, formal proposal.

It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments. U.S. President Barack Obama

“I think we’re not at the stage of putting down public pieces of paper,” he said.

Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s emissary to the European Union, said the plan calls for Syria’s chemical weapons to be placed under international supervision – inside that country initially, at least.

“The ultimate aim is to have these weapons destroyed,” Chizhov told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.

He acknowledged the task of gaining control of the weapons and destroying them with a civil war raging in Syria won’t be easy, voicing worries about what rebel fighters might do.

Separately, the United States, France, and Britain discussed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution, according to a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron.

How long will window be open?

Ambassadors from the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members – the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France – met the same day for less than an hour, a diplomat with knowledge of the meeting said.

While the focus now is on Switzerland, U.N. headquarters in New York is expected to become the focal point early next week when U.N. chemical weapons inspectors deliver their report to the Security Council – as early as Monday or Tuesday, sources say – on the August 21 attack in Syria.

In Washington, the debate about what the United States should do in Syria is not over. While Obama has said he wants to give the diplomatic process a chance, he hasn’t said how long he’ll wait before possibly pushing again for military action.

After his meeting earlier this week with Senate Democrats, Sen. Dick Durbin said the president asked lawmakers “for some time to work things out – a matter of days into next week.” Another Senate Democrat, though, said it could take weeks to determine if diplomatic efforts will pan out.

Members of Congress will watch Kerry’s trip closely for a sense of Obama’s next move after weeks of beating the drum for military action against Syria.

“If diplomacy fails, he’s painted himself into a corner,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said after Obama’s speech. “The leader of the free world can’t say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing.”

Senior State Department officials have cautioned that negotiations over the proposed deal may not conclude after the scheduled round of talks in Geneva. The plan would be to take any final deal to the U.N. Security Council to be formalized in a resolution.

Outcome far from certain

While that process unfolds – if it does successfully – Obama continued to keep the door open for military action, despite exhortations from Putin that he drop any hint of a threat.

The U.S. president has said any military operation in Syria would be targeted, limited and not involve U.S. ground forces. Its goal would be to degrade al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons.

Obama has also said any strike would be effective – saying Tuesday that “the United States military doesn’t do pinpricks” – and he has ordered armed forces to be poised in the region “to keep the pressure on Assad.”

U.S.-funded (if not U.S.-made) weapons began flowing to Syrian rebels about two weeks ago, a U.S. official said. Coordinated by the CIA, the supplies include light weapons, ammunition and anti-tank weapons in addition to nonlethal aid the United States has long been providing.

A big question looming over the diplomatic talks is whether any U.N. resolution includes a potential for military action should al-Assad not cooperate. That’s something the United States and its allies have favored, while Putin has said his country could veto any measure there that contains such a threat.

CNN Poll: Part of Syria strike opposition is the messenger’s fault

Analysts say Kerry, as leader of the U.S. diplomatic efforts, has his work cut out for him.

“I think it’s unlikely the Russian government is going to relent on this issue of whether or not it would support the use of force in a security council resolution,” said Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official now at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

“They’ve been consistent since day one of the Syrian crisis that they did not want to see the United States or anyone else use force. I think that’s one of the ambitions the Russians have going into this negotiation in Geneva,” he added.

Obama makes case: opinion

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in an exclusive interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that Kerry must not take the threat of force off the table in his talks with the Russians even if they insist he drop it.

“This is the way that diplomacy works. You use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy, and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force,” said Albright, who served as America’s top diplomat under President Bill Clinton.

“One of the things I know from trying to get Security Council resolutions is that they take a while,” said Albright. “But my personal feeling here is that it is that threat of the use of force, and the president made very clear that our ships would stay in the area, and that the use of force would stay on the table.”

President Barack Obama has decided to delay the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt in a sign of U.S. pressure for the military there to move quickly restore civilian rule following its ouster of President Mohamed Morsy.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Egypt’s military chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, on Wednesday to inform him of the decision.

Hagel and al-Sisi also discussed the general’s call on Wednesday for mass demonstrations in Egypt for support of the military.

The Obama administration has so far not called Morsy’s removal earlier this month a military coup, which could cut more than $1 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt if that characterization is made.

Obama has expressed deep concern about the removal of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, calling for a quick return to civilian leadership. He also ordered a review of U.S. law regarding aid to the vital Middle East ally.

The four jets were due to be sent to Egypt by the end of August as part of a $1.3 billion arms package that included additional F-16s and some Abrams tank parts.

It has not been decided when or if the F-16 deliveries will resume, Little said. Also not clear is what conditions the United States would impose on their delivery or whether the balance of the overall arms sale would be met.

Little also said the administration will still proceed with its major military exercise known as “Bright Star” scheduled with the Egyptians for later this year.

The delay will not significantly impact Egypt’s military capabilities. But it is a sign of U.S. pressure to get Egypt to move quickly toward civilian rule.

Little said the decision was made “given the overall situation” in Egypt, but added the administration still hasn’t made a decision on the question whether events in Egypt should be called a coup.

Little said the United States was not suspending its overall arms sales to Egypt currently.

Earlier this month, administration officials said they expected the four aircraft to be delivered even as the White House was continuing to review assistance programs with Egypt."

Gordon', 'Thomas Erdbrink']","In New Nuclear Talks, Technological Gains by Iran Pose Challenges to the West","GENEVA — Iran is expected to make an offer on Tuesday to scale back its effort to enrich uranium, a move that a year ago would have been a significant concession to the West. But Iran’s nuclear abilities have advanced so far since then that experts say it will take far more than that to assure the West that Tehran does not have the capacity to quickly produce a nuclear weapon.

With thousands of advanced centrifuges spinning and Iranian engineers working on a plant that will produce plutonium, which also can be used in a weapon, Iran’s program presents a daunting challenge for negotiators determined to roll back its nuclear activities.

Both sides enter the nuclear talks that begin here on Tuesday with inherent strengths and weaknesses. Iran walks in with a nuclear program that cannot easily be turned back, while the West has imposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.

And if Iran is going to maintain the right to enrich uranium to even low levels, as it continues to insist it must, the West will surely demand highly intrusive inspections — far more than Iran has tolerated in the past. How these matters are resolved will go far in deciding the success or failure of the talks."

Despite the apparent diplomatic failure, the White House received an endorsement from the 28-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the key Western military alliance.

After a meeting of the allaince’s policymaking arm, NATO Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement in Brussels that reports of a chemical weapons attacks by Syria “cannot go unanswered. Those responsible must be held accountable.”

The statement didn’t commit NATO to joining any military operation, but gave its blessing for such an effort, said George Benitez, an analyst with the Atlantic Council of the United States and editor of the Natosource blog. “They’re saying: ‘We support what you’re going to do.’”

He said there appeared to be fewer misgivings about military action than before other recent U.S.-led interventions. Germany and Poland, which kept a distance from the U.S., French and British attack on Libya in 2011, supported the NATO statement, for example.

At the U.N., in a meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council, British representatives proposed a resolution condemning Syria’s use of banned chemical agents and called for all necessary means to respond to it.

But officials from Russia, Syria’s principal international backer, made it clear that they would oppose the resolution, killing the idea and foreclosing any further discussion, diplomats said.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said the Obama administration found the British proposal “strong and compelling.” She laid blame for the failure of the diplomatic effort on continued Russian opposition “to any meaningful [Security Council] action on Syria.”

Harf said U.S. officials would consult other countries about possible military action as well as other options, and “will take appropriate actions to respond in the days ahead.”

The White House has sought to build international support for punitive airstrikes against Assad’s government for the purported poison gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21. More than 300 people were killed, and more than 3,000 were injured, according to the Syrian opposition and aid organizations.

Assad’s government denied responsibility for the attack, blaming rebels who have fought to oust him from power since early 2011. The United States and its allies have not yet offered proof to back up their contention that the Syrian government had carried out chemical attacks.

U.S. officials said the goal of any alliance attack on Syria would be to degrade Assad’s military and deter it from further use of chemical weapons. They said they are not trying to topple Assad or change the balance of power in the civil war.

Under international law, military action is justified in self-defense or with a U.N. blessing. But Harf said a strong response is warranted in this case because chemical weapons use violates international law and as well as international norms.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

San Francisco (CNN) - Seeking to move his domestic agenda away from the disappointments of health care reform, President Obama made another pitch for an immigration overhaul Monday, calling on lawmakers to restart an effort that stalled over the summer.

But even as he made his pitch at a recreation center serving mainly Chinese-Americans in San Francisco, Obama was loudly interrupted by a group who says the President's not doing enough to end deportations of undocumented immigrants.



Ju Hong, a 24-year-old student at San Francisco State, told Obama his family couldn't see each other because of the nation's immigration laws - and that Obama wasn't doing enough by himself to change the rules.

""You have the power to stop deportation,"" Ju said as a chant of ""stop deportation"" grew behind where the President was standing.

Later, Ju told reporters he was ""disappointed"" in the blame the President placed on Republicans, instead saying Obama could help reunite his family by executive order.

Obama, who told Secret Service agents to allow the protesters to remain inside the event area, took sharp aim at Congressional Republicans during his remarks for what he said was an unwillingness to ""catch up with the rest of the country"" on immigration changes.

After waving off the Secret Service, Obama said, ""I respect the passion of these young people because they feel deeply about the concerns for their families.

""Now what you need to know, when I'm speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community. If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so.""

""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition,"" Obama continued.

""And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.""

Obama rebutted the protesters' claims he could end deportation alone, saying he needed Congress on board to fully repair a flawed system. In 2012, Obama did end deportations for certain young immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents.

Immigration reform is ""within our grasp, if we can convince folks in Washington to just do what needs to be done,"" Obama said, pointing to a measure passed by the Senate earlier this year that garnered bipartisan support.

That Senate measure, passed by a large majority in June, included an eventual pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants that hinged upon strict new border security provisions. The bill, the work of a Senate gang of four Democrats and four Republicans, earned strong backing from the White House but wasn't taken up in the House, where some conservatives allege the citizenship clause amounts to amnesty for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

Republican leaders in the House have said they'll take up individual immigration measures instead of the comprehensive legislation the White House says it prefers. Obama last week told a group of business chiefs he would be open to some piecemeal measures, as long as they change the aspects of the nation's immigration system that he's pushing for.

""It's not smart,"" Obama said of the current laws. ""It's not fair. It doesn't make sense. And we have kicked this can down the road long enough.""

In political terms, immigration reform is generally regarded as an issue that can help bolster a candidate or party among the growing U.S. Latino population; Republicans' interest in the issue of late is seen as a response to the GOP's disastrous showing among Latinos in the 2012 presidential election.

But in areas of the West Coast like San Francisco and Seattle, Asian Americans form a larger demographic bloc. The site of Obama's speech Monday, the Betty Ong Chinese Recreation Center, serves the city's historic Chinatown - the oldest such concentration of Chinese immigrants in North America. The building is named for a flight attendant who lost her life on 9/11.

Comprehensive immigration reform would be a major legislative win for the president, who has struggled to see his top agenda items passed by a divided legislature. The signature law of his first term, the Affordable Care Act, passed on party lines when the House of Representatives was still controlled by Democrats. Today that law is mired in technological problems with its exchange website, HealthCare.gov, as well as a constant barrage of criticism from Republicans on its policy details.

The President's immigration message came amid a three-day fundraising blitz for Obama, which took him to Seattle on Sunday, San Francisco on Monday and Los Angeles on Tuesday. Immigration reform is widely popular among Democrats, as well as some of Obama's Silicon Valley donors, who have long lamented federal rules that bar them from hiring top talent trained in the United States but without the ability to work here. To underscore that point, the President was introduced Monday by Geetha Vallabhaneni, who after waiting twelve years for a green card went on to found Luminix, a software firm."

Beginning in the early morning Tuesday with the killing of a Finance Ministry official with a bomb attached to his vehicle and continuing for hours, the attacks were a devastating reminder of the violence that regularly afflicts Iraq. And they somehow seemed more poignant coming on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the American-led invasion.

By midmorning, the familiar sight of black smoke rose above a cityscape of palm fronds, turquoise-tiled mosque domes and squat concrete buildings. By midafternoon, the numbers had stacked up: 57 dead and nearly 190 wounded in separate attacks that included 17 car bombs, 2 adhesive bombs stuck to cars, and a killing with a silenced gun.

Most attacks hit Shiite neighborhoods. Their targets varied: restaurants, a bank, a vegetable market and a parking garage. Others were near a courthouse and a university, and some seemed to have no target other than innocent passers-by. Many Iraqis say they worry about an increase in sectarian tensions. Though there were no immediate claims of responsibility, the attacks were carried out in the fashion of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Sunni insurgent group weakened but not vanquished by the American military."

But the story, and the details surrounding it, continues to garner interest

Relive the night the news broke and get caught up on the most recent developments

Two years later, the story of Osama bin Laden's death remains a high-interest topic.

Here are some of the key stories we've published since the world's most-wanted terrorist was killed, from the first breaking news story to the latest disputes over what happened that day.

News breaks

President Obama announced bin Laden's death shortly before midnight ET on May 1, 2011, more than an hour after the Internet and social media began exploding with reports of his demise.

The news also set what was then a Twitter record as people posted an average of 3,400 messages per second.

The aftermath

In the days and weeks following the raid, more details would be released about how it all went down. How did the U.S. know bin Laden was there? Who took part in the mission, and who knew about it? Why was bin Laden killed instead of taken prisoner? Over time, some of the details initially put out by the White House were clarified or changed . Some are still disputed today.

There were several other headaches for U.S. officials to deal with.

There was a full-throated debate about whether to release grisly photos of bin Laden's body to the public. But in the end, Obama, not wanting to incite further violence, chose to keep the photos classified . ""We don't need to spike the football,"" he told CBS News.

The killing also created tension that needed to be smoothed over with Pakistan, which was outraged that the United States chose to carry out the bin Laden mission there without first informing its leaders.

And then there was the downed helicopter U.S. officials hoped to retrieve from bin Laden's compound because of security concerns over the stealth technology of its unusual tail assembly

A few days after the raid, U.S. officials unveiled videos of bin Laden that were recovered in the raid. You can watch all of them here . Perhaps the most well-known video of this stash shows a hunched-over bin Laden, draped in a blanket, using a remote control to watch television.

Also taken in the raid were documents, disks, thumb drives, computers and other intelligence that would be pored over for evidence of further terrorist plots.

Years later

After bin Laden's death, much praise was heaped on the elite Navy SEALs who carried out the raid: the anonymous ""quiet professionals"" who live by a code to keep their sensitive missions secret.

But one former member of the team, Matt Bissonnette, detailed the mission in his 2012 best-seller ""No Easy Day."" The book started a debate about honor, ethics and cultural values in the military ; the Pentagon said Bissonnette included classified material in the book and didn't follow protocol for pre-publication review.

The raid was also portrayed in the film ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which focuses on the bin Laden manhunt and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Three U.S. senators -- Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain -- called the film ""grossly inaccurate and misleading,"" especially the movie's suggestion that harsh interrogations helped find bin Laden. The filmmakers responded by saying the film condensed 10 years of intelligence work into a 2½ hour film.

This year, Esquire magazine published a profile on a Navy SEAL who said he was the one who shot bin Laden. His account contradicted some of the details in Bissonnette's book.

Another SEAL, however, told Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, that the Esquire story is ""complete BS."""
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/857401.stm,2000-07-29 18:35:01,[],Immigration bond scheme scrapped,"An immigration bond scheme which would have forced certain visitors entering Britain to hand over about £3,000 has been dropped by the government.

The government has decided not to press ahead with the returnable deposit scheme after it stirred angry reaction among anti-racist and immigration support groups.

A pilot study of the proposals, aimed at people from some Asian and African countries whose visa applications might be considered borderline, was due to be introduced in the autumn.

Foreign Office Minister Keith Vaz confirmed on Saturday that the programme had been dropped for good.

Racist threat

Ministers have been hinting the scheme would be shelved since it sparked outrage from immigration campaigners and the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, Bill Morris.

In April Mr Morris said the scheme could encourage racists.

On Saturday he told BBC News Online the union welcomed the decision to drop the scheme.

""I'm delighted that people seeking to come to the UK will be judged on merit of their application rather than the size of their wallet,"" he said.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes added: ""The idea of bonds as a surety for visitors from some countries was clearly discriminatory.

""When will the government learn that what we need are sensible policies, not tough-sounding but half-baked ideas?""

First step

Mr Morris said the T&G would keep up pressure on the government to drop the ""iniquitous"" voucher system for asylum seekers.

Under the scheme, asylum seekers are given vouchers instead of cash to do their weekly shopping, which campaigners say is degrading.

They mounted protests outside supermarkets around England and Wales on Saturday, calling on retailers to pull out of the scheme.

""We believe the government should take the next step and abolish it,"" he said.

The National Assembly Against Racism and Indian Workers' Association Great Britain have also campaigned against the scheme and previous moves to charge up to £10,000 for relatives from the Indian sub-continent visiting residents in Britain.

The groups said the impact of the bond scheme could cause severe financial hardship for black families who are already over-represented among the poorest in Britain."
http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/27/israel-issues-warning-to-iran-over-nuclear-bomb-report/,2013-10-27 00:00:00,[],Israel issues warning to Iran over nuclear bomb report,"An Israeli defense official says a new report claiming Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb in less than a month is further justification for why Israel will take military action before that happens.

Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA Today that Iran is speedily moving to develop advanced centrifuges that will enable it to enrich uranium needed for nuclear weapons within weeks.

""We have made it crystal clear – in all possible forums, that Israel will not stand by and watch Iran develop weaponry that will put us, the entire Middle East and eventually the world, under an Iranian umbrella of terror,"" Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA Today.

The United States and other world powers fear Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic says its program is for peaceful energy production, and this week's meetings in part focused on how to scale back its enrichment of material that can be used to generate power or nuclear warhead material.

The Institute for Science and International Security on Thursday issued a report stating that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb in as little as one month, USA Today reported. The organization's estimates did not include the time required to build a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile

Meanwhile, the Obama administration is asking Congress to hold off on enacting new sanctions against Iran, arguing that a pause in the push to impose new penalties would give negotiators flexibility in talks now underway to get Iran to comply with demands it prove its nuclear program is peaceful.

Even as U.S. officials argue that tough sanctions are what brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, the White House and State Department said Friday the administration wants lawmakers to wait on new sanctions legislation to give the negotiations time to get traction. Some lawmakers have argued that now is not the time to ease pressure and that pursuing new sanctions will give the U.S. additional leverage in the talks.

But, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was the consensus of the administration's national security teams that a pause ""would be helpful in terms of providing some flexibility while we see if these negotiations will move forward."" She said the position was delivered to lawmakers and congressional aides at a White House meeting on Thursday.

""We have conveyed that any congressional action should be aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward. So while we understand that Congress may consider new sanctions, we think this is a time for a pause, as we asked for in the past, to see if negotiations can gain traction,"" Psaki told reporters.

She noted that additional sanctions can always be imposed later if the Iranians fail to meet their obligations, and she stressed that no existing sanctions are being lifted.

At the White House, national security council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the negotiations would not last indefinitely without progress and movement from Iran, which has long defied international demands to come clean about its nuclear intentions.

""The window for negotiation is not open-ended, and if progress isn't made, there may be a time when more sanctions are, in fact, necessary,"" Hayden said. ""We have always said that there would be no agreement overnight, and we've been clear that this process is going to take some time.""

Bipartisan pressure in Congress to ramp up sanctions on Iran has been rising for some time and hit a new high last week after negotiators from the United States, the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany met with Iranian officials in Geneva.

The chief U.S. negotiator, Wendy Sherman, told Congress before those talks that the administration would support tougher sanctions on Iran if it didn't come to the Geneva talks with ""concrete, substantive actions"" and a verifiable plan to scale back its nuclear program.

The Senate Banking Committee is expected soon to draft new sanctions shortly after the government reopens, largely mirroring a House bill that passed overwhelmingly by a 400-20 vote in July and blacklisted Iran's mining and construction sectors. It also called for all Iranian oil sales to end by 2015.

The Senate's bill may narrow that timeframe, block international investment in more economic sectors, try to close off Iran's foreign accounts and tighten Obama's ability to waive requirements for allies and key trading partners who continue to do business with Iran.

Nine militants%2C most wearing suicide vests%2C attacked Supreme Court complex

The attack sparked running battles with police and army forces



The assault was the most serious in Mogadishu since 2011

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Nine al-Shabab Islamic extremists, most wearing suicide vests, stormed Somalia's main court complex on Sunday while the Supreme Court was in session, firing a barrage of bullets during a running gun battle with security forces that lasted two hours, officials said.

A preliminary death toll stood at 16, including all nine attackers.

The assault was the most serious in Mogadishu since al-Shabab militants were forced out of the capital in August 2011. Al-Shabab controls far less territory today than in years past, and its influence appears to be on the decline, but Sunday's attack proved the extremists are still capable of pulling off well-planned and audacious assaults.

The attack on the Supreme Court complex began at around 12:30 p.m., sparking running battles with police and army forces. Two bomb blasts were heard and gunmen were seen on the roof of a court building firing shots, an Associated Press reporter at the scene said. Police officer Hassan Abdulahi said he saw five dead bodies lying at the entrance to the court.

The militants took an unknown number of hostages during the siege. Many other government workers and civilians in the court complex — a confusing labyrinth of buildings and rooms — hid while fearing for their lives.

Western officials knew militants had been planning something major. The British Foreign Office on Friday released a travel warning for Somalia that warned of a high threat of terrorism. ""We continue to believe that terrorists are in the final stages of planning attacks in Mogadishu,"" it said.

The complex and sustained nature of the assault on the court system suggested militants hoped to inflict severe casualties. Later, a suicide car bomber rammed a vehicle carrying Turkish citizens.

On a Twitter feed believed to belong to the militants, al-Shabab appeared to take credit for the attack. A posting said five militants from the ""Martyrdom Brigade"" took part in the ""daring"" attack.

Interior Minister Abdikarim Hussein Guled said nine militants attacked the court complex, and that six of them detonated suicide vests. Three others were shot and killed during the assault, he said. Guled said he couldn't immediately provide an overall death toll that included government officials and civilians.

Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said the ""pointless and pathetic act"" would have no effect on the government's commitment to progress. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said Somalia is moving forward but the enemy of Somalia and ""of all mankind"" is trying to prevent the country from prospering.

""I want the terrorist to know that our country, Somalia, is moving and will keep moving forward and will not be prevented to achieve the ultimate noble goal, a peaceful and stable Somalia, by a few desperate terrorists,"" Mohamud said.

Ugandan troops stationed in Mogadishu as part of the African Union force arrived at the scene and began taking up sniper positions on rooftops.

The Supreme Court was in session and the court's chief justice may have been the target of the assault, said a Western official who had been speaking to Somali officials. The official spoke on condition he wasn't identified because he wasn't authorized to release the information.

The gunmen took hostages in the complex's main courtroom and forced their way into other rooms in the complex, said another police officer, Abdinasir Nor.

The court complex is a confusing maze of buildings and rooms, allowing for plenty of places to hide but also for many places for gunmen to take hostages. The armed men forced their way inside the complex and immediately set off an explosion, said Yusuf Abdi, who was near the court when the attack happened.

About two hours after the assault began, survivors of the attack began coming out of the court complex. Some were crying and others held their heads in their hands.

""I never expected to make it out alive today,"" said Halima Geddi, who fled the court complex about two hours after the attack. She said she had taken cover behind an outer wall. ""There is no peace. No one protects us. I came to see my boy who was supposed to be tried here.""

At about 3 p.m. a suicide car bomber rammed his vehicle into a car carrying Turkish citizens to the airport, said Mohamed Anjeh, a police commander.

Mogadishu's main government center is heavily guarded with multiple security checks. However, the security at the court complex is not nearly as strong. The Ugandan troops who arrived on scene began pushing back on-lookers shortly after the attack began.

Most militant attacks in Mogadishu are blamed on fighters from al-Shabab, the al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremist rebel group in Somalia. Al-Shabab ruled Mogadishu from roughly 2006 until August 2011, when African Union and Somali forces pushed them out of the city. Since then the al-Shabab extremists have launched suicide bombings on the capital city every few weeks.

Despite those intermittent attacks, Mogadishu is generally considered more peaceful today than most of the previous seven years.

Estrada, who was ousted from the presidency in 2001 and convicted of large-scale corruption in 2007, returns to the political scene as the new mayor of Manila after winning the position in 13 May national elections. EPA/ROLEX DELA PENA

New Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, joined by other elected local officials, was formally sworn into office yesterday noon at the city hall, with the former president calling himself an ''ex-convict'' and promising to revive the old glory of the country's capital city.

Estrada took his oath before former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, marking his return to public office since his ouster from the presidency in 2001. Estrada began his first day in office as Manila Mayor five days after the Supreme Court asked his reply to a petition for intervention filed by outgoing Mayor Alfredo Lim in a disqualification case filed against him.

Estrada began his speech by thanking his supporters and appealing to those who did not vote for him to give him their trust and assistance as he works to improve the city's image.

''For the first time, Manila will have an ex-convict as your city mayor,'' he said as he related the events leading to the so-called EDSA II.

''I was convicted, and the justices who convicted me were immediately promoted to the Supreme Court. Kung ako man ay ex-convict, ito ay dahil sa prinsipyo,'' Estrada said.

''And I feel I am in good company with Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar and our own Senator Ninoy Aquino who was convicted by a military court. We were all convicted. That is why we are now all men of conviction,'' he added.

Vice President Jejomar Binay and daughter Nancy Binay also attended the ceremony while Sen. Jinggoy Estrada administered the oath taking of the elected city council officials.

The 76-year old former president said Manila needs to be revived as it is the ''gateway to the Philippines and the face and image of the Philippines.''

He cited reports of Manila policemen linked to crimes such as extortion, kidnapping, and robbery ''from Divisoria up to the Port Area.''

Story continues

Estrada also noted that last year, the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group tagged the Manila as the new ''carnap capital of the country,'' replacing Quezon City.

As if to add salt to the injury, American novelist Dan Brown called the city of Manila as the ''gates of hell'' in his new book ''Inferno'' released last May.

But for Estrada, Brown's book should serve as a wake-up call for city officials to be aggressive in restoring the city's former beauty and grandeur.

To achieve this, he said peace and order must be prioritized.

''Hindi lang basura ang wawalisin namin, pati corrupt officials...I promise you: The fight against corruption will be the centerpiece of our administration,'' he said.

''This is a warning and a wake-up call to police officers engaged in criminal activities from kotong to drug-dealing, from extortion to protection rackets and other abuses. I ask you to reform because we will go after you. Ang advice ko sa inyo, magbago na kayo! We will apply the full force of the law so that we may become a model city insofar as peace and order is concerned,'' the mayor said.

Estrada also vowed to improve the condition of the six hospitals in the city and to address the problem of illegal vendors lining the streets of Manila.

The new mayor said his first 100 days will be devoted to clearing the streets of vendors that cause traffic jams, which also create a ''conducive environment for petty crimes like snatching.''

'' Ang panukala ko dito ay maglunsad tayo ng mga night market kung saan puwede nang mag-okupa ng kalye ang mga vendor para magkaroon pa rin sila ng hanapbuhay na hindi sagabal sa traffic,'' he said.

Business owners will also be required to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to deter and solve crimes easily.

To solve the issue of flooding, he said the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and the Department of Public Works and Highways have already began the cleaning and dredging of creeks.

Estrada also vowed to institute an efficient and systematic tax collection system as he assured full transparency on all revenue collections, disbursements and expenditures of the city.

At the end of his speech, Estrada appealed to the public ''for a little patience and a little sacrifice,'' admitting that his three-year term faces insurmountable challenges.

''Pero hindi po ako si Superman at alam kong hindi ko kayang bigyan lahat ng ito ng madaling solusyon. Hindi minamadyik ang mga problemang nag-uugat sa maraming taon at dekada ng kapabayaan.''

For his part, Vice Mayor Francisco ''Isko Moreno'' Domagoso disclosed that they have already passed an ordinance that orders the fuel companies operating at the Pandacan oil depot to vacate the area by January 2016. He made the statement during the press conference following the oath-taking rites."

The death toll has surged from weekend violence in Afghanistan, with six Americans and more than a dozen Afghan civilians reportedly among the casualties.

Five Americans -- including a U.S. diplomat , a civilian from the Defense Department and three U.S. service members -- were killed while delivering books to an Afghan school, when a suicide bomber struck their convoy in southern Afghanistan's Zabul province Saturday. Another U.S. service member was killed in a separate attack Saturday.

The diplomat's death was a grim reminder of the risks and importance of pushing for change in ""one of the toughest places on earth,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said.

Anne Smedinghoff, 25, is believed to be the first U.S. diplomat killed since a September attack in Benghazi, Libya.

""I think there are no words for anybody to describe the extraordinarily harsh contradiction of a young 25-year-old woman with all of the future ahead of her, believing in the possibilities of diplomacy, of changing people's lives, of making a difference, having an impact, who was taking knowledge in books to deliver them to a school,"" Kerry said.

In separate clashes in Kunar province on Saturday, local officials said, at least 11 children were killed in a NATO operation aimed at Taliban targets. NATO officials said they were investigating reports of civilian casualties.

Kerry was emotional Sunday as he spoke to U.S. diplomats stationed in Istanbul about Smedinghoff's death.

Smedinghoff was ""vivacious, smart, capable, chosen often by the ambassador there to be the lead person because of her capabilities,"" Kerry said.

The attack killed Afghan civilians and wounded four more State Department personnel. One of them was in critical condition in a hospital in Kandahar, Kerry told reporters Sunday.

""I wish everyone in our country could see first-hand the devotion, loyalty and amazingly hard and hazardous work our diplomats do on the front lines in the world's most dangerous places,"" Kerry said in a statement Saturday. ""Every day, we honor their courage and are grateful for their sacrifices, and today we do so with great sadness.""

Smedinghoff volunteered for an assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and had been working there since July, her parents said in a statement.

""She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,"" Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff said. ""We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world.""

Afghan children killed

At least 11 Afghan children were killed Saturday in a joint military operation by Afghan and NATO forces, local officials said.

Mohammed Zaher Sapai, governor of the Shigal district, said 11 children were among 18 people killed in the operation.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force is investigating, spokesman John Manley said.

""We take these reports of civilian injuries very seriously,"" he said.

U.S. military brass visits

The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, is in Afghanistan for meetings with coalition and Afghan leaders.

Dempsey will be briefed on the ongoing military transition, where Afghan security forces are taking greater control of their country.

He will meet with Marine Corps Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, who took command of ISAF about two months ago.

""One of the things I'm going to ask (Dunford) is ... what have you learned,"" Dempsey told the American Forces Press Service.

""If he tells me 'Nothing,' I'm going to say, 'Maybe we got the wrong guy.'""

Dempsey spokesman Col. David Lapan later told CNN that the chairman was simply joking when he made the remark about Dunford. Dempsey has total confidence in Dunford, Lapan said."

The covert U.S. training at bases in Jordan and Turkey began months before President Obama approved plans to begin directly arming the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad, according to U.S. officials and rebel commanders.

“We have stepped up our assistance, but I cannot inventory for you all the elements of that assistance,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. “We have provided and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the Syrian opposition, as well as the Supreme Military Council.”

The Supreme Military Council is the military arm of an umbrella group that represents more moderate rebel factions, including the Free Syrian Army.

The training and Obama’s decision this month to supply arms and ammunition to the rebels have raised hope among the beleaguered opposition that Washington ultimately will provide heavier weapons as well. So far, the rebels say they lack the weapons they need to regain the offensive in Syria’s bitter civil war.

The tightly constrained U.S. effort reflects Obama’s continuing doubts about getting drawn into a conflict that already has killed more than 100,000 people and the administration’s fear that Islamic militants now leading the war against Assad could gain control of advanced U.S. weaponry.

The training has involved fighters from the Free Syrian Army, a loose confederation of rebel groups that the Obama administration has promised to back with expanded military assistance, said a U.S. official, who discussed the effort anonymously because he was not authorized to disclose details.

The number of rebels given U.S. instruction in both countries since the program began could not be determined, but in Jordan, the training involves 20 to 45 insurgents at a time, a rebel commander said.

U.S. special operations teams selected the trainees over the last year when the U.S. military set up regional supply lines to provide the rebels with nonlethal assistance, including uniforms, radios and medical aid.

The two-week courses include training with Russian-designed 14.5-millimeter anti-tank rifles, anti-tank missiles, as well as 23-millimeter anti-aircraft weapons, according to a rebel commander in the Syrian province of Dara who helps oversee weapons acquisitions and who asked his name not be used because the program is secret.

The training began last November at a new American base in the desert in southwest Jordan, he said. So far, about 100 rebels from Dara have attended four courses, while rebels from Damascus have attended three courses, he said.

“Those from the CIA, we would sit and talk with them during breaks from training and afterward, they would try to get information on the situation inside Syria,” he said.

The rebels were promised enough armor-piercing anti-tank weapons and other arms to gain a military advantage over Assad’s better-equipped army and security forces, said the Dara commander.

But arms shipments from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, provided with assent from the Americans, took months to arrive and included less than the rebels had expected.

Since last year, the weapons sent through the Dara military council have included four or five Russian-made heavy Concourse anti-tank missiles, 18 14.5-millimeter guns mounted on the backs of pickup trucks and 30 82-millimeter recoilless rifles. The weapons are all Soviet or Russian models but manufactured in other countries, he said.

“I’m telling you, this amount of weapons, once they are spread across the province [of Dara] is considered nothing,” the rebel commander said. “We need more than this to tip the balance or for there to even be a balance of power.”

U.S. officials said the Obama administration and its allies may supply anti-tank weapons to help the rebels destroy armored vehicles used by Assad forces. They are less likely to provide portable anti-aircraft missiles, which the rebels say they need to eliminate Assad’s warplanes. U.S. officials fear those missiles would fall into the hands of the Al Nusra front, the largest of the Islamist militias in the rebel coalition, which the U.S. regards as an Al Qaeda ally.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry is heading to Qatar on Saturday and will talk with other governments backing the rebels. A senior State Department official told reporters Friday that the talks would include discussions about coordinating deliveries of military aid.

CIA and White House officials declined to comment on the secret training programs. Other U.S. officials confirmed the training, but disputed some of the specific details provided by rebel commanders.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Bittar, who defected as a fighter pilot from Assad’s air force last year and is now head of intelligence for the Free Syrian Army, said training for the last month or so has taken place in Jordan.

The training, conducted by American, Jordanian and French operatives, involves rockets and anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry, he said.

Between 80 and 100 rebels from all over Syria have gone through the courses in the last month, he said, but training is continuing. Graduates are sent back across the border to rejoin the battle.

Bittar complained that sufficient weapons had yet to arrive for the rebel forces and said the Americans have not yet told them when they can expect to receive additional arms.

“Just promises, just promises,” he said.

Debate surges in Peru,"Story highlights Authorities say Peru will likely hold a selective draft this May Those who don't want to serve can pay a $715 fine Critics say the measure allows the wealthy to avoid military service Military leaders say the new measure is not discriminatory

(CNN) —

Is paying a fine to get out of military service fair?

The question is at the center of a debate surging in Peru this month as the South American country’s government reveals new rules for a possible draft.

Authorities say if the government can’t fill thousands of vacancies with volunteers, it will start a draft this May. Men and women 18 and over are eligible. But those called up who do not want to serve can pay a fine of 1,850 soles ($715).

Critics say the measure will allow the wealthy to avoid military service and leave the poor with no other choice than to join.

Military leaders say the new measure isn’t discriminatory and that the draft is a necessary step to shore up dwindling ranks.

The option of paying a fine to avoid service has drawn sharp criticism from Peru’s government ombudsman. And opposition lawmakers have said they will summon Peru’s defense minister to testify over the matter.

An editorial in the El Comercio newspaper this week described the new policy as “discrimination against those who have the least.”

“This is a hurdle designed so that only the people who have economic resources can jump over it,” the editorial said.

Nearly a third of Peru’s population lives below the poverty line, according to government statistics. A minimum wage salary is 750 soles ($290) per month.

The debate over who serves in the military, and why they join the ranks, resonates far beyond Peru’s borders.

In Israel, thousands of demonstrators last year demanded an end to rules that make ultra-Orthodox Jews exempt from that country’s military draft.

For more than a decade U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel has been pushing a controversial proposal to reinstate a draft in the United States.

“Currently the burden of defending our nation is carried by less than 1% of the American population,” the New York Democrat wrote in an opinion column published on CNN.com in January. “The 2.2 million members of the armed forces in active duty, the National Guard and the Reserve have become a virtual military class that makes the ultimate sacrifice of laying down life and limb for our country.”

Bringing back the draft, he argued, “would compel the American public to have a stake in the wars we fight as a nation.”

Many countries around the world require military service. Colombia, which borders Peru, also fines those who refuse to serve after they’re called up.

In Peru, officials say sheer numbers have forced them to consider a draft, more than a decade after the country passed a law eliminating obligatory military service.

Jose Cueto, chief of the joint command of Peru’s armed forces, told the state-run Andina news agency that there has been a “drastic decrease” in the number of people who join the military since the country switched to a volunteer force.

Rebel fighters have expressed disdain for US President Barack Obama after he backed away from striking over alleged chemical weapons attacks, saying the world does not care about Syria.

Leaders of two rebel brigades in the northern city of Aleppo, speaking to AFP after agreeing to join forces, also accused Russia and the regime of Bashar al-Assad of conspiring to buy time for the Syrian president to press his campaign against those seeking to overthrow him.

They were speaking as the United States and Russia hammered out a deal, based on proposals by Moscow, to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014 and leaving the door open to sanctions if Damascus fails to comply.

""America told the world it would bomb Syria and then, when the time came, it got scared,"" said Abdelqaderi Asasheh, operations chief of the Liwa al-Tawhid brigade in Aleppo.

The battalion's commander, Abdulaziz Salameh, was even more scathing about the United States.

While accusing Russia and Syria of ""devising a perfect plan to put a stop to an attack by the West,"" he said ""Obama has shown himself not to be a man of honour, without anything to say.""

He added with bravado that ""we don't need the attack. We don't need anyone. We count on the help of God, and he will guide us to final victory.""

However, he said that while ""we can't expect anything from the United States, but if they finally decide to attack we will take advantage of the situation and launch an offensive against the regime's military bases and against the airport in order to take control of Aleppo.""

Abu Tawfiqa, a commander of the Liwa al-Fatah brigade, said ""we don't want an attack, but if it happens the United States will find a very powerful ally on the ground.""

The two brigades held a ceremony on Friday at a former military academy north of Aleppo to mark the agreement to unite their forces, which they claim number 13,000 across the country.

Abu Feras, spokesman for Al-Tawhid, said ""the international community doesn't care what happens to Syria. If it really did it would have intervened a long time ago.""

""The United States and Russia are playing with Syria; we mean absolutely nothing to them. The same is true of the United Nations, which accuses the regime of crimes against humanity and keeps talking and talking, as if that would solve anything. They have been talking for 30 months and done absolutely nothing.""

A man standing nearby, interjected: ""Obama is a liar. He won't keep his word. He said he would attack if Assad used chemical weapons against the civilian population. What more does he need to intervene and put an end to this slaughter.""

Hassan al-Mara, a former school teacher turned fighter, agreed with the man.

""You are right, the West has let us down again. America and Europe have shown that their threats were no more than cheap propaganda.""

Aleppo, once the commercial capital of the country, had been relatively untouched by the Syria conflict which has killed more than 110,000 people since it flared in March 2011.

In summer 2012, rebels seized key districts of the city, and the army has been struggling to recapture them ever since. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting and relentless regime bombing.

A joint report drawn from The Huffington Post's seven international editions finds striking public opposition to military intervention in Syria, with polls showing weak support for a strike in much of Europe as well as in the United States and Canada.

In the United States, only 25 percent of those surveyed in late August in a HuffPost/YouGov poll expressed support for a military strike in reaction to the lethal chemical weapons attack blamed widely on the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad.

A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center and wrapped up Sept. 1 -– almost two weeks after the chemical weapons attack -– found only 29 percent in favor of a strike.

In France, where President Francois Hollande has pledged to join the United States in taking on Syria, public support for military intervention has been running at 45 percent, according to a recent CSA survey for Atlantico. Another poll conducted by Ifop for the newspaper Le Figaro found 55 percent in favor of intervention, yet only 41 percent approved of France joining in a military response.

In Britain, where polls have long shown consistent opposition to any form of intervention in Syria, neither allegations of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime nor the push for action from leaders in London and Washington has altered the opinion of a war-weary public.

A ComRes poll for the Independent newspaper published on Monday found that only 29 percent of people believe Britain should join the United States in launching air strikes against Syria to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, while 57 percent are outright opposed. Four out of five people assert that any military action against Syria requires the approval of the United Nations.

ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins told The Huffington Post UK that he doesn’t believe a forthcoming report from the United Nations weapons inspectors will “move the dials, and neither would further chemical crimes by Assad -– at least on the scale seen so far.”

In Germany, public opinion has been running 58 percent against striking Syria, according to public television. And in Italy a recent poll by the IPR Institute found that 52 percent of the public opposed an attack on Syria even absent Italian involvement. About 57 percent of Italians opposed allowing Italian military bases to be used in assisting foreign strikes engaged in strikes.

No polls have been conducted to gauge Canadian opinion on military intervention, but fatigue from involvement in Afghanistan and a few anti-Syrian-intervention protests suggest Canadians are not eager to jump in. Canada has signaled that it will not offer military support for a potential U.S.-led strike on Syria, while lending voice to calls for action.

Signs of public opposition from around the globe resonate as a rebuke to the Obama administration as it presses to unleash weapons on Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack there blamed for the deaths of some 1,400 people.

Public resistance reflects a marked predilection against military intervention following disastrous wars involving foreign forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. This sentiment appears to run especially deep in France, which played a leading role in interventions in Libya and Mali over the past two years.

“In Mali, France went in alone, and in Libya, it was the spearhead,"" Jerome Fourquet, who heads the Opinion department at Ifop, told Le Huffington Post. ""Public opinion considers it not the job of the French to be the world’s policeman.”

Public opposition also speaks to a palpable distrust of the intelligence touted in Washington as justification for firing on Syria. Memories of the run-up to the Iraq war and bogus claims that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction have carried over to the conflict at hand.

Among the British public, the ComRes poll found that 62 percent of voters felt the “experience of the Iraq war means that Britain should keep out of any military conflicts in the Middle East for the foreseeable future.""

Another poll conducted by Survation for the Mail on Sunday newspaper found that 81 percent of people opposed to military action cited Iraq as an influence. Around 40 percent said that calls for air strikes in Syria by former Prime Minister Tony Blair –- a leading architect of the Iraq war -- had weakened, rather than strengthened the British government’s case.

Much of the public opposition to Syria strikes reflects the fact that the conflict there is viewed as a confined event -– a humanitarian disaster, yes, and a potentially dangerous regional crisis, but not a direct threat to people living in the countries being asked to marshal a military response.

Governments in Washington, London, France and Ottawa have portrayed the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons as a threat to humanity everywhere -– the sort of cruelty and incivility that cannot be allowed with impunity. Yet despite efforts by President Barack Obama to stoke fears of chemical-weapon attacks against Americans and their allies, few people outside Syria fear for their own safety.

Hawkins, the ComRes chairman described “two key requirements” to gaining public support for military intervention abroad -- first, “a credible threat to the security of British citizens” and, second, “a reasonable prospect of success.""

Neither appears to apply to the Syria crisis, leaving those leaders pursuing military strikes at direct odds with their publics.

Still, analysts note that public opinion on armed intervention tends to be volatile, with patriotic surges and an impulse to support military forces typically following initial armed strikes.

Such was the dynamic in France in the case of Libya. In early March 2011, the French public was largely opposed to intervention in Libya, with only 36 percent expressing support in polls. But less than a month later, following the first French strikes in Libya, public support surged to 66 percent.

“What we saw was a patriotic reflex with public opinion rallying to the flag,"" Fourquet said. ""All the more so because risks were limited, as the intervention consisted exclusively of air strikes.”

And yet this same tendency for public opinion to fluctuate tends to work in reverse when military campaigns drag on: By the summer of 2011, as Moammar Gadhafi's regime fell in Libya, French approval for continued national involvement had just slipped below the 50 percent mark.

Another source of public unease is a sense that the military strikes could provoke an unforeseen regional conflagration, requiring a larger and more perilous intervention. So warns even a former member of the Syrian National Council, the coalition of opposition parties seeking to oust Assad.

""I could theoretically favor targeted and limited strikes, to exercise pressure and relaunch the political process, because there will be no military solution,"" the former SNC member, Randa Kassis, said in an exclusive interview with HuffPost Maghreb. ""But the problem with these strikes is the response of the regime. How will Western countries react then? Have they considered the risk. If one response leads to the next, what will the consequences be? A regional war, perhaps? I am against intervention, because we don't know the consequences.""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a ceremony broadcast on state television that building the Qaher F-313, or Dominant F-313, shows Iran's will to ""conquer scientific peaks"".

Tehran has repeatedly claimed to have developed advanced military technologies in recent years, but its claims cannot be independently verified because the country does not release the technical details.

The state started producing its own military equipment in the 1980s to compensate for a Western weapons embargo that banned export of military technology and kit to Iran.

The Defence Minister, Ahmad Vahidi, said: ""Qaher is a fully indigenous aircraft designed and built by our aerospace experts.

""This is a radar-evading plane that can fly at low altitude, carry weapons, engage enemy aircrafts and land at short airstrips.""

He said it was Iran's best stealth plane.

However, some reports suggest Iran's programme relies on equipment supplied by major international defence contractors and that it incorporates parts made abroad or uses outside engineered technologies in its domestic designs.

Pictures of the Qaher released by the official IRNA news agency and pictures on state TV showed a single-seat jet. They described it as a fighter-bomber that can combat other aircraft and ground targets.

Iran's English-language state Press TV said Qaher was similar to the American-made F/A-18, an advanced fighter capable of dogfighting as well as penetrating enemy air defences to strike ground targets.

Hasan Parvaneh, an official in charge of the project, said the physical design of the Iranian plane was unique and bore no resemblance to any foreign fighter jet.

""Development depends on our will. If we don't have a will, no one can take us there,"" President Ahmadinejad said.

""Once we imported cars and assembled them here. Now, we are at a point where we can design, build and get planes in the air."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The State Department has warned U.S. citizens to defer travel or leave the country

Egyptian anger against the U.S. government has increased in recent weeks

Some Americans who have deep roots in Egypt aren%27t so quick to leave

CAIRO — When American Drew Brammer accidentally stayed out after the 7 p.m. curfew here Saturday, he became a little worried.

""I'm afraid if I walk out they'll be like, 'Where's your passport? We need to go to your house,' "" the English teacher from Oregon said via phone from a Cairo gym — where he got caught up in a political chat — not far from a security checkpoint.

Some Americans have fled the country amid the ongoing unrest this summer in Egypt, where nearly 900 were killed this week alone in clashes between security forces and protesters. Others have changed their plans to arrive, but some, like Brammer, are choosing to stay in a nation where residents are living under a constant state of emergency.

""Part of me kind of thinks that this will pass and I can just ride it out,"" said Brammer, 28, who teaches English in Egypt and also studies Arabic.

On Thursday, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to defer travel or leave the country because of ongoing political and social unrest. The agency urged Americans to follow local regulations, including the 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. government-imposed curfew.

Fresh turmoil began at the end of June when millions took to the streets to protest against then-president Mohammed Morsi. After the leader was ousted in early July, the State Department ordered all non-emergency embassy staff and their families to depart. A travel warning was also issued.

Some have heeded the caution. A group of American interns on scholarship here were told to leave, said Jessica Smelser, who recently graduated from George Washington University with a master's degree.

Smelser, scheduled to arrive in Cairo in mid-July herself, never made it to Egypt's capital.

""A week before I was about to leave, my university told me, 'You can't go there, and all the other students there are being evacuated.' ""

At first, Smelser was upset at the decision as she was forced to choose a different city in the Middle East for her internship, but after hearing about the increasing violence in Egypt and growing rage directed at the U.S., she says, ""I'm really glad they didn't let me go.""

""I stick out. I'm very pale, red hair,"" Smelser said, referring to potential threats against Americans. ""I don't look like I belong there.""

Anger against the U.S. government has increased in recent weeks as one political camp accused Washington of backing the Muslim Brotherhood while others said President Obama did little to stop the ouster of Morsi, an Islamist propelled to power by the group.

In late June, Andrew Pochter, 21, a student at Ohio's Kenyon College was killed in mob violence in Alexandria.

Days later, the Washington-based American Councils for International Education evacuated 18 students from the northern coastal city, according to the Associated Press. Fulbright program participants and Center for Arabic Study Abroad fellows were also evacuated, ABC News reported.

But some Americans who have deep roots in Egypt aren't so quick to leave. One of them, Abigail Toner, is almost six months' pregnant.

The 34-year-old, Long Island-born American has lived here for 2½ years. She works for an Egyptian company, is married to an Egyptian man and just moved with her husband across town into a new apartment.

""All these different things … have me here for now,"" Toner said. ""That doesn't mean my husband and I haven't been saying: What's the breaking point?""

Toner said she doesn't feel she is in personal danger, even as a woman in a country where reports of sexual harassment are high and there is widespread anger toward Americans.

""I'm not near any of the things that are going on,"" she said, referring to clashes and protests. ""Because I feel safe, I feel I can keep the baby safe.""

Yosra Brander can't say the same. ""I guess my worry is: It hasn't come into our neighborhood. But is it going to?"" she said.

A Muslim American from the Midwest, Brander moved to Egypt four years ago as a single mom with a job contract, no place to live and $2,000 in her pocket. Now she has an apartment, a husband and ""one of the best jobs you can get"" as a teacher at an international school.

""I've built a life here,"" she said. But in recent weeks, familiar places have turned into sites of violence.

A neighborhood Brander knows as a good place for buying school supplies became the scene of a shooting Friday. An appliance store she just shopped at was looted. And familiar sites have turned into killing zones, like the squares outside Cairo University and Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque, where security forces crushed sit-ins Wednesday.

""Everything is becoming ruined, and I don't want Egypt to get ruined,"" she said. ""I'm worried about what could happen, and nobody knows right now what could happen.""

On Saturday night, as the hours ticked on and security forces patrolled some of the streets, Brammer finally left the safety of the gym, even in light of the curfew. He made it home without any problems.

""The army checkpoint was way chill,"" he wrote in a text message just after midnight local time. ""There were kids playing soccer and riding bikes around it. ... They just said hi to me, and I walked by."""

Putin reassumed the presidency of Russia last year, President Obama dispatched his national security adviser to Moscow. Mr. Obama had made considerable progress with Dmitri A. Medvedev, the caretaker president, and wanted to preserve the momentum.

Any hopes of that, however, were quickly dashed when Mr. Putin sat down with the visiting American adviser, Tom Donilon, at the lavish presidential residence outside Moscow. Rather than talk of cooperation, Mr. Putin opened the meeting with a sharp challenge underscoring his deep suspicion of American ambitions:

“When,” he asked pointedly, “are you going to start bombing Syria?”

At the time, Mr. Obama had no plans for military involvement in the civil war raging in the heart of the Middle East, but Mr. Putin did not believe that. In Mr. Putin’s view, the United States wanted only to meddle in places where it had no business, fomenting revolutions to install governments friendly to Washington.

The meeting 16 months ago set the stage for a tense new chapter in Russian-American relations, one that will play out publicly this week when Mr. Obama travels to St. Petersburg for a Group of 20 summit meeting hosted by Mr. Putin. Although Mr. Obama had no intention of bombing Syria last year, on Saturday he said he now favored military action against Syrian forces, not to depose the government of Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, but in retaliation for gassing its own citizens — an assertion Mr. Putin denounced as “utter nonsense” to justify American intervention.

While it was the Kremlin’s decision last month to shelter Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, that finally prompted Mr. Obama to call off a separate one-on-one meeting he had scheduled with Mr. Putin while in Russia, the core of the schism is not so much that case as the radically different worldviews revealed by the Syria dispute. Where Mr. Obama feels compelled to take action to curb the use of unconventional weapons, Mr. Putin sees American imperialism at work again."

USA TODAY

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu says Jerusalem will never be divided

Palestinian Authority%27s Abbas wants East Jerusalem for a capital

Proposals range from divine sovereignty to tunnels

As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators prepare for preliminary talks in Washington on Monday, the future of Jerusalem looms as the thorniest and most difficult issue to resolve.

The State Department announced Sunday that the two sides had accepted invitations from Secretary of State John Kerry to come to Washington ""to formally resume direct final status negotiations."" The department said two days of initial meetings will begin Monday evening.

U.S. officials say Secretary of State John Kerry will name former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk to shepherd the peace talks. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the announcement, say Kerry would name Indyk Monday at the State Department.

Kerry's announcement of negotiations came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet approved the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners, a key part of the Kerry-brokered deal.

Netanyahu has said Jerusalem — which Israel unified in the 1967 Six-Day War and claims as its capital — is the heart of the Jewish nation and will never be divided.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says there can be no agreement and no end to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis without a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the last remnants of the Jews' Second Temple and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

""Jerusalem will be a huge problem"" to overcome for any final agreement, says Aaron David Miller, a former adviser on Arab-Israeli peace negotiations to Democratic and Republican secretaries of State. ""Down the road, (talks) will fail if Jerusalem is not resolved.""

Miller says the parties will tackle other issues first, such as borders and security, to build trust and confidence on both sides before moving to more difficult ""identity issues"" such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and a demand by Netanyahu that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish homeland.

Before announcing that Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to meet on resuming talks, Kerry obtained a pledge from Qatar that it would sweeten an Arab proposal initially put forward by Saudi Arabia in 2002 that offered Israel peace with 22 Arab nations and 35 Muslim nations if it returned all lands it seized in 1967 and agreed to a ""just solution"" for Palestinian refugees.

Under Qatar's new proposal, the Gulf state said border disputes between Israelis and Palestinians could be solved through land swaps. The Qatari statement meant that Arab states would endorse a compromise on Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

In the 46 years since Israel took control of the land there, it has built Jewish neighborhoods in and around East Jerusalem, and cities in the West Bank that Netanyahu and previous Israeli leaders have pledged to retain in any future deal. How much of the West Bank Israel would retain is yet to be decided, but Israel is expected to compensate Palestinians with territory from territory that was considered part of Israel before 1967, Miller says.

The two sides will also have to agree on security, including what kinds of weapons a Palestinian military would be allowed to have, whether a new Palestinian state could sign defense treaties with other nations and whether Israel could maintain its military presence in the Jordan River Valley, which separates the West Bank from Jordan.

Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, predicts agreement on such issues is achievable because security is a prerequisite for economic development and is in the Palestinians' self-interest. However, compromise on the fate of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees scattered across the Arab world and on the Palestinian claim to Jerusalem will be much harder, Ibish says.

Ibish says Palestinians will have to accept that refugees and their descendants who've lived for decades without full citizenship in other nations will never be allowed to return to the homes they left. Their numbers would outnumber the Jewish population, which Israel would never accept, Ibish says.

On Jerusalem, however, there will either be a compromise or no deal, he says.

Competing claims on the land are most intense in the Temple Mount-Haram al Sharif area and the stone-paved 1-square-kilometer area of Jerusalem's Old City. But Jewish neighborhoods and construction in and around East Jerusalem have given rise to various creative solutions for resolving the riddle of how two people can share the same place:

• Palestine or Israel could have exclusive sovereignty over individual areas of the Holy Basin and the Old City. However, Ibish says such an option is not viable because neither side will trust the other, and the city has to somehow operate as a municipality with shared transportation, electrical grid and other services.

• Another option is shared sovereignty or some kind of international administration for the Holy Basin, where it would be managed by a United Nations committee headed by a party agreed to by both sides.

• A light-rail system along the border of Israel and the West Bank boundary of the new Palestine could include train stops that would incorporate border crossings from one side to another. A sketch of this notion was reportedly put on the table during 2008 negotiations between Abbas and then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Edward Djerejian, U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1992 to 1995 under President Clinton, has made fresh proposals of his own as director of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Texas. The two sides will have to agree upon a unified city that serves as a capital for two states and has joint municipal planning for shared systems such as the electrical grid and transportation, Djerejian says.

""At the end of the day, it is going to be intermingled in many ways,"" and it would be a first arrangement of its kind in the world, he says. ""I can't think of another city where that pertains."""

She held roundtable meetings to discuss the issue of caring for the elderly in nursing homes so that workers could participate. Her own experiences as the mother of a patchwork family with three children and resident of a publicly sponsored social living project have contributed to her image of being straightforward and someone to whom average people can relate.

Bettina Munimus, a researcher with the European Academy for Women in Politics and Economics, based in Berlin, said that Ms. Dreyer’s more consensus-oriented approach is indicative of an overall shift, visible in the other states where women are now in charge — including the biggest, North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as Saarland and Thuringia.

“In the previous generation, the old male politicians used the ‘basta’ style of politics to outwardly demonstrate power and the need for the final word,” Ms. Munimus said. Not so the female governors. “They know that power is needed to bring about policy, but along the way, it is important to cooperate, to create policy with others. That is the identifying factor of this style.”

Since 2010, another Social Democrat, Hannelore Kraft, has governed North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state and one known for decades as much for its old boys’ political network as for its heavy industry.

Ms. Kraft was forced to settle right after her election for a minority government that relied on the support of political foes to pass legislation. Together with the deputy governor, Sylvia Löhrmann from the Greens, Ms. Kraft dubbed her government the “invitation coalition” and got to work.

Two years later, her fragile constellation collapsed, and Ms. Kraft faced off against a former minister from Ms. Merkel’s conservative party in fresh elections last May. Not only did Ms. Kraft retain her governorship; she won a clear majority in the state legislature for government with the Greens.

Many Germans would have liked to see Ms. Kraft run as the Social Democratic candidate, challenging Ms. Merkel for the chancellorship, in September elections. A recent survey by Statista pollsters showed the 51-year-old the third most popular politician in the country, after Ms. Merkel and Joachim Gauck, the German president."

More than five million council house tenants in Britain will be given the right to buy their home under new government proposals.

The Housing Bill published today will give tenants who have lived in their home for up to three years a 33% discount on the market value of their home, increasing in stages up to 50% for a tenancy of 20 years.

The government believes the bill will transform the social structure of Britain for good. Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for the environment, said: ""This bill lays the foundations for one of the most important social revolutions of this century.""

But Shelter, the organisation for homeless people, has said the move will increase the number of homeless people and decrease the number of homes available to accommodate them.

Opposition

Labour are vehemently opposed to the proposals believing the impact on the nation's pocket will be huge. Roy Hattersley, shadow environment spokesperson said: ""We shall fight it very hard in the House of Commons and in the country.""

As a further incentive to prospective buyers the government will also offer tenants a 100% mortgage from the local authority.

Those who cannot afford to buy their home immediately will be able to pay a £100 deposit and postpone the sale for two years at which time they will be able to purchase their home at today's prices.

If local authorities do not comply with the new legislation the secretary of state will have the power to directly intervene in the sale.

Critics have accused the government of being too generous to council house tenants but the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher and her government are sure the new policy will pave the way for a property-owning democracy and a more socially responsible population.

Labour believe the cost to the public purse will be at least £5,000 per sale but the Conservatives maintain that central and local government will save millions through the reduction of subsidy to council house tenants."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Syrian activists say a string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in the country's north has killed at least 20 people, leveled buildings and forced residents to dig through mounds of rubble in search of survivors. (AP Photo/Lens Yong Homsi)

A State Department cable suggests the Syrian army likely used chemical weapons during an attack in the city of Homs last month, Foreign Policy's The Cable reports.

According to the website, a cable signed by the U.S. consul general in Istanbul and sent to the State Department described an investigation by the consulate into the Dec. 23 attack.

An Obama administration official who reviewed the document, which was classified at the ""secret"" level, detailed its contents to The Cable. ""We can't definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23,"" the official said.

U.S. and NATO representatives have warned the embattled Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons would trigger an international reaction. ""The possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons I would expect an immediate reaction from the international community,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in December, according to Reuters.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist network based in Britain, claimed in December that six Syrian rebels had died after inhaling smoke in the city of Homs. The Observatory said that the fighters inhaled ""white smoke without a smell"" and that they ""felt dizzy and suffered headaches."" Some reportedly suffered seizures.

Al Jazeera received two videos in the wake of the Dec. 23 assault, which purport to show the aftermath of the attack.

Syria denied the December accusations and said it would not use chemical weapons against its citizens.

While the U.S. has said the use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" the administration has refrained from specifying what action it would consider.

The State Department declined to comment to The Cable.

Activists estimate more than 60,000 people have died since the start of the conflict in Syria in March 2011."

Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week” that the release of more than 100 pages of Benghazi emails and notes show “beyond a shadow of the doubt” that accusations she tried to change the narrative of what happened in the attacks was false.

""And, frankly, I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this, now that they have seen the emails, owe Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack,” he said.

“An apology for what?” host George Stephanopoulos asked.

“For accusing her of misleading the country,” Pfeiffer said, adding, “For saying that she didn't -- that somehow we were -- she was involved in some sort of political whitewash of what happened there. What she said was what the intelligence community believed at the time. And when we got further information, we told the American people what that was. That's how people know what happened here.”

Pfeiffer’s comments aren’t likely to sit well with some, like GOP lawmakers like Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, who led the charge against her and claimed she played an active role in the conspiracy to hide what actually happened during the Benghazi attacks."

In a nation nicknamed the “graveyard of empires,” foreign forces are remembered for what they leave behind. The United States is leaving heaps of scrap in Afghanistan.

The armored trucks, televisions, ice cream scoops and nearly everything else shipped here for America’s war against the Taliban are now part of the world’s biggest garage sale. Every week, as the U.S. troop drawdown accelerates, the United States is selling 12 million to 14 million pounds of its equipment on the Afghan market.

Returning that gear to the United States from a landlocked country halfway around the world would be prohibitively expensive, according to U.S. officials. Instead, they’re leaving behind $7 billion worth of supplies, a would-be boon to the fragile Afghan economy.

But there’s one catch: The equipment is being destroyed before it’s offered to the Afghan people — to ensure that treadmills, air-conditioning units and other rudimentary appliances aren’t used to make roadside bombs.

“Many non-military items have timing equipment or other components in them that can pose a threat. For example, timers can be attached to explosives. Treadmills, stationary bikes, many household appliances and ­devices, et cetera, have timers,” said Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency.

That policy has produced more scrap metal than Afghanistan has ever seen. It has also led to frustration among Afghans, who feel as if they are being robbed of items such as flat-panel televisions and armored vehicles that they could use or sell — no small thing in a country where the average annual income hovers at just over $500.

In Afghanistan, nicknamed the “graveyard of empires,” foreign forces are remembered for what they leave behind. In the 1840s, the British left forts that still stand today. In the 1980s, the Russians left tanks, trucks and aircraft strewn about the country. The United States is leaving heaps of mattresses, barbed wire and shipping containers in scrap yards near its shrinking bases.

“This is America’s dustbin,” said Sufi Khan, a trader standing in the middle of an immense scrap yard outside Bagram air base, the U.S. military’s sprawling headquarters for eastern Afghanistan.

The scrap yard looks like a post-industrial landfill in the middle of the Afghan desert, a surreal outcropping of mangled metal and plastic. There’s a tower of treadmills 50 feet high and an acre of American buses, trucks and vans, stripped of seats and engines. An ambulance is perched unsteadily atop a pile of scrap, as if it fell from the sky. A mountain of air-conditioning units sits next to a mountain of truck axles.

Some of the scrap still shows signs of its previous owners — vehicles spray-painted with American names, mattresses sunken from 12 years of use, bumper stickers from Hawaii or Oklahoma.

A torrent of scrap

The Bagram scrap yard is owned by Feda Mohammad Ulfat, who helped build the neighboring base more than a decade ago, transporting gravel and concrete. Now Ulfat is helping to dismantle the base, taking in thousands of pounds of American scrap metal every day.

“I never imagined we’d be getting this much stuff,” he said.

Not all of the equipment reaching the scrap yard was deliberately damaged: Some was already broken after a decade of use. Ulfat decided several years ago that he would invest in it anyway.

Some of his friends thought he was crazy, but Ulfat had an idea: The expensive American gear could be melted and reconstituted as raw material for an Afghan building boom. He’d gotten rich on dozens of other contracts with the U.S. military, and he assumed that this one would be no different.

When he signed the contract, the scrap metal was only trickling in. But over the past six months, the U.S. drawdown has reached a fever pitch in eastern Afghanistan, with dozens of bases being closed. Suddenly, a torrent of scrap metal was being delivered to Ulfat’s farm. He had to buy more land. Scrap was piled atop scrap. He now spends up to a half-million dollars a month on gear that has been shredded or flattened.

When U.S. officials began planning for their exit, the idea was to ship home the majority of their equipment, especially expensive military gear such as mine-resistant vehicles. That calculus has changed.

The Pentagon has budgeted $5 billion to $7 billion to ship gear back to the United States. But that sum isn’t enough to take everything currently in Afghanistan.

Wanting at least a small return on its investment, the U.S. military decided to sell the leftovers for pennies on the pound. That’s where Ulfat came in.

He has now opened his scrap yard for the public to rummage through. Small groups of men wander around, buying broken air conditioners that can be stripped of their copper wiring or sheets of corrugated iron that can be sold to Pakistani traders. Many of the supplies that the U.S. military used to fight its longest war have begun their second lives in South and Central Asia.

This month, Haji Montazer paced the scrap yard with his son. They were looking for generators that might be repairable or really anything that they could sell in Kabul or Pakistan. One of their customers makes bed frames out of the metal beams that once held up American military structures. Another takes metal pieces — parts of military vehicles and barbed wire — to Lahore, where they are melted and sold as corrugated rooftops for cheap Pakistani homes.

Not like the Russians

Montazer once bought equipment from the Soviet forces, which began their withdrawal in the late 1980s.

“But the Russians didn’t break their things before they sold them to us,” he said.

That bitter sentiment is shared by many who visit Ulfat’s scrap yard. The United States has not publicly explained why its gear is destroyed before being sold. U.S. officials are quick to point out that the Afghan government typically has an opportunity to express interest in American military equipment, which is sometimes handed over intact.

Lately, Ulfat’s dream of getting rich off the U.S. scrap has started to fade. Kabul’s real estate boom is over, he said. All he hears from Afghans are concerns about what will happen to the country after the U.S. withdrawal. His scrap yard tells the story of the drawdown.

“What will we do with all of this? Right now, no one will buy it. And if the future is as bad as people say it will be . . . .” His voice trailed off. “It could be bad.”

Hafizullah, an employee of Ulfat’s who goes by one name, wandered through the scrap yard one day this month, overseeing the latest delivery — a mix of blast walls and carburetors. With Bagram still the most active base in eastern Afghanistan, aircraft flew over his head incessantly.

One helicopter flew particularly close, hovering near the scrap yard. Hafizullah pointed to the Black Hawk and laughed.

“I can’t wait until they start selling those here,” he said."

Updated at 11:48 a.m. ET on 8/25



Washington (CNN) – Two key members of congressional foreign affairs panels say they expect the United States to strike Syria following reports of chemical weapons attacks in that country last week, though other lawmakers interviewed Sunday cautioned that unilateral action would be misguided.

""I think we will respond in a surgical way and I hope the president, as soon as we get back to Washington, will ask for authorization from Congress to do something in a very surgical and proportional way. Something that gets their attention, that causes them to understand that we are not going to put up with that kind of activity,"" Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""



But Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs panel, said President Barack Obama may not need to wait for congressional authorization.

""Congress needs to be involved but perhaps not initially,"" Engel said. ""Perhaps the president could start and then Congress needs to resolve it and assent to it. We cannot sit still. We've got to move and we've got to move quickly.""

Another Democrat, however, said the United States should only intervene militarily in Syria with the backing of an international coalition.

“This has to be an international operation, it can’t be a unilateral American approach,” Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“We can’t let ourselves get into a situation where this becomes a springboard for a general military operation in Syria to try and change the dynamic,” Reed said. “That dynamic is going to be long term, very difficult, and ultimately established by the Syrians, not by foreign powers.”

Rep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CBS he didn’t think Americans “have an appetite to put troops on the ground in Syria.”

The situation in Syria escalated dramatically last week after reports the government there used chemical weapons in civilian areas.

Opposition groups say over a thousand people died in the attack with thousands more affected by the gas.

CNN cannot independently verify the causality claims.

Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister said Sunday that the government will allow United Nations inspectors to visit the site of the alleged attack, but that may be too late.

""If the Syrian government had nothing to hide and wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident, it would have ceased its attacks on the area and granted immediate access to the UN – five days ago. At this juncture, the belated decision by the regime to grant access to the UN team is too late to be credible,"" a senior Obama administration official said Sunday.

Over 100,000 people are estimated to have perished so far in Syria's civil war.

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']",David Ignatius: People power rises again,"“Authoritarianism in the name of Islam is dead,” messaged one Egyptian activist last Sunday, as millions gathered in the streets to denounce the rule of President Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood government.

What happened over the next few days combined elements of a popular uprising and a military coup. The mass protest against Morsi showed the strength of dissent. But the Egyptian army’s role in toppling Morsi Wednesday was a reminder that the danger of authoritarianism is still very much alive in the Middle East, whether it’s under religious or nationalist guise.

The United States so far has been largely irrelevant to events in Egypt. I wish the Obama administration had been doing more to back moderates in the Middle East, overall, but in Egypt, the United States deliberately played the role of mediator rather than decider. The army wanted a public American “green light” for its coup, but it didn’t get one.

Perhaps the best thing that can be said on this July 4th is that the Egyptian people are writing their own history. They may be making mistakes along the way, and I wish we weren’t seeing a general in uniform seizing the stage again. But for once, the Middle East conspiracy theorists who always see America as the controlling force in events seem to have been wrong. President Obama has been a back-seat passenger.

The target of this week’s protests was Morsi, but the mass demonstrations recalled the giddy days of the February 2011 revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. The basic message was the same: We are citizens. We want dignity and human rights. We aren’t afraid of autocratic leaders or their thugs. That revolt led to military rule, too, but its spirit was one of idealism and democracy.

“It’s a second revolution,” Ahmed Said, a leader of Egypt’s National Salvation Front, told the Guardian newspaper. He was right. The danger is that, as in the French, Russian and Iranian revolutions, we are in a prolonged period of violence and instability that will only end with a new dictator.

What’s fascinating is that the new challenge to religious parties in the Middle East transcends sectarian lines. The protest against the Muslim Brotherhood in Sunni Egypt is matched by a similar renewal of dissent in Shiite Iran, where the 2009 Green Revolution was crushed by government repression.

The unlikely emblem of change in Iran is Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president last month. He’s part of the clerical establishment that has run Iran for the past three decades. So it’s premature to assume that Rouhani’s election signals any breakthrough in stalled negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.

But Rouhani’s victory does tell us something about the Iranian public mood: Among the six candidates who ran in the June 14 election, Rouhani was the most critical of the status quo; he called for reforms and new ties with the West. The fact that he won 51 percent of the vote (with a 73 percent turnout) marked a break from the tutelage of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who appeared to favor national security adviser Saeed Jalili.

“We have no other option than moderation,” Rouhani said during the campaign. What this will mean in practice isn’t clear, but Rouhani has urged in his writings that Iran engage with the West, rather than depend on Russia and China.

Protesters have also shaken the Islamic populism of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He has been an “authoritarian rock star,” in the words of William Dobson, the author of “The Dictator’s Learning Curve.” But even Erdogan triggered a backlash after years of squeezing the Turkish media, courts and military. “The shared experience of repression, combined with collective frustration at mounting top-down efforts to regulate public life . . . brought citizens from different walks of life together” in Turkey, wrote Emiliano Alessandri, Nora Fisher Onar and Ozgur Unluhisarciklion the Foreign Affairs Web site.

This new wave of activism in the Middle East isn’t pro- or anti-American. It’s something else — a movement of empowered citizens who don’t want the old secular dictatorships of Hosni Mubarak’s era, and don’t want a new Islamic authoritarianism, either. This core of “people power” surfaced in the initial “Arab Spring” of 2011, but a chill developed as the Muslim Brotherhood gained control in Egypt and chaos prevailed in Libya and Syria. Despite these setbacks, this week showed there is still a popular movement for democratic change that resists dictation from anyone.

“I have never seen anything like this, not even during February of 2011. This is a genuine popular movement, no organisation whatsoever,” tweeted Egyptian writer Bassem Sabry late Tuesday.

For U.S. officials, recent events are a reminder that the Middle East is still in the early stages of a long-running process of transformation. Morsi’s election in 2012 offered the Muslim Brotherhood a chance to show that it could govern Egypt effectively. It has flunked the test — and the Egyptian military has lost patience with the failed experiment.

On America’s Independence Day, we celebrate the triumph of our democracy. But David McCullough reminds us in his book “1776” that in January of that revolutionary year, George Washington despaired that “few people know the predicament we are in.” It took America another 12 years to write and ratify a workable Constitution. In the Middle East, the convulsive democratic transition is just beginning.

He Was Among Post Reporters Awarded The Pulitzer Prize For National Reporting.']",Managing the bomb,"Is the United States entering a period in which it has to learn to live with “the bomb,” as in the spread of nuclear weapons?

Compare the apparent contradiction between the way Washington is dealing with North Korea and Iran and the effect this could have on other countries.

North Korea not only has the capability to produce nuclear weapons (it has conducted three underground tests), but it has also stated an intention to build them. At last month’s plenary meeting of the North Korean Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, “a new strategic line was laid down on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear-armed forces,” said a spokesman for North Korea’s General Department of Atomic Energy.

In April 2009, Pyongyang threw out inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Since then there has been no monitoring of those facilities. North Korea has been subjected to increasing economic sanctions, but those efforts have not slowed its progress toward a deliverable nuclear weapon.

Yet I haven’t heard any official in Washington, Seoul, Tokyo or Beijing talk about attacking reactors at Yongbyon, where plutonium or uranium are being refined — or any secret facilities that may be making highly enriched uranium.

Meanwhile, Israel and the United States have threatened military action against Iran should Tehran move toward building a nuclear weapon. Israel’s red line is Iran developing the capability to produce highly enriched uranium at its two major facilities at Natanz and Fordow. Both are being visited by IAEA inspectors who report on the level of enrichment being achieved.

The inspections provide the United States and Israel some early warning should Iran suddenly try to break out and produce weapons-grade material. Another tipoff: if Iran told the IAEA to leave.

And although North Korean verbal threats are treated as bluster because they don’t appear to be supported with military action, Iran is seen as an “existential threat.” and its repeated claims that it doesn’t want to build nuclear weapons are dismissed as lies.

Several truths are not being discussed in all of this.

The first is that most people in Iran and North Korea want the prestige that goes with nuclear weapons, although most are paying an economic price. Notice that North Korea’s youthful new leader tied the determination to build nuclear-armed forces with “pushing forward economic construction.”

What most Americans don’t know is that North Korea first sought help from the Soviet Union for a nuclear reactor after the United States threatened to use its nuclear weapons to end the Korean War. Soon after, Pyongyang learned that U.S. nuclear bombs and artillery shells had been stored at bases in South Korea — and the desire for their own weapons increased.

Having nuclear weapons is a popular political issue in Iran. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi began the nuclear power program with technology and highly enriched uranium provided by the United States for a research reactor. He also had in mind gaining technology for producing a bomb. When the shah was deposed in 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered an end to Iran’s nuclear programs.

Ironically, it was U.S. claims that Iraq, Tehran’s enemy, was developing nuclear weapons that led Khomeini to restart his country’s program in 1984. Today, Iran’s neighbors — Russia, India and Pakistan — have nuclear weapons, as do its prime enemies, Israel and the United States.

No wonder the nuclear program appeals to Iranian national pride. In 2009, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tried to calm the United States and other Western countries by appearing to negotiate the future of the nation’s nuclear program, his most vocal opposition came from Iran’s Green Movement leaders, who had worked against his election and feared he would give away too much.

Today there is growing talk in South Korea that the United States should return its tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn in 1991, or that Seoul should develop its own nuclear deterrent.

Even Japan has some legislators talking about dispensing with their longtime principles that bar the possession, manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s new prime minister, has said that the country’s constitution does not preclude the acquisition of nuclear weapons for tactical defense.

Perhaps it’s time for the United States to at least discuss this possible new reality: No nation, not even the powerful United States, can threaten strong enough economic sanctions or military action against any country whose leaders and public want to build nuclear weapons.

Take the view of Stanford professor Sigfried Hecker, a director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, who has visited North Korea seven times. He was the person who announced in November 2010 that the Kim Jong Il regime had built a state-of-the-art uranium enrichment facility.

On Tuesday, Hecker said in an interview posted on Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation Web site that North Korea “has a bomb but not yet much of an arsenal.” He said Pyongyang “lacks fissile materials, plutonium or highly enriched uranium to fuel its bombs” and it is for that reason it is threatening to restart its old plutonium reactor and increase the capacity of its uranium enrichment facility.

Given that circumstance, the United States should focus on trying to dissuade the North Koreans from producing more fissile material, rather than trying to get them to totally give up nuclear weapons.

The United States should work toward Pyongyang having “no more bombs, no better bombs and no export,” Hecker said.

“Why would the regime want to launch a nuclear attack when it fully knows that any use of nuclear weapons would result in a devastating military response and would spell the end of the regime?”

That’s deterrence, which worked during the Cold War and I believe will continue to work no matter who has a nuclear weapon, North Korea, Iran, or any other country.

Nations ultimately will have to see this is the only rational way to proceed.

Story highlights NEW: Egypt is bracing for mass rival rallies on Friday A coup determination would force the administration to cut military aid to vital Mideast ally Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was ousted July 3 by the military after mass protests Obama administration has delayed delivery of fighter jets to Egypt

(CNN) —

The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN’s Jill Dougherty on Thursday.

A coup determination would force the United States to end military aid to Egypt.

“The law does not require us to make a formal determination as to whether a coup took place and it is not in our national interest to make such a determination,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

The administration sees continuing aid to Egypt – more than $1 billion annually – to be “consistent with our law” and necessary to further U.S. national security interests, the source said.

The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy’s supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military.

Morsy, Egypt’s first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution.

Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and thousands injured since Morsy’s ouster, some of them in confrontations with authorities and others in clashes with those on the other side of the political spectrum.

Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of Egypt’s military, has called for mass demonstrations Friday to support the country’s armed forces. He is calling the protests a “mandate” for the military after weeks of violence that he has blamed on Morsy’s supporters, primarily the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, issued its own call for protests.

The group has refused to recognize the ouster, saying Morsy is the legitimate president.

Al-Sisi warned that any violence “will be confronted with the resolve and strength” of the military.

“We call upon various political faction to avoid any act of provocation,” he said in statement released Thursday.

There has been growing concern about among world leaders about the increase in violence since Morsy’s ouster.

The country is considered a vital regional ally for the United States, which signaled its displeasure with Morsy’s ouster on Wednesday when the Pentagon said it was delaying the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets.

It’s not clear what conditions would be imposed before the aircraft would be cleared for shipment. The Pentagon said, however, that it was not suspending overall arms sales to Egypt at this time.

The fugitive document-leaker has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. He has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23.

Fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden announced that he is submitting a request for political asylum in Russia, where he has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23. Eventually, the 30-year-old former contractor for the National Security Agency said at a meeting with human rights activists and lawyers, he hopes to gain asylum in Latin America.

Fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden announced that he is submitting a request for political asylum in Russia, where he has been stranded at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport since June 23. Eventually, the 30-year-old former contractor for the National Security Agency said at a meeting with human rights activists and lawyers, he hopes to gain asylum in Latin America.

The fugitive document-leaker Edward Snowden surfaced, even if behind closed doors, at Sheremetyevo International Airport on Friday afternoon, and in announcing to a group of visitors that he plans to seek asylum in Russia, he ensured that a problem neither Moscow nor Washington wants is not about to go away.

Snowden had hoped to go to Latin America, but as that prospect has come to appear more difficult, he is facing the more immediate challenge of getting out of the airport after nearly three weeks there. He told his guests that he sees Russian asylum as a short-term solution, in hopes that he can later make his way to Venezuela, Nicaragua or Bolivia, which have offered him asylum.

Russia has been ambivalent at best about his presence here, as an unwelcome complication in already strained relations with the United States. But by late evening, Russian authorities seemed to be making the best of a difficult situation, as a line of officials sought out the media and voiced their support for asylum.

If asylum is granted, the Obama administration would be forced to decide how to react without ruining relations with Moscow entirely.

Snowden told his guests, they reported afterward, that he likes Sheremetyevo Airport well enough but that he can’t stay cooped up forever. Russian officials said it may take them two or three more weeks to decide.

The Interfax news agency quoted Russian migration service head Konstantin Romodanovsky as saying no asylum request had been received as of Saturday.

Snowden has been out of public sight since he arrived here from Hong Kong on June 23, a step ahead of American efforts to have him sent back to the United States for revealing classified information about data collection programs run by the National Security Agency.

But Thursday night he sent e-mail invitations to a group of defense lawyers, pro-Kremlin politicians and human rights advocates to meet him the next day at the airport. There he read a statement critical of the United States and told them of his hopes for Russian asylum.

And in a comment that seemed to raise more questions than answers, he repeated claims that as an NSA contractor, he “had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize and read your communications. Anyone’s communications at any time.”

The White House said in a statement Friday that President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone about Snowden’s status and “a range of security and bilateral issues.”

Until now, Russia has been eager not to prolong Snowden’s stay, though it has been unwilling to return him to the United States. Moscow’s relations with Washington are complicated enough, politicians here have said, without a professed whistleblower and fugitive from prosecution standing between them.

“I do not want a human fate to hinge on the relations between two countries,” said Vladimir Lukin, Russia’s human rights commissioner and a participant in the meeting, “but at the same time it would be undesirable if relations between two countries hinged on one man’s will.”

The Kremlin insisted again that if he is to stay, Snowden must agree “to fully stop activities causing damage to our American partners and Russian-American relations,” in the words of Dmitri Peskov, Putin’s spokesman.

Snowden told his visitors that he has no problem meeting that condition, said Tatyana Lokshina of Human Rights Watch, because he believes he has not caused any harm to the United States with his revelations.

It’s not clear the Kremlin would be in line with those semantics. “As far as we know, he has considered and continues to consider himself a human rights champion and a defender of the rule of law and democracy and that he did not plan to abandon these activities,” Peskov said at a briefing.

“He is a patriot of his country,” said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a member of parliament from the ruling United Russia party and the grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov, who was the Soviet foreign minister under Joseph Stalin.

Nikonov said he thinks Snowden will have to remain at the airport while his request — which has yet to be filed — is considered. The meeting Friday was repeatedly interrupted by flight announcements, he said, and Snowden joked, “I’m used to that by now.”

‘Not a whistleblower’

Lokshina reported that Snowden feels safe at the airport, but it has become clear he “couldn’t stay indefinitely.” On her way to the meeting, she got a phone call from a U.S. diplomat who, she said, asked her to relay to Snowden that the United States does not consider him a whistleblower — a category that has a fairly precise legal definition.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki denied that human rights representatives had been asked to convey a message to Snowden. “At no point did . . . any official from the U.S. government ask anyone to convey a message to Mr. Snowden,” she said.

The State Department expressed “disappointment” that Russia allowed human rights activists into the airport transit zone “despite the government’s declaration of Russia’s neutrality.”

“Our concern here is that he’s been provided with this opportunity to speak in a propaganda platform . . . that Russia has played a role in facilitating this, that others have helped elevate it,” Psaki said.

Snowden, she said, is “not a whistleblower. He’s not a human rights activist. He’s wanted on a series of serious criminal charges brought in the Eastern District of Virginia in the United States.”

In the statement he read from at the meeting, Snowden attacked the “historically disproportionate aggression” of the United States in trying to prevent his access to asylum in Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua, according to a transcript provided by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that is helping him.

“I believe,” he said, after talking about his revelations, “in the principle declared at Nuremberg in 1945: ‘Individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience. Therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring.’ ”

Snowden said he was formally accepting “all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future.” He cited, for example, Venezuela’s offer of asylum, but he said that “some governments” in Western Europe and North America were interfering with his “right to enjoy that asylum,” making it impossible for him to travel.

Several Latin American leaders have accused the United States of pressuring European countries to keep Snowden from reaching the region, including an incident in which Bolivian President Evo Morales’s plane was apparently prevented from crossing the airspace of some European nations on suspicion that Snowden was hiding aboard.

The scene at the airport

Snowden’s visitors gathered at 4:30 p.m. in the arrivals hall of the airport’s Terminal F, a dingy, aging relic of the Soviet era. They were mobbed by television camera crews, starved of a glimpse of Snowden for the past 19 days. Then airport officials led them on a long march past tourists just in from Thailand, right by a restaurant called Franklin’s Roll & Burger displaying a large American flag, up one escalator and down another, until they reached the gleaming Terminal E.

Down to the ground floor, into a back area nearly empty except for a woman placidly embroidering, then along a long blank pale green wall, to a door marked “Staff Only.” The airport had set up a meeting room that allowed the visitors not to cross passport control, from their side, or Snowden from his. A hot, jostling mob of journalists waited while the meeting took place. Then they pounced when the visitors re-emerged.

The country is expected to go to the polls in early May, on a date yet to be decided by President Asif Ali Zardari. More than 85 million registered voters, less than half of the 180 million population, are eligible to vote to elect a new parliament - the first time in the country's history transitioning from one democratically elected government to another since it gained independence from British Raj in 1947.

“Direction set by the present parliament will go a long way in the legislative history of the country,"" Yasmeen Rashid, member of the ruling Pakistan People’s Party, told Fox News.

""The parliament promoted the democratic process and the coming governments will get guidelines from this system.""

The nuclear-armed nation has had three eras of military rule derailing democracy, which damaged the country’s ability to politically handle domestic issues and diplomatically address international community concerns.

""The [military] dictators in the past badly deteriorated the economic and social skeleton of the country and the people were expecting much more from the democratic parliament,"" Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan, leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-N said.

The people of Pakistan had high expectations from the democrat government after General Pervaiz Musharraf, former president of the country, who came to power through a bloodless military coup in 1999, resigned in 2008. But all they received was higher taxes, power cuts, shortage of gas, price hike, and no hope of a relief package for the common man.

Khan told Fox News that the parliament, treasury and opposition has failed to meet the expectations of the masses, but expressed hope the public would continue to contribute strengthening the democratic system in the next elections.

Pakistan continues to battle militancy, the majority of it home-grown terrorism, which has left thousands of civilians and soldiers dead. Sectarian violence targeting the minority Shi’ite Muslim community, a chronic energy crisis, a poverty rate over 40 percent, lack of jobs, a crippled economy and rising corruption are just some of many challenges it faces.

Failures of the government overshadow much of its achievements, says Ahmed Bilal, of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency. Though the outgoing regime is marred by poor governance and rampant corruption, it leaves behind “political and electoral reforms making the prime minister and the parliament stronger, giving autonomy to provinces and by giving [a right to] say to opposition parties in the formation of the Election Commission”, he says.

Zardari’s ruling PPP and its coalition partners passed at least 138 legislations and 81 resolutions including more representation and rights to women through parliament.

The government did mend its difficult relations with India, opening trade between countries, increasing cooperation and intelligence-sharing with Afghanistan, and in good faith released several Taliban prisoners from Pakistan prisons. It also revived the defunct Gwadar Port by handing it to China, and even risked U.S. sanctions by signing a deal with Iran to build a gas pipeline and oil refinery to overcome the country’s power crisis.

Pakistan has a very vital and complicated relations with the U.S., and the next elected government may be comprised of politicians who have towed an anti-U.S. line to gain support.

All provincial assemblies are expected to be dissolved by March 19, and a caretaker government headed by a new prime minister acceptable to all major political stakeholders will take charge in coming days if a consensus is reached."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-myanmar-media-20130317,0,455405.story",2013-03-16 07:00:00,[],Media in Myanmar worry that freedom is already slipping away,"YANGON, Myanmar — When Mizzima moved its headquarters to Yangon last year from India, media watchers saw it as a sign that political reform in Myanmar was real.

For more than a decade, the media group has published hard-hitting coverage of military corruption and Myanmar’s dismal human rights record, and many saw its arrival as a bellwether of the regime’s tolerance.

Recent days, however, have brought growing industry concern about backsliding after the government sent a draft press law to the parliament March 4: It bears an unsettling resemblance to the draconian 1962 media law still in effect, which has long been used to jail, torture and harass journalists.

“If they go with this law, there will be big noises and confrontation again with the press,” Sein Win, Mizzima’s chief editor, said in a sparse office on the fourth floor of a high-rise apartment that has seen better days. “We don’t want to go back to that again.”

Media organizations here say the measure’s vague wording — submitted without consulting media industry leaders — opens journalists to abuse, as do provisions that include a six-month jail sentence for license violations and a ban on criticizing the military-drafted constitution.

In late January, the government also quietly established a committee staffed with members of the military and the Information and Home Affairs ministries to oversee journalists.

“That’s two strikes against them,” said Shawn Crispin, the Bangkok, Thailand-based Asia representative of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group. “Seemingly, authorities have gotten cold feet on what it would mean to have a free and open press.”

Another media group, Reporters Without Borders, ranked Myanmar 151 out of 179 countries in its 2013 Press Freedom Index.

Political analysts say the nominally civilian government elected in 2011, which is still controlled by the military, is afraid of losing control. After a honeymoon period of glowing coverage of its release of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, more open policies and freed political prisoners, the government is facing increasingly negative reports about ethnic conflict, corruption and land grabs.

And although President Thein Sein recently held the first government news conference in decades and newly elected Information Minister Aung Kyi appears relatively open-minded, critics say officials are finding it difficult to alter their mind-set after decades of absolute power and censorship.

“The Ministry of Information understands it has to change its image,” said Ye Naing Moe, director of the Yangon Journalism School, who has conducted media training courses for officials in the capital, Naypyidaw. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not still running the show.”

Perhaps most striking in these courses, he said, is a near-complete lack of basic news understanding among officials overseeing the media.

Advertisement

“I had to start with ‘What is news?’” he said. “For them, news means a sheet from bureaucrats you’re told to publish.”

One trainee asked Ye Naing Moe what would happen to society if independent news media were allowed. The official registered near-disbelief at his response: You’d be able to read seven newspaper versions, not just one.

“It’s a bit like Chicken Little thinking the sky is falling in,” Ye Naing Moe said. “I tried to encourage them to come out of their cave.”

Another challenge for the government is transforming its long-standing state-run mouthpieces into “public service” media that people want to read or watch.

A trainer who recently worked at the government’s MRTV network said passivity among the technologically challenged staff members was deep-seated after decades of being told what to do. “They still write scripts out by hand!” he said.

At the New Light of Myanmar newspaper — once nicknamed the New Lies of Myanmar — the government has introduced advertising and color production and has tried to shake up coverage, which traditionally has featured articles such as “Lost air conditioner found in paddy field” and “Religious Affairs minister deals with religious matters.”

Advertisement

But some are skeptical. “Forget about the central government, they don’t even dare touch local issues,” said editor Sein Win. “How can they ever be ‘public service’?”

It isn’t just the government that’s finding its feet, however. Companies are also grappling with rapid change after decades of a sheltered existence. This month, the state has approved eight “temporary” licenses for private daily newspapers, something that’s been banned for decades.

Advertisement

That sparked a rapid expansion in an industry with little experience, critics say.

“We need more than freedom, we need professionalism,” said Ma Thida, executive editor of the Myanmar Independent News Journal, a private weekly. “Many editors don’t know how to edit, and no one cares about language. There are so many mistakes.”

Advertisement

Industry structure is also a concern. About 70% of the country’s print media is based in Yangon, much of it controlled by ex-military officials or their relatives, leaving little coverage in rural areas, where most Burmese live.

“Most journals are owned by tycoons and cronies, so I don’t have much faith in them,” said Ko Aung Soe, a farmer in Kankone, outside Mandalay. “I believe in true media, but there’s none around.”

Advertisement

At the offices of the recently opened House of Media & Entertainment multimedia group, founders U Zaw Thet Htwe and comedian Maung Thura “Zarganar,” both former political prisoners, say overt intimidation is being replaced by overly vague guidelines that can be used as authorities see fit. Guidelines issued in August warned against articles with “destructive views of state policy,” those “detrimental to international friendship” or any that might “frighten the public.”

There’s also widespread concern that the government could use defamation lawsuits — the mining ministry filed one last year before withdrawing it — in lieu of censorship, taking a cue from Singapore.

Advertisement

Zarganar and other editors said the industry was walking a fine line: It wants to be aggressive but worries that pushing too hard could return hard-liners to power before reforms are institutionalized.

“This is an opportune moment,” said Thiha Saw, editor of the weekly newspaper Open News. “But our concern: All these guys are former military generals. Is it real or is it just to attract international investment? We’re going to push reforms as far away from the old 1962 law as possible, so it’s hopefully beyond the point of no return.”

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/12/11/mandela-memorial-interpreter-deemed-fake/,2013-12-11 00:00:00,[],Sign language interpreter who stood next to Obama at Mandela memorial called a 'fake',"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

A man who stood close to President Barack Obama and other heads of state while providing sign language interpretation at Nelson Mandela’s memorial Tuesday was a “fake” who was making up his own gestures, sign language experts say, raising questions about the security at the event.

""[He] was moving his hands around, but there was no meaning in what he used his hands for,"" Bruno Druchen, the Deaf Federation of South Africa’s national director, told The Associated Press Wednesday.

The country’s deaf community and the ruling African National Congress have no knowledge of who the man actually is, despite him appearing on television gesticulating alongside South African President Jacob Zuma last year, Reuters reported. Zuma’s office is trying to figure out the man's identity.

""I don't know this guy. He doesn't work for the ANC. It was a government event. Ask them,"" ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu said.

U.S. Secret Service Spokesman Brian Leary told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the department is aware of the matter, but declined to elaborate.

More On This...

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that he wasn't aware of any security concerns with the man being near Obama.

""I think my only reaction to that is that it's a shame that you had a service that was dedicated to honoring the life and celebrating the legacy of one of the great leaders of the 20th century, [and it] has gotten distracted by this and a few other issues that are far less important than the legacy of Nelson Mandela,"" he said.

Druchen and three other sign language experts said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages and could not have been signing in any other known sign language because there was no structure to his arm and hand movements. South African sign language covers all of the country's 11 official languages, according to the federation.

""He didn't follow any of the grammatical rules and structure of the language. He just invented his signs as he went along,"" Delphin Hlungwane, an official South African sign language interpreter at DeafSA, told Reuters.

""There was zero percent accuracy. He couldn't even get the basics right. He couldn't even say thank you,"" she added.

Ingrid Parkin, principal of the St. Vincent School for the Deaf in Johannesburg, said she's received complaints from the deaf community from Canada to China about the man on stage and that his movements look ""like he's signing gibberish."" He also used no facial expression to convey the emotions of the leaders, a key element of sign language interpretation.

""This man himself knows he cannot sign and he had the guts to stand on an international stage and do that,"" Parkin said.

The scandal over the interpreter is another indication of shoddy organization of the historic memorial service, which took place Tuesday at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. Other difficulties included public transportation breakdowns which hindered mourners from getting to the event and a faulty audio system that prevented many of the tens of thousands in the stadium from hearing the leaders' speeches. In an apparent security failure, police did not search the first wave of crowds arriving at the stadium.

When the man appeared last year with Zuma, a deaf person in the audience videotaped the event and gave it to the federation for the deaf, which analyzed the video, prepared a report about it and a submitted a formal complaint to the ANC, Druchen said.

In their complaint, the federation suggested that the man should take the five years of training needed to become a qualified sign language interpreter in South Africa.

Druchen said a fresh complaint will be filed to the ANC about the interpreter he called a ""fake"" with a demand for an urgent meeting.

""It was horrible, an absolute circus, really, really bad,"" Nicole Du Toit, an official sign language interpreter who also watched the broadcast, told The Associated Press.

Bogus sign language interpreters are a problem in South Africa, because people who know a few signs try to pass themselves off as interpreters, Parkin said. And those hiring them usually don't sign, so they have no idea that the people they are hiring cannot do the job, she said.

""They advertise themselves as interpreters because they know 10 signs and they can make some quick money,"" said Parkin. ""It is plain and simple abuse of the deaf community, they are taking advantage of the deaf community to make money.""

He watched a Marine lay a wreath in honor of victims of a 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in this city on the Indian Ocean. He made no remarks.

And with that, one of his last appearances on his weeklong tour of Africa, Obama ended his trip much as it began — quietly.

Obama’s first tour of the continent as the first African American president was less a whirlwind swing marked by places of personal meaning and displays of political energy than a carefully planned trek to stops familiar to other U.S. presidents. Obama’s trip included remembrances of great leaders and reflections on history, but was largely absent the typical cultural scenes: no safaris, no dancing, no posing with tribesmen.

That subdued tenor was to some extent because of a twist of timing. Obama’s trip came as Nelson Mandela lay gravely ill in a Pretoria hospital and much of South Africa was consumed by news of the beloved elder statesman’s condition and ugly disputes between Mandela family members.

The president’s sojourn in South Africa became a two-day tribute to a man he calls a personal hero, culminating in a visit to Mandela’s former jail cell and a speech calling on Africans to keep pushing for social change.

But the aura of earnestness was also a nod to the reality of tight economic times. With the U.S. economy still in a slump, the White House was mindful of the appearance of staging trips that look like vacations. As officials finalized Obama’s plan, the Washington Post reported that the trip could cost $60 million to $100 million, a reflection of the massive security operation that envelops the president in the post-Sept. 11 era. The report put the White House on high alert for images that might be seen as frivolous globe-trotting.

Obama’s three-country itinerary was striking compared with some other presidential tours. In 1998, President Clinton visited six countries in 12 days, which included a day-and-a-half safari in Botswana. That trip cost $42.8 million, not including the Secret Service’s expenses, which are classified, according to a government report to Congress.

The first U.S. president to visit South Africa, Clinton was accompanied by a delegation of prominent African Americans and addressed the country’s Parliament and Mandela, who was then president.

President George W. Bush went twice to Africa. In 2003, he drew smaller crowds than those that had flocked to see Clinton. But his commitment to fight AIDS in Africa helped make him popular. When he returned in 2008, Bush declared that Liberia felt like “home” and in Monrovia broke into a jubilant dance with traditional dancers.

Obama, in one of his few moments working a crowd, briefly grooved with a drum circle in Senegal. The president beamed and began to sway a bit — but stopped short of dancing.

The president, who visited Ghana for a day in 2009, traveled with First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, and niece Leslie Robinson. They moved at a stately pace through Africa, opting not to fly at night. The seven-day trip included almost three full travel days.

There would be no safari, only an announcement of aid to stop rhinoceros poaching. The closest Obama got to seeing rural Africa was a chat with two farmers who were brought to the lawn of the president’s luxury hotel in Dakar, Senegal, to explain agricultural improvement programs. “And I know that millet and maize and fertilizer doesn’t always make for sexy copy,” he said, asking reporters to give the event some coverage.

The president’s visit included only flashes of Obama’s ties to the continent. As he arrived in Tanzania on Monday, he noted, “Obviously, my family on my father’s side is from East Africa. They spent some time actually in Tanzania.” But he did not explain further. His father was born and is buried in Kenya. His step-grandmother still lives there.

In one strange this-is-your-life moment, Senegal’s President Macky Sall toasted Obama at an official dinner by introducing a man who Sall claimed was a minor, and unnamed, character in Obama’s 1995 memoir “Dreams From My Father.” Although Obama enthusiastically shook the man’s hand, it wasn’t clear that the president remembered him.

More recent figures in Obama’s biography featured more prominently in the trip. As he toured Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, Obama often found himself and his policies compared to his predecessor. Then, on Tuesday, Bush was at Obama’s side, for the memorial of the embassy bombing.

The Republican former president was visiting East Africa for a meeting of first ladies hosted by his wife, Laura Bush. The event is part of the AIDS-relief and development work the couple began in the White House and has continued since. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, started by Bush, is often hailed as model for grand-scale development work and presidential legacy-making.

As he announced his own smaller initiatives, Obama was mindful that his efforts could not match Bush’s financial investment given the budget battles he faces with the Republican-controlled House.

Still, Obama aimed to leave his own imprint. He touted his $7-billion plan to upgrade power infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly two-thirds of the population has no access to electricity. Obama visited the Ubungo Power Plant, a once-shuttered facility that was reopened with help from private investors and the Millennium Challenge Corp., another Bush-era program.

Obama’s Power Africa program aims to expand such efforts. He said the U.S. would also support smaller projects, such as distribution of the “Soccket” ball, a soccer ball that stores kinetic energy and can power a reading light. “You can imagine this in villages all across the continent,” he said.

(CNN) - The host of a fundraiser and major donor to the Democratic Party complimented President Barack Obama for his hospitality back in Washington but joked about the lack of valet parking at the White House, offering to pay for the addition.

Billionaire Haim Saban, and his wife Cheryl, hosted the President and a group of Hollywood and political elites at their estate in Beverly Hills Monday night for a fundraiser for Democratic House and Senate campaign committees.



""Last Friday, the President and First Lady were very generous and kind with their time, they invited us to the White House for a very small intimate dinner. And we had a wonderful time – great food, great company, very inspiring,"" Saban said while introducing the President, according to reporters who attended the event.

But Haim added: ""No valet parking!""

""You know what? I had to walk to the White House. We have valet parking at the Sabans! So, Mr. President, if you would, please, thank you. Taxpayers' money? I'll fund it, no problem,"" he joked.

The President then took the stage, responding that there was valet parking... just not for him.

""Now, let me clarify something. First of all, there was valet parking for Cheryl,"" he said to laughs.

""We thought it was appropriate for Haim to get some exercise. Cheryl, being the wonderful person that she is, declined the valet parking and so she might have joined him. But I would have been happy to have her drive right up into the South Lawn.""

The Israeli-American media mogul first hit it big in the 1990s, creating and producing the children's show the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Saban owns the Spanish-language media company Univision. In September, Saban's net worth amounted to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes.

The President's stop at the Beverly Hills fundraiser comes as a part of a three-day West Coast swing.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also spoke at the event, along with DCCC Chairman Steve Israel and DSCC Chairman Michael Bennet, according to a DCCC official. Over one hundred people attended the dinner, paying between $16,200 and $32,400."

Russia, for example, has insisted that Iran should participate. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy on Syria, has also urged that Iran take part.

The United States and its allies have opposed including Iran, which has sent members of its paramilitary Quds Force to help the Assad government and has been supplying arms as well.

American officials have not publicly been as forward leaning as Mr. Fabius on Iran’s inclusion in talks, which would be aimed at creating a transitional government with full authority. They appear to be waiting to see what happens at a Thursday session at which Iran’s new foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, will meet counterparts from the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany on Iran’s nuclear program.

A meeting between Mr. Zarif and the Security Council members, which would include Secretary of State John Kerry, would be one of the highest-level face-to-face contacts between Iran and the United States in more than three decades of estrangement. It would also be the first meeting of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif in their current roles.

Mr. Zarif is an American-educated diplomat appointed by the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. Both have sought to distinguish themselves from the hard-line approach of the last president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They have been outspoken in asserting that Iran is ready to advance the negotiations on the nuclear dispute, which has drawn heavy Western sanctions and left the country increasingly isolated economically.

Iran has asserted that its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful purposes, denying assertions from the West and Israel that it is developing the capability to make nuclear weapons. The Israeli government, which particularly mistrusts Iran’s nuclear intentions, has dismissed the new Iranian diplomatic effort as a public relations maneuver.

Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, met with the Iranian foreign minister on Monday and described her discussions with him as constructive. Ms. Ashton said Mr. Zarif, whom she had never met face to face before Monday, had “talked about a number of issues but focused on the nuclear issue.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The opposing events led the group to focus on a question asked on Friday by many in Syria’s beleaguered opposition: Would the promised aid come in time, or would be it be too little, too late?

An older rebel who leads a few dozen fighters on one of the front lines in Aleppo was skeptical. “I’ll believe that America is helping us when I see American arms in my group’s hands, not statements and food baskets,” said the 40-year-old fighter, who calls himself Abu Zaki. “We will accept all support even from Satan to finish the Assad regime, then we will not forget those who stand and support us and who stand and support the regime.”

At the same time, he said, he did not understand American fears that arms would go to Al Nusra Front, a rebel group linked to Al Qaeda, since it had never attacked Western targets."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/28/1182698/-Remember-when-Paul-Ryan-blamed-the-attack-in-Benghazi-on-the-sequester,2013-01-28 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']",Remember when Paul Ryan blamed the attack in Benghazi on the sequester?,"It turns out that Ryan's position gets even more knotty, because it's not just the he now supports something that he said in 2012 would undermine America, it's also that he actually supported the legislation that originally created the cuts that he he subsequently opposed and now supports again. Take another trip down memory lane to re-experience Ryan trying to B.S. his way out of that:



NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS News): Congressman, these defense cuts are part of the Budget Control Act. You voted for the Budget Control Act. In fact I went and looked, you put on the a statement at the time it was passed and you called it a victory, and you called it a positive step forward. So, you voted for defense cuts. And now you're criticizing the president for those same defense cuts that you voted for and called a victory. RYAN: No, no, I have to correct you on this, Norah. I voted for a mechanism that says a sequester will occur if we don't cut $1.2 trillion spending in government.

No, Norah. You're wrong. I didn't vote for it. Instead, I voted for it. So don't say I didn't vote for it, because I did vote for it. Er, I mean, don't say I did vote for it. Because I don't support it now. But I did vote for it. And I reserve the right to say whatever the fuck I please at any point in the future. Okay?



O'DONNELL: Congressman, it's my understanding that as part of the Budget Control Act there was not just the sequestration, the defense sequestration, but there is also $1 trillion in immediate spending cuts, which included the defense cuts, almost $400 billion that were proposed by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr. Dempsey, as well as Secretary Panetta. And you also voted for those. And now you're saying that you didn't vote for them? RYAN: We can get into this nomenclature. I voted for the Budget Control Act but the Obama administration proposed $470 billion in defense cuts. We don't agree with that. Our budget rejected that. And then on top of that is another $500 billion in defense cuts. O'DONNELL: Right, it's a trillion in defense spending. And you voted for it. RYAN: No, Norah, I voted for the Budget Control Act. O'DONNELL: That included defense spending. RYAN: Norah, you're mistaken.

Yeah, Norah. Get your facts straight. Congressman Paul Ryan only voted for whatever he voted for that serves his particular needs at this very moment. Don't go getting technical and stuff about what he did or didn't vote for and what it did or didn't do. That's irrelevant. What matters is Paul Ryan has killer dimples and tremendous abs. And he will get wonky with anybody. Literally, anybody. Anytime, anywhere. Wonk off on demand.

Meanwhile, speaking of wonking off, let's be fair to Paul Ryan. Because even though he spent the 2012 campaign demagoguing on defense spending, the one good thing about his 2011 budget proposal was that he didn't propose spending a single dime more on defense than President Obama.

That's from page S-4 of Ryan's 2011 budget plan. Notice all those zeroes? That's the difference between President Obama's budget proposal and Paul Ryan's proposal: nothing. So in more ways than one, by flip-flopping on his 2012 position on defense cuts, Ryan is going back to where he started in 2011.

Personally, I think this obsession with the deficit is misguided, but given the existence of the obsession, there are worse things Paul Ryan has done than embracing the sequester's spending cuts. But as long as that's what he's doing, he should have the courage to admit it, unless all this stuff about wonkiness is just a smokescreen to disguise the fact that he is, at core, just a typical political hack."

(CNN) - Did you miss the president's interview on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno""?

Here are five things you need to know about the interview, which marked his sixth sit-down with Leno.



1. Obama: Embassy closings aren't an overreaction

The decision to close a broad swath of American embassies and diplomatic posts across the Middle East in response to a terror threat was not an overreaction, Obama said.

The U.S. security posture throughout the Middle East, and especially in Yemen, was heightened after officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to a top ally in Yemen telling him to ""do something."" A worldwide travel alert was issued, along with the slate of embassy and consulate closings.

The latest threat, Obama said, was a reminder that violent extremism still exists in the world. He stressed the importance of using caution and common sense while traveling abroad.

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,"" Obama said.

2. Obama will attend G-20 summit in Russia

The White House announced Wednesday the president won't sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, but Obama confirmed in Tuesday night's interview that he'll still attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg.

Multiple lawmakers–Republicans and Democrats alike–called on the president to skip the meeting with Putin after Russia granted temporary asylum to the former government contractor Edward Snowden.

Asked Tuesday about Snowden, who admitted to leaking details of U.S. classified surveillance programs, Obama said he was disappointed with Russia's decision.

""Traditionally we have tried to respect if there's a lawbreaker or alleged lawbreaker in their country,"" he said. ""We evaluate it, and we try to work with them. They didn't do that with us. And in some ways it's reflective of some underlying challenges that we have had with Russia lately.""

Russia's leaders, he said, have a proclivity for slipping into a Cold War mindset; though he added essential cooperation between the two nations continues.

But will Obama call him a whistle blower?

""We don't know yet exactly what he did, other than what he said on the internet,"" the president said. ""And it's important for me not to prejudge something. Hopefully at some point he'll go to trial and he will have a lawyer and due process and we can make those decisions.""

3. Do Obama and McCain have a 'bromance'?

The president offered a laughing assessment of Sen. John McCain. The budding ""bromance"" between Obama and McCain – manifested Tuesday in the Republican senator's trip to Egypt at Obama's request – is akin to a romantic comedy, the president said.

""Initially, you're not getting along and then you keep bumping into each other,"" he joked.

In his opening monologue, Leno joked that McCain had been working with Egyptian leaders since ""the King Tut administration.""

But that 'bromance' may have been short-lived. After the White House announced Obama was nixing the meeting with Putin, McCain zinged the president on Twitter.

Remember: Tell Vladimir ""after my election I have more flexibility"" AP: ""Obama Cancels Meetings With Putin"" http://t.co/TVM18HFpR8 #Russia — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) August 7, 2013

His tweet referenced a moment when Obama was heard last year requesting Putin for space on the issue of a planned U.S.-led NATO missle defense system in Europe.

""This is my last election,"" Obama told then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. ""After my election I have more flexibility.""

""I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir,"" Medvedev said. Putin was the incoming president at the time.

4. Hillary Clinton not measuring the White House drapes

Saying Hillary Clinton was enjoying a ""post-administration glow"" at their White House lunch last week, Obama said she doesn't need to scope out the Oval Office ahead of an anticipated 2016 presidential bid. When Leno joked the former first lady may be measuring the drapes, Obama pointed out she has plenty of experience in the executive mansion.

""Keep in mind she's been there. She doesn't have to measure them,"" he said.

5. Obama has 'no patience' for anti-LGBT laws in Russia

Responding to a question about recent legislation in Russia that cracks down on gay rights, the president said he has ""no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them.""

""Do you think it will affect the Olympics?"" Leno asked the president, whose own views on the subject have evolved in the course of his presidency. Russia is slated to host the Winter Olympics in 2014, in the city of Sochi.

Obama was adamant. ""Every judgment should be made on the track, or in the swimming pool, or on the balance beam, and people's sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to do with it.""

This was the first time Obama had commented on Russia's new anti-LGBT laws, which have come under increasing scrutiny as questions mount about the country's intentions during the Olympic Games.

But the president was careful to avoid singling out Russia, pointing out that many leaders he meets with support similar legislation in their nations.

""When I traveled to Africa, there were some countries that are doing a lot of good things for their people, who we're working with and helping on development issues, but in some cases have persecuted gays and lesbians. And it makes for some uncomfortable press conferences sometimes."""

Videos show people suffering from muscle spasms%2C foaming from the mouth and with decreased pupil size

Report pinpoints 10 sites of chemical attacks

USA TODAY could not verify the videos independently

ISTANBUL — Groups representing Syrian rebels told USA TODAY on Thursday that they have amassed evidence over months that proves President Bashar Assad is using deadly chemical nerve agents despite President Obama's ""red line"" threat.

Several groups including the Syrian Network for Human Rights say Assad has been using weapons like sarin gas far more frequently than has been reported. Early this week, an intelligence chief for the Israeli Defense Forces said Israel concluded Assad used them last month.

In a report released exclusively to USA TODAY, the network said Syrian human rights observers such as itself have concluded that Assad's forces have used chemical weapons on ""10 separate locations in Syria"" in four provinces over the span of several months starting in December.

""Beginning at Homs, and then in the suburbs of Damascus, and then at two attacks inside Damascus in Jobar neighborhood,"" Damascus-based activist Sami Ibrahim, of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, told USA TODAY.

Ibrahim says his group — a Syrian group of human rights activists that collects victims' accounts of the conflict — can back up its claims of chemical weapons use by Assad. Its report says Assad has been using ""different types"" of chemical weapons, including sarin gas, on at least two separate occasions in suburban Damascus and Aleppo.

""We have videos of those killed, we have photos, we have testimony from the eyewitnesses, from the doctors inside the hospitals; they are speaking inside the video,"" Ibrahim said of his report's findings.

President Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would be a ""game-changer"" in deciding whether the United States would intervene in the 2-year-old civil war. The United Nations estimates that up to 80,000 civilians have been killed by Assad's forces.

Videos contained in the network's report show victims of attacks suffering from muscle spasms, people foaming from the mouth and decreased pupil size. USA TODAY could not verify the videos independently.

The videos also included an alleged chemical weapons attack in Aleppo, activists close to rebel fighters in Turkey say.

""You could see (in video), there was foam coming out of the mouth, the eyes were closed or at least the pupils were so small,"" said Syrian opposition activist Hozan Ibrahim, who is based in Berlin.

Some of the survivors of the attack — in which Ibrahim states two people died — were taken to Turkey. This allowed opposition forces there to verify that chemical weapons were used, Ibrahim added.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights says its findings should be all that is needed to get the West to grant the rebels the military assistance they have been asking for to defeat Assad. The rebels want heavy weapons that will allow them to compete with Assad's artillery, and a Western-military-enforced no-fly zone, such as was used in Libya to oust Moammar Gadhafi.

""We heard hundreds of statements (from the West) against Bashar al-Assad, that he's a criminal and he should leave,"" Ibrahim said. ""But give me the real action against him!""

""We have to expect action, otherwise the other dictatorships will learn from Bashar al-Assad that the international community is unable to do anything for this criminal,"" Ibrahim said.

Analysts say that, having conceded it believes the Syrian government has used chemical weapons, the Obama administration will now be under ""overwhelming"" pressure to take military action.

""It's a matter of time, I would argue, before the administration retaliates against the Assad regime,"" said Fawaz Gerges, the director of the Middle East Center at the London School for Economics. ""If and when the U.S. responds, I think it's going to be a huge response. I don't think it's going to be a tiny limited action."""
