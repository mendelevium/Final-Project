For generations, the West was a Republican stronghold, the land of Goldwater and Reagan and sagebrush rebels. But a change began under President Clinton and was hastened under President Obama, who twice added Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats’ stable of support in the West.

The reason, in short, is Latino voters.

The rise of Latino power, which began in California as a backlash to the heated rhetoric surrounding Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal-immigration initiative, has steadily spread eastward, giving once-red states a distinctly more blue tinge.

There may be no better illustration than California’s next-door neighbor.

Obama won Nevada in 2008 by a whopping 12 percentage points. By all rights, however, Republican Mitt Romney should have been strongly competitive there in 2012. He had an organizational base among the state’s large Mormon population, and Nevada has been an economic basket case for years, with jobless, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates that set a national standard for awfulness.

Obama carried the state, however, winning in November by more than 6 percentage points.

Strong Latino support is one reason. What happened in Nevada reflected the results nationwide: The percentage of Latino voters grew to 18% of the electorate, from 15% in 2008, and Obama won their support by a crushingly large margin.

Immigration has become the Democrats’ wedge issue, drawing small-business-owning and culturally conservative Latinos away from the GOP in the way Republicans long used abortion and other contentious social issues to pry working-class Democrats away from their party moorings.

As an added political benefit to Democrats, the issue of illegal immigration splits the GOP between enforcement-only hard-liners and advocates of a more balanced approach that would mix fortified borders with some path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the United States illegally. To hard-liners, that amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and an unacceptable capitulation to Obama and his fellow Democrats.

The president used last week’s inaugural address to signal that immigration reform, one of the unfulfilled promises of his first term, would no longer be overlooked.

America’s journey “is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity,” he said to strong applause from the hundreds of thousands gathered on the National Mall.

Latinos in Congress who met with Obama on Friday said the president described the issue as his top legislative priority.

Obama’s remarks in Las Vegas are likely to cover proposals he has called for in the past: tougher border security, a crackdown on employers who hire illegal workers and a way for undocumented immigrants to responsibly “earn” their way to U.S. citizenship. More details are expected in the president’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12.

The political message on Tuesday, however, may be more significant than the substance.

The goal for Democrats is to lock in their strong Latino support and the votes of succeeding generations, the way the party has in California, so candidates can devote more time and resources to red states like Arizona and Texas that should, the demographics suggest, grow more competitive in 2016 and beyond.

Obama may have run his last election campaign. But one thing he would like to bequeath to fellow Democrats is a solid electoral college base rooted in the West to offset the advantage Republicans enjoy across the South.

His Las Vegas appearance is a step toward that second-term goal.

Feinstein warns of an ""uphill road"" to get her proposal passed The NRA says it is ""confident"" Congress won't pass Feinstein's measure The proposals come almost six weeks after the Newtown school massacre

Can there be a solution to America’s gun problems? Anderson Cooper looks at both sides of the debate in “Guns Under Fire: an AC360º Town Hall Special” Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.

On one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons – including a Bushmaster similar to the one used in last month’s Newtown school massacre.

Behind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower. One by one, victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.

Almost six weeks after the Connecticut shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders, Feinstein said she planned to introduce her measure later Thursday, with Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado doing the same in the House.

What’s in Feinstein’s gun bill?

Feinstein’s proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

She said the goal is to “dry up the supply of these weapons over time.”

“These massacres don’t seem to stop,” the California Democrat lamented, listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations – Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson and Oak Creek.

“We should be outraged at how easy it is” for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large-capacity magazines used in those slaughters, Feinstein told the event at the U.S. Capitol that she organized.

Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer

Her legislation is opposed by the nation’s powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. That means that despite a push by the White House and Democrats for tougher gun control steps, Feinstein’s full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval.

In a statement on Thursday, the NRA said that Feinstein “has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades.”

“The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein’s wrong-headed approach,” the organization added.

In a sign of the gun lobby’s influence, a nine-day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania next month was postponed Thursday because the NRA withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of “modern sporting rifles” – the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by Feinstein’s proposal.

At her Washington event, Feinstein acknowledged that enacting a ban was “really an uphill road,” adding: “If anyone asks if we can win this, the answer is we don’t know, because it’s really uphill.”

She then made a plea for people to call their senators and House members to declare “enough is enough,” adding that a mobilized public is “stronger than the gun lobby.”

Later Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden made a similar appeal in an online discussion on Google, saying: “Make your voices heard.”

He insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening background checks, presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms.

“It’s not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people,” Biden said. “It’s about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people.”

President Barack Obama called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the December 14 Newtown school massacre and overall gun violence in America.

Marine to senator: ‘No ma’am,’ I won’t register my guns

Feinstein’s measure would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles, as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or less, she said. Not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons.

The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.

“They are by make and model exempted from the legislation,” she said, adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions.

Those exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative Democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the NRA and constituents.

Supporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms, but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts.

They also contend that high-capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the Newtown massacre.

Opponents contend the Second Amendment forbids the government from this type of limit on weapon ownership by citizens.

They worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and, some also argue, against potential future government tyranny or abuse. Instead, the NRA has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students.

Speakers at the event organized by Feinstein rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower.

“How are you going to hunting with something like that?” asked Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left. “You kill something, there’s nothing left to eat.”

With new Congress comes a new push for gun laws

Continuing bloodshed on the nation’s streets – with dozens dying every day from gun violence – should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted, he argued.

“If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don’t know what else will,” Ramsey continued, thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis.

At Feinstein’s request, people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence, including several from the Virginia Tech massacre, then offered their support for her efforts.

Some told of losing a parent or child. Others described how attackers inflicted carnage so quickly.

Pam Simon, a staff member to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a Tucson grocery store.

“On that day, 30 bullets were delivered in less than 30 seconds,” Simon said.

NRA chief: Obama makes ‘mockery’ of American freedoms

Some of the weapons on display Thursday are currently against the law in the District of Columbia, and Democratic sources told CNN that Feinstein coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there.

NBC’s David Gregory was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network’s “Meet the Press” program broadcast from Washington. No charges were brought in that case.

Obama’s proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill.

While the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks, it remains opposed to other steps, saying they won’t prevent criminals from getting weapons.

Instead, gun advocates urge tougher enforcement of existing laws and making criminals serve their full sentences.

Biden led a panel assembled by Obama in December to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden’s recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced this month.

A recent CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don’t believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence.

In announcing his gun control package, Obama also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks.

New York state recently enacted a series of new gun regulations, the nation’s first since the Newtown shootings. Ten other states are reviewing some form of related action.

The issue is among the most politically divisive in the country, as demonstrated by the decision by Reed Exhibitions to postpone the nine-day Eastern Sport and Outdoor Show scheduled to start February 2 in Harrisburg.

On Tuesday, the NRA withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition.

“We had called on Reed Exhibitions to reconsider their decision; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so,” an NRA statement said. “As a result, the NRA will not be participating in the upcoming show in Harrisburg or in any other shows hosted by Reed Exhibitions that maintain this policy.”

In announcing Thursday that the show was off, a Reed Exhibitions official said the intent of excluding “certain products” was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event.

“It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year’s show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment,” said Chet Burchett, the company’s president for the Americas.

“It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing,” he added.

http://www.nbcnews.com/business/more-states-consider-ban-credit-card-surcharges-1C8455523,2013-02-22 13:21:00+00:00,['Herb Weisbaum'],More states consider ban on credit card surcharges,"Charge a fee to use your credit card? It’s legal for merchants to do that, unless barred by state law. Ten states already ban such surcharges – California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas – and more may join the list.

The legislatures in 13 other states are currently considering bills that would prevent these so-called “check out” fees. Lawmakers in Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Tennessee are responding to a rule change that took place late last month. A similar bill will soon be introduced in West Virginia.

Visa and MasterCard agreed to let merchants add a surcharge to credit card transactions as part of the settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by retailers. Until Jan. 27, both Visa and MasterCard had prohibited merchants from charging the customer for the cost of processing that credit card transaction.



The settlement does not affect Visa or MasterCard debit cards. American Express still prohibits a surcharge on any of its cards.

New Jersey Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Secaucus) said he introduced a bill to ban surcharging because it would hit consumers in the pocketbook.

“The amount of the surcharge may seem miniscule on paper, but in the family budget 1.5 to 3 percent could add up to a shorter grocery list or less to spend on gas,” he said in a statement.

In Utah, Sen. Curtis Bramble (R-Provo) is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit surcharges on any type of “financial transaction card” which would include debit cards.

Major retailers are not expected to tack on a credit card surcharge, at least not any time in the immediate future. Wal-Mart, Target, Sears and Home Depot told NBC News they have no plans to add a credit card surcharge. But just the possibility has spurred some lawmakers into action.

“It’s a waste of the legislative process,” said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation. “They could take steps to bring greater competition into the marketplace by prohibiting the price fixing of the hidden swipe fees merchants pay to process credit card transactions.”

Trish Wexler, spokesperson for the Electronic Payments Coalition, whose members include Visa and MasterCard Worldwide, told NBC News it has not taken a position on the issue.

“No one knows how checkout fees will work their way through the system,” Wexler said in an email statement, “but the settlement provides sufficient consumer protections while the process plays out.”

What about disclosures?

The advocacy group Consumer Action has published a booklet on credit card checkout fees. It warns shoppers to be on the lookout for these fees and advises them to express their dissatisfaction.

“Customers shouldn’t stand for it,” said Ruth Susswein Consumer Action’s deputy director of national priorities. “Our advice is to tell them you don’t like the fee and this makes you want to take your business elsewhere.”

The new rules from Visa and MasterCard require retailers who apply a credit card surcharge to post a notice at the store’s entrance. The exact percentage of the surcharge does not need to be disclosed until the point of sale. The customer receipt must list the amount of the surcharge.

Online stores with a surcharge will not be required to have a notice on the home page. They only need to alert shoppers about this when they reach the page where credit cards are first mentioned. In most cases, that means the final step of checkout when the purchase is being completed.

Not the end of this story

The settlement that allows merchants to impose a credit card surcharge is only preliminary. The court has yet to issue its final ruling in this case. That’s expected later this year.

Once that happens, various retailers and business groups plan to challenge the settlement. That could drag into late 2014.

The possibility that the settlement could be modified will probably keep most businesses of any size from instituting credit card fees for the time being.

On top of that, the economy is absorbing costs from delays and disruptions to government services, and from a sharp blow to consumer and business confidence. The report runs through a long list of the disruptions: a backlog in veterans’ disability claims, children left out of Head Start, patients left out of cancer studies, halted consumer-safety work, delays in certain tax refunds.

The report said that the government had not calculated the costs of actually shutting the government down and reopening it. But it described them as significant.

“Disruptions at nuclear cleanup sites associated with the shutdown will cost two to three weeks of productivity,” it said. The shutdown “may cause the Department of Energy to miss cleanup milestones agreed to with the states where cleanup is underway.”

Ultimately, disruptions like the shutdown may discourage workers from taking government jobs, analysts have said.

“The furloughs came on top of an unprecedented three-year pay freeze, increases to retirement contributions and the loss of six days’ wages due to the sequestration-related furloughs this summer,” the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 650,000 government workers, said in a statement.

“Employees are frustrated at being made the sacrificial lamb of deficit reduction, and as a result the federal government is becoming a less attractive employer.”"

Remember how running the printing presses was going to cause runaway inflation? Since the recession began, the Fed has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet, but inflation has averaged less than 2 percent.

pretty much standard liquidationism, with a strong goldbug streak.

Krugman calls Stockman's analysis of our economic history as- I wonder if that is intended at least in part to link Stockman to the craziness of the likes of Glenn Beck, who after all has been a paid mouthpiece for gold interests?

Perhaps not, since Stockman basically asserts that we have been going to Hell in a handbasket since FDR took us off the gold standard, and have been on sprees ever since:

spending sprees, consumption sprees, debt sprees, and above all money-printing sprees. If disaster was somehow avoided for 70-plus years, it was thanks to a series of lucky accidents.

which doesn’t make the nation as a whole any poorer, and doesn’t require that we collectively spend less. In fact, the biggest problem created by all this debt is that it’s keeping the economy depressed by causing us collectively to spend too little, with debtors forced to cut back while creditors see no reason to spend more.

In a sense, all of that tartness is simply preface from Krugman, who then provides an important economic lesson on our rising debt. Yes, it has increased as a portion of GDP. The amount that is foreign has increased, albeit less than most Americans think, but that it mainly America borrowing from AmericansRemember, you do not pay taxes on interest earned from government bonds, and that investment is still considered absolutely safe. Add to that the large amounts of cash being held by corporations because inflation is so low and we we should already see the need for investment to stimulate spending. As Krugman has noted for some time, because interest rates are currently so low, the government should, rather than cutting spending, be increasing it as a stimulus whose return will based on historic trends within a short time return far more in tax revenue than it will cost interest. Such additional spending will also create increases in revenue for state and local governments, as sales and income tax streams increase, the price of real estate begins to return to higher levels, and then those governments can perhaps even rehire some of those employees they have been forced to lay off because they are required to run balanced government. That rehiring adds additional spending which will also increase government revenue through taxation.

Krugman is all for restoring financial controls and oversight to deter excess leverage and prevent the next crisis.

To deal with the crisis that’s already here, we need monetary and fiscal stimulus, to induce those who aren’t too deeply indebted to spend more while the debtors are cutting back.

by turning our problems into a morality play of sin and retribution, it helps condemn us to a deeper and longer slump.

the notion of macroeconomics as morality play has a visceral appeal that’s hard to fight. Disguise it with a bit of political cross-dressing, and even liberals can fall for it.

This of course is ""anathema"" to Mellonites, like Stockman, like the deficit hawks, like Pete Peterson, like unfortunately too many Democrats as well. They think that deficit spending - which in their minds includes any spending on the social safety net that does go through the private sector so that corporations can gain some direct profit - is what has caused our current financial crises, which they measure primarily in the size of deficits and debts, never mind that the deficit increased under a Republican administration in part because of unnecessary tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations and fighting two wars without paying for them. Krugman warns us that their approach of liquidation is destructive, becauseOf course, the messaging from the Mellonites has been working. As Krugman puts it ""sin sells."" That is,This is happening not just on the macroeconomic level of the national economy. We see it in the policies of Democratic mayors like Emanuel in Chicago, who use among other things the financial problems as a justification for slashing away at the basic local government function of public education, and finding ways of turning that function into something that can turn profits for the investor class and corporations, even as it destroys neighborhoods and ignores the needs of those hurting the most.

The real political cross-dressing comes from a Democratic President more committed to a ""grand bargain"" with ""bi-partisan"" support than he seems to be to rebuilding the economy for the long term. What is sad is that he can clearly argue that he was right on stimulus spending. That is, he could clearly argue had he pushed for a more significant stimulus the first time around. Even so, the data supports him - rather than pushing for the grand bargain he should be pushing for more stimulus.

Krugman's column saddened me because of its ending, especially the words visceral appeal that's hard to fight. I do not think it is impossible to fight but the rhetorical battle is already lost when the Democratic President accepts the framing of the argument in a way that cedes control to the Mellonites, whether they are simply hostile to government or merely wrong-headed about how governments and economies actually function.

Still, the column is important enough I wanted to bring to the attention of this community. The link gets you past the firewall and does not count against your quota of Times stories for the month.

Read the whole thing.

It is worth the time.

But then, isn't that always true of Krugman?"

And as I wrote last week, the Congressional Budget Office expects deficit reduction to lop off 1.5 percent of GDP growth in 2013; if those measures were not in place, we would be looking at 3 percent growth for the coming year, the amount we need to achieve a strong recovery."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/debt-limit-republicans_n_4077954.html,2013-10-10 00:00:00,['Senior Congressional Reporter'],"Republicans Offer Short-Term Deal To Raise Debt Limit, Leave Government Shutdown","WASHINGTON -- Republican House leaders Thursday offered the president and Senate far less than they want in the ongoing financial standoff, presenting a six-week hike of the debt limit, but no deal to reopen the shuttered federal government.

President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats have repeatedly argued that they will not negotiate with the GOP on the budget until the government is reopened and the House stops using the $16.7 trillion debt limit as a lever to extract concessions. The limit is expected to be reached Oct. 17, but the House bill would push the debt ceiling back to around Thanksgiving.

""What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and start to deal with America's pressing problems,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters on Capitol Hill.

""I would hope that the president will look at this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway, halfway to what he's demanding in order to have these conversations,"" he continued.

Several lawmakers said the debt bill could move as soon as Friday if Obama agrees to open up talks on other topics.

Yet reaction from the White House was not very positive, although press secretary Jay Carney said that if a clean debt ceiling bill actually reaches the president's desk, Obama would sign it.

Still, Carney reiterated the administration position that the White House doesn't see the debt ceiling being raised or the government being opened as any sort of concession, but as part of Congress' job.

""Our position is clear: they ought to turn on the lights, they ought to pay our bills,"" Carney said. ""The logic here is that they would harm the American economy and the American people in order to try to extract concessions from the president and their counterparts on Capitol Hill. That's an unsustainably bad proposition.""

Similarly, Senate Democrats did not seem impressed by the deal.

""Republicans may let one hostage go, but they are keeping a gun to the head of the other, while reserving the right to kidnap the first one again in a few weeks,"" an aide to Senate leadership told HuffPost on background, because the House's formal legislation has yet to be released.

It remains unclear if the Senate would go along with a short-term bill. Democrats introduced a measure in the upper chamber that would extend the debt limit for more than a year.

Ahead of a Thursday afternoon meeting between two-dozen Republicans and the White House, one Republican agreed that all the proposal does is essentially move the goal posts.

""We haven't changed our position, only the timeline,"" said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). ""There won't be a vote on a temporary extension of the debt limit unless the president agrees this afternoon to sit down and talk with us.""

Yet even GOP reaction to the House plan seemed mixed coming out of the Republicans' closed-door meeting Thursday morning. After leaders presented the plan to members, many echoed Boehner in saying it was a show of good faith to the White House. But hard-line conservatives like Iowa Rep. Steve King said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the deal, and others said they would only back the bill if the president pledges to begin negotiations on broader fiscal issues.

Although a half-dozen lawmakers leaving the meeting said the House's proposed debt-ceiling hike has no riders, The Wall Street Journal reported there was one possible wrinkle that would permanently ban the sorts of ""extraordinary measures"" that Treasury secretaries have long used to keep bills paid during debt limit debates.

The United States actually began brushing up against the debt limit in May, and since then the Treasury has essentially been borrowing from itself and raising pension funds to meet obligations. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that while he thought the House bill was ""clean,"" he was concerned about how it deals with the measures Treasury has already taken. A six-week measure would add about $90 billion to the debt, but undoing all the steps taken going back to May could make the tab more like $300 billion, he said. ""If it says a date certain [six weeks], how do you take into account reimbursement of the federal government and our creditors for the extraordinary measures that the Treasury Department has been using since May?"" he said.

With Carney repeating the position that the president will not negotiate on opening the government, it seemed unlikely that the White House meeting would prove fruitful.

However, if Boehner's offer of a conference committee comes through, negotiations with the White House might not be required. Congress has the ability to work out its differences on its own through such a committee, with members from both chambers sitting down to craft a spending plan, as they have so far failed to do.

This is a developing story and has been updated."

On Jan. 1, an estimated 1,600 hotel and transportation workers in SeaTac, Wash., will see their pay jump to $15 an hour, a 60 percent increase from the state's $9.32 minimum wage.

While many workers look forward to the higher pay, employers are looking for ways to absorb the big increase in labor costs. Some plan on eliminating jobs.

""We're going to be looking at making some serious cuts,"" said Cedarbrook Lodge General Manager Scott Ostrander. ""We're going to be looking at reducing employee hours, reducing benefits and eliminating some positions.""

That's in the short term. Eventually, those jobs and more are expected to return as the Cedarbrook Lodge looks to build an addition to the hotel. The plan is to increase revenue to offset the higher labor costs.

But not every employer is being so ambitious. One has told a trade group it is going to close one of its two restaurants, eliminating 200 jobs.

The plan has also caused Han Kim -- who runs Hotel Concepts, a company that owns and manages 11 hotels in Washington state -- to shelve plans to build a hotel in SeaTac. The company already has three hotels in SeaTac, and Kim and a business partner were looking to build a fourth on land they own.

""Uncertainty is bad for business, and right now we're right in that area so we're just putting everything on hold,"" Kim said.

Opponents of the $15 minimum wage did score a legal victory late last week when a King County, Wash., judge ruled that it does not apply to any of the workers at the SeaTac airport. Superior Court Judge Andrea Darvas ruled only the Port of Seattle can set wage and other work rules at the airport. That eliminates 4,700 workers from the successful ballot initiative.

Backers of the $15 minimum wage vow to appeal the ruling up the state Supreme Court. One of the biggest supporters is Kshama Sawant, a socialist who also won her election to the Seattle City Council. She plans on making Seattle the next city to have a $15 minimum wage.

""There may be a few jobs lost here and there, but the fact is, if we don't fight for this, then the race to the bottom will continue,"" Sawant said.

Sawant is skeptical that the higher minimum wage will lead to mass layoffs. But the American Car Rental Association estimates 5 percent of low-wage jobs will be cut; and another 5-10 percent of those workers will be replaced by more experienced workers.

The owner of Dollar Rental Cars told Fox News she'll outsource some functions, change schedules and cut some staff in response to the new policy."

Bob McDonnell (R) introduced an amendment to the state's health insurance exchange implementation bill that would prevent insurance plans in the new health exchange from covering abortion.

While similar bills introduced in other states would allow a woman to buy a policy rider for abortion coverage, McDonnell's proposed amendment late Monday night would ban that as well.

""No qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through an exchange established or operating in the Commonwealth shall provide coverage for abortions, regardless of whether such coverage is provided through the plan or is offered as a separate optional rider thereto,"" the amendment reads, adding that women who have become pregnant from rape or incest or whose lives are in danger would be exempt from the ban.

Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50,000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange.

NARAL, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care.

“With this amendment, Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care,"" said Caroline O’Shea, deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a statement. ""Coverage for safe, legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit, Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.""

McDonnell's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.

Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment. Virginia delegate Bob Marshall (R), who has introduced several anti-abortion bills in the House of Delegates this year that have not gone to a vote, sent out an aggressive email blast to his supporters last week.

""The Governor and Republican House and Senate leaders completely ignored any new legislative efforts to protect preborn children in the 2013 session because they wanted to avoid controversy in an election year,"" he wrote. ""If Gov. McDonnell does not hear from many principled pro-lifers like yourself, he may continue to do nothing to protect our conscience from the HHS Mandate or to prohibit abortion coverage in health exchanges."""

Business leaders have lobbied for a guest worker program, arguing that they need low-skilled labor for jobs — in agriculture, for instance — that American workers cannot or will not do. (A leaked draft of the president’s immigration proposal said nothing about a guest worker program, perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that the White House was looking to labor and business leaders to forge their own agreement on the issue.)

The principles outlined on Thursday — the product of months of negotiations between the groups — required compromise from both sides. Labor unions, acknowledging that “there are instances — even during tough economic times — when employers are not able to fill job openings with American workers,” agreed that there may be a need for a new type of guest worker program. In return, the unions insisted that American workers get a first shot at open jobs, and they secured an agreement that the number of incoming lower-skilled workers would be set based on need.

But even as there appears to be a growing consensus on some issues, a full-scale immigration overhaul remains a far-off prospect. This week, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, came out against a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants — a crucial component for Democrats for any immigration plan.

“People have a pathway to citizenship right now: It’s to abide by the immigration laws, and if they have a family relationship, if they have a job skill that allows them to do that, they can obtain citizenship,” Mr. Goodlatte told NPR. “But simply someone who broke the law, came here, say, ‘I’ll give you citizenship now,’ that I don’t think is going to happen.”"

Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio

The labor force has been shrinking in all of Ohio's major cities other than its state capital, Columbus.

Cleveland has lost 52,000 workers, or about 5% of its labor force, since November 2007, and Cincinnati lost 39,000 workers, or about 4% of its labor force, since May 2009, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Job growth is anemic, particularly in Ohio's main industry, manufacturing. Signs point to workers giving up, said Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio.

""I think people are getting discouraged and leaving the labor market,"" she said.

Ohio lost 388,000 jobs in the financial crisis, and has since gained only about a fifth of them back.

Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.

The fallout from the housing bust is still felt here. The construction sector slashed more than half its jobs in the crisis, and they've only started to trickle back in the last few months.

But the decline in the labor force isn't solely due to construction. In neighboring Nevada, the heart of the housing bust, the labor force didn't drop nearly as dramatically as in Arizona.

Phoenix alone lost 64,000 workers, or 3% of its labor force, and Tucson lost 29,000 workers, or a 6% of its labor force, over the last four years.

Most of those declines have come from young men, ages 25 to 34, and middle-aged women, ages 45 to 59.

The Latino labor force has also declined, which could be due in part to stricter immigration laws.

Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, Conn.

Like much of New England, Connecticut generally has an older population than the nation as a whole. With the stock market improving since the recession ended, the number of Baby Boomers retiring has been increasing, said Alissa DeJonge, director of research at the Connecticut Economic Resource Center.

At the same time, the unemployment rate among young minorities has climbed in the state's urban centers, such as Hartford and Bridgeport.

""It may be that these younger minority workers have stopped looking for work and will reenter the labor force when the state's economy improves,"" said Orlando Rodriguez, senior policy fellow at Connecticut Voices for Children.

Detroit and Kalamazoo, Mich. and Milwaukee, Wis.

Michigan's population was declining three years before the recession even hit, as the auto industry moved jobs elsewhere.

The state's largest city, Detroit was hit particularly hard. Three years ago, the U.S. Census found that the city's population had fallen to its lowest level since 1910.

Other manufacturing cities in the Midwest are facing similar declines.

Milwaukee lost 16,000 workers, or 2% of its labor force since June 2009. And Kalamazoo lost 17,500 workers -- a whopping 10% of its labor force -- since January 2007."

It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday. That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college.

At the same time, wages aren't keeping up. The country's median annual household income has fallen by more than $4,000 since 2000, after adjusting for inflation, and many of the jobs lost during the recent recession have been replaced with lower-wage positions.

The USDA's latest estimates include expenses for housing, food, transportation, clothing, health care, education and child care, as well as miscellaneous expenses, such as toys and computers.

The biggest price tag is for families in the urban Northeast earning $105,360 or more. They will spend $446,100, much more than the national average, according to the report. Meanwhile, families earning less than $61,590 a year in rural areas will spend the least, at $143,160.

While expenses in all categories rose in 2012, health care, education and child care spending increased the most.

Health care spending made up around $20,000, or around 8%, of the USDA's estimated child-rearing expenses for a child born in 2012. Meanwhile, child care and education expenses represented nearly 18% of the total costs for middle-income parents.

Since 2000, the cost of child care has increased twice as fast as the median income of families with children, according to the most recent report from Child Care Aware of America. In 2011, the average cost of full-time center-based care for an infant ranged from about $4,600 a year in Mississippi to more than $15,000 in Massachusetts.

""Many families are priced out of licensed child care services,"" said Lynette Fraga, executive director of the nonprofit group. ""If they are priced out, then the health and safety of those children are at risk.""

Amanda Holdsworth, who lives outside of Detroit with her husband and 22-month-old daughter, pay more than $1,000 a month for their daughter's day care center -- or nearly 15% of their monthly income. The costs are so high that they think twice about having a second child.

""To think about paying two day care rates, it's shocking,"" she said.

Related: Best countries for working moms and dads

Another factor hurting families: rising transportation and food costs. Gas prices almost doubled between 2000 and 2012, even after adjusting for inflation, according to AAA. Meanwhile, food costs have spiked.

Turlock, Calif., resident Jason Hicks, a father of 10- and 13-year old sons, said his family has seen their monthly grocery bill grow from $500 to $800 in the past few years.

""As prices are going up and our kids are reaching teenage years, it's compounded quite quickly,"" he said.

There are ways to ease the cost burdens, said Stuart Ritter, a T. Rowe Price financial planner who teaches a money management class for new parents. Many employers, for example, offer tax-advantaged accounts that let parents pay for health and child care expenses with before-tax dollars.

""I have to reassure everybody there are other people who successfully have children,"" he said. ""I personally have three. People figure out ways to make this work."""
http://news.yahoo.com/flight-delays-pile-amid-faa-budget-cuts-222819836--finance.html,,[],Flight delays pile up amid FAA budget cuts,"NEW YORK (AP) — Flight delays piled up across the country Monday as thousands of air traffic controllers began taking unpaid days off because of federal budget cuts, providing the most visible impact yet of Congress and the White House's failure to agree on a long-term deficit-reduction plan.

The Federal Aviation Administration kept planes on the ground because there weren't enough controllers to monitor busy air corridors. Cascading delays held up flights at some of nation's busiest airports, including New York, Baltimore and Washington. Many operations were more than two hours behind schedule.

At one point, the delays were so bad that passengers on several Washington-New York shuttle flights could have reached their destination faster by taking the train.

Nearly a third of flights at New York's LaGuardia airport scheduled to take off before 3 p.m. were delayed 15 minutes or more, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Last Monday, just 6 percent of LaGuardia's flights were delayed.

The situation was similar at Washington's Reagan National Airport, in Newark, N.J., and in Philadelphia, with roughly 20 percent of flights delayed.

At airports, Monday is typically one of the busiest days, when many high-paying business travelers depart for a week on the road. The FAA's controller cuts — a 10 percent reduction of its staff — went into effect Sunday. The full force was not felt until Monday morning.

Travel writer Tim Leffel had just boarded a US Airways plane from Charlotte, N.C., to Tampa, when the flight crew had an announcement.

""They said: 'The weather's fine, but there aren't enough air traffic controllers,'"" Leffel said. Passengers were asked to head back into the terminal. ""People were just kind of rolling their eyes.""

His flight landed one hour and 13 minutes late.

One thing working in fliers' favor Monday was relatively good weather at most major airports. A few wind gusts in New York, snow in Denver and thunderstorms in Miami added to some delays, but generally there were clear skies and no major storms.

Story continues

However, the furloughs will continue for months, raising the risk of a turbulent summer travel season. And the lack of controllers could exacerbate weather problems, especially spring and summer thunderstorms.

There's no way for passengers to tell in advance which airport or flights will experience delays.

FAA officials have said they have no choice but to furlough all 47,000 agency employees — including nearly 15,000 controllers — because the agency's budget is dominated by salaries. Each employee will lose one day of work every other week. The FAA has said that planes will have to take off and land less frequently, so as not to overload the remaining controllers on duty.

Critics have said the FAA could reduce its budget in other spots that wouldn't delay travelers.

""There's a lot finger-pointing going on, but the simple truth is that it is Congress's job to fix this,"" said Rep. Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat and member of the House aviation panel. ""Flight delays are just the latest example of how the sequester is damaging the economy and hurting families across the country.""

Some travel groups have warned that the disruptions could hurt the economy.

""If these disruptions unfold as predicted, business travelers will stay home, severely impacting not only the travel industry but the economy overall,"" the Global Business Travel Association warned the head of the FAA in a letter Friday.

Deborah Seymour was one of the first fliers to face the headaches. She was supposed to fly Sunday night from Los Angles to Tucson, Ariz. First her 9:55 p.m. flight was delayed for four hours. Then at 2 a.m., Southwest Airlines canceled it.

""It's pretty discouraging that Congress can't get it together, and now it's reached the point that we can't get on an airplane and fly,"" Seymour said.

On some routes Monday, it was actually faster to take ground transportation. The 8 a.m. US Airways shuttle from Washington to New York pushed back from the gate six minutes early but didn't take off until almost 10 a.m.

The plane landed at 10:48 a.m. — more than two and a half hours late. If travelers instead took Amtrak's 8 a.m. Acela Express train from Washington, they arrived in New York at 10:42 a.m. — four minutes early.

Normally, there are 10 air traffic controllers at a regional facility handling arrivals for Los Angeles International Airport. On Sunday night, there were just seven, according to Mike Foote, a local union president with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. A low layer of clouds late compounded the situation.

In such weather, two controllers do nothing but watch planes as they descend below 15,000 feet to ensure they don't veer off course. That allows 68 to 70 planes to land each hour. Because of the furloughs, there were no controllers to do that Sunday, dropping the arrival rate to 42 planes an hour, Foote said.

United Airlines said there were ""alarming pockets"" of delays and warned that if a solution isn't found, the problem could ""affect air travel reliability for our customers.""

Delta Air Lines cautioned travelers to expect delays in New York, Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.

Many flights heading to Florida were seeing delays of up to an hour. By late Monday, delays into Los Angeles were expected to average three hours.

Having just one fewer controller to handle arrivals to Newark Liberty International Airport can result in the airport being unable to use a relief runway to handle peak traffic, reducing arrivals by about 15 percent, said Dean Iacopelli, a union official at an FAA regional facility for New York's airports.

""It is not just telling one out of 10 people to stay home and so one out of 10 planes get delayed. It's much more complicated that,"" Iacopelli said.

Prior to the furloughs, if a controller called in sick, there were enough people to take on the extra work, Iacopelli said, or somebody could be asked to work overtime. Now that isn't possible.

The FAA has also furloughed other critical employees, including airline and airport safety inspectors.

In a letter to the FAA Friday, Delta general counsel Ben Hirst asked the agency to reconsider the furloughs, saying it could make the cuts elsewhere and transfer funds from ""non-safety activities"" to support the FAA's ""core mission of efficiently managing the nation's airspace.""

Two airline trade associations and the nation's largest pilots union filed a lawsuit Friday asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to halt the furloughs. No hearing date has been set.

The two airline associations — Airlines for America, which represents major carriers, and the Regional Airline Association — are asking the court to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Department of Transportation's three-hour limit on the length of time airlines can keep passengers waiting inside planes on the tarmac without giving them the opportunity to return to a terminal.

Airlines can be fined as much as $27,500 per passenger for violating the limit. The Transportation Department said it is reviewing the industry's request.

The rating agency's move eased the threat of a cut to the world's biggest economy.

Moody's said the federal government's debt trajectory is on track with criteria the rating agency previously laid out, even without further budget measures from Washington.

The economy is growing moderately, but it is still ""progressing at a faster rate compared with several Aaa peers and has demonstrated a degree of resilience to major reductions in the growth of government spending,"" Moody's said in a statement.

The U.S. budget outlook has brightened in recent months, alleviating some of the pressure on policymakers for more fiscal compromises.

On May 14, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the U.S. federal budget deficit is shrinking at a faster pace than expected, and forecast this fiscal year would end with the smallest shortfall since 2008.

""We feel that we have enough information on the debt trajectory at this point to make a conclusion even without information on any possible further actions in Washington,"" said Steven Hess, Moody's lead U.S. sovereign credit analyst.

Even the possibility of further debate on raising the U.S. debt ceiling this year - allowing the government to keep borrowing money - is unlikely to hurt the rating, Hess said.

""We think that they will raise the debt ceiling, as they always have in the past,"" he said. ""But even if there's some delay, we're not too concerned about that affecting the government's ability to service its debt.""

Analysts said the affirmation means the U.S. sovereign rating could be safer now for years to come.

""We are still running sizable deficits but they are not getting worse,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

""Barring a nuclear event or the re-emergence of the debt ceiling problem, this drastically reduces the chance of a U.S. downgrade in the next couple of years,"" he added.

Last month Fitch also affirmed the U.S. sovereign AAA rating. But that agency kept a negative outlook, saying still-elevated debt levels leave the country vulnerable to shocks without more deficit reduction.

Standard & Poor's rates the country AA-plus, with a stable outlook. S&P cut the rating in August 2011 after a bruising round of debt ceiling debates in Washington raised fears of political dysfunction.

In addition, Moody's affirmed the Aaa senior ratings of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks, which the agency considers to be directly linked to the rating of the U.S. government.

While the stable outlook means the agency is unlikely to cut the U.S. sovereign rating in the medium term, Moody's noted that could change in the future.

""Without further fiscal consolidation efforts, government deficits are anticipated to increase once again over the longer term,"" the Moody's statement said.

The outlook covers the next couple years or so, Hess said. After that, he added, ""a triple-A rating is not guaranteed forever.""

""There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" Boehner said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week.""

Contrary to Boehner's claim, several House Republicans have signaled willingness to pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached to Obamacare's funding and implementation.

As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of those Republicans hit 21 -- surpassing the magic 17 votes needed to pass a clean funding bill if all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with them. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put that bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.

Boehner criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for their unwillingness to budge on the CR, saying Reid is demanding ""complete surrender.""

Turning toward the looming debt ceiling deadline, the House Speaker said his chamber would not pass a measure to raise the limit without an Obamacare-related provision.

""We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],"" Boehner said. ""The votes are not in the House.. We are not going down that path.""

Boehner added that he had no indication of when the standoff would end.

(CNN) —

The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would fund the government through the end of September and avoid a partial federal shutdown, as well as soften the blow of sweeping spending cuts.

The measure, which passed the chamber in a 73-26 vote, now advances to the House.

Leaders of the Senate, run by Democrats, and the Republican-controlled House hope to avoid another saga like the fiscal showdowns that have come to define dysfunction in Congress.

“I hope that this practical, commonsense leadership will be a good sign for … other things in the future,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. “The work done by (the managers of the bill) should be and it is exemplary for what needs to follow.”

Lawmakers want to get the bill, known as a continuing resolution, to President Barack Obama’s desk before leaving Washington for a two-week holiday break starting on Friday.

Failure to enact the measure before March 27 would result in a partial shutdown of federal agencies and other programs.

Justices warn spending cuts put critical legal services at risk

There has been a cavernous political divide between Democrats and Republicans over the role of government spending, taxes and the best way to deal with deficits and debt.

Lawmakers, however, want to find a way to lessen the impact of $85 billion in sweeping, automatic spending cuts that took effect at the beginning of this month after Congress failed to agree on a comprehensive approach for reducing the deficit.

Earlier this month, the House passed its own spending plan that incorporated the cuts – known as sequestration – but provided some leeway for the military and the Veterans administration.

The compromise Senate version, crafted primarily by Maryland Democrat Barbara Mikulski and Alabama Republican Richard Shelby, further reduces the impact of forced austerity by establishing stop-gap budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, as well as NASA.

In its current form, the compromise bill would lock in $984 billion in spending – a notable drop from the $1.043 trillion initially approved before the forced sequestration cuts took effect.

A senior congressional GOP aide told CNN last week the House will probably approve the plan absent significant changes.

The head of the House Appropriations Committee – Kentucky GOP Rep. Harold Rogers – agreed, telling CNN Wednesday that the bill’s “in good shape” and the threat of a government shutdown is “off the table.”

By establishing new budgets for the targeted departments and programs, the bipartisan Senate proposal resets priorities and helps better manage the draconian formula of the spending cuts.

Despite the bill’s bipartisan nature, several senators were unhappy with their inability to offer amendments.

Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, forced an extension of debate after being denied a vote on an amendment to protect rural airport control towers from closure due to the cuts.

“It’s always difficult to attribute motives but as I talk to my colleagues, the only explanation I ever get that has any semblance of truth is there is a point to be made here,” Moran said. “By denying the amendment’s passage, we prove that sequestration can’t work, that we can’t cut money from budgets.”

Obama administration officials have vehemently denied any political motivation to the cuts, arguing that their hands are tied by the across-the-board nature of the sequester.

Some conservative Republicans argue that, despite the cuts, the legislation is still loaded with wasteful spending.

Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, for example, questioned the inclusion of $154 million in Pentagon alternative energy research funding, $120 million for infrastructure improvements in Guam, and $65 million for Pacific coast salmon restoration.

“The bill contains numerous examples of egregious pork barrel projects,” McCain said last week.

McCain told CNN on Tuesday, however, that he would not stand in the way of final passage of the measure.

“I’m ready to vote right away,” he said. “I’ve made my point. I’ve made my speech. I’ve done what I can and I’m ready to move forward.”

Sources tell Fox News that House and Senate negotiators are close on a possible agreement, at least on paper. Lawmakers have until Friday to finish off their work for the year.

""'Close' is a staff term,"" one senior lawmaker cautioned, suggesting it's unclear whether those drafting the bill yet have the votes.

But even if the bill comes together by the time the House is set to adjourn for the year on Friday, it represents a far cry from the kind of ""grand bargain"" congressional leaders once talked about.

The Washington Post reported that it would not include any significant tax or entitlement reforms, or seriously deal with the sequester cuts. The national debt would continue its seemingly inexorable climb.

Aides told the Post that the emerging plan would raise agency spending to just over $1 trillion for the next two fiscal years, while aiming to offset some of that spending by cutting federal worker pensions and making other modest changes.

Though lawmakers once considered a pension overhaul that would save $130 billion over a decade, aides reportedly are looking at a plan that will instead save less than $17 billion.

The Post reports that negotiators are hoping to finish off the bill in a matter of days and take it straight to the floors of the House and Senate. Lawmakers have until Jan. 15 to pass a budget bill or else risk a partial shutdown.

The budget, though, just represents one challenge facing Congress in the days ahead. While the current budget bill expires in mid-January, lawmakers have until only the end of the year to deal with several other items, including payments to doctors and long-term jobless benefits.

On top of that, several lawmakers, and President Obama, were rearranging their schedules to attend memorial services this week for the late South African leader Nelson Mandela.

Long-term unemployment aid, a prickly issue on the Hill, is expected to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million workers who've been without a job for longer than six months.

President Obama used his weekly radio address on Saturday to appeal to Congress to extend it. ""Extending unemployment insurance isn't just the right thing to do for our families -- it's the smart thing to do for our economy,"" he said.

But despite threats by some Democrats to hold up the must-pass budget bill over their demand for extending jobless benefits, a top Democrat signaled Sunday that his party might not block the budget bill over the issue.

""I don't think we've reached that point where we've said this is it, take it or leave it,"" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said on ABC's ""This Week.""

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the long-term benefits -- which typically kick in after 26 weeks -- are actually doing a ""disservice to these workers"" by making them less marketable to would-be employers.

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, speaking on the same program as Durbin, said the issue should be dealt with separately, outside the budget talks.

Both Portman and Durbin, though, voiced optimism that lawmakers might reach some kind of agreement on the budget by the end of the week.

Lawmakers are also at work drafting a three-month measure to prevent a 24 percent drop in Medicare payments to doctors. The cost is estimated at about $8 billion.

And lawmakers are trying to work out at least a short-term deal over the farm bill -- an issue that could end up affecting the price of milk.

The bill itself is meant to set spending levels for farm programs and food stamps. A House measure that passed on a party-line vote calls for food stamp cuts totaling $40 billion over a decade. A Senate version, passed with bipartisan support, envisions reductions of $4 billion.

But failure to resolve the broader issues would also return the nation to a Depression-era dairy law and set in motion a chain of events that would potentially quadruple the price of a gallon of milk.

Now Christie’s at it again – blaming the House GOP for not moving quickly enough to approve funds.

Joel Pollak and other conservatives on Twitter, today, remember the history, and were having none of Christie’s revisionism:

@govchristie Do you not understand legitimate objections to wasteful pork, opportunistically inserted into the bill? Or just not concerned? — Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) April 30, 2013

@joelpollak All the pork was stripped out of bill prior to passage at the insistence of Republicans, myself included. Pls learn the facts. — Governor Christie (@GovChristie) April 30, 2013

@govchristie Respectfully, I believe the facts are otherwise. You insisted on passage of the original pork-laden bill shar.es/lpEXv — Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) April 30, 2013

@joelpollak You are dead wrong. — Governor Christie (@GovChristie) April 30, 2013

@govchristie It’s interesting–you cite House bill in your defense now, but the Senate bill caused the uproar. You blasted the House anyway. — Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) April 30, 2013

The entire reason you held a press conference was to berate Republicans for not passing the bill with the pork @govchristie — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) April 30, 2013

No, your criticism @govchristie was of House Republicans not passing the bill WITH all of the pork, stop rewriting history — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) April 30, 2013

You are “dead wrong” @govchristie, you held a press conference specifically about the House not passing the pork version of the bill — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) April 30, 2013

Rand Paul', 'R-Ky']","Exclusive — Rand Paul: End of the Filibuster, Beginning of 'Ironfisted Rule'","And so it came to pass that the filibuster was dismembered, dishonored, and indefinitely detained. With the end of the filibuster came the end of any semblance of comity and compromise on Capitol Hill.

The party that never seemed to care much for the rule of law broke the rules of the Senate to change the rules. Senate rules for two centuries allowed the filibuster. To change the rules required a two-thirds majority.

When the Parliamentarian ruled that the Democrats were breaking the rules, the Democrats simply over-ruled the Parliamentarian. The rules, it seems, are not binding upon Democrats.

We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes in a living, breathing, ever-evolving Constitution might not believe that Senate rules are important.

We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes that morality is unfixed, unchained to any constants, that all ethics are situational, would break the rules.

Is anyone really surprised that a party with no apparent concern for the burden of debt they place on every American family, that such a party would break the rules to get their way?

We are told they are upset that the Senate takes too long. They want their way and they want it now. The ironfisted rule of rule breakers has begun. There will be no return.

What passed for gridlock before will pale in comparison to the poison that seeps from the hands of those who are careless and reckless with the law.

Where the filibuster once created conversation, the ironfisted rule will stifle it.

For you see, contrary to popular belief, the filibuster actually fostered compromise, dialogue, and results. In exchange for release of nominations, in exchange for release of legislation, Republicans and Democrats would agree to votes.

The filibuster would encourage a reluctant president to cooperate with oversight from Congress.

Information about malfeasance or transparency could be pried from a President in exchange for relinquishing a hold or ending a filibuster. The filibuster was Congress’ tool to exert power or balance power with the president.

The loss of the filibuster weakens Congress and makes any executive, regardless of party, more powerful and less likely to be transparent.

In short, giving power to the party in the minority worked for two centuries to coax compromise.

In the era of filibusters and holds, someone like myself could put roadblocks in front of a Federal Reserve nominee. That hold could then be exchanged for a vote on a bill that had been held hostage for years, such as Audit the Fed.

Such compromise will no longer occur. The Senate will now be run with an iron fist, a fist clenched so tightly, a power wound so closely, that dissent will no longer be heard, debate will be stifled, and amendments to legislation will become non-existent.

The Senate has been described as the saucer that cools the tea that boils out of the cup that is the House of Representatives. The Senate was the saucer that cooled the tea, deliberated and gave review and time for calmer minds to prevail. The Senate was one of the items that our Founders established to separate our Republic from the whims of the majority, from the headlong dash of an unrestrained mob-ocracy.

The public will be burned more often as the Senate becomes less saucer and more boiling cauldron. The loss of the filibuster will lead to more."
http://news.yahoo.com/boehner-protests-obama-veto-threats-155727651.html,,[],Boehner protests Obama veto threats on budget,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House veto threats against legislation that implements spending cuts in the austere GOP budget plan are ""reckless"" and would lead to a government shutdown, House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.

Boehner, R-Ohio, said the veto warnings mean Obama is threatening to shut down the government unless he wins tax increases and higher spending.

The White House said Monday that Obama will veto any legislation implementing the GOP's budget, which endorses spending levels forced by across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration and shifts about $30 billion from nondefense programs to the Pentagon.

""No one wants to make more progress on deficits than I do. I've been working at it for years now. I know how hard it is,"" Boehner said. ""That's why the idea of shutting down the government if we can't find a deal is so irresponsible.""

But even with a budget impasse, a government shutdown could be averted if Congress approved separate stopgap legislation. Such measures, known as continuing resolutions, are routine, and there hasn't been a government shutdown since the 1995-96 confrontation between President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress.

The two sides finessed their differences earlier this year by agreeing to a catchall spending bill permitting $1.043 trillion for agency operations funded annually by Congress. Across-the-board cuts automatically reduced spending to $986 billion and could be implemented again if the ongoing budget impasse isn't broken.

Republicans are drafting spending bills for the upcoming budget year at a lower $967 billion cap. The White House supports a level $91 billion higher.

""We simply won't sign into law the Republican budget, which would drastically slash the investments the middle class, seniors and our economic growth depend on,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""It's time for Speaker Boehner to match his promises of an end to manufactured crises with actions."""

Last year during the debt ceiling fight, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came up with a novel idea. To satisfy the demands of conservatives who insisted on the whacky idea of paying down the national debt, Congress would create a bipartisan “super committee” consisting of members of both the House and Senate who would come up with a plan to make cuts or increase revenue to pay down the national debt.

President Obama joined in the negotiations and came up with the idea of sequestration. If the super committee failed, and most everyone privately thought it would, there would be automatic spending cuts in 2013 that would target sacred cows including defense and education — painful for both sides.

[pullquote]

In fact, it is reasonable to believe, the sequestration cuts would be so painful to the sacred cows of both sides that once the super committee — stacked with congressmen and Senators who could never get the job done — failed, Congress could punt on sequestration and come up with new ideas to pay down the debt or find new shiny initiatives to distract Americans from a lack of debt reduction.

More On This... Obama signs order to begin $85B in spending cuts

Barack Obama came up with sequestration. He negotiated it. Conservatives opposed it knowing that Republicans would ultimately cave and there would actually be no spending cuts. Then a funny thing happened. Republicans and their conservative base fell into a lovers quarrel over the direction of the party. The party establishment in Washington wanted to collaborate with the President, ignored the base’s demands to keep up the fight against ObamaCare, and started acting arrogantly against conservatives.

The base fought back. Republican leaders knew they had to do something to keep up appearances with the base. They decided they could not backtrack on sequestration. The cuts had to happen.

President Obama has long shown a propensity to be good at only one thing: the self-promotion of Barack Obama. He has not been good at governance. He has not been good at getting other Democrats elected. He has been a terrible negotiator. He failed to see what was happening in the party opposite. He structured a deal that made sequestration the law of the land without a literal act of congress to stop it.

Now we have arrived at the day most thought would never come.

In the run up to today, President Obama resorted to a campaign of fear mongering. He decided to make sequestration a blunt instrument. Instead of using his executive discretion to make careful cuts, he found ways to make the cuts appear disastrous, spooky, and painful for the American people. In the last week it would have come as no surprise to hear the president, given his increasing hyperbole about sequestration, to claim it would cause both erectile dysfunction and hospitals to finish off the infirm and elderly without so much as a visit to a death panel.

But the hyperbole did not work. Sequestration has arrived.

In all the talk, chatter, punditry, and hyperbole, one thing has been forgotten. This fight has never been about where to make cuts, but whether to make cuts at all. House Republicans offered several plans to alter the cuts. The Democrats would never consider them. The Democrats, instead, preferred raising taxes and, in sequestration, got one of their long held wishes of defense cuts.

The Democrats were never serious about real spending cuts, which is why the president could be so unserious at his campaign style rallies claiming sequestration would cause furloughs for teachers, policemen, and fire fighters, none of whom are even employed by the federal government.

The game now is predictable. Democrats will try to make the sequestration cuts as painful as possible on the American people. They will stop spending in areas that will do maximum harm and inconvenience to the lifestyle of the American citizen. They want Americans to think any cuts in spending at all are too disruptive.

The president and Democrats do not have to do this. They could make reasonable cuts. But if they do they will show spending cuts are possible without major disruption, pain, and inconvenience. That would give away the game.

The truth is, though, inescapable. Today the sun came up. Americans went about their daily lives. The federal government was open for business. The mail ran. The Mayans were not right.

Americans are reminded that Washington can, in fact, cut its budget and the world will not end. The only better reminder of this would be a government shutdown. We can only hope."

Washington (CNN) - Elouise Wafer's kids thought they had arranged the perfect gift for their mother's 70th birthday.

A former history teacher, Wafer had always wanted to stroll through the White House, a building she had taught about in school for decades.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Sylvia Atkins, her daughter, arranged for a tour through a member of Congress–then she, her sister and Wafer made the journey together from Dallas. But the plane ride had a dash of disappointment.

Shortly before departing Texas, Wafer saw on the news that the White House would be canceling public tours beginning Saturday - the same day as her scheduled slot.

""This was my golden opportunity,"" Wafer said. ""I really wanted to see some of the things that I had studied in school and taught about in school. I wanted to see it in real life.""

Wafer was one of many tourists whose White House plans were scrubbed when the White House decided this week to cut the tours through September 30, the remainder of the fiscal year.

The move came days after Washington failed to come up with a plan to avert $85 billion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration. Federal agencies across the board are making changes to their budgets.

Ryan Dosier, another visitor whose tour luck ran out, was skeptical of whether the walk-throughs deserved to be on the chopping block.

""I just, I don't know how much this is really saving,"" he said. ""I can't imagine that me and two other people is a big expense for them.”

The U.S. Secret Service told CNN Thursday that the plan will help the agency save $74,000 per week - or $2 million in the next seven months. That's how much it costs to pay 37 uniformed officers $50 an hour for 40 hours a week to secure the tour's route through the East Wing.

But that's just a fraction of the $84 million the Secret Service needs to cut from its $1.6 billion budget, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The officers normally assigned to the tours will be reassigned to other duties at the White House.

“The Secret Service, like other agencies of government is affected by the sequester,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during his Thursday press briefing. “And the Secret Service presented options that ranged from canceling tours to potential furloughs and cuts in overtime. And in order to allow the Secret Service to best fulfill its core mission, the White House made the decision that we would unfortunately have to temporarily suspend these tours.”

Some Republicans were quick to blast the Obama administration for nixing the tours, arguing it was a political move designed to draw up more negative public reaction over the cuts and pin all on the blame on the GOP.

""This is nonsense,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""This is punishing the American people.""

Gingrich called on President Obama to end his golf outings and use the money saved to refund the tours.

""The president will use up more Secret Service time guarding him while he golfs than it would take to keep the White House tours open all year,"" he argued.

He wasn't the only one. Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas submitted an amendment to a funding measure in the House this week that would require the president to stop golfing until the White House resumed the tours.

A White House spokesman said Tuesday that this was just the first consequence to the forced spending cuts that began taking effect March 1. And White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that more White House employees will face pay cuts and furloughs.

""We're also faced with making some tough decisions when it comes to ongoing projects,"" he said during the daily press briefing. ""But we're also a pretty personnel heavy agency.""

The self-guided tours are typically arranged through a member of Congress. Natalie Cooper had obtained a ticket through the office of a senator from North Carolina for her son's 8th birthday.

Standing outside the White House Saturday, shortly before noon, Cooper told the birthday boy, Aaron, that they would no longer be getting a tour.

""I was pretty upset about it,"" she told CNN. ""He had his own bucket list and on that bucket list was D.C. and the White House, so it was a little bit upsetting.""

Aaron had already told his class he was going to the White House and added that he was ""sad, very sad."" But, he said, they had plans to see more monuments and museums in town.

Other visitors - who didn't have tour plans - felt less upset about the cancelation. As one couple from Canada said, ""Cuts are cuts.""

The White House Visitors Center, however, will remain open seven days a week. Located just southeast of the White House, the center - through the National Park Service - offers guided tours around the White House area for free every hour. The center also shows a 25-minute video of the different rooms in the White House.

While Wafer won't get her own tour of the White House for her 70th birthday, she said she's not letting the disappointment ruin her Washington vacation. Among other stops, Wafer took a tour of the U.S. Capitol.

But, just like any good teacher, she was more concerned about the students.

""Kids are out for spring break, and they don't get a chance to come (here) all the time,"" she said. ""This is a good time for them to visit the White House.""

On Wednesday the House is expected to vote on a Republican bill that would let the Treasury Department borrow new money until mid-May.

President Obama will not oppose the bill, even though he would prefer a longer term debt ceiling increase, the White House said.

The legislation could still be tripped up in the House or Senate, but there's a good chance for House passage at the very least.

""It's not a slam dunk. But the main thing is that the Republicans will cave on the debt ceiling. So we're now just arguing over the details,"" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for Potomac Research Group.

On CNN.com: House GOP wants to balance budget in 10 years

House Republicans have said for the past two years that they would not raise the debt ceiling unless the increase is matched by a comparable amount of spending cuts. But the bill they're voting on this week doesn't include that quid pro quo.

Instead, it includes a provision that House Speaker John Boehner called ""no budget, no pay.""

Here's how the bill would work:

The proposal would suspend the debt ceiling until May 18, which means Treasury could continue to borrow without restriction. The debt ceiling would then be restored at its current level of $16.394 trillion plus however much Treasury borrowed during the suspension.

Related: Debt ceiling FAQs

Come May 18, Treasury could once again use ""extraordinary measures"" to stave off the prospect of default for up to two months, giving Congress a little more time to raise the debt ceiling, said Pete Davis, a former Hill budget staffer who now runs Davis Capital Investment Ideas.

The bill would also open a path to a longer term increase: It would require the House and Senate to each agree by April 15 to a budget resolution for fiscal year 2014. And such a measure, which is intended to set spending and revenue levels for the next five to ten years, can include debt ceiling increases, Davis said.

If the House and Senate don't meet the April 15 deadline, lawmakers' pay would be withheld until they pass a budget resolution or until the current Congress ends in January 2015.

So it's not that lawmakers won't get paid if they miss the deadline. Their salaries would be held in escrow and paid out at some point later.

House Republicans, in coming up with the temporary debt ceiling solution, are in essence conceding the debt ceiling fight is not their best shot at securing spending cuts and substantive deficit reduction.

And that change could spur progress toward meaningful budget talks.

""The House Republicans' plan shows a constructive shift of focus away from threats of default and towards the need for a budget. That should improve the chances for negotiations over a serious fiscal plan,"" Concord Coalition Executive Director Robert Bixby said in a statement.

Two make-or-break opportunities loom for those negotiations. Unless Congress act by March 2, the pending sequester would trigger close to $1 trillion in defense and non-defense spending cuts that no one in Congress likes.

And if they fail to act by March 27, federal funding will expire entirely and the government would be shut down until lawmakers can find some way to agree on spending and taxes for the next year or at least another few months."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/us-gdp-q1_n_3358706.html,2013-05-30 00:00:00,[],U.S. GDP In Q1 Revised Lower As Austerity Measures Bite,"WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - A drop in government spending dragged more on the U.S. economy than initially thought in the first three months of the year, a sign of increasing pain from Washington's austerity drive.

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate during the period, down a tenth of a point from an initial estimate, according to revised figures from the Commerce Department released on Thursday. Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain.

Growth was held back as government spending fell across all levels of government and as businesses outside the farm sector stocked their shelves at a slower pace.

Washington has been tightening its belt for several years but ramped up austerity measures in 2013, hiking taxes in January and slashing the federal budget in March.

Still, economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, supported by the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policies. Most economists expect growth will slow mid-year as budget cuts come into effect.

Government spending fell even more sharply in the fourth quarter, and economists speculate that government agencies pulled back in anticipation of budget cuts initially due to begin in January but which took effect in March.

In the first quarter, government spending dropped at a 4.9 percent annual rate, faster than the 4.1 percent rate initially estimated. Spending fell at federal, state and local government offices, though the majority of the downward revision in Thursday' report came at the county and city level.

The drag from government and inventories was partially offset by an upward revision to consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate, up two tenths of a point from the government's previous estimate.

However, a cloud hung over that category, as most of the upward revision was due to higher sales of gasoline. Higher prices at the pump are a burden on consumers, leaving them less money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, the first decline in a year.

Total imports grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially estimated, moderating the drag on growth from net trade.

Excluding the volatile inventories component, GDP rose at an upwardly revised 1.8 percent rate, slightly higher than analysts had forecast. (Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

“We are pleased to again welcome Governor Sarah Palin to CPAC in March,” ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said in a statement. “Governor Palin electrified the crowd in 2012 and we are thrilled to welcome her back this year.”

CPAC 2013 will be held Thursday, March 14 through Saturday, March 16, 2013 at its new location in National Harbor, MD at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.

The non-Washington, D.C. location of this year’s conference is fitting for Palin, who blistered the permanent political class and crony capitalism during her 2012 address last year in the nation’s capital in her first appearance at the conference.

Last year, she was mobbed in the hallways before her speech. Palin stayed for nearly an hour after speaking, engaging conservatives and supporters who were there to listen to her. Reporters and observers at CPAC noted in 2012 they had not seen anyone who resonated with the conservative base more than Palin.

At CPAC 2012, Palin said Washington, D.C. had become “something that our forefathers never envisioned, and they would have sworn their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to change.”

Palin said the “old Washington of our Founders” was a place where people “came to serve your government, not prosper over it and on it and from it and off of it.” She mentioned the country’s wealthiest counties were all around the D.C. region, a theme director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute would later document a year later in “Boomtown.”

She referenced her speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 when she spoke of “crony capitalism” that “isn’t the capitalism of free men and free markets, of risk and sacrifice, of innovation and hard work.” She said the new crony capitalism is one of “connections” and of “government bailout and handouts” and waste, “corporate welfare and corruption.”

After her Indianola speech, “crony capitalism” and “permanent political class” were injected into the political vocabulary.

“This is the capitalism of Barack Obama and the permanent political class,” Palin said at CPAC in 2012.

She lambasted the Occupy protesters who were at the conference in 2012, saying they should be instead protesting at Obama’s White House, which has “spurred the expansion of government which diminishes freedom and opportunity for all to rise and to succeed.”

Palin derided politicians who come to Washington, D.C. “denouncing the place as the cesspool of corruption” only to, after a year or two, see it as a hot tub.

“And they are hopping in and enjoying the jacuzzi,” Palin said, noting it was “time we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.”

After Palin turned down Fox News’ offer to renew her contract, she spoke exclusively to Breitbart News about her future. When asked what her response was to the mainstream media’s declarations that she and the Tea Party were “buried,” Palin said she was raised “to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season.”

“When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us,” Palin told Breitbart News last month."

House GOP leaders announced their intention Wednesday to pass a bill this week that would only keep the government running after September 30 if President Barack Obama’s health care reform law is fully defunded.

The decision sets up a high stakes game of political chicken over the next 12 days, as Democrats have repeatedly rejected any attempt to undo the president’s signature legislative achievement.

“We’re going to continue to do everything we can to repeal the president’s failed health care law,” said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. “The law is a train wreck.”

“We aim to put a stop to Obamacare before it costs one more job or raises a family’s out-of-pocket expenses one more dollar,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.

The House bill, which would keep the government running through mid-December, also locks in overall funding levels at $986 billion, preserving Washington’s so-called “sequester” – forced across-the-board spending cuts that have been criticized by leaders on both sides of the aisle.

Obamacare, spending showdown heats up in House

Most congressional Democrats, opposed to further cuts in non-defense spending, have expressed their strong opposition to such a move.

In addition, the GOP bill states that Social Security and disability payments need to receive top priority if Congress and the president are unable to raise the federal debt ceiling by mid-October.

A failure to extend the nation’s borrowing limit and pay bills already incurred risks an unprecedented national default.

Obama and other Democratic leaders have warned they will not cave to GOP demands for new spending cuts in exchange for a hike in the debt limit.

“I’m happy to negotiate with (congressional Republicans) around the budget, just as I’ve done in the past,” Obama told business leaders on Wednesday.

“What I will not do is create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It’s irresponsible.”

The president told his audience to “flip the script for a second and imagine a situation in which a Democratic speaker said to a Republican president, ‘I’m not going to increase the debt ceiling unless you increase corporate taxes by 20 percent. And if you don’t do it, we’ll default on the debt and cause a worldwide financial crisis.’”

“That can’t be a recipe for government,” he said.

A less confrontational strategy initially backed by GOP leaders unraveled last week.

Government shutdown: Again? Seriously?

Numerous House Republicans threatened to defeat a temporary spending measure proposed by their leadership because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law.

Conservative groups such as Tea Party Patriots and Heritage Action for America praised the harder line now adopted by Boehner and other GOP leaders.

“Senate Democrats and President Obama must make a decision: shut down the government to protect a destructive, unpopular law or acknowledge Obamacare has failed and cannot be salvaged,” said Michael Needham, communications director for Heritage Action.

One Republican, Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry, told CNN that conservative activists had been strongly engaged with House members on the issue in recent weeks.

I “absolutely heard from a lot of our conservative groups over the (summer) break about defunding Obamacare,” Terry said. “The pressure was absolutely there … (though) I didn’t feel like it was pressure per se because I agreed we need to do away with Obamacare.”

Opinion: Worried about Obamacare? Fear not

Another Republican, freshman Rep. Trey Radel of Florida, predicted the White House will eventually give in to at least some GOP demands.

“I think the president will negotiate with us,” he said.

Other Republicans seemed less sure.

“We can’t let the government shut down,” said Rep. Peter King, R-New York. “We can’t be kamikazes and we can’t be General Custer.”

A top Senate Democrat warned House Republicans they were playing a losing hand.

“Republican leaders in the House have decided to give the hard right their day in the sun, and decided to pursue an agenda that they know will never, ever be signed into law,” New York’s Chuck Schumer said.

“Reasonable Republicans, stop these zealots in your party from driving our economy off a cliff.”

Meanwhile, with a potential government shutdown less than two weeks away, the White House budget office directed federal agencies on Wednesday to prepare for a potential shutdown.

Sylvia Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told federal agencies to update their plans in the event no agreement is reached before September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

“Prudent management requires that agencies be prepared for the possibility of a lapse,” Burwell wrote.

They know this because House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan created a spreadsheet with some scary charts of what things might be like in the 2070s. (Rumor has it that he created the charts with nothing but his dimples and abs.)

So when Ryan said over the weekend that the country isn't facing an immediate debt crisis, Very Serious People were right to be dismayed. After all, how can Paul Ryan possibly convince Americans to support his plan to balance the budget in ten years if he says there's not an immediate debt crisis? If Ryan says there's no debt crisis, people might get crazy ideas—like believing that creating jobs should be our top priority, not austerity.

Fortunately, Paul Ryan has a boss: House Speaker John Boehner. And Speaker Boehner knows there's a debt crisis. He said so in December, dismissing President Obama's plan to replace the sequester and end Bush tax cuts for the wealthy because ""his plan does not begin to solve our debt crisis.""

But wait, I'm just learning now that Boehner has recanted. This weekend he said:



We do not have an immediate debt crisis.

Asked specifically whether he agreed with President Obama who has said we don't have an immediate debt crisis, Boehner said ""yes."" Don't get me wrong, he still says he wants to make huge spending cuts, because eventually he says we'll have a crisis—but he says we don't have one right now.

But just because Boehner is changing how he talks about whether or not there's a debt crisis, it's not like he's actually changing his policies. Sure, it would be reasonable for him to change, given that the budget deficit has dropped by half since 2009 while the unemployment rate is still stuck near 8 percent. But that's not happening. Republicans might be saying there's no debt crisis, but austerity is still the only thing they are offering."

http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-obama-gop-see-no-205914262.html,,[],"Analysis: Obama, GOP see no need to stop the cuts","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unlike in earlier rounds of budget brinkmanship, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans both seem content to fight out their latest showdown on the current terrain, let across-the-board spending cuts take effect on March 1 and allow them to stay in place for weeks if not much longer.

This time, there is no market-rattling threat of a government default to force the two sides to compromise, no federal shutdown on the short-term horizon and no year-end deadline for preventing a tax increase for every working American.

The rhetoric is reminiscent, for sure.

""So far at least, the ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or the biggest corporations,"" Obama said this week as he campaigned to pin the blame for any negative effects on his political opponents. ""So the burden is all on the first responders, or seniors or middle class families,"" he said in comments similar in tone to his re-election campaign.

Republicans, standing on political ground of their own choosing, responded sharply to the president's fresh demand for higher taxes.

""Spending is the problem, spending must be the focus,"" said House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, while Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declared, ""There won't be any easy off-ramps on this one. The days of 11th hour negotiations are over.""

A crisis atmosphere could yet develop this spring, when hundreds of thousands or even millions of threatened government furloughs begin to take effect and the spending cuts begin to bite. Already, Republicans are considering legislation to give the administration greater flexibility in making the cuts, a step that could minimize the impact on the public. It's a step the White House says it opposes, although the depth of that conviction has yet to be tested.

At heart, the standoff is yet another indication of the political resistance to a compromise curbing the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and possibly Social Security, a step that both Obama and Republicans say is essential to restoring the nation's fiscal health. It is the last major remaining challenge in divided government's struggle, now in its third year, to reduce deficits by $4 trillion or more over a decade.

Story continues

Counting the across-the-board cuts now beginning to command the nation's attention — at a 10-year cost of $1.2 trillion — the president and Congress have racked up more than $3.6 trillion in savings. Much came from spending, although legislation that Republicans let pass at year's end raised taxes on the wealthy to generate an estimated $600 billion for the Treasury over a decade.

The so-called sequester now approaching was never supposed to happen. It was designed as an unpalatable fallback, to take effect only in case a congressional super-committee failed to come up with $1 trillion or more in savings from benefit programs.

Now, more than a year later, Republicans are fond of saying that the idea itself originated at the White House.

That skips lightly over the fact that their own votes helped enact it into law.

Also that they decided a month ago that it marked the moment of most leverage in their struggle to maneuver Obama and Democrats into curtailing benefit programs. To accomplish that objective, they already have raised the debt limit without winning any cuts in exchange, a step they once vowed not to take. And within two weeks, they are likely to launch legislation making sure the government operates without interruption when current funding authority runs out for most agencies on March 27.

Republicans aren't the only ones partial to verbal sleights of hand.

In a letter to lawmakers earlier this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sounded a series of alarms. The spending cuts ""could compromise"" the health of more than 373,000 mentally ill or emotionally disturbed individuals, ""could slow efforts to improve"" health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, she wrote, and admissions to inpatient addiction facilities ""could be reduced.""

Could or could not. Soon or later. Nothing pinned down.

The administration hopes to win over the public and bring Republican lawmakers to heel, and it dispatched Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to the White House briefing room on Friday.

""Come to the table and start talking"" to find a way to avert the cuts, the former GOP lawmaker urged members of his own Republican Party.

Peppered with skeptical questions, LaHood directed reporters to his department's website, with a listing of more than 300 air traffic facilities where overnight shifts could be eliminated or perhaps closed entirely.

Asked if his office was receiving unhappy calls from the public, he got to the political point.

""My phones will ring from members of Congress (asking) 'why is my control tower being closed?'"" he said.

He Left The Post In April']","Politics is a team sport, but not for House Republicans","Politics is a team sport. Except the way House Republicans have played it for the past few years.

At the root of the problems that afflict the majority party in the House is that there are simply too few members willing to occasionally set aside personal interests and ambitions for the broader goals of the party. They just won’t take one for the team.

“The founders’ vision of seeing consensus and compromise in a party conference, let alone on the floor of Congress, appears to be a thing of the past,” said Tom Reynolds, a former congressman from New York who spent two elections as chairman of the House GOP’s campaign arm.

“It is every man for himself,” added another Republican former lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about internal party differences. “House Republicans need to recognize their destinies are intertwined.”

Examples of this go-it-alone approach are everywhere. The surprise failure of the farm bill last month was a result of the rebellion of five dozen Republicans who thought the legislation cut too little. The collapse of House Speaker John Boehner’s alternative proposal during the “fiscal cliff” negotiations late last year was caused by conservative Republicans’ unwillingness to get behind it. (Worth noting: While Boehner (R-Ohio) eventually voted for the compromise deal that averted the fiscal cliff, neither House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) nor House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did.) Then, of course, there was the quasi-rebellion against Boehner at the start of the 113th Congress, when he barely avoided being pushed to a second ballot in his quest for a new term as speaker.

The farm bill was perhaps most illustrative of the lack of team spirit in the House GOP. Among the 62 Republicans who voted against the bill, five were committee chairmen — positions they hold thanks to the very party leaders they bucked in voting “no.”

“We have younger members [who] seem incapable of following and who constantly make the perfect the enemy of the good,” explained one GOP lawmaker, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. “We have chairmen . . . who seem to think they have no obligation to the majority that gave them gavels or even to their fellow chairmen.”

House Republicans’ lack of cohesion on important votes is made all the more clear when you compare it with the recent unity displayed by Democrats in the House and the Senate. On the farm bill, for example, just 24 Democrats — primarily from agriculture-heavy states — voted for it, while 172 voted against it. On the Senate side, not a single Democrat opposed the comprehensive immigration proposal put forward by the “Gang of Eight” last week.

House Republicans’ unwillingness to play team ball is beyond dispute. But the reasons for that lack of unity — and who is to blame for it — are a more open question.

Conservatives who make up the rump group in the House insist that they were elected to be true to their principles and their constituents, not to a party leadership that many believe is responsible, at least in part, for the current state of affairs in Washington. Their reluctance to go along with the GOP team, then, is a natural outgrowth of strongly held beliefs — which, after all, is what voters always say they want in their elected officials.

Others point to the effects of redistricting, the decennial drawing of congressional lines across the country that, over the past several decades, has made the vast majority of House members untouchable in general elections because of the clear partisan lean of their districts. The only thing they fear, politically speaking, is a challenge from the ideological right in a primary, and they protect against that possibility by hewing as closely as they can to the desires of the conservative base. “For survival in a primary, voting against the leadership is a badge of honor back home,” explained Dan Mattoon, a longtime senior adviser to former speaker Dennis Hastert.

The end of earmarks — the plums, usually involving federal dollars spent in a certain district, that Republicans banned when they retook the House in 2010 — also is cited as a reason for the every-man-is-an-island attitude among GOPers. In years past, an earmark dropped into the farm bill here or there would usually persuade a wavering lawmaker to get on board with his party’s leadership. That tool is gone, and with it some of the persuasive powers of people like Boehner and Cantor.

Viewed more broadly, the Republican Party finds itself in a bit of a political wilderness. By 2016, the GOP will have controlled the presidency for only eight of the past 24 years, a streak — and not the good kind — reminiscent of the one Democrats experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s. Why does that matter? Because it’s much easier to stay on the same team when there’s a single captain or coach pointing the way. Republicans lack that presence now and won’t have anything approximating that sort of leader until the 2016 presidential primary process concludes — at the earliest.

In short: Don’t expect an increase in team play from House Republicans — on immigration, the debt ceiling or any of the other contentious fights that will come before Congress in the coming months. There will be lots of (political) isolation plays for the foreseeable future.

“Wrestlers and golfers don’t see the value of a sacrifice fly, but sometimes it’s what the team needs,” said another GOP lawmaker."

Details of a plan reached last week appear to show state legislative leaders are attempting to solve Illinois' $100 billion pension crisis in part by changing workers' retirement age, reducing automatic pension increases and limiting their collective-bargaining privileges.

Union leaders argue the plan to help the under-funded pension plan, which appears to have bipartisan support, seems no different than the one the General Assembly rejected earlier this year.

“It’s an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security,” the We Are One Illinois labor coalition said last week as details of the plan emerged. ""It’s no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits. In fact, reports suggest the leaders have repackaged Senate Bill 1 and barely bothered to disguise it.”

Rank-and-file state lawmakers were briefed on the plan Friday, and a vote could come as early as this week.

Leaders of the unions, a usually reliable Democratic vote, are specifically targeting Democratic state senators from moderate, swing districts where election opponents can hammer them for inaction or being too tough on state workers and say eight to 10 of them are considered ""persuadable.""

The battle is the most recent to play out across the Midwest where Republican governors in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan have worked to limit collective bargain deals to reduce budget shortfalls.

The most epic battle took place in Wisconsin in 2011 when GOP Gov. Scott Walker led an effort to get the General Assembly to pass legislation that limited collective bargaining for most state workers and required them to pay more for their pensions and health-care benefits to help reduce a projected $137 million budget shortfall.

The move sparked weeks of protests in the state capitol, a national debate on the issue and a failed attempt to recall Walker, who was faced with a projected $3.6 billion deficit when he signed the legislation.

Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and the four legislative leaders of the Democrat-controlled Assembly say the plan will save the state an estimated $160 billion over 30 years and are working to secure enough support for passage.

House Speaker John Boehner indicates broader talks on the budget must be part of debt-ceiling debate

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew calls GOP stance %22reckless%22

Boehner says it%27s up to Obama to begin talks to end impasse%3A %22He knows what my phone number is.%22

WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown headed into its second week with no sign of resolution to the bitter stalemate as key Republicans in Congress on Sunday linked the current budget impasse to the looming confrontation over a potential default on the nation's debt.

House Speaker John Boehner said the GOP-led House would not pass measures to either reopen the government or increase the government's borrowing authority without concessions from the White House, including talks on reducing federal spending.

""I don't want the United States to default on its debt,"" the Ohio Republican said on ABC'sThis Week. ""But I'm not going to raise the debt limit without a serious conversation about dealing with problems that are driving the debt up.""

President Obama, he said, ""is risking default by not having a conversation with us.""

Asked how the stalemate would end, Boehner said: ""If I knew, I would tell you.""

The government will reach the limit of its borrowing authority on Oct. 17, and Obama has called for lawmakers to pass a bill increasing the limits with no conditions attached.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew called it ""reckless"" and ""dangerous"" for the federal government to veer so closely to a potential default on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt. ""On the 17th, we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire,"" Lew said on CNN's State of the Union.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who led GOP efforts to dismantle Obama's 2010 health care law as a condition of keeping the government open, Sunday outlined three conditions that should be met before Republicans agree to debt-ceiling deal.

""We should look for some significant structural plan to reduce government spending,"" Cruz said on CNN. ""We should avoid new taxes. And, No. 3, we should look for ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare.""

The House and Senate were set to return to work Monday afternoon. The Democratic-controlled Senate is likely to approve a House-passed bill to ensure federal employees currently furloughed receive back pay once the shutdown ends. But there was agreement on little else as the shutdown moved into Day 7.

The partial government shutdown began Oct. 1, after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement on spending bills to keep the government running into the new fiscal year.

House Republicans made dismantling or delaying the health care law a condition of passing a temporary spending bill -- a position rejected by Obama and Senate Democrats.

In recent days, the House has passed several measures to reopen portions of the government -- most of which have been rejected by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is demanding the House vote on a bill to open the entire government without any conditions.

On Sunday, Lew called on the House to vote immediately on a temporary spending measure without linking it to demands on either the health care law or spending cuts. Lawmakers ""need to open the government up,"" he said. ""They can do it today.""

Boehner, however, said he does not have the votes in the House to pass a stopgap budget measure with no strings attached, despite indications that some moderate Republicans would be willing to join Democrats in passing a ""clean"" measure to end the shutdown.

Democrats challenged Boehner's assertion. ""If there are not votes to open the government as Speaker Boehner says, why is (he) so afraid to call the vote and prove it,"" White House senior adviser Dan Pfieffer tweeted Sunday.

""Put it on the floor Monday or Tuesday,"" New York Sen. Charles Schumer said on ABC. ""I bet there are the votes to pass it.""

Republicans insisted Sunday that it was up to Obama to start negotiations to end the impasse. ""We're interested in having a conversation about how we open the government and how we begin to pay our bills,"" Boehner said. ""But it begins with a simple conversation.""

Obama ""knows what my phone number is,"" he said.

In one encouraging sign for federal workers, 350,000 Pentagon employees were returning to work Monday after they were furloughed in the shutdown. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered them back on the job after government lawyers determined that a new law aimed at shielding uniformed members of the military from the effects of the shutdown also extended to many civilian employees who support the military."

Nope,"“You know, those Capitol janitors will not get as much overtime. I’m sure they think less pay, that they’re taking home, does hurt.”

— Gene Sperling, director of the White House economic council, on ABC News’ “This Week,” March 3, 2013

“On the issue of the janitors, if you work for an hourly wage and you earn overtime, and you depend on that overtime to make ends meet, it is simply a fact that a reduction in overtime is a reduction in your pay.”

— White House spokesman Jay Carney, news briefing, March 4

At a news conference last Friday, President Obama claimed that, “starting tomorrow,” the “folks cleaning the floors at the Capitol” had “just got a pay cut” because of the automatic federal spending cuts known as the sequester.

The president very quickly earned Four Pinocchios for that statement, especially after senior officials at the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the federal agency that employ janitors on the House side, and the office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA), which employs janitors on the Senate side, issued statements saying the president’s comments were not true.

Still, the White House has kept up its spin offensive, claiming that a cut in “overtime” was a de facto pay cut and thus the president was right — or at least not wrong.

So, we wondered: How much overtime do Capitol Hill janitors actually make?

The Facts

First of all, we should note that the White House’s story kept evolving as we reported last week’s column. It’s almost as if the president’s aides had to scramble to come up with reasons why the president could be correct, without actually knowing the facts.

So, when we forwarded to White House aides an AOC memo saying no furloughs were planned, White House aides latched onto a line about overtime reductions. For a couple of hours, we were also told that the janitors were on contract — and contracts were being curtailed. But that line of reasoning turned out to be incorrect. Then, after the statements from the Capitol were issued, there was no longer any response.

But, as seen by the quotes above, the talking point about “overtime” did not fade away.

AOC officials declined to discuss janitor compensation, but SAA officials were willing to share details. Given that the AOC and SAA janitors essentially work side by side, it is reasonable to assume that the pay statistics are roughly similar.

Bret H. Swanson, assistant sergeant at arms for operations and the manager of cleaning technicians, said 27 people are employed on the night cleaning shift and 16 people on a day shift; a majority of the cleaning takes place at night. There is a differential for the overnight shift, so the night janitors earn an average of $51,644 a year and the day janitors earn an average of $49,481.

And the overtime pay? It averaged $304 per employee in fiscal year 2012 and $388 per employee thus far in the current fiscal year. “Cleaning technicians do not earn what I would consider to be a great deal of overtime pay,” Swanson said.

In other words, overtime amounts to only pittance of the overall pay — about $6.50 a week on top of wages of $1,000 a week. That’s much different from Carney’s claim of having to “depend on that overtime to make ends meet.”

Indeed, even before the sequester was implemented, Capitol Hill janitors have already earned more overtime pay than they did in all of last year. Swanson said the higher amount so far this year is because of “the demands of beginning a new Congress and hosting a presidential inauguration during a weekend that also included a federal holiday.”

Swanson said that, as reported, SAA would work on trying to drive down overtime requirements for employees for the rest of the year. But, for the rest of the sequester, the janitors are already ahead of the game.

A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

The Pinocchio Test

We don’t try to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. When Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was ridiculed for saying last week that 170 million jobs would be lost because of the sequester, we dropped our inquiry when we realized she had corrected her statement — to the official Congressional Budget Office estimate of 750,000 jobs — later in the same news conference. Everyone makes mistakes, and that’s understandable.

The quicker the mistake is cleaned up, the better. As Education Secretary Arne Duncan showed this week, a little humility, even a bit late, can be a good thing.

But a clean-up brigade shouldn’t simply try to deflect and obfuscate. Apparently, the president assumed — incorrectly — that the janitors on Capitol Hill would get a pay cut. Rather than admit an error, White House aides doubled down on their talking points about overtime being essential to their livelihood, without actually knowing the truth.

Clearly, the sequester is hurting segments of the government and will cut the pay of some government workers. It would be better to focus on those people rather than imaginary victims.

At the center of Mickelson's tax complaint was his claim that he pays a tax rate of 62 to 63 percent.

""If you add up all the federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security and the state, my tax rate's 62, 63 percent,"" Mickelson said. ""So I've got to make some decisions on what I'm going to do.""

Related: Did California's Rich Tax Really Shrink Its Deficit?

There is no doubt that Mickelson's taxes are high. And they just went up by an additional 7.9 percent over the past three months due to the ""fiscal cliff"" deal and California's Proposition 30.

But several accountants interviewed said it's unlikely that Mickelson is actually paying a rate above 60 percent. With even the most basic tax planning, they said, his real rate is most likely closer to 50 percent.

After his comments turned into a rare off-course controversy for Mickelson, he apologized but didn't back away from his numbers. ""Finances and taxes are a personal matter and I should not have made my opinions on them public,"" he said today in a statement. ""I apologize to those I have upset or insulted and assure you I intend to not let it happen again.""

But let's consider those numbers.

Under current tax rates, Mickelson would pay 13.3 percent in state income tax and 39.6 percent in federal income tax. That's 52.9 percent combined. Medicare and Medicaid is an additional 2 percent. The new health-care levy is .9 percent on earned income and 3.8 percent on investment income.

Self-employment taxes could total an additional 15.3 percent -- but that's only on income up to $113,000, accountants say. After that the rate is 2.9 percent.

Mickelson would also pay local taxes where he plays tournaments. That could add another one percent or two percent.

So the maximum Mickelson could pay in state and income taxes, payroll and other income-related taxes would be around 60 percent.

But that rate is only if he did absolutely no tax planning or basic deductions. He would, for instance, get a deduction on his state income taxes from his federal. He would also deduct any golf-related expenses as a business expense. He probably puts money in a retirement plan, which is tax-favorable.

I would guess that Mickelson has some investments, which would be taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 20 percent (or 23.8 percent with the new health-care tax). And I would guess he might have a mortgage deduction, or other deductions related to kids and education.

And we know that Mickelson gives money to charity. So that would be deducted as well. If he has trusts (which he likely does) that also reduces his tax rate.

Steven Piascik, president of Piascik – the accounting firm that works with dozens of professional athletes – said that he easily could bring Mickelson's rate to around 50 to 52 percent with some ""basic tax planning.""

""I couldn't guarantee it, but 8 to 10 percent off that 62 percent rate seems normal,"" he said. ""I would guess he's doing a lot of these things already.""

Either Mickelson misspoke – or he needs to hire a new accountant."

During the Nov. 26 visit, Obama met DreamWorks executives and employees, gave an afternoon speech about the importance of the film industry to the American economy and international diplomacy, and visited with stars of an upcoming DreamWorks movie, including Steve Martin.

He also shook hands with Glendale Mayor Dave Weaver, and three other council members attended his speech, the Glendale News-Press reported.

Glendale residents who didn’t have a chance to meet the president shouldn’t have to pay for the DreamWorks staff who did, Councilman Zareh Sinanyan said during a council meeting this week.

“Is it not fair for [DreamWorks] to foot at least part of the bill?” Sinanyan said. “It’s not like the president came and met with the residents of Glendale.”

Sinanyan’s request came as Glendale continues to climb out of financial distress prompted by the recession and the loss of the city’s prominent redevelopment program.

The approximately $61,000 price tag for Obama’s visit covered the cost of 92 city personnel, ranging from SWAT officers to traffic control authorities, said city spokesman Tom Lorenz.

Although Councilwoman Laura Friedman said Thursday that she agreed with Sinanyan, she said Friday that she had changed her mind.

“I think that when the president comes to your city, it’s an honor and we have to take responsibility for his safety,” said Friedman, who was unable to attend the president’s speech. “As much as it would be great if DreamWorks paid, I’m not going to demand that they do.”

DreamWorks spokeswoman Allison Rawlings said the animation company had not been contacted directly by the city about the cost of security at the Obama event.

“DreamWorks is honored that the president chose to speak at DreamWorks and in Glendale,” Rawlings said.

City Manager Scott Ochoa said it’s traditional for cities to pay for the extra security that comes with a presidential visit.

“At the end of the day, it’s really just something we do,” Ochoa said.

The House and Senate are both moving on fiscal matters

A deal to keep the government open is likely

The next showdown will probably be this summer

WASHINGTON — Congress is on track to approve competing party-line budget blueprints as well as legislation to fund the government and prevent a shutdown March 27, but newfound fiscal momentum on Capitol Hill is a temporary reprieve from the budget battles that will renew this year.

The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate will approve respective ten-year budget plans with vastly different views on spending, taxes and entitlement programs before adjourning for a two-week spring recess.

The House will begin debating on Wednesday a conservative blueprint authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that would eliminate the annual deficit in 10 years without raising taxes but through deep cuts to non-defense spending. The bill would convert Medicare into a premium support system where seniors are given federal subsidies to buy their own health care.

""This budget stops spending money that we simply do not have,"" said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J.

Senate Democrats' budget plan is a less ambitious road map without major federal overhauls. It includes an equal ratio of about $1 trillion in spending cuts and revenue raised through closing tax loopholes. The combination would allow Congress to turn off the $1.2 trillion automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that kicked in March 1. Their budget does not achieve balance in the 10-year window but lowers the national debt to less than 3% of the overall economy, a metric many economists consider stable. ""It is a path towards a bipartisan deal that the American people are looking for,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the budget's author.

Budget resolutions are non-binding and do not have the force of law. The two chambers are highly unlikely to reconcile the two visions, considering their vast differences, but Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said budget negotiators would try. ""I think there's going to be a real effort,"" he said.

The effort is aided in part by reinvigorated personal efforts by President Obama to find a longer-term agreement for the nation's fiscal future. Obama wants to replace the unpopular automatic cuts with both spending cuts and revenue, but Republicans oppose any new revenue from taxes and want spending cuts and entitlement changes.

Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council, told USA TODAY ""Capital Download"" that Republicans would have to budge on revenue if there was any hope for compromise.

""If the Republican leadership that controls the House of Representatives says ... that from now on, every single penny of deficit reduction has to come from things like Medicare, education, research; that there can't be one single penny that comes from closing a loophole or a tax expenditure for a very well-off American — that is the type of absolute position that makes that kind of compromise very difficult,"" he said.

The battle is likely to resume over the summer when Washington faces another deadline to increase the federal debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing authority to pay its bills. ""I think between now and midsummer, we'll be having these discussions again,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who lauded the president's recent private meetings with lawmakers but acknowledged compromise remains elusive. ""(Obama) knows what needs to be done, and we await his taking the steps he needs to take."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24484207,,[],Debt-ceiling offer: Beginning of the end of shutdown crisis?,"""What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move - a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget - for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government and to start to deal with America's pressing problems,"" he said."

Summers, forced out of contention for the Federal Reserve chairmanship by liberal Democratic opponents who thought he was too close to Wall Street.

Though brilliant, the Harvard economist has nonetheless ticked off too many people in his long and brash career, not only on policy grounds but also because of his famously caustic personality. Note to future careerists: Niceness counts.

Nor should you pity President Obama, who reportedly favored Summers. The president is reaping what he sowed. He started the unseemly squabble among Democrats by awkwardly announcing that the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had “already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to.”

That was in June, when Bernanke was still in the middle of a second four-year term to which Obama had appointed him and had not yet publicized his own intentions.

Obama defended Summers in closed-door meetings with congressional Democrats but never mustered the gumption to nominate him and bring his party into line.

No, the real victims here are the Federal Reserve and its chairmanship, both of which are supposed to be above politics but have been dragged deep into the same political muck that stains every other institution in this polarized capital. The question is how much Fed independence, actual and perceived, has been harmed, and for how long.

Of course, the Fed has never been completely apolitical. President Richard Nixon pushed his handpicked Republican Fed chairman, Arthur Burns , to engineer a boom for his 1972 reelection campaign. The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act, passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, put the Fed in charge of value-laden (i.e., political) trade-offs by requiring it to minimize both inflation and unemployment.

Meanwhile, the Fed’s role as a financial regulator has grown, subjecting it to constant lobbying from interest groups and their allies in Congress.

In 2010, Republicans mounted an unjustified but successful partisan attack on Obama’s nomination of Peter Diamond to be one of the Fed’s seven governors.

Still, the Fed managed to avoid undue politicization. Chairman is the key job, and all chairmen since August 1979 — Paul A. Volcker, Alan H. Greenspan and Bernanke — served at least part of their tenure after being reappointed by a president of the opposite party.

In all that time, the closest Senate confirmation vote was 70 to 30 in favor of Bernanke’s reappointment in 2010.

Now Summers’s withdrawal under fire suggests the Fed’s top position may be subject not only to fierce wrangling between the parties but within them. He never got a hearing, just a lot of flak about what he or his competitor, Janet Yellen, mightdo in office.

Supposedly Summers would have unduly tightened monetary policy, perhaps even more than the bond-buying “taper” Bernanke is already weighing. Says who? Last I checked, Summers hadn’t tipped his hand about monetary policy and was waging an op-ed campaign for greater infrastructure spending, out of concern for jobs.

Critics blame Summers not just for being abrasive (fair enough) but also for supporting financial deregulation as President Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, which allegedly led to economic meltdown years later. Worse, Summers never admitted the mistake or apologized for it, as Michael Hirsh emphasized in a National Journal rendition of the critics’ arguments. Ergo, Summers would still be pro-Wall Street now.

I did not know that atoning for policy judgments that were made in good faith, but can be questioned in hindsight, was a precondition for the Fed chairmanship. If it were, Bernanke would have been disqualified due to his backing of low-interest-rate policies at the Fed under Greenspan — which many blame for the housing bubble.

In early 2007, Bernanke declared that the subprime mortgage crash was “likely to be contained.” Whoops.

Still, as chairman, Bernanke’s been good to great. Probably that’s because he’s a first-rate economist who doesn’t ruminate on the past but judges the issues before him according to the best available data — a description that also fits Summers, and Yellen, for that matter.

The Summers fight was a power struggle, not a serious policy debate. Progressives were determined to roll the White House and, inexplicably, the White House let them.

Neither side seemed too concerned about the political independence of an institution whose essential attribute is a capacity to resist demands for easy money, if necessary — parties and elections be damned.

As two distinguished Harvard economists put it in a 1993 paper: “Insulating monetary policy from the political process . . . helps enforce the low inflation equilibrium. Without some degree of political independence, it would be impossible to appoint a central banker more inflation averse than a majority of the voters, which is a socially desirable goal.”

Their names? Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers.

Depending on the recommendations of a government task force he would create under a deputy mayor of health care innovation, he said, city coverage might still be placed in the hands of a different insurance company under a more competitive scheme, or the city might outsource just the administration to an insurer, as Medicare does while keeping overhead as low as 1.3 percent. A third option he listed would be for the city “to take the whole thing in-house.”

He said he would reorganize government agencies to seize opportunities presented by the Affordable Care Act, and have his health care innovation task force consider insurance terms that “keep more of the money in the city,” like allowing prescriptions to be filled at local pharmacies rather than only by mail order, or using the city’s development and investment capability to increase primary care at a hospital facing closure.

“This is not just a conversation you can have around cost,” he said, citing the nation’s experience in the 1990s with an H.M.O. model that no one liked, and calling the quality of health care in New York “a crown jewel.”

The coverage devised by the task force, which he called Thrive (standing for Taskforce for Healthcare Reform, Innovation and Vitality for Everyone), could eventually be offered to all New Yorkers by being listed on the state insurance exchange required by the Affordable Care Act. Such an experiment could not be tried in places like Cincinnati or St. Paul, he went on, but “New York is the health care capital of the world,” with more than 560,000 health care workers, including tens of thousands of doctors and nurses in the city’s own employ."

http://news.yahoo.com/flight-delays-pile-amid-faa-budget-cuts-222819836--finance.html,,[],Flight delays pile up amid FAA budget cuts,"NEW YORK (AP) — Flight delays piled up across the country Monday as thousands of air traffic controllers began taking unpaid days off because of federal budget cuts, providing the most visible impact yet of Congress and the White House's failure to agree on a long-term deficit-reduction plan.

The Federal Aviation Administration kept planes on the ground because there weren't enough controllers to monitor busy air corridors. Cascading delays held up flights at some of nation's busiest airports, including New York, Baltimore and Washington. Many operations were more than two hours behind schedule.

At one point, the delays were so bad that passengers on several Washington-New York shuttle flights could have reached their destination faster by taking the train.

Nearly a third of flights at New York's LaGuardia airport scheduled to take off before 3 p.m. were delayed 15 minutes or more, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Last Monday, just 6 percent of LaGuardia's flights were delayed.

The situation was similar at Washington's Reagan National Airport, in Newark, N.J., and in Philadelphia, with roughly 20 percent of flights delayed.

At airports, Monday is typically one of the busiest days, when many high-paying business travelers depart for a week on the road. The FAA's controller cuts — a 10 percent reduction of its staff — went into effect Sunday. The full force was not felt until Monday morning.

Travel writer Tim Leffel had just boarded a US Airways plane from Charlotte, N.C., to Tampa, when the flight crew had an announcement.

""They said: 'The weather's fine, but there aren't enough air traffic controllers,'"" Leffel said. Passengers were asked to head back into the terminal. ""People were just kind of rolling their eyes.""

His flight landed one hour and 13 minutes late.

One thing working in fliers' favor Monday was relatively good weather at most major airports. A few wind gusts in New York, snow in Denver and thunderstorms in Miami added to some delays, but generally there were clear skies and no major storms.

Story continues

However, the furloughs will continue for months, raising the risk of a turbulent summer travel season. And the lack of controllers could exacerbate weather problems, especially spring and summer thunderstorms.

There's no way for passengers to tell in advance which airport or flights will experience delays.

FAA officials have said they have no choice but to furlough all 47,000 agency employees — including nearly 15,000 controllers — because the agency's budget is dominated by salaries. Each employee will lose one day of work every other week. The FAA has said that planes will have to take off and land less frequently, so as not to overload the remaining controllers on duty.

Critics have said the FAA could reduce its budget in other spots that wouldn't delay travelers.

""There's a lot finger-pointing going on, but the simple truth is that it is Congress's job to fix this,"" said Rep. Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat and member of the House aviation panel. ""Flight delays are just the latest example of how the sequester is damaging the economy and hurting families across the country.""

Some travel groups have warned that the disruptions could hurt the economy.

""If these disruptions unfold as predicted, business travelers will stay home, severely impacting not only the travel industry but the economy overall,"" the Global Business Travel Association warned the head of the FAA in a letter Friday.

Deborah Seymour was one of the first fliers to face the headaches. She was supposed to fly Sunday night from Los Angles to Tucson, Ariz. First her 9:55 p.m. flight was delayed for four hours. Then at 2 a.m., Southwest Airlines canceled it.

""It's pretty discouraging that Congress can't get it together, and now it's reached the point that we can't get on an airplane and fly,"" Seymour said.

On some routes Monday, it was actually faster to take ground transportation. The 8 a.m. US Airways shuttle from Washington to New York pushed back from the gate six minutes early but didn't take off until almost 10 a.m.

The plane landed at 10:48 a.m. — more than two and a half hours late. If travelers instead took Amtrak's 8 a.m. Acela Express train from Washington, they arrived in New York at 10:42 a.m. — four minutes early.

Normally, there are 10 air traffic controllers at a regional facility handling arrivals for Los Angeles International Airport. On Sunday night, there were just seven, according to Mike Foote, a local union president with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. A low layer of clouds late compounded the situation.

In such weather, two controllers do nothing but watch planes as they descend below 15,000 feet to ensure they don't veer off course. That allows 68 to 70 planes to land each hour. Because of the furloughs, there were no controllers to do that Sunday, dropping the arrival rate to 42 planes an hour, Foote said.

United Airlines said there were ""alarming pockets"" of delays and warned that if a solution isn't found, the problem could ""affect air travel reliability for our customers.""

Delta Air Lines cautioned travelers to expect delays in New York, Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.

Many flights heading to Florida were seeing delays of up to an hour. By late Monday, delays into Los Angeles were expected to average three hours.

Having just one fewer controller to handle arrivals to Newark Liberty International Airport can result in the airport being unable to use a relief runway to handle peak traffic, reducing arrivals by about 15 percent, said Dean Iacopelli, a union official at an FAA regional facility for New York's airports.

""It is not just telling one out of 10 people to stay home and so one out of 10 planes get delayed. It's much more complicated that,"" Iacopelli said.

Prior to the furloughs, if a controller called in sick, there were enough people to take on the extra work, Iacopelli said, or somebody could be asked to work overtime. Now that isn't possible.

The FAA has also furloughed other critical employees, including airline and airport safety inspectors.

In a letter to the FAA Friday, Delta general counsel Ben Hirst asked the agency to reconsider the furloughs, saying it could make the cuts elsewhere and transfer funds from ""non-safety activities"" to support the FAA's ""core mission of efficiently managing the nation's airspace.""

Two airline trade associations and the nation's largest pilots union filed a lawsuit Friday asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to halt the furloughs. No hearing date has been set.

The two airline associations — Airlines for America, which represents major carriers, and the Regional Airline Association — are asking the court to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Department of Transportation's three-hour limit on the length of time airlines can keep passengers waiting inside planes on the tarmac without giving them the opportunity to return to a terminal.

Airlines can be fined as much as $27,500 per passenger for violating the limit. The Transportation Department said it is reviewing the industry's request.

But while Congress convened once again Thursday to weigh a set of mini-spending bills, President Obama hit the stump 20 miles away -- taking his bid to pressure Republicans, once again, on the road.

At a construction company in Rockville, Md., Obama blasted the ""reckless Republican shutdown in Washington,"" and called on Congress to fix it by passing a budget ""with no partisan strings attached.""

He warned that the economic impact will get ""worse"" the longer it drags on, and accused House Speaker John Boehner of catering to ""extremists"" by not bringing a straight budget bill to the floor.

Republicans, meanwhile, complained that Obama had called them to the White House a day earlier without offering any concessions.

""It was essentially a negotiation about not negotiating,"" Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said. He added: ""It's time for Democrats to start acting responsibly. It's time to work with us and get our way out of this mess.""

Ahead of the president's visit on Thursday, the White House made clear the president was not budging off his position that Republicans must pass a ""clean"" spending bill, free of provisions dealing with ObamaCare. ""He will not negotiate. He will not offer concessions to Republicans in exchange for not tanking the economy,"" press secretary Jay Carney said.

The president held a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday with bipartisan congressional leaders, but the session ended as it began -- with each party retreating to previously stated positions and a compromise nowhere in sight.

Obama is now returning to a tactic he's employed many times before, making his case to supporters at campaign-style events in a bid to increase pressure from the outside on his political foes. The tactic, though, continues to open the president to Republican accusations that he's veering clear of the negotiating table, where a deal presumably would be struck.

""At times like this, the American people expect their leaders to come together and to try to find ways to resolve their differences,"" Boehner said Wednesday evening after the White House session broke up. ""The president reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate.""

Ever since the president rallied for the passage of a national stimulus package in 2009, Obama has made campaign-style speeches part of his repertoire in advocating for legislation.

The past year has been filled with these kinds of events. Last December, Obama rallied Detroit union supporters over tax hikes amid the fiscal cliff showdown

Then in February, he pressured Republicans, from a shipyard in Virginia, to strike a deal on the sequester to avoid harsh spending cuts. The tactic didn't work -- the ""supercommittee"" tasked with solving the problem ended up deadlocked, and the cuts went into effect.

Then came a national push for gun control legislation. Then again in May, Obama launched an effort to pressure Congress to hold down student loan rates.

It's unclear whether Obama's pressure campaign will work this time. Republican leaders are no doubt cognizant that during the last partial government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, their party was largely blamed for the impasse and suffered in the next elections.

But the party is holding the line, arguing that their demands that ObamaCare be curtailed are in line with what the American people want.

While Obama is on the road, House Republicans are trying to increase pressure on the president's party by calling up a series of mini-spending bills and daring Democrats to oppose them. The House on Thursday, in a 265-160 vote, approved a bill to fund the National Guard and Reserve, and debated another to fund the Veterans Affairs Department. On Wednesday, the House -- without much Democratic support -- approved bills to fund the national parks and the National Institutes of Health. Another bill was passed allowing the District of Columbia to spend its own funds.

Tempers were flaring among the rank-and-file as leaders failed to reach a compromise.

Lawmakers spent the evening Wednesday shouting at each other. In perhaps the most intense exchange, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., repeatedly accused his GOP colleagues of waging ""jihad"" on Americans.

Miller, who was a champion of the federal health care law when it was being drafted, claimed Republicans who are now complaining about the national parks being closed did not show the same concern over health care. He said: ""When you were on the jihad against Americans' access to health care, shutting down the parks wasn't a problem. Shutting down NIH wasn't a problem.""

Miller was then ruled ""out of order."" After he left the floor, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, said he was ""disgusted"" by Miller's comments.

""We should all reject his comments,"" Simpson said, adding that Miller should be formally censured ""but I won't call for it."""
http://news.yahoo.com/shutdown-ruins-vacations-hurts-local-economies-041811789.html,,[],"Shutdown ruins vacations, hurts local economies","FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Stop at a cafe in the remote stretches of northern Arizona and southern Utah in the fall, and you're likely to hear a mix of languages as tourists from around the world step into the iconic western landscape, marked by breathtaking canyons and massive rock formations.

Millions of visitors tour the region each year for what can be once-in-a-lifetime vacations.

Those visitors didn't stop with the government shutdown, which forced officials to close down roads, campgrounds and tourist centers at national parks dotting the landscape.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has offered to use state money to keep the Grand Canyon open, and several businesses made similar pledges — all of which have been politely rejected by the national park.

The impact isn't just ruining vacations. It also has brought local economies to a near standstill.

THUMBS DOWN

Outside Yellowstone's north entrance, two men on a bus with Indian and Chinese passengers frown and give the thumbs down sign after seeing the park is shut down. A family of Japanese tourists leaves the Grand Canyon in tears. An English couple and a Belgium couple touring national parks out West settles for a drive around Yosemite without being able to put their feet on the ground.

""Looks as though both sides are having a bit of a childish tantrum,"" says Englishman Neil Stanton.

Songyi Cho, on a separate trip to Yosemite, says: ""This is crazy. How can a whole government shut down?""

While some international tourists kept tabs on American politics in the days before they ventured to national parks, others were blindsided.

Alan Platt and his wife, Leana, first heard about a possible shutdown while at the Grand Canyon on Monday. Platt guessed that lawmakers would be pushed to the brink but pass a budget by the deadline. He was wrong, and the couple was forced to cut their three-day Grand Canyon stay short.

""For the rest of the world, we're concerned about the fact you have partisan positioning going on,"" he says. ""No matter who's in power, there's a national pride in engagement we saw. Suddenly, we see a great divide.""

ICONS FROM A DISTANCE

Some of the country's most recognizable icons can be viewed from a distance — the full faces of Mount Rushmore, Devils Tower, the granite formations in Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Mount Rainier. No one needs to tell tourists that it's not the same as camping on the beaches of the Grand Canyon off the Colorado River, walking the slot canyons at Zion or watching water spew at Old Faithful in Yellowstone.

""There's no question it's disappointing,"" says Bruce Brossman of the Grand Canyon Railway, which has furloughed conductors and engineers who run trains into the canyon. ""You can get a sneak peak and maybe get inspired to come back.""

Returning to the national parks might be easier said than done, particularly for international tourists who often plan expensive and lengthy vacations.

SALVAGING TRIPS

Jock Holland, of Melbourne, Australia, is among those forced to make alternate plans. He was heading to Grand Teton from Yellowstone when he was stopped by the park closure. He planned to chart a new course after grabbing a bite to eat in Jackson, Wyo.

The Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau outside the national park helped Stanton and his wife, Clare, set up horseback rides and hikes outside. He says Yosemite has ""been somewhat on our bucket list for years, and you get here and you can't get to it. A bit frustrating but we still made the most of it.""

Julie Jaeger and her friend are leaving California on Friday for what would have been a trip to Zion, Bryce Canyon, the Grand Canyon's North Rim, Canyonlands and Mesa Verde national parks. They've renamed their vacation the ""magical mystery tour,"" as they search for state parks and interesting towns to visit along the way. They still hope the federal government resumes operations and they can salvage part of their original itinerary.

BUSINESSES TAKE HIT

Rafting outfitters, fishing guides, Jeep companies, hotels and restaurants are hurting without the 715,000 people who spend about $76 million a day visiting the national park system.

About 90 percent of the business at Phoenix-based Across Arizona Tours is for the Grand Canyon, says company co-founder Leonardo Gem.

""It's like closing Macy's the day after Thanksgiving,"" he says.

At Lees Ferry Anglers, which runs fishing trips in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in northern Arizona, employees are busy calling customers to cancel trips scheduled this week.

""It is devastating,"" says employee Kaila Bruner. ""You can't really function normally. We just have to depend on the lodging and the through traffic to stay open.""

Greg Bryan, mayor of the tiny town of Tusayan outside the Grand Canyon entrance, manages a hotel in town and says he is downsizing staff as fewer and fewer people come through. The town should be bustling with tourists sharing pictures of sunsets over the South Rim, of mule rides down the park's trails and massive expanses of geology.

It looks more like a ghost town these days.

(CNN) —

Robert Redford says bigotry, fear of change and a determination to personally destroy President Barack Obama have paralyzed the U.S. government.

Women and young people are the answer to fixing the gridlock that has partially shut down Washington, the actor told CNN on Tuesday.

“Give them the reins,” Redford said. “I think they can do better than we have.”

Redford, 77, sat down with CNN’s Nischelle Turner to talk about his new film, “All Is Lost,” which he agreed could serve as an analogy to the shutdown crisis.

In the movie, Redford plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision with a container ship.

“At a certain point, I think, when things really get awful, when things get really bad and all seems to be lost – there’s no hope, there’s no possibility – then a lot of people quit,” Redford said about his character. “They say, ‘What’s the point?’ and they quit. And others keep going for no other reason than that.”

Opinion: Men dither while women lead

Redford: ‘Why are these people behaving so stupidly?’

The conversation then turned to the drama playing out in Washington, where a standoff between Obama and Republicans in Congress has forced the federal government into a partial shutdown and threatened a default on the U.S. debt.

“It’s so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past,” Redford said. “And I was trying to figure out, why are these people behaving so stupidly? Why are they behaving so horribly that it’s crippling our whole country?

“And I think it has to do with fear. I think it’s a group of people that are so afraid of change, and they’re so narrow-minded that some people – when they see change coming – get so threatened by change, they get angry and they get terrorized, and then they get vicious. I think that’s who these people are. They’re so afraid of change that they’re behaving miserably.”

Obama is “a compassionate man who can’t function” in this political environment, Redford said. It “is so decrepit, it is so paralyzed, and the worst of it is it is paralyzed by intention,” he said. “There is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system. I think what sits underneath it, unfortunately, is there’s probably some racism involved, which is really awful.”

Obama’s opponents reject whatever he might propose “because their determination was to destroy this person,” Redford said. “They wanted, if it meant destroying the government, anything to keep him from succeeding.

“I think just the idea of giving credit to this President, giving him credit for anything, is abhorrent to them, so they’ll go against it. Never mind that it’s the better good of the people, never mind that they’re supposed to be in office representing the interest of the public. They’re representing their own self-interests, which is very narrow and in some cases bigoted.”

America’s problem: We’re too dumb

Redford: All is not lost

But, unlike his latest film title, all is not lost, Redford said. He said “something new” is starting to happen that offers hope.

“Susan Collins, who is a Republican, is saying: ‘Enough of this. This is not the job I signed up for. I’ve got to do something,’ ” said Redford, referring to the U.S. senator from Maine. “So she’s bringing a bipartisan group together of women. I think the future should belong more to women and young people.”

Women must save the country “because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly,” Redford said. “I mean, sometimes you say: ‘Can we actually be this dumbed down, or am I actually hearing what I’m hearing from some of these people? Are they really, is that really happening?’ It’s sad.”

Does this mean Redford is already throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton in a 2016 White House bid?

“No, I wouldn’t single out one woman over another,” he said. “I think it’s time to give more women a chance.”

“All Is Lost,” which is almost a silent movie, with its sparse dialogue, hits U.S. theaters next week.

In a morning appearance alongside emergency first responders he suggested could lose their jobs under the automatic cuts, Obama complained that congressional Republicans refuse to consider what he calls a “balanced” approached to budgeting.

“So far, at least, what they’ve expressed is a preference where they’d rather have these cuts go into effect than close a single tax loophole for the wealthiest Americans -- not one,” Obama said as he delivered brief remarks. He took no questions from the White House press corps.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

The automatic cuts, set to take effect March 1, would harm the economy, cost American jobs and even threaten military and law enforcement readiness, Obama said.

The Tuesday appearance is the president’s latest event in a public campaign to portray the GOP as standing in the way of “balanced” reductions to debt and deficit. Obama says he is willing to cut wasteful government spending to reach that goal but insists the deal must also involve reform of the tax code in a way that produces new tax revenue.

Republicans also want to find a way to avoid the dramatic spending cuts, set up by Obama and Congress as a way to force the parties to work out a compromise, but they want to do it without imposing new taxes.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) predicted last week that the automatic cuts would probably take effect unless lawmakers come up with a long-term plan significantly cutting spending and wiping out the deficit in the next decade.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Obama renewed his call for a short-term fix that would give the parties more time to work out a bigger plan.

If Republicans and Democrats can’t get a big budget agreement done by next Friday, Obama said, then Congress should pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would prevent the so-called sequester cuts from taking effect.

Rather than simply a plan to “kick the can down the road,” Obama said, the fix would “give them time to work together on a plan that finishes the job of deficit reduction in a sensible way.”

The president spoke grimly of the consequences of letting the deadline pass without such a fix.

Emergency responders such as police and firefighters would see their disaster response degraded, he said. Border patrol agents would have their hours reduced.

FBI agents will be furloughed and federal prosecutors “will have to close cases and let criminals go,” Obama said, while teachers are laid off and many Americans lose access to preventive care including cancer screenings.

“It seems like every three months around here, there is some manufactured crisis,” Obama said. “We’ve got more work to do than to just try to dig ourselves out of these self-inflicted wounds.”

http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2013/09/30/questions-answered-impact-government-shutdown-on-travelers/,2013-09-30 00:00:00,[],9 questions answered: Impact of government shutdown on travelers,"Hitting the road soon? A possible federal government shutdown could put a serious damper on your travel plans.

If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, tourists may experience travel delays and won’t be able to access some of the country’s top sites, including the Statue of Liberty and other attractions run by the National Park Service.

The possible government shut down doesn’t just impact tourists; it can affect school trips, weddings and have a detrimental knock-on effect for local business that rely on tourism this time of the year.

Here are some questions answered to help you navigate a federal shutdown:

Will airports be open and security screening take place? Yes, expect some delays, but security will remain tight. According to the TSA, nonessential employees will be furloughed, but “the majority of our officers who screen passengers/luggage will remain on the job,” TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein tweeted.

Will my flight take off? Yes, federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job.

Can I get a last minute passport? Probably not. The Department of State says that it would continue processing foreign applications for visas and U.S. applications for passports. That’s because it has some funds outside the annual congressional appropriation. But if the government shuts down, you should expect delays. During the other government shut down in 1995-1996, 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas went unprocessed each day, while 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went unprocessed, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.

Will all national parks, museums and zoos sites really be closed? Yes, and you can add battle fields, historic homes, monuments or any other federally funded tourist site to that list. That’s 401 sites in all, including the Smithsonian museums, Great Smoky Mountains, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island in New York, as well as Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.

Can at least watch the Baby Panda Cam? Sadly, you’ll have to get your dose of cuteness somewhere else. The daily antics of the newborn panda cub on the National Zoo’s ""Baby Panda Cam"" have become a popular pastime for thousands of viewers. The zoo said that managing the panda cam requires staff and volunteers.

Wait! What if I am already at a park at a remote camp site? Park officials probably have already notified you that you’ll have to leave. They should have given you 48 hours prior notice for you to make alternate plans.

Can I get a gun permit for a gun I want for my hunting trip? If you don’t already have a gun permit, you probably won’t be able to get one.

Should I plan on taking Amtrak for my trip from Boston to Washington? Yes. Amtrak, which relies on federal subsidies, is vowing to keep operating, saying that, ""Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor and across the country in the coming days and weeks can be assured that Amtrak will remain open for business.""

Will I be able to get back into U.S. after my trip to Niagara Falls? Yes, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers should remain on duty, so you can clear immigration and customs in the U.S., though staffing may be more limited than usual. CBP said it is unsure of how the shutdown will affect the processing of applications filed at the border."

USA TODAY

The partial U.S. government shutdown is now a nervous watch on how close the world's largest economy comes to its first-ever debt default. What you need to know as the shutdown begins Day 8:

Some GOP lawmakers not worried about debt limit breach

Some Republicans are skeptical about warnings that failing to raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 would result in a financial catastrophe. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and other GOP lawmakers contend the United States could prioritize its debt payments and not default. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, wants to couple a bill to end the government shutdown with one to increase the nation's borrowing authority, plus other concessions. President Obama is refusing to negotiate until the government reopens and the debt limit is increased to remove the possibility of default.

How furloughed workers are filling their days

Thousands of civilian employees were back on the job at the Pentagon on Monday, but about 500,000 federal workers are still idle in the government shutdown. Many of these idled workers are keeping themselves busy with home projects, looking for part-time work or just enjoying their free time until official Washington returns them to their jobs. A bill to ensure furloughed government workers receive back pay, passed by the House this weekend, has not yet been scheduled for a Senate vote.

Wall Street feeling anxious as stocks fall

Stocks fell Monday amid hardening political stances. The Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index all dropped as the government shutdown began its second week. Markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Europe also saw losses. ""Expect more market volatility and downside pressure if a deal is not reached this week,"" said Joseph Quinlan, an investment strategist at U.S. Trust.

Polls: GOP takes more blame for shutdown impasse

Seven in 10 adults disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the wrangling over funding the government, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. That's a 7-point jump since last week. More than half say they don't approve of the way President Obama is handling the budget standoff, and 61% say the same about congressional Democrats. The blame is more closely divided in a Pew Research Center poll. Nearly 4 in 10 Americans point fingers at the GOP, compared with 30% who blame Obama and 19% who say both the White House and Republicans share responsibility.

Skateboarders flip for shutdown's silver lining

There is an upside to the nearly empty plazas in front of the District of Columbia's partially shuttered government buildings. Skateboarders have taken to gliding on some of the marbled plazas and steps on federal property that aren't being policed amid the government shutdown, reports The Wall Street Journal . One favorite spot: Freedom Plaza on 13th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, not far from the White House.

“One of the things that I don’t do well is this,” she said to applause from most of the guests, according to a White House transcript. “Do you understand?”

A pool report from a reporter in the room said Obama “left the lectern and moved over to the protester.” The pool report quoted Obama as saying: “Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.""

Obama’s suggestion that she would leave was not included in the official White House transcript.

The audience responded by asking Obama to remain, according to the pool report, which quoted a woman nearby telling Sturtz, “You need to go.”

Sturtz was escorted out of the room. She said in an interview later she was stunned by Obama’s response.

“She came right down in my face,” Sturtz said. “I was taken aback.”

Sturtz said she told Obama she was happy to take the microphone to plead her case, which, Sturtz said, appeared to fluster the first lady.

“I said I want your husband to sign the executive order,” Sturtz said. “Her husband could sign this order tonight and protect 22 percent of the work force in this country.”

Sturtz said she paid $500 to attend the fundraiser, part of a protest cooked up by the gay rights group GetEqual, which gained notice in Obama’s first term for hectoring him during speeches and demanding more action on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. Sturtz, who gave $5,000 to the Democratic Party and Obama's campaign in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, said she was devoting herself to full-time activism now pressing the White House on the employment discrimination issue.

The proposed executive order that prompted Sturtz’s outburst would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

LGBT activists, many of whom hailed Obama for his vocal support for same-sex marriage rights in the months leading up to his reelection in 2012, have been increasingly dismayed that the White House has not yet acted on the proposed order.

The issue has been building for years, pushed by gay rights advocates who argue that more than 20 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by federal contractors. Advocates for the executive order have attempted to exert more quiet pressure, highlighting cases of discrimination by some firms and connecting workers to administration officials to make personal appeals.

White House officials have said they back legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, but have declined to say whether the executive order is pending.

Metro Weekly, a gay newspaper, reported in 2012 that, as a presidential candidate in 2008, then-Sen. Obama had pledged to a Houston LGBT group that he would support a “formal written policy” of non-discrimination.

Pat Quinn launched Illinois’ epic attempt to bail itself out of a $100 billion public employee pension debt Thursday, signing into law an ambitious financial, legal and political effort to restore the state’s tumbling credit ratings and unstable economy.

Despite the historic nature of the law, which takes effect June 1, the Democratic governor signed the measure behind closed doors, joined by top lawmakers. The quietness of the event symbolized the controversial nature of a package that has split longtime political allegiances and quickly become fodder for the 2014 campaign season.

The private bill signing stood in sharp contrast to the public pep rally that master of ceremonies Quinn held when he put his signature on Illinois’ gay marriage law little more than two weeks earlier, a move that reaffirmed support among progressives.

On Thursday, Quinn offered a simple signing statement on the pension measure saying “Illinois is moving forward” and calling the law “a serious solution to the most dire fiscal challenge of our time.”

Whether the law represents a solution to the state’s pension liability will likely be up to the courts to decide. As expected, public employee unions said they had directed their lawyers to prepare a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the law and seek a stay to prevent it from taking effect.

The We Are One coalition of unions, headed by the state AFL-CIO, called the new law “attempted pension theft and it’s illegal.”

“Leading politicians and their followers chose to violate their oaths of office, trample on the Illinois Constitution, and willfully ignore the plain letter of the law,” the coalition said in a statement. “Once overturned, its purported savings will evaporate and the state’s finances and pension systems will be left in worse shape.”

At issue is a clause in the 1970 state constitution which defines public pensions as an “enforceable contract” with benefits that cannot be diminished or impaired. But supporters of the measure, including House Speaker Michael Madigan, have maintained the law will be upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court.

Once again Thursday, Madigan claimed full credit for the legislature’s narrow passage of the measure, an unusual posture for the state Democratic chairman to take on legislation that was fought by unions, a traditional Democratic ally.

“The bill would not have passed without me,” Madigan said in the statement Quinn’s office released, a rare claim of self congratulations from a veteran politician who prefers to work behind the scenes.

Madigan’s boast may be a way for him to push back against the idea that he helped create the financial instability that surrounds state government as someone who has served as House speaker for all but two of the last 30 years.

The new law counts on saving $160 billion over the next 30 years, largely by sharply curbing cost-of-living increases to retirees and requiring many current workers to skip up to five annual cost of living bumps when they retire. It also would boost the retirement age for current workers by up to five years, depending on how old they are.

In an effort to get the law deemed constitutional, employees would have to contribute 1 percentage point less to their salaries, pension systems would be allowed to sue to force the state to pay its required employer share to retirement, and a limited number of workers could join a 401-(k) style defined contribution plan.

Earlier Thursday, state Treasurer Dan Rutherford, one of four Republican candidates for governor, took the side of the unions in saying he did not believe the givebacks to workers and retirees were sufficient enough to be found constitutional.

A rival for the GOP governor nomination, Winnetka equity investor Bruce Rauner told supporters on Twitter he was not surprised “that a flawed, insider deal crafted behind closed doors is signed behind closed doors too.”

Rauner, who has been sharply critical of government unions, had advocated a more stringent plan to shift workers into 401-(k) plans — a move viewed politically impossible in a Democratic controlled legislature and a proposal difficult for a workforce in which about 80 percent do not receive a safety net of Social Security.

Of the other two Republicans in the race, state Sen. Bill Brady of Bloomington, the 2010 GOP nominee, served on a special pension panel and supported it while state Sen. Kirk Dillard of Hinsdale opposed it for a litany of reasons after previously supporting similar legislation.

Rand Paul', 'R-Ky']","Exclusive — Rand Paul: End of the Filibuster, Beginning of 'Ironfisted Rule'","And so it came to pass that the filibuster was dismembered, dishonored, and indefinitely detained. With the end of the filibuster came the end of any semblance of comity and compromise on Capitol Hill.

The party that never seemed to care much for the rule of law broke the rules of the Senate to change the rules. Senate rules for two centuries allowed the filibuster. To change the rules required a two-thirds majority.

When the Parliamentarian ruled that the Democrats were breaking the rules, the Democrats simply over-ruled the Parliamentarian. The rules, it seems, are not binding upon Democrats.

We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes in a living, breathing, ever-evolving Constitution might not believe that Senate rules are important.

We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes that morality is unfixed, unchained to any constants, that all ethics are situational, would break the rules.

Is anyone really surprised that a party with no apparent concern for the burden of debt they place on every American family, that such a party would break the rules to get their way?

We are told they are upset that the Senate takes too long. They want their way and they want it now. The ironfisted rule of rule breakers has begun. There will be no return.

What passed for gridlock before will pale in comparison to the poison that seeps from the hands of those who are careless and reckless with the law.

Where the filibuster once created conversation, the ironfisted rule will stifle it.

For you see, contrary to popular belief, the filibuster actually fostered compromise, dialogue, and results. In exchange for release of nominations, in exchange for release of legislation, Republicans and Democrats would agree to votes.

The filibuster would encourage a reluctant president to cooperate with oversight from Congress.

Information about malfeasance or transparency could be pried from a President in exchange for relinquishing a hold or ending a filibuster. The filibuster was Congress’ tool to exert power or balance power with the president.

The loss of the filibuster weakens Congress and makes any executive, regardless of party, more powerful and less likely to be transparent.

In short, giving power to the party in the minority worked for two centuries to coax compromise.

In the era of filibusters and holds, someone like myself could put roadblocks in front of a Federal Reserve nominee. That hold could then be exchanged for a vote on a bill that had been held hostage for years, such as Audit the Fed.

Such compromise will no longer occur. The Senate will now be run with an iron fist, a fist clenched so tightly, a power wound so closely, that dissent will no longer be heard, debate will be stifled, and amendments to legislation will become non-existent.

The Senate has been described as the saucer that cools the tea that boils out of the cup that is the House of Representatives. The Senate was the saucer that cooled the tea, deliberated and gave review and time for calmer minds to prevail. The Senate was one of the items that our Founders established to separate our Republic from the whims of the majority, from the headlong dash of an unrestrained mob-ocracy.

The public will be burned more often as the Senate becomes less saucer and more boiling cauldron. The loss of the filibuster will lead to more."

Obama decides he doesn't need these guys for the next jobs effort.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama announced a new plan to repair the nation's failing infrastructure and create construction jobs. On Wednesday, the White House unveiled the plan

The first element is a ""fix-it-first"" policy, an investment of $50 billion to address the transportation infrastructure with $40 billion of that targeted to the most urgent projects, the ""highways, bridges, transit systems, and airports most in need of repair."" The second part of the plan is a ""Rebuild America Partnership,"" with all levels of government partnering with business and private capital on infrastructure projects. The third part is a commitment from the federal government to modernize and streamline the agency permitting and regulatory processes for projects.

The outlines of the plan have been well received so far.



After hearing a general description of the proposal, Robert Puentes, director of theMetropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, said that while some of the announcement had been on the president’s agenda for some time, “the important shift seems to be the administration is not waiting for the legislature,” but is “maximizing the things they can do themselves.” Mr. Puentes expressed enthusiasm for the infusion of more private capital into infrastructure investment. “This is not going to solve all our infrastructure problems — we still have a long way to go,” he said, adding that private money cannot meet all of the nation’s needs. However, he said, “this will go a long way.”

Importantly, these are initiatives that minimize the need for congressional approval, where there would likely be a less enthusiastic response, at least from one side. Past efforts at infrastructure jobs bills have regularly been killed by Republicans, whose commitment to real job creation is hollow , at best."

the important point about these particular bad predictions is that they came from people who constantly invoke the potential wrath of the markets as a reason we must follow their policy advice. Don’t try to cover America’s uninsured, they told us; if you do, you will undermine business confidence and the stock market will tank. Don’t try to reform Wall Street, or even criticize its abuses; you’ll hurt the plutocrats’ feelings, and that will lead to plunging markets. Don’t try to fight unemployment with higher government spending; if you do, interest rates will skyrocket. And, of course, do slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid right away, or the markets will punish you for your presumption. By the way, I’m not just talking about the hard right; a fair number of self-proclaimed centrists play the same game. For example, two years ago, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson warned us to expect an attack of the bond vigilantes within, um, two years unless we adopted, you guessed it, Simpson-Bowles. So what the bad predictions tell us is that we are, in effect, dealing with priests who demand human sacrifices to appease their angry gods — but who actually have no insight whatsoever into what those gods actually want, and are simply projecting their own preferences onto the alleged mind of the market.

Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia. The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn’t blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul’s impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations — an issue that has torn the chamber for years. Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.

Finally, while Sen. Rand Paul's filibustering speech on drones stole headlines regarding the vote for John Brennan to become the next director of the CIA this week, it's a Senate report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that could pose a greater problem for Brennan either now or early in his tenure. Though the report remains classified, The New York Times reports that Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, will push for at least parts of it to be made public. Insiders note the report offers a scathing criticism of CIA interrogation programs like those portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty revealing a pattern of failure to disclose details or grossly distorting the success of the program. If Zero Dark Thirty's performance at the Oscars is any indication—it was nominated but failed to win in any major categories—the American public doesn't care much to discuss the uncomfortable lessons of our involvement in Iraq over the past decade. As always, we avoid them at our own peril. As the saying goes, those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it.

Seemed like every time we met, Carl Levin was wearing the same suit -- not quite gray, not quite brown, always a little wrinkled. Add the ever-present plastic reading glasses on the end of his nose and a wild swirl of gray hair that covered less of his head every year, and this was either a carefully cultivated professorial image or a guy who had more important things on his mind than how he looked. After just a few of the regular meetings we had during my years on the Free Press editorial page, I knew it was the latter. But that's not to say there wasn't some of the former in the mix. In an era when politicians take courses in telegenics and sound bites, Carl Levin was pretty much ... Carl Levin, and that was apparently OK with the voters of Michigan, who elected and re-elected him six times to the U.S. Senate and would probably have given him a seventh term next year if Levin hadn't said Thursday that he's done running.

At the surrender ceremony after the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781, the British band played “The World Turned Upside Down.” Republicans, like the British, will realize that America has changed only after they lost the battle and the war. A new generation of selfless voters, the millennials have replaced the baby boomers as the focus of American politics but Republicans are stuck in a time warp in the 1980s. As the world changes, Republicans cling to the past as hard as Fox News hangs onto the myth that it is fair and balanced."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc suffered a defeat on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a decision forcing it to defend against claims it misled investors about mortgage securities that lost value during the 2008 financial crisis.

Without comment, the court refused to consider Goldman's appeal of a September 2012 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Goldman shares sank more than 2 percent.

That court let the NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates it did not own, but which were backed by mortgages from the same lenders.

Goldman and other banks have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.

The bank has said that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.

Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally had no immediate comment, saying the bank's lawyers had yet to review the order.

Lawyers for the NECA-IBEW fund were not immediately available for comment.

Fred Isquith, a lawyer specializing in class action and securities litigation who is not involved in the case, said Monday's order is important because of the amount of mortgage litigation in the 2nd Circuit, home to Wall Street, but said the fallout might be less than Goldman fears.

""If you expand the number of securities, you expand the amount of potential damages,"" said Isquith, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz and former president of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. ""How much more? I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that when it comes down to dealing with actual damages, it will be less than they argued.""

Goldman shares were down $3.43, or 2.2 percent, at $151.41 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

""VEXATIOUS"" LITIGATION FEARED

At issue was whether the NECA-IBEW fund, a Decatur, Illinois, electrical workers' union pension fund that bought certificates from two of 17 trusts under a 2007 registration statement, could sue on behalf of investors in all 17 offerings.

The 2nd Circuit let the fund sue over seven of the offerings: the two it invested in, plus five others that also contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co. It said the other 10 offerings were too different.

Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher representing Goldman, warned in court papers that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand ""will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions.""

Goldman said the case also merited review because it conflicted with a decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involving Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc.

But Darren Robbins, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the NECA-IBEW fund, said both decisions ensure that class representatives have ""a genuine stake in establishing liability on all of the claims asserted.""

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Goldman, saying the 2nd Circuit decision encouraged ""vexatious, abusive litigation and coercive multi-million or billion dollar settlements to the detriment of the nation's economy.""

The case is Goldman Sachs & Co et al v. NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-528.

Other laws are often violated when spam messages are sent to numbers in the federal “Do Not Call” registry.

The commission said it was pursuing an additional case charging contempt of court against Phillip A. Flora, a serial text-message spammer who was barred in 2011 from sending unsolicited texts. He faces potential felony charges of violating a federal court order, in addition to a new lawsuit filed by the F.T.C. against his company, Seaside Building Marketing. Mr. Flora could not be reached for comment.

The authorities said it was difficult to catch companies that send spam messages because they frequently change the phone numbers used to originate the messages, making them hard to track.

Spam waves have become much more frequent since phone companies began offering unlimited text-messaging plans. Now, spammers buy hundreds of SIM cards, the chips that make cellphones work, allowing them to send a flood of messages and then abandon the phone numbers.

The F.T.C. has received at least 50,000 complaints about spam text messages in the last few years, including 20,000 that related to an offer of a free prize, and the number of complaints is growing rapidly. Mr. Baker said the commission received seven times as many complaints in 2012 as it did in 2011.

Officials advised anyone who receives such a message not to click on any link and not to reply. In particular, they said, consumers should not text “Stop” or a similar direction back to the sender, as spam messages often suggest; that simply lets the sender know the phone number is active and therefore a candidate for sale to other marketers. Instead, consumers are requested to forward the text message to 7726, which is a central repository for spam messages that has been set up by cellphone carriers. The message should then be deleted, the officials said."

In an assertive State of the Union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech, Mr. Obama declared it was “our generation’s task” to “reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth — a rising, thriving middle class.”

“Every day,” he said, “we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?”

The increase in the minimum wage, from $7.25 an hour now, was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president, from education and energy to public works projects. Taken together, Mr. Obama said, these investments would accelerate the nation’s recovery by helping those in the broad middle class."
http://news.yahoo.com/mass-gov-vetoes-transportation-financing-182535482.html,,[],Mass. gov vetoes transportation financing bill,"BOSTON (AP) -- Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick on Friday kept his promise to veto a massive transportation financing bill, saying the measure was ""not good enough"" after lawmakers rejected his demand to include a plan for offsetting a potential loss of turnpike tolls.

In making the announcement, the governor said he was acting with ""mixed emotions"" because the bill included many positive elements.

Legislative leaders in both the House and Senate have expressed confidence that they have sufficient votes to override the veto.

The bill, which calls for $500 million in new taxes, seeks to pump billions of dollars into the state's transportation network over the next decade, allowing the state to modernize its aging infrastructure and jumpstart a number of stalled projects, such as expansion of commuter rail to the South Coast.

The legislation would also end the practice of borrowing to pay salaries of state transportation workers and close the MBTA's $115 million deficit, heading off another round of fare increases or service reductions.

""On the one hand, this bill, in its current form, enables us to reinvest in our transportation network, after decades of willful neglect,"" Patrick said in a statement. ""It provides some short-term resources to deal with our most pressing needs. It responds to a key priority of my administration and will stimulate many jobs.""

""But this bill is not good enough,"" he added.

The key flaw in the bill, according to Patrick, is that it does not address the problem of how to replace lost revenue if tolls west of Interstate 95 come down as scheduled in 2017. While some lawmakers are of the belief the tolls will not ultimately come down, the governor criticized the Legislature for choosing to deal with the question at a later time.

""I believe this is an issue to be dealt with now, not put off to another day,"" he said.

Patrick's amendment would have allowed for an automatic increase in the state's gas tax if — and when — the western tolls come down.

The House on Wednesday voted 121-31 to send the bill back to the governor without the change, and the Senate did the same on Thursday by a 29-9 margin. Both margins, if they held up, would be above the two-thirds threshold needed to override the veto.

The bill already includes a 3 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax and would index future increases in the tax to inflation. It also raises the cigarette tax by $1 per pack and imposes the state sales tax on computer software and services."

So, by heading down that path, Republicans would cost themselves most if not all Democratic votes. That would force Republicans to find the votes for an extension from their own caucus—but given the narrow and fractious nature of the GOP majority, it's hard to see how that's possible. Republicans need Democratic votes.

If they elect to move forward anyway, there's another problem with the ""No budget, no pay"" idea: It's not Constitutional. The 27th Amendment clearly bars Congress from changing its own pay. And a top Republican is ready to shoot it down:



The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said constitutional problems may doom a debt ceiling plan announced earlier Friday by House leaders, but the Republican lawmaker said he has a replacement in mind. “That’s unconstitutional,” Rep. Darrell Issa said of the plan to withhold members’ pay if their chamber does not pass a budget resolution. House Republicans have dubbed the proposal “no budget, no pay.”

Issa says he wants the legislation to tie the debt ceiling itself to passage of a budget. But that goes beyond mere ""gimmick"" and brings us right back to a hostage crisis situation—and that's what created this problem in the first place.

Bottom line, it seems like Republicans have three options: (1) they can pass a clean extension of the debt limit, as Cantor's initial statement seemed to be saying they would, (2) they can try to pass a debt limit extension that includes the unconstitutional ""no budget, no pay"" gimmick, or (3) they can go back to hostage crisis mode, right back where we started.

Only one of those three options—the first—is at all viable. And in a sign of the clown show that is today's GOP, it's still not clear what they are going to do, even though hours earlier they sent a message loud and clear that they were waving the white flag of surrender.

Issa, in a bit of ass covering, elaborates to TPM, saying he expects a final measure to have cleared up any constitutional issues. Let's be clear though, he still thinks (correctly) that it's unconstitutional to change the amount of money members of Congress get paid during a term. Pay could be withheld or delayed, but not eliminated. And he still favors explicit language holding the debt limit hostage to budgetary politics. In other words, Issa's preferred outcome is still one with a hostage crisis: he just wants a different ransom letter. And it's a nonstarter."

Statewide, 52% of the respondents said the $68-billion project to link Los Angeles and San Francisco by trains traveling up to 220 mph should be halted. Just 43% said it should go forward.

The poll also shows that cracks in voter support are extending to some traditional allies, such as Los Angeles-area Democrats, who have embraced the concept of high-speed rail as a solution to the state’s transportation problems. The survey results suggest that the current plan and its implementation are of specific concern to those voters, according to officials with the Republican and Democratic firms that jointly conducted the poll.

“I don’t think they are against the concept, but they are against the way it is being executed,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic polling firm in Washington.

The massive project has fallen a year behind schedule and is facing lawsuits that threaten to stall the momentum of the project and a groundbreaking now likely to come early next year.

The new findings mirror a USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll taken last year, just before the state Legislature approved funding to start construction, under political pressure from the Obama administration and the state’s Congressional leaders. At that time, state rail officials argued that public backing would increase as improvements to the rail plan became clear.

But a wave of new support hasn’t materialized. Instead, signs of buyer’s remorse among voters for approving a 2008 ballot measure to fund the current project have increased. The poll found 70% of respondents want the project to be placed back on the ballot — up from the 55% measured in last year’s USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll.

As public opposition solidifies and the start of construction nears, the question of whether the state should go forward with one of the biggest and most technically difficult infrastructure projects in California history is taking on greater urgency.

“It should have public support to go forward,” said former state Sen. Quentin Kopp, a former champion of the rail project who has become one of its most influential critics. “The lack of support reflects a general disbelief of the authority leadership, which has become a public relations game.”

Kopp, who served for years on the California High-Speed Rail Authority board, said the agency will almost certainly need another bond measure to complete construction, making public opinion potentially crucial to the project’s survival.

The results include some good news for the project. A 61% majority said the bullet train would help reduce traffic on highways and at airports, and 65% said it would create jobs. And by one measure, public opposition appeared more pointed last year. At that time, 59% of poll respondents said they would vote against high-speed rail if it were on the ballot, though they were not asked whether the project should be stopped.

Rail agency officials declined to be interviewed. Spokeswoman Lisa Marie Alley said in a statement: “We will continue to uphold the will of the voters, Legislature and federal administration to help modernize California’s transportation system and create tens of thousands of new jobs.”

Fifty-one percent of respondents called the project a waste of money, and 63% said they would never or seldom use it. Given the choice, 58% of voters would rather fly or drive from Southern California to the Bay Area, and 39% would take a bullet train.

Voter concerns about the project have been heightened by the tough economic times that continue across the state, the poll shows.

“Over the last five years, voters have had to tighten their belts, and they feel the government should be doing the same thing,” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that helped conduct the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and The Times.

Poll respondent Lara Erman, a Burbank resident, cited those concerns as the basis of her opposition to the project. “Our state and our country are in a lot of trouble right now with the condition of the economy and the job market,” she said. “It would be better served as a private enterprise project.”

Bryan Koenig, an aircraft mechanic in Ridgecrest, said he objects to the project mainly because he won’t use it and “the cost is exorbitant.”

The bullet train network is supposed to begin carrying passengers between the Bay Area and Los Angeles by 2028. Construction was supposed to have begun late last year, but it now appears it will not begin until 2014, assuming a court ruling does not sidetrack it. A Sacramento County Superior Court judge ruled this summer that the state violated the legal protections imposed by the 2008 voter-approved bond measure that will provide $9 billion in funding. A second ruling, due this fall, would determine how to remedy the violation.

The sampling of 1,500 registered voters conducted in mid-September found significant differences in voter opinion about the project across the state. In Southern California, 56% of respondents said they want the project stopped. Even in the Bay Area, where support has historically been strong with the backing of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, only 51% endorsed the project. The margin of error in the poll was 2.9 percentage points.

Nowhere is the project more controversial than in the Central Valley, where farmers, businessmen and homeowners have formed coalitions to overhaul or derail it. Even though Gov. Jerry Brown touts the benefits to the Central Valley, 59% of voters there want to call it off, according to the poll. Opposition is even stronger in the Northern California counties, where 61% say it should be killed.

“The best thing for Brown is to have one of the lawsuits stop the project until he leaves office,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC.

The poll also asked about a quixotic proposal by high-tech businessman Elon Musk, chief of Space Exploration Technologies and Tesla Motors, for a tube-type transport system, called the Hyperloop, that would move people between L.A. and the Bay Area in 30 minutes at a cost of $20 per trip. Sixty-five percent of the respondents said the proposal was not realistic. Nonetheless, they liked the idea, and 55% said they would take the Hyperloop, compared with only 13% who would opt for the high-speed rail.

This message was sent to the Senate community on behalf of Terrance W. Gainer, Senate Sergeant at Arms.

Door Closures/Long Lines

Senate Community:

Many of you have contacted me about the long lines and trouble getting into our Senate buildings over the past three days. I regret the inconvenience and continue to explore ways to mitigate the delays. However, given the budget constraints all of us are experiencing, I do not expect substantial relief.

The United States Capitol Police (USCP) continues to explore ways to relieve congestion and limit the wait time. However, the police staffing impact and concomitant costs are significant. Remember, if we are able to relieve the pressure in the morning by opening additional doors it requires police officer overtime, and the costs still must be recovered from some USCP service. Figuring out where to relieve the pressure is the hard part. Something has to give.

I respectfully request your assistance: you can make a difference. As you make appointments with visitors or otherwise communicate with the public, please emphasize that the process of entering the building has changed. Remind visitors that there are fewer entrances available, and perhaps recommend to them the appropriate door to use. Most important, and much like our shared experience at airports after 9-11, more time is needed to get into the buildings. The sociologist in me hopes visitors and staff, armed with current information, will adjust patterns and past practices.

We will continue to adjust signs, add signs, and use way finders to help. Your personal communication with expected visitors is critical. Notifying us or the USCP about particular needs, early meetings, large gatherings, committee hearings, and social functions might also ease the pain.

Please be assured that we understand the issue and will work with you as we adjust to a few new realities.

Respectfully, Terry"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/27/should-government-tax-email/,2013-03-27 00:00:00,['Barnini Chakraborty'],Should the government tax your email? One California official thinks so,"Your property is taxed. Your income is taxed. Your investments are taxed.

But ... your email?

A California official is bringing new life to the argument that the Internet -- including emails -- is an untapped revenue resource that should be taxed to help local economies.

Berkeley City Councilman Gordon Wozniak brought up taxing emails during a recent council meeting. He suggested the money collected, which would be part of a wider-reaching Internet tax, could be used in Berkeley's case to save the local post office.

""There should be something like a bit tax,"" he said during the March 5 meeting. ""I mean, a bit tax could be a cent per gigabit and they would make, probably, billions of dollars a year.""

Plus, he said, there should be a ""very tiny tax on email.""

This idea goes beyond already-controversial proposals to tax e-commerce -- like buying used books on Amazon. This would be a tax on data.

Wozniak told FoxNews.com the response to the idea has been varied.

""Most people don't like the idea of taxing the Internet,"" he acknowledged. ""There are a number of people who say it's a good idea, but some are saying it's impractical and there's no way to do it.""

Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, is one of those people.

""It's a terrible idea,"" Edwards told FoxNews.com.

""The government doesn't need any more tax money. That's not the problem. The American government is spending more than ever.""

Plus, he said, a tax like this would hit ""different types of industry in different ways.""

Local governments can't legally impose a tax on the Internet -- but Wozniak's idea is not as new, or perhaps as far-fetched, as it sounds. Amid concerns that the government could one day turn to the Internet for a new-age funding stream, Congress in 1998 passed a law called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans Internet taxation.

That law is set to expire next November. If that happens, Wozniak's proposal could someday turn into a reality -- but the likelihood is slim.

Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Dean Heller have already introduced legislation this year that would indefinitely extend the law prohibiting federal, state and local governments from taxing Internet access.

The idea of a ""bit tax"" is the brainchild of Arthur Cordell, a former information technology adviser for the Canadian government. Cordell proposed the tax during a 1997 lecture at Harvard Law School.

""While there are few kudos for proposing a new tax, the time is ripe to suggest positive and constructive ways of dealing with serious fiscal realities,"" Cordell said at the time. ""The move to a new economy should be matched by consideration of a new tax base. A tax base that is growing. A tax base that is at the heart of a new economy. A tax base that can be easily identified, one where collection is in few hands. A tax that is difficult to avoid.""

He, too, called it a ""bit tax.""

Cordell did not return a request for comment from FoxNews.com. But he did tell a Los Angeles Times columnist this month that he still supports the Internet tax, saying, ""it's needed more than ever as we get rid of brick and mortar stuff. ... eventually it's going to happen.""

The idea seemed to get an endorsement from the LA Times columnist, George Skelton, who suggested such a tax could even cut down on ""spammers and scammers."" Skelton suggested emails that run off the screen be taxed an additional amount, ""just as a bulky letter costs more than a 46-cent stamp.""

Under Cordell's framework, the bit tax would impose a levy on each digital bit of information flowing through global networks. That means people could have to pony up a fee for emails, file transfers, electronic check transactions and more.

And that could be just the beginning.

Cordell said in 1997 that the new revenue could be used for schools, parks and health care, among other services. Critics of this idea, he argued, are interested in trying to ""wrestle the state to the ground."" At the time, he quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., ""who wrote in a decision in 1904 that 'Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.'""

Edwards disagrees.

""Holmes said that during a time when federal taxes were 4 percent of the GDP,"" Edwards said. ""Yes, taxes might have paid for a civilized society then, but that's not where we are now."""
http://www.nbcnews.com/business/more-states-consider-ban-credit-card-surcharges-1C8455523,2013-02-22 13:21:00+00:00,['Herb Weisbaum'],More states consider ban on credit card surcharges,"Charge a fee to use your credit card? It’s legal for merchants to do that, unless barred by state law. Ten states already ban such surcharges – California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas – and more may join the list.

The legislatures in 13 other states are currently considering bills that would prevent these so-called “check out” fees. Lawmakers in Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Tennessee are responding to a rule change that took place late last month. A similar bill will soon be introduced in West Virginia.

Visa and MasterCard agreed to let merchants add a surcharge to credit card transactions as part of the settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by retailers. Until Jan. 27, both Visa and MasterCard had prohibited merchants from charging the customer for the cost of processing that credit card transaction.



The settlement does not affect Visa or MasterCard debit cards. American Express still prohibits a surcharge on any of its cards.

New Jersey Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Secaucus) said he introduced a bill to ban surcharging because it would hit consumers in the pocketbook.

“The amount of the surcharge may seem miniscule on paper, but in the family budget 1.5 to 3 percent could add up to a shorter grocery list or less to spend on gas,” he said in a statement.

In Utah, Sen. Curtis Bramble (R-Provo) is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit surcharges on any type of “financial transaction card” which would include debit cards.

Major retailers are not expected to tack on a credit card surcharge, at least not any time in the immediate future. Wal-Mart, Target, Sears and Home Depot told NBC News they have no plans to add a credit card surcharge. But just the possibility has spurred some lawmakers into action.

“It’s a waste of the legislative process,” said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation. “They could take steps to bring greater competition into the marketplace by prohibiting the price fixing of the hidden swipe fees merchants pay to process credit card transactions.”

Trish Wexler, spokesperson for the Electronic Payments Coalition, whose members include Visa and MasterCard Worldwide, told NBC News it has not taken a position on the issue.

“No one knows how checkout fees will work their way through the system,” Wexler said in an email statement, “but the settlement provides sufficient consumer protections while the process plays out.”

What about disclosures?

The advocacy group Consumer Action has published a booklet on credit card checkout fees. It warns shoppers to be on the lookout for these fees and advises them to express their dissatisfaction.

“Customers shouldn’t stand for it,” said Ruth Susswein Consumer Action’s deputy director of national priorities. “Our advice is to tell them you don’t like the fee and this makes you want to take your business elsewhere.”

The new rules from Visa and MasterCard require retailers who apply a credit card surcharge to post a notice at the store’s entrance. The exact percentage of the surcharge does not need to be disclosed until the point of sale. The customer receipt must list the amount of the surcharge.

Online stores with a surcharge will not be required to have a notice on the home page. They only need to alert shoppers about this when they reach the page where credit cards are first mentioned. In most cases, that means the final step of checkout when the purchase is being completed.

Not the end of this story

The settlement that allows merchants to impose a credit card surcharge is only preliminary. The court has yet to issue its final ruling in this case. That’s expected later this year.

Once that happens, various retailers and business groups plan to challenge the settlement. That could drag into late 2014.

The possibility that the settlement could be modified will probably keep most businesses of any size from instituting credit card fees for the time being.

The decision limited the sweep of a 1789 law that had been used to address human rights abuses abroad.

The decision was unanimous, but the justices divided along ideological lines in their reasoning.

Human rights groups said the decision was a sharp blow.

“This decision so severely limited a law that has for decades been a beacon of hope for victims of gross human rights violations,” said Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First. “This decision cuts a hole into the web of accountability. Human rights abusers may be rejoicing today, but this is a major setback for their victims.”

Business groups said the ruling would help put an end to baseless lawsuits.

But the intransigence of the right wasn’t the only disease troubling America’s body politic in 2012. We were also suffering from fiscal fever: the insistence by virtually the entire political and media establishment that budget deficits were our most important and urgent economic problem, even though the federal government could borrow at incredibly low interest rates. Instead of talking about mass unemployment and soaring inequality, Washington was almost exclusively focused on the alleged need to slash spending (which would worsen the jobs crisis) and hack away at the social safety net (which would worsen inequality).

So the good news is that this fever, unlike the fever of the Tea Party, has finally broken.

True, the fiscal scolds are still out there, and still getting worshipful treatment from some news organizations. As the Columbia Journalism Review recently noted, many reporters retain the habit of “treating deficit-cutting as a non-ideological objective while portraying other points of view as partisan or political.” But the scolds are no longer able to define the bounds of respectable opinion. For example, when the usual suspects recently piled on Senator Elizabeth Warren over her call for an expansion of Social Security, they clearly ended up enhancing her stature.

What changed? I’d suggest that at least four things happened to discredit deficit-cutting ideology.

First, the political premise behind “centrism” — that moderate Republicans would be willing to meet Democrats halfway in a Grand Bargain combining tax hikes and spending cuts — became untenable. There are no moderate Republicans. To the extent that there are debates between the Tea Party and non-Tea Party wings of the G.O.P., they’re about political strategy, not policy substance."
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-seeks-smooth-roughest-cuts-081523452.html,,[],"GOP seeks to smooth roughest cuts, avert shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans controlling the House are moving to take the roughest edges off across-the-board spending cuts that are just starting to take effect.

Even as the military would bear a $43 billion cut over just seven months, the new GOP measure released Monday would give the Pentagon much-needed funding for readiness. It would also ease the pain felt by critical agencies like the FBI and the Border Patrol.

The effort is part of a huge spending measure released Monday that would fund day-to-day federal operations through September — and head off a potential government shutdown later this month.

""Our goal is to cut spending, not to shut the government down,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The measure would leave in place automatic cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 7.8 percent to the Pentagon ordered Friday by President Barack Obama after months of battling with Republicans over the budget. But the House Republicans' legislation would award the Defense Department its detailed 2013 budget while other agencies would be frozen in place at 2012 levels.

The unprecedented across-the-board cuts would then be applied to the day-to-day budgets of every federal agency except Veterans Affairs, which is exempt from them.

The GOP funding measure is set to advance through the House on Thursday in hopes of preventing a government shutdown when a six-month spending bill passed last September runs out March 27. The latest measure blends updated 2013 budget measures for the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments — giving much-sought increases for military operations and maintenance efforts and veterans' health programs — but puts most the rest of the government on autopilot.

Senate Democrats want to add more detailed budgets for domestic Cabinet agencies but it will take GOP help to do so. The House measure also denies money sought by Obama and his Democratic allies to implement the signature 2010 laws overhauling the health care system and financial regulation.

Story continues

After accounting for the across-the-board cuts, domestic agencies would face cuts exceeding 5 percent when compared with last year. But Republicans carved out a host of exemptions seeking to protect especially important functions, such as federal prisons and firefighting efforts in the West, as well as new funding for embassy security and modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The FBI and the Border Patrol would be able to maintain current staffing levels and would not have to furlough employees.

The legislation would provide about $2 billion more than the current level to beef up security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions worldwide. Last September, a terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

A project to repair the iconic Capitol Dome could stay on track and NASA would be protected from the harshest effects of the automatic cuts, known in Washington-speak as a sequester.

The across-the-board cuts would carve $85 billion in spending from the government's $3.6 trillion budget for this year, concentrating the cuts in the approximately $1 trillion allocated to the day-to-day agency operating budgets set by Congress each year. Those so-called discretionary accounts received big boosts in the first two years of Obama's presidency, when Democrats controlled Congress, but have borne the brunt of the cuts approved as Obama and Republicans have grappled over the budget.

Both Democrats and Republicans for months have warned the cuts are draconian and would slow the growth of the economy, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for instance, says they would slow the economy by 0.6 percent and cost about 750,000 jobs."

After all, it was just 99 years ago that Henry Ford offered the workingman $5 a day and profit-sharing. How, in less than a century, did it come to this?

The short answers: municipal mismanagement, race riots, white flight, black flight, dead flight (people routinely disinter their deceased and relocate them to the suburbs). There were the overreaching unions and management that couldn’t balance a ball. Proof? The multibillion-dollar bailout of the auto industry. Thank you, American taxpayers!

Then there is our spectacular civic corruption: A former mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, waits for a bed in federal prison, convicted of extortion, racketeering and bribery. He looted the city of millions of dollars and stole the future of thousands of children. They can send him to hell for all I care. I don’t want to pay for his upkeep. But thank you, taxpayers! You will pay for it. And the ex-mayor’s team of super lawyers will also be paid with the public dime.

So Detroit files for bankruptcy. What does this mean? Pay close attention because it may be coming to you soon, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia. In 2011, Moody’s calculated the unfunded liabilities for Illinois’s three largest state-run pension plans to be $133 billion. (It is expected to be even larger this year.) That’s the size of six Detroit bankruptcies — give or take a few hundred million.

Of Detroit’s debt of at least $18 billion, about $7 billion is secured by collateral like casino revenues and utility taxes. That means creditors — read: big banks — will get paid. Of the remaining $11 billion dollars or so in unsecured debt, about $9 billion is owed to retirees and current municipal workers, people like firefighters and police officers. These debts come in the form of promised pension checks and health care benefits, all backed by a false, unsecured promise. These are the people who are likely to lose out.

In simple math, do we sacrifice 30,000 former and current workers to save a city of 700,000 people and their progeny? Most Detroiters will tell you yes. Don’t judge. We feel bad about it. But we’re simply Americans. We are a gaunt dog. We are desperate. And you are watching and studying us.

Pension checks will be much smaller than planned and health care benefits will get foisted off on Medicaid and Obamacare. Thanks again, taxpayers!"

Fletcher', 'May', 'Michael A. Fletcher Is A Senior Writer For Espn.']","In North Carolina, unimpeded GOP drives state hard to the right","Backed by throngs of chanting supporters, dozens of liberal demonstrators are subjecting themselves to arrest each Monday at the state legislature here to protest a flurry of bills that could transform North Carolina into a model of conservative governance.

The state’s hard turn to the right comes less than five years after people took to the streets here to celebrate the 2008 victory of Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The win prompted Obama’s supporters to crow about the growing influence of progressive and minority voters not only in North Carolina but across the South.

But that euphoria is now a distant memory. Since the recession hit, North Carolina has been saddled with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates. The bad times helped prepare the way for a carefully executed strategy, with big financial support from a major conservative activist, that helped the GOP win control of both chambers of the state General Assembly in 2010.

Those victories were capped last year when Republican Pat McCrory was elected governor, giving the party control of all levers of state government for the first time since 1870.

The victories were aided by the strong financial support of Art Pope, a multimillionaire who spent heavily in support of the state’s GOP candidates. The Institute for Southern Studies, a North Carolina-based research organization, said Pope’s advocacy network spent $2.2 million on 22 legislative races, winning 18. Overall, conservative organizations largely supported by Pope accounted for three-fourths of the outside money spent in North Carolina legislative races in 2010, according to the institute.

One of McCrory’s first acts after being elected governor was to install Pope, a former legislator, as the state budget chief. (The governor’s office declined to make Pope available for an interview.) And now, GOP lawmakers are moving swiftly to enact a long list of legislation they say is largely aimed at limiting government debt and snapping the state’s economy out of a years-long malaise.

Legislators have slashed jobless benefits. They have also repealed a tax credit that supplemented the wages of low-income people, while moving to eliminate the estate tax. They have voted against expanding Medicaid to comply with the 2010 federal health-care law. The expansion would have added 500,000 poor North Carolinians to the Medicaid rolls.

“Before considering Medicaid expansion, we must reform the current system to make sure people currently enrolled receive the services they need and more taxpayer dollars are not put at risk,” McCrory said in a written statement after signing a bill blocking the expansion.

Lawmakers are also considering proposals to reduce and flatten income tax rates while expanding the sales tax, perhaps to even include groceries and prescription drugs — which some advocates see as a first step toward eliminating the state income tax.

“North Carolina is a high-income-tax state, and we’re suffering the consequences,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R). “Our unemployment rate is the fifth worst in the country, and our high tax rates are hindering economic growth and pushing jobs to our neighbors.”

There are also measures pending to require drug testing for low-income people applying for job training and welfare benefits.

Other GOP-controlled legislatures have passed or considered similar measures in the wake of the recession. Florida, Missouri and Michigan are among the states that have slashed jobless benefits. Texas, Louisiana and Wisconsin are among at least 15 states not participating in the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act. And West Virginia, Kansas and Texas are among the states where legislators have proposed bills requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.

The North Carolina House has passed a law requiring voters to have a government-issued identification card, and legislators are considering bills to roll back the state’s law allowing same-day voter registration and to sharply limit early voting — measures that supporters of the current law say were integral to the high turnout of minority voters in the past several elections.

“I don’t know that there is a state that has as many regressive policies on tap,” said Penda Hair, co-director of Advancement Project, a Washington-based civil rights group that is considering a lawsuit challenging changes to the state’s voting laws.

Liberals may be up in arms, but North Carolina conservatives are applauding the new direction of the General Assembly. After the state Senate unveiled its tax reform plan this month, the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity released a poll that it said showed widespread support across the state. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the state tax code is in need of reform, and nearly half backed moving to totally eliminate the personal income tax within four years.

“The poll results show a clear desire for bold tax relief and reform that gets North Carolina back in the game for jobs and business,” said Dallas Woodhouse, state director of Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina.

The legislative effort has mobilized liberals who see North Carolina as a laboratory for conservative ideas propelled nationwide by the money of a handful of key patrons. They note that many of the initiatives being pursued by legislators here have long been championed by a network of conservative organizations supported by Pope and billionaire activists Charles and David Koch, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

“Most of the laws that take us backwards do not come out of Congress but out of state legislatures,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. “Conservative forces here have gone all out to implement these policies and to lock in their power by changing the voting laws.”

In an effort that resurrects some of the tactics of the civil rights movement, Barber has led a growing, multiracial campaign of civil disobedience intended to draw attention to the changes being pursued by legislators.

This past week, more than 600 demonstrators, some waving placards and singing freedom songs, gathered outside the North Carolina Legislative Building for the fourth “Moral Mondays” protest.

With the crowd behind them, 57 protesters walked inside the building and stood in front of the large brass doors leading to the Senate chamber. The demonstrators — pastors, students, college professors and senior citizens among them — were arrested and led away in plastic handcuffs. They joined a group of more than 100 North Carolina residents who had been arrested and jailed in three previous protests.

“This leadership wants to make our state a place of deeper stratification and inequality,” Barber said.

In the coming weeks, Barber plans to move the protests from the doorstep of the legislature to the home districts of the lawmakers through a series of 25 town meetings.

But, as it stands, there is very little opponents can do to alter the will of the governing majority — something many of the protesters acknowledge.

“My hope is two-pronged,” said Derick Smith, an instructor at North Carolina A&T University who was arrested several weeks ago during a protest. “You want to bring attention to what’s happening. And you’ve got to hope that the governor will listen and back away from some of the more divisive provisions.”"

That is in part because the federal minimum wage is too low.

Currently, an individual with a full-time job at the minimum wage and a family of three to support will fall below the federal poverty line. These workers, despite putting in regular hours, are struggling to provide basic necessities for themselves and their families. By allowing the minimum wage to remain at a nearly unlivable level, we have deemed certain jobs not worthy enough to meet even our country’s minimum standard of living.

How have we been able to keep wages so low without significant social discord? By using tax revenue and a complicated government bureaucracy to subsidize low-wage employers and supplement minimum-wage salaries. Rather than firms paying a worker’s true cost and customers paying an appropriate price for the services provided by those firms, the government provides workers with “income transfers” to help them meet basic needs. These include such programs as the earned income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid.

These government supports mask a job’s true value and set an artificially low wage. They also represent the height of inefficiency. Raising the minimum wage means that the income required for basic needs is delivered in a one-step approach, via the paycheck directly from firm to worker, rather than requiring additional government expenditures.

Beyond efficiency, there is also the matter of human dignity. Think about it: After a long day on the clock, you come home knowing that despite your hard work, you can’t feed your family, cover their medical insurance or pay your rent without government support. What message does that send about the dignity of your work and the pride of taking personal responsibility for your family? Low wages push workers into shadow labor markets where they get paid under the table, avoid reporting income and evade tax responsibilities. Artificially low wages teach workers that their work is not valuable — a disastrous policy outcome.

In his State of the Union speech, President Obama called for raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. That would be a start toward restoring dignity and value to low-wage work. But it isn’t enough. We propose raising the minimum wage, in stages, to $12.50 an hour, an amount that would allow an individual supporting a family of three to live modestly, at about 138% of the federal poverty line. That level offers workers a way to escape poverty, a chance to feed their families, buy basic medical insurance and live in secure housing without significant government support.

The most common objection to raising the minimum wage is that it destroys jobs. But a slew of recent studies have pointed out that although raising the minimum wage does increase earnings and reduce poverty, it has a limited, almost negligible, effect on employment. Studies have also illustrated that restoring the dignity of work through higher wages reduces worker turnover and increases productivity.

Some make the overstated claim that increasing the minimum wage would accelerate companies’ off-shoring of jobs. But most low-wage jobs today are geographically fixed, or as economists call them, “non-tradable.” A janitor or home-care worker’s job, for example, can’t be outsourced to China.

Advertisement

What is sometimes understated is the likelihood of low-wage jobs being automated, a real and growing threat. But if a small growth in the minimum wage is enough to move an industry to automation, it is likely that automation was coming in short order anyway. Technological progress is inevitable and further automation unavoidable. If raising the minimum wage leads to productivity gains through investment in automation, so be it. In the meantime, we need to reward American workers for their efforts.

Some argue that raising the minimum wage offers benefits to those who may not need them. This argument is also flawed. The Economic Policy Institute’s latest analysis shows that most low-wage workers live in low-wage households, and 84% of the workers in low-wage jobs are at least 20 years old. But, regardless of age or need, anyone who shows up to work and puts in hard hours deserves a wage that keeps him or her out of poverty.

Finally, critics of raising the minimum wage often suggest raising the earned income tax credit instead. But that would simply perpetuate the cycle of devaluing work. It also takes money out of the pockets of taxpayers rather than from the businesses that benefit from the credit, creating, in effect, a federal subsidy for low-wage employers. A higher minimum wage would help ensure that the earned income tax credit works more effectively and efficiently.

Raising the minimum wage is about reducing inequality, but it is also about restoring the true value of work. Every American’s hard work should be rewarded.

http://news.yahoo.com/no-compromise-government-brink-shutdown-204618543--finance.html,,[],No compromise: Government on brink of a shutdown?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Moving closer to the brink of a government shutdown, House Republicans vowed Thursday they won't simply accept the stopgap legislation that is likely to remain after Senate Democrats strip away a plan to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law.

A sense of confusion settled over the House, both over how to avoid a shutdown and how to handle even more important legislation to increase the government's borrowing ability to avert a default on U.S. obligations. Short of votes, House leaders shelved a vote that had been expected this weekend on the debt limit measure and gave frustrated GOP lawmakers few clues about what they plan to do to avoid a shutdown.

The chaos sets the stage for weekend drama on Capitol Hill, with the Senate planning to send the fractious House a straightforward bill Friday to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 rather than partly closing down at midnight Monday.

Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and several rank-and-file Republicans said the House simply won't accept a ""clean"" spending measure, even though that's been the norm in Congress on dozens of occasions since the 1995-96 government closures that bruised Republicans and strengthened the hand of Democratic President Bill Clinton.

""I don't see that happening,"" Boehner said. Still, he declared that ""I have no interest in a government shutdown"" and he doesn't expect one to occur on Tuesday.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the Democratic-led chamber will not relent.

""The Senate will never pass a bill that guts the Affordable Care Act,"" Reid declared.

A partial government shutdown would keep hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job, close national parks and generate damaging headlines for whichever side the public held responsible.

Washington faces two deadlines: The Oct. 1 start of the new budget year and a mid-October date — now estimated for the 17th — when the government can no longer borrow money to pay its bills on time and in full.

Story continues

The first deadline requires Congress to pass a spending bill to allow agencies to stay open. The mid-month deadline requires Congress to increase the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap to avoid a first-ever default on its payments, which include interest obligations, Social Security benefits, payments to thousands of contractors large and small, and salaries for the military.

The standoff just four days before the end of the fiscal year increased the possibility of a shutdown, with no signs of compromise.

The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that because of the time it takes the Senate to approve even non-controversial bills, if the House amends a Senate-passed spending bill and returns it to the Senate over the weekend, ""That is a concession on their part that we're going to shut down the government.""

Not far from the Capitol, at a community college in Largo, Md., Obama insisted he would not negotiate over his signature domestic achievement, either on a bill to keep the government operating or legislation to raise the nation's borrowing authority.

""The entire world looks to us to make sure that the world economy is stable. You don't mess with that,"" Obama said of the debt ceiling/default measure. ""And that's why I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America.""

Responding to Obama's non-negotiable stand, Boehner said, ""Well, I'm sorry but it just doesn't work that way.""

Meeting behind closed doors, House Republican leaders encountered resistance from their rank and file over the debt limit measure even though they were attaching a list of other Republican favorites such as green-lighting the Keystone XL oil pipeline, blocking federal regulation of greenhouse gases and boosting offshore oil exploration.

Republicans who lost the presidential election and a shot at Senate control last year are trying to use must-pass measures to advance agenda items that the Democratic-led Senate and Obama have soundly rejected. The last-ditch effort on ""Obamacare"" comes just days before coast-to-coast enrollment in the plan's health care exchanges begins Oct. 1.

Despite the popular items, the leadership was struggling to win over its recalcitrant GOP members, especially tea party-backed lawmakers pressing for deeper, deficit-cutting spending measures. The spending cuts the Republicans would attach to the debt-limit legislation would be likely to represent a small fraction of the almost $1 trillion in new borrowing authority the bill would permit.

""Among conservatives, there's a lot of angst about that,"" said Rep. John Fleming, R-La.

Proposed changes include requiring federal workers to contribute more to their pensions, along with other items from a failed 2011 deficit-cutting effort.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, insisted that the House accept the Senate bill.

""Republicans have got to put an end to the tea party temper tantrums and pass our bill without any gimmicks and without any games,"" she said.

In the Senate, top Democrat Reid sought to schedule a series of votes Thursday night to speed the short-term spending bill to the House. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, blocked the effort, however, saying they wanted the vote on Friday.

Cruz gave a 21 hour-plus speech earlier this week opposing the measure if it is changed to remove the anti-Obamacare provisions. Reid's request sparked a remarkable exchange between Cruz and Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who accused the tea party duo of being publicity hounds who want a Friday vote because that's what they've told outside activists to expect.

""My two colleagues, who I respect, have sent out emails around the world and turned this into a show,"" Corker said, his voice dripping with derision. ""And that is taking priority over getting legislation back to the House so they can take action before the country's government shuts down.""

http://news.yahoo.com/senator-irs-pay-70m-employee-081309135.html,,[],Senator: IRS to pay $70M in employee bonuses,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is about to pay $70 million in employee bonuses despite an Obama administration directive to cancel discretionary bonuses because of automatic spending cuts enacted this year, according to a GOP senator.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says his office has learned that the IRS is executing an agreement with the employees' union on Wednesday to pay the bonuses. Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

""The IRS always claims to be short on resources,"" Grassley said. ""But it appears to have $70 million for union bonuses. And it appears to be making an extra effort to give the bonuses despite opportunities to renegotiate with the union and federal instruction to cease discretionary bonuses during sequestration.""

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

The IRS has been under fire since last month, when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. A few weeks later, the agency's inspector general issued a report documenting lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Story continues

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

The spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizeable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

The agreement eliminates the threat of another government shutdown

Conservatives are already lining up in opposition

WASHINGTON — Budget negotiators announced Tuesday a bipartisan deal to set spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replace unpopular spending cuts with other savings.

House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., led the negotiations that had intensified in recent days as a Dec. 13 deadline approaches.

In a joint appearance Tuesday evening in the U.S. Capitol, Ryan and Murray said the agreement would stop the government ""lurching from crisis to crisis"" and eliminate the threat of another government shutdown. The current stopgap funding measure is scheduled to run out again Jan. 15.

President Obama praised the deal as ""a good first step"" and said he would sign it if it reaches his desk.

If approved, the agreement would put the congressional budget process back on track, allowing for passage of the 12 annual bills that cover federal spending other than mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Ryan noted that it is the first bipartisan budget agreement to come out of a divided Congress since 1986. ""This isn't easy,"" he said.

The budget framework sets top-line spending figures for the next two fiscal years and partially replaces for two years the sequester — the across-the-board spending cuts triggered earlier this year following prior failures to reach a budget agreement –– with other cuts and non-tax revenues.

For fiscal year 2014, overall federal spending will be $1.012 trillion and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. The agreement replaces $63 billion in sequester cuts with a combination of other savings, and includes an additional $22.5 billion in deficit reduction.

There is already growing opposition from influential outside conservative groups, and it is unclear how many Republicans would vote for it despite Ryan's endorsement. ""As a conservative, I think this is a step in the right direction,"" Ryan said, ""I think conservatives should vote for it."" Ryan will brief rank-and-file Republicans on Wednesday morning.

Fiscal conservatives have voiced reservations about a spending level higher than $967 billion, which is the level set by the sequester cuts.

""It's disingenuous for Republicans to surrender the only real spending reforms accomplished under the Obama administration, and call that a deal,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks. The group opposes the deal and is urging lawmakers to vote against it.

Senior Republican lawmakers including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, also expressed reservations Tuesday to any deal that increases spending levels. ""My initial reaction is 'no,' "" Hatch said.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., immediately announced his opposition Tuesday evening. ""(The American people) deserve better than this,"" he said in a statement.

House Democrats unsuccessfully sought to use the negotiations as a vehicle to secure an extension of unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the month. Benefits affecting 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers are set to expire if Congress doesn't act, and the budget deal could be the only vehicle headed to President Obama's desk before the House of Representatives adjourns until the new year on Friday. The Senate is scheduled to be in session next week.

Ryan and Murray said unemployment benefits were not part of their deal, and would need to be settled separately.

Democrats were also likely to lose support within their party because the agreement cuts the federal employee pension system and includes no new tax revenues.

""This plan won't create jobs, get the economy back on track, or meaningfully cut the deficit,"" tweeted Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.

The agreement comes at the end of what has been the most unproductive legislative year in Congress on record, and at a time when congressional approval ratings continue to hover at historic lows.

The agreement is a sign that Congress can still function, negotiators said.

""This bill doesn't solve all of our problems, but I think it's an important step in helping to heal some of the wounds here in Congress, to rebuild some trust, and show that we can do something without a crisis right around the corner and demonstrate the value in making the government work for the people we represent,"" Murray said.

The bipartisan conference committee established by last week’s 11th-hour agreement to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling probably won’t produce a truly groundbreaking bipartisan deal that would end the nation's debt problem once and for all, nor are the members aiming that high.

At best, the budget resolution that comes out of the committee may serve as a ""down payment"" on that debt and provide Congress an opportunity to fulfill its most basic function of setting spending levels so the appropriations committees can fund the government.

In other words, it is likely to be literally the least lawmakers could do — which would be quite an achievement for this unpopular, do-nothing Congress.

As part of the agreement to temporarily keep the government open, the House and Senate have appointed 29 lawmakers to a conference committee tasked with reconciling the House and Senate budget proposals that passed earlier this year. The panel's leaders, Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, who each chair the Budget Committees in their respective chamber, must report back to Congress by Dec. 13 with the final version of the budget.

When the new conference committee members held their first meeting last Thursday, both sides kept expectations low.

“Chairman Ryan knows I’m not going to vote for his budget. I know that he’s not going to vote for mine,” Murray said at the Thursday meeting. “We’re going to find the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on. That’s our goal.”

“Our job,” she added, “is to make sure that we have put forward a spending cap and a budget path for this Congress in the next year or two, or further if we can.”

That common ground, as one aide close to Ryan described it to Yahoo News, would amount to little more than “small things.”

At the end of these formal negotiations, Republicans want modest changes made to the nation’s entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare — the primary drivers of U.S. debt — which they say are necessary to keep those programs sustainable for future generations. Democrats want sequestration eliminated, or at least reformed to give federal agencies more flexibility to find savings.

Story continues

And yes, there is some common ground on this.

Unlike in years past, this time Ryan won’t insist that Democrats hand over the holy grail of Republican entitlement reform: a controversial plan to transform Medicare into a system that provides vouchers for seniors to buy health care in a private market. (Sound familiar?) Instead, as Yahoo News reported earlier this month, Ryan intends to seek more realistic tweaks to entitlement programs that Democrats, including Obama, already have proposed.

Ryan outlined some of his ideas in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. Although he wrote the piece in the context of the ongoing debt-limit debate at the time, aides close to Ryan say it revealed how he plans to approach the budget conference.

“We could ask the better off to pay higher premiums for Medicare. We could reform Medigap plans to encourage efficiency and reduce costs. And we could ask federal employees to contribute more to their own retirement,” Ryan wrote. “Rep. Dave Camp (R., Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) have been working for more than a year now on a bipartisan plan to reform the tax code. They agree on the fundamental principles: Broaden the base, lower the rates and simplify the code. The president himself has argued for just such an approach to corporate taxes. So we should discuss how Congress can take up the Camp–Baucus plan when it's ready.”

As part of the deal, Republicans appear willing to loosen up the tight reins of sequestration, which is their strongest piece of leverage.



“The sequester offers that nice opportunity” to make structural changes to entitlement spending, a Ryan aide told Yahoo News. “In [Ryan's] mind, it's how he can do everything in his power to forge a good down payment on this debt. If you're just cutting government agency spending, you can't get much, but if you go into entitlement programs, that’s where the bigger structural problems are.”

The opportunity is indeed a long time coming. This year marks the first time both the House and Senate have passed budget resolutions since 2009.



Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, both chambers are supposed to pass their own resolution that sets spending levels, and then each side appoints members of a conference committee to negotiate their differences. The resolutions are not technically law — the president, who submits his own budget annually, never “signs” a “budget” — but they serve to reveal priorities, force Congress to regularly re-examine its spending and set spending levels for appropriators. For most of President Barack Obama’s time in office — and during three years under former President George W. Bush — Congress has instead funded the government through a series of stopgap bills that set the spending levels for short periods of time

The government currently operates based on spending levels set by the Budget Control Act of 2011, the law that ushered in sequestration, which indiscriminately cut billions across most of the federal government. Democrats hate sequestration outright, and despite the many Republicans who give sequestration lip service because it reined in spending, plenty of them can’t stand the defense cuts.

In March, the Republican-majority House passed its version of a budget resolution, which cut enough spending to balance the federal budget in a decade. The Senate responded two days later with its own resolution (after Republicans threatened to withhold lawmakers’ pay if they didn’t.)

But then seven months passed and nothing happened. Senate Democrats called repeatedly for a budget conference, but Republicans resisted, saying that there was too much disagreement between the parties for formal negotiations to begin. Democrats, who had spent the past four years getting hammered by Republicans because they hadn’t passed a budget resolution of their own, were furious. Finally, last week, as the nation neared its borrowing limit, Republicans agreed to talk.

Striking a deal this year would help the government avoid yet another bout of brinkmanship over a shutdown when the latest round of short-term government funding runs out in January.

But here’s where the hope for a final resolution could fall apart: Traditionally, Congress only really acts when it must. Like schoolchildren and journalists, politicians need deadlines, and severe consequences for not meeting them. (Think back to the ominous-sounding “fiscal cliff,” “government shutdown,” and “Taxmageddon.”)

In this case, there are no hard deadlines for the budget committee.

Yes, the agreement hashed out last week asks the panel to report back to Congress in December, and if they fail, perhaps they’ll find coal in their stockings from Santa Claus at Christmas. Hopefully, the potential for an agreement is more than just a figment of our imagination."

More from the Associated Press:

WASHINGTON — U.S. employers added 195,000 jobs in June and hiring was more robust in the two previous months than earlier estimated. The gains raise hopes for a stronger economy in the second half of 2013.

The Labor Department said Friday that the economy also added 20,000 more jobs in May and 50,000 more in April than initially reported. The unemployment rate stayed at 7.6 percent, but for a good reason: More people started looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are searching for jobs.

Americans' paychecks rose at a healthy pace and have outpaced inflation in the past year. Average hourly pay increased 10 cents to $24.01. That's 2.2 percent higher than a year ago. Over the 12 months ending in May, consumer prices rose 1.4 percent.

Stock index futures rose shortly after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped from 2.56 percent to 2.65 percent, a sign that investors think the economy is improving.

The economy has added an average of 202,000 jobs a month for the past six months, up from 180,000 in the previous six. Hiring and consumer confidence have increase despite higher taxes and federal spending cuts.

Further job growth could lower the unemployment rate and help the economy rebound after a weak start this year. If growth accelerated and unemployment fell, the Federal Reserve might start to scale back its bond purchases before the year ends. The bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates low.

Despite the solid pace of hiring, the economy is growing sluggishly. It expanded at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter. Most analysts expect growth at roughly the same subpar rate in the April-June quarter.

Weak economies overseas cut demand for U.S. exports in May. That led some economists to predict that growth in the second quarter might be slower than forecast. Still, many areas of the economy are improving.

The Fed's low interest-rate policies have encouraged more Americans to buy homes and cars. They've also helped boost stock and home prices in the first half of the year, increasing wealth and lifting consumers' confidence to its highest level in 5 1/2 years.

Auto sales in the January-June period topped 7.8 million, their best first half since 2007, according to Autodata Corp. and Ward's AutoInfoBank. Sales of previously occupied homes exceeded 5 million in May, the first time that's happened since November 2009. New-home sales rose at their fastest pace in five years.

Though fewer exports have hurt manufacturing, factories did field more orders in May. And a measure of business investment rose for the third straight month.

A stronger second half fueled by continued job gains might be enough for the Fed to begin tapering its stimulus. Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that the Fed would slow its bond purchases later this year and end them next year if the economy continued to strengthen.

But Bernanke added that if the economy weakens, the Fed could delay its pullback or even step up its bond purchases again. Several Fed members have since tried to clarify Bernanke's remarks by saying any tapering of the bond purchases would depend on the strength of the economy."

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

Monday night's bicameral back and forth between the House GOP and the Senate ended in the way everyone saw coming: a shutdown of the federal government, owing to the House Republicans' refusal to simply send the Senate the ""clean"" continuing resolution that everyone knew would have ended the futile contretemps right then and there. As that didn't happen, reporters instead got to watch House Republicans smack a tennis ball into a brick wall, over and over again until everyone just hung it up for the night.

But there was a brief moment where everything threatened to actually get interesting.

I speak, of course, of Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who is what passes for a ""moderate"" House Republican in this day and age. Days ago, King criticized the legislative meanderings of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and called Cruz a ""fraud,"" which ensured that King's office would spend the rest of the day fielding calls from Cruz's fanbase. Their comments featured ""vile, profane, obscene language,"" the likes of which King had never heard, and we remind you that he represents part of Long Island.

As a result, King went on ""Morning Joe"" and told their Zoo Crew, “I’m not saying Ted Cruz is responsible for all his supporters, but he has tapped into a dark strain here in the American political psyche here, and again, the most obscene, profane stuff you can imagine all from people who say they support the Constitution.""

So King was primed to be one of those ""mad as hell/not gonna take it anymore"" types as Monday's deliberations began, and as the sun set in the west, it looked for all the world like he was going to finally foment a revolt. As the National Review's Jonathan Strong reported Monday evening, ""Republican moderates have apparently had enough."" King wanted a ""clean"" continuing resolution, and he was going to damn well keep the rest of the GOP caucus from adding rules to the bill by leading a gang of moderate Republicans into the breach:

In what is by far their boldest stand since the GOP took control of the House in 2010, a group of them are threatening to bring down a vote on the rule for the government-funding bill scheduled for 6:30 p.m. New York representative Peter King is leading the charge, and his fellow New Yorker [Representative] Michael Grimm is close behind him. The group told leadership on Saturday they have 25 members who are willing to bring down the rule.

This was a significant rump, taking this ""boldest stand.""

As Politico reported, ""If no Democrats vote for the rule, [Speaker of the House John] Boehner can only lose 17 Republicans to sink the plan."" And so, the battle was joined, and as night fell across the District of Columbia, everyone who wanted the insanity to end turned their hopeful eyes to the vote count in the House. Would King bring 25 votes against dirtying up the continuing resolution?

As it turns out, King overestimated the number in his band of brothers by... you know, about 23 people:

The size of a bloc of GOP moderates ready to bring down a vote on the House floor over the government-funding bill shriveled from 25 lawmakers on Saturday to just two when the House voted just now to pass the rule. New York representative Peter King and Pennsylvania representative Charlie Dent, two key moderates, voted no, while four hardline conservatives, including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, voted no because the bill didn’t draw a hard enough line against Obamacare.

Well done, lads. Ha, ha, remember that whole ""fellow New Yorker Michael Grimm is close behind him"" part? That was really neat.

There's not a whole lot to say about a plan that nobody should have believed was going to come to fruition anyway. But it's worth pointing out that when the political media holds forth on the ideological landscape of Congress, and games out what they believe is possible in terms of bargains and compromises, just about everything in their conceptual framework is premised on the notion that a lot of moderate Republicans exist, and that the resting state of Capitol Hill is ""center-right.""

As it turns out, all of those premises are wrong. There aren't a lot of ""moderate Republicans"" in Congress. And those who exist are very timid and nearly useless when the chips are down. The government is shut down right now, but the notion that ""moderate Republicans"" were capable of steering a debate somewhere sensible went by the boards a long time ago.

Previously', 'He Was Policy Editor', 'Where He Had Primary Responsibility For Wonkblog']",Spending cuts represent moment of truth for tea party,"Since the day they were swept to power more than two years ago, the tea party’s legions in Washington have made dramatic federal spending cuts the centerpiece of an economic message that has dominated the national debate.

Now they’re about to get what they want.

Deep reductions in domestic and defense spending are set to begin Friday in a process known as sequestration, which will make progress toward the tea party’s goal of shrinking the government. What unfolds over the following months will be a high-stakes test of whether significant cuts in spending will help or hurt the economy — and the Republican Party’s brand.

The cuts, worth $1.2 trillion over 10 years, are slated to become reality after a period when the tea party — a movement, represented by a group of Republicans elected in 2010, whose goal is to radically cut the government — has struggled to have a lasting impact on Washington. The tea party saw President Obama win reelection and enact more than $600 billion in tax increases on the wealthy, while GOP leaders agreed to allow more federal borrowing without anything in return.

But many Republicans say the sequester is the moment when the tea party can claim it has made its mark. Although Democratic and Republican leaders are pointing fingers, the tea party and its allies are happily accepting credit for the cuts.

You’ve heard politicians mention the word “sequester” a lot lately. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe explains what the term means and why it matters. (The Washington Post)

“This will be the first significant tea party victory in that we got what we set out to do in changing Washington,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), a tea party Republican elected in 2010.

Rep. Reid J. Ribble (R-Wis.), a conservative elected in 2010 who doesn’t consider himself a member of the tea party, said the movement “was significant in getting the American people’s attention on this problem. You have to give them credit.”

‘Can’t be both bad and good’

The sequester, which will begin slowly but build over time, has put Republican leaders in a difficult corner. They say they oppose the cuts to defense spending and see little wisdom in indiscriminate, across-the-board reductions elsewhere.

But they also say they agree with the magnitude of the budget reductions — and in fact want to eventually go much further, reducing discretionary spending and entitlement programs.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) recently advocated an approach that has been a hallmark of the tea party: reduce federal spending so the budget is balanced in 10 years, without any increase in taxes.

To do that, experts say, such cuts would need to generate $4 trillion to $5 trillion in savings over a decade — more than three times the $1.2 trillion under sequestration.

Huelskamp, who voted against the original bill authorizing the sequester because he wanted even more cuts, said he expects Boehner and other Republican leaders to come through but is nervous about recent statements suggesting that they might be looking for alternatives.

“They promised the sequester would happen,” said Huelskamp, who voted against Boehner for speaker this year. “For them to go back on their word certainly threatens their ability to lead.”

Some Republicans say it’s risky for GOP lawmakers to celebrate deep spending cuts while warning of their potentially negative consequences.

“It’s going to be difficult for the Republicans as a party in this,” said Tony Fratto, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. “They said the sequester is bad. You can’t say that and then say it’s a good thing, a step in the right direction. It can’t be both bad and good.”

But Barney Keller, communications director for the conservative Club for Growth, said Republicans who don’t support big budget cuts might face primary challenges next year.

“Many Republicans aren’t afraid of losing their job to a Democrat, because of redistricting” that virtually guarantees that GOP lawmakers will hold on to their seats, he said. “But they are afraid of losing their jobs to more fiscally conservative candidates.”

The effects of spending

Conventional economic theory holds that significant cuts in government spending harm the economy. Tea party Republicans, however, argue that reducing federal spending and borrowing will help minimize distortions in the economy and keep the government from crowding out private-sector growth. Quickly slowing the rise of the national debt, austerity advocates say, will raise the confidence of businesses and consumers in the nation’s long-term economic stability.

More traditional economic analysts agree that reducing budget deficits is a good goal, but they don’t think it should happen in any significant way during times of economic weakness. They tend to argue that government spending has a positive role in supporting the economy, and they note that Europe has struggled under austerity measures.

The tea party had an immediate influence on budget politics after its rise to power in 2010. Washington shifted to a debate about the size of government, and plans advanced by leading Republicans, especially Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), sought deep cuts in spending.

The push to slash the budget led to several battles with the White House, which would agree to cuts that were only a small fraction of what tea party members and other conservatives demanded. Many of the reductions did little to actually slow government spending.

“Up until now, this has been a clever game played on an imaginary budget,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist. “It hasn’t been real.”

Tea party members say the failure to do more hurt the GOP in last year’s election, which gave Obama a second term and Democrats gains in the House and the Senate.

“Part of that was rank-and-file Republicans were upset that we hadn’t followed through on what we had promised,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (Tex.). “I think leadership sees that.”

No deal likely this time

The sequester was made law in the summer of 2011, after a fight over whether to raise the federal debt ceiling. Republicans would allow more borrowing only in exchange for spending cuts; the White House wanted any further discussion about the debt limit to be postponed until after the election.

The deal between the White House and Congress had authorized the sequester to begin Jan. 1, 2013, if lawmakers couldn’t find other ways to reduce the budget deficit. They didn’t, but the two sides agreed to postpone the sequester for two months in the “fiscal cliff” tax deal at the beginning of this year. Now, it doesn’t appear likely that another deal will be at hand before cuts begin Friday.

Kevin Smith, Boehner’s communications director, laid the blame for the sequester on the White House. He noted that the House last year passed bills to replace the sequester with alternative spending cuts.

“The White House is on defense because it doesn’t have a plan,” Smith said. “The president hasn’t lifted a finger to urge his allies in the Senate to pass a solution of their own.”

White House officials say they have an offer on the table to replace the sequester with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, and they note that they back a Senate plan to postpone the sequester through the rest of the year.

Rep. Renee L. Ellmers (N.C.), who is part of the 2010 class of Republicans but not a member of the tea party caucus, said she worries about the sequester, especially since her district, home to Fort Bragg, would be hit hard. But she said it may have to happen.

“I do believe it will start a very important process that will help our economy to start to grow,” she said. “The debt that we have at the federal level is our biggest threat for our country.”"

Updated x1,"From Stanford University's Hoover Institution Policy Review, an article by Tod Lindberg titled, Left 3.0 - Obama and the Emergence of a Newer Left:



...

Obama staked his legacy on patching the largest remaining hole in the New Deal social welfare safety net. Guaranteed lifelong access to affordable health care has been at the top of the Left’s policy agenda since fdr. Bill Clinton tried, failed, gave up for good. Obama would not give up. Despite an economy that continued to sputter contrary to his own expectations and those of his advisors, despite public opinion polls that early turned against the reform effort, despite ominous electoral signals, and despite having to abandon the Left’s cherished “public option,” he persisted. And he prevailed. It was a political risk on the order of the one Ronald Reagan took in cooperating with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s successful effort to wring inflation out of the economy in 1981–82 at the cost of a brutal recession. Obama lost Democrats their House majority in doing so. Not that they thought it would happen, but in the view of many on the Left, health care reform on the scale Obama was able to achieve, though imperfect, would be worth losing a House majority. The remainder of Obama’s first term would be a domestic policy desert if not worse, entailing various capitulations to the gop, at least in the eyes of many on the Left at the time. But he had his signature achievement, subject to validation by the Supreme Court and the ability to sustain enough Democratic political power in Washington to prevent its repeal.

...

The new media environment has been very favorable to Left 3.0. Vibrant websites abound, some of them extraordinarily influential: The “netroots” have been a formidable force. The sorting of the political parties into left and right has an analogue in the sorting of the consumption of political opinion. It has never been easier to avoid encountering opinions with which one might disagree. The effect of this on the Left side of the political spectrum has helped promote the solidarity of Left 3.0 and the Democratic Party: The victors in the internal political debate were those advocating for “the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”"

Washington (CNN) - Most Americans say the government shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems for the country, according to a new national poll.

And while a CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that slightly more people are angry at Republicans than Democrats or President Barack Obama for the shutdown, it is clear that both sides are taking a hit.



The poll, conducted over the weekend, was released on Monday, nearly one week into the partial shutdown over a push by tea party backed GOP lawmakers trying to dismantle or defund Obama's signature health care reform law.

According to the poll, 63% of those questioned say they are angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown.

""But the Democrats are not getting off scot-free. Fifty-seven percent of Americans are also angry at the way the Democrats are dealing with the shutdown. And a 53% majority say they are also angry at President Obama,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown.""

The CNN poll results are similar to those from a new Pew Research Center poll also released Monday and surveys from Gallup and CBS News/New York Times surveys conducted last week, which indicate slightly more people blaming - or angry at - Republicans than Democrats or the president for the shutdown.

Not surprisingly, huge majorities of Democrats are angry at the Republicans, and huge majorities of Republicans are angry at Obama and Democrats. Independents are equally angry at all sides, with 59% of Independents very or somewhat angry at the Democrats, six in 10 angry at the GOP, and 58% angry at Obama.

The poll indicates that 18% of the public says the shutdown is a crisis and an additional 49% say the shutdown has caused major problems.

""That's a higher level of worry than in November 1995, when the government shut down because the Democrats, led by President Bill Clinton, and the Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, could not agree on funding. In 1995, 12% felt the shutdown at that time was causing a crisis and 44% thought it was a major problem,"" adds Holland.

The two-thirds who say the shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems is similar to the seven in 10 who said the same thing in the Gallup poll.

According to the CNN survey, Democrats are most concerned about the shutdown, although a majority of Independents and Republicans also say the shutdown is causing a crisis or a major problem.

There's also a gender gap, with three-quarters of women but only 57% of men saying the shutdown has caused a crisis or major problems.

Some 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed due to the shutdown, with many government services and agencies are closed, suspended.

The CNN poll was conducted October 3-6 by ORC International, with 1,009 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

At the other end, the top brass of federal employees are on track to receive bonuses. And workers who impact the food and airline businesses, like meat inspectors and air traffic controllers, have managed to get a break from Congress.

But underprivileged children waiting to attend preschool, low-income seniors who rely on regular breakfasts from the government and elderly cancer patients seeking chemotherapy are among the first to really feel the impact of $85 billion in forced spending cuts that kicked in on March 1.

The cuts are affecting the poor on other fronts:

* In Michigan, 21,000 children won't get new clothes when they go back to school this fall. The state slashed a $137 clothing allowance for each child being cared for by relatives, according to MLive media group.

*In Kansas City, Kansas, 33 families that had been homeless are slated to lose housing at the Waterstone Apartments, because of cuts to the federal housing voucher programs, according to KCTV news.

* Poor people who wind up in federal court and need legal representation are waiting longer for trials, because so many public defenders are being forced to stay home, unpaid, said Federal Public Defender Lisa Peebles of Syracuse, N.Y. Her staff is taking 20 days off, some of the longest furloughs among federal employees.

""These are the things low income people need: Legal representation, health care, child care,"" said Professor Tim Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ""The more inequality grows, the more they'll need the exact programs we're cutting,""

Giant safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, as well as aid programs funded by the Veterans Administration have been protected from cuts.

But agencies and programs that are thinly funded or have no ability to shuffle money around have been hit particularly hard in the first round, said Steve Bell, senior economic policy director at the Bipartisan Policy Center. That includes those that spend most of their budget allocation on programs for the sick and poor and labor.

Related: Four federal agencies to shut down on Friday

""As time goes, you will see more of a cumulative impact,"" Bell said. ""We call it a slow-motion train wreck.""

Some programs are working hard to cushion the effect on the people. Obama administration officials had predicted the early childhood education program Head Start would cut 70,000 children from rolls. However, some of the centers that administer the program have found ways to adjust their smaller funds.

For instance, Kids Central of Norton, Va. trimmed the number of school days by 10, and cut back on school supplies and property maintenance, rather than whittling down the class size, said Darrell Edwards, executive director of that program.

Budget cuts have led to unexpected consequences for cancer-stricken seniors undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Hundreds of independent cancer clinics have either cut back, or are in the process of determining whether to treat Medicare patients because federal spending cuts trimmed reimbursement rates for pricey chemotherapy drugs.

Related: Meals on Wheels budget cuts: 'Slowly developing crisis'

The American Society of Clinical Oncology found in a recent survey of doctors and facilities that half of its members had to stop treating patients and send them to hospitals for chemotherapy.

""Having to travel just an additional 10 miles and be treated in a larger system can be a traumatic experience for these (cancer) patients,"" said the oncology group's president Sandra Swain, in a statement.

In coming months, forced federal spending cuts will carve a more equal, painful path, say budget experts.

Meanwhile, senior executives at the very top of the federal pay scale still may get bonuses this year, according a report released last week by Senator for Missouri Claire McCaskill.

""The idea that some of the highest paid federal government employees could be getting bonuses while others are being furloughed is outrageous,"" said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, who has crafted a bill to end such bonuses while sequester is on."

Military and civilian employees will get a 1 percent raise in the new year, consistent with the level laid out in Obama's earlier budget proposal. The order had to be signed before January 1 to allow federal agencies to update their pay systems for the new year. Congress could have declined to authorize the increases on at least two occasions in recent months, including when lawmakers passed a two-year budget agreement earlier this month, but chose not to intervene. Federal civilian workers have had their pay frozen for three years. Military employees have received a salary increase each year that Obama has been in office, the White House said. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic Whip in the House of Representatives, praised the move as a ""modest but important step"" against the background of an improving economy. Revised figures last week showed economic growth in the United States was an annualized 4.1 percent in the third quarter, the strongest since the final three months of 2011. ""In the case of federal civilian employees ... given that these hardworking public servants have already contributed nearly $114 billion toward deficit reduction and some were furloughed as a result of the shutdown and the sequester, it is long overdue,"" Hoyer said. Employee unions have praised the increase as a small first step toward relief for the mostly middle-class workers on the federal payroll. Still, those workers continue to lose ground in real terms. The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 1.2 percent for the 12 months ended November 2013. For calendar 2012 the rate was 2.1 percent.

(CNN) – A monthly jobs report showing sluggish hiring in March gave Republicans an opening Friday to chastise President Barack Obama's economic policies.

""The president's policies continue to make it harder for Americans to find work,"" House Speaker John Boehner wrote in a statement released a half hour after the Labor Department report was released. ""Hundreds of thousands fled the workforce last month and unemployment remains far above what the Obama administration promised when it enacted its 'stimulus' spending plan.""



Friday's report showed 88,000 jobs were added in March, far lower than the 190,000 jobs that economists expected. The unemployment rate fell to 7.6%, though the drop was pegged to 500,000 Americans leaving the workforce.

During last year's election, Obama's record on jobs creation formed the core of rival Mitt Romney's attacks, even as hiring began picking up and the unemployment rate dropped. Republicans have continued attacking Obama's jobs record after the election as the White House and Congressional Republicans grapple over a deficit reduction plan.

Next week Obama will unveil his annual budget, which is expected to make changes to Medicare and Social Security in an effort to reach a deficit deal with Republicans.

In his statement Friday, Boehner said that ""one of the best things President Obama can do is follow the House and outline a balanced budget next week – one that includes entitlement reforms that are not conditional on enactment of more tax increases, which will suppress growth instead of encourage it.""

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus cast the March jobs report as a consequence of Obama's focus on upcoming midterm elections.

""What exactly was the president doing in the last month to create jobs as the economy sputtered along?"" Priebus asked. ""Why did he flit off to San Francisco this week to fundraise on Billionaire's Row instead of sending a budget to Congress? Why is adding money to Nancy Pelosi's campaign coffers more important than adding jobs to the economy?""

Obama's fundraising swing through California began Wednesday evening and continued Thursday with events for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.

Priebus also placed blame on Congressional Democrats, whose policies he said were hurting American hiring.

""Why don't liberals admit their big government programs are straining Americans' budgets? Why are they sticking young people with higher insurance costs through Obamacare? Why won't they work with Republicans to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid?"" he said.

""Are the president and his fellow Democrats out-of-touch–or just not serious about doing their jobs?"" he concluded.

Rep. Eric Cantor, the number two House Republican, wrote it was time for Obama and Democrats in Congress to ""stop making excuses and start working together on common sense solutions to address our lingering unemployment problem, and the stagnant economy.""

Public polling shows Americans split on who to trust with the economy, Obama or Congressional Republicans. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted March 7-10 showed 44% trusted Obama more on the economy and 40% trusted members of the GOP in Congress.

Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in a statement that ""more work remains to be done"" to spur hiring.

Today’s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,"" Krueger wrote. Similar statements are released after every monthly jobs report. ""It is critical that we continue the policies that are helping to build an economy that creates jobs and works for the middle class as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007."""
http://news.yahoo.com/senate-vote-ok-85-billion-210201607.html,,[],"Senate vote: OK $85 billion cuts, avert shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved legislation Wednesday to lock in $85 billion in widely decried spending cuts aimed at restraining soaring federal deficits — and to avoid a government shutdown just a week away. President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats rejected a call to reopen White House tours scrapped because of the tightened spending.

Federal meat inspectors were spared furloughs, but more than 100 small and medium air traffic facilities were left exposed to possible closure as the two parties alternately clashed and cooperated over proposals to take the edge off across-the-board spending cuts that took effect on March 1.

Final House approval of the measure is likely as early as Thursday. Obama's signature is a certainty, meaning the cuts will remain in place at least through the end of the budget year on Sept. 30 — even though he and lawmakers in both parties have criticized them as random rather than targeted. Obama argued strongly against them in campaign-style appearances, predicting painful consequences, before they began taking effect, and Republicans objected to impacts on Pentagon spending.

Without changes, the $85 billion in cuts for the current year will swell to nearly $1 trillion over a decade, enough to make at least a small dent in economy-threatening federal deficits but requiring program cuts that lawmakers in both parties say are unsustainable politically. As a result, negotiations are possible later in the year to replace the reductions with different savings.

The administration as well as Republicans picked and chose its spots in arguing for flexibility in this year's cuts.

""My hope is that gets done,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said earlier in the week of the effort to prevent layoffs among inspectors that could disrupt the nation's food supply chain. ""If it does not, come mid-July we will furlough meat inspectors,"" he added, departing from the administration's general position that flexibility should ease all the cuts or none at all.

Story continues

Nor did the White House resist a bipartisan plan to prevent any cut in tuition assistance programs for members of military.

The final vote was 73-26, with 51 Democrats, 20 Republicans and two independents in favor and 25 Republicans and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana opposed.

Political considerations were on ample display in both houses as lawmakers labored over measures relating to spending priorities, both for this year and a decade into the future.

Rep. Mark Mulvaney, R-S.C., said he had wanted the House to vote on Obama's own budget, but he noted the president hadn't yet released one. ""It's with great regret ... that I'm not able to offer"" a presidential budget for a vote, he said. He added he had wanted to vote on a placeholder — ""34 pages full of question marks"" — but House rules prevented it.

Minority Democrats advanced a plan that calls for $1 trillion in higher taxes, $500 billion in spending cuts over a decade and a $200 billion economic stimulus package. Republicans voted it down, 253-165.

They are expected to approve their own very different blueprint on Thursday.

It calls for $4.6 trillion in spending cuts over a decade and no tax increases, a combination that projects to a balanced budget in 10 years' time. That spending plan would indeed be simply a blueprint, lacking any actual control over federal spending.

The issues were grittier in the Senate, where lawmakers grappled with the immediate impact of across-the-board cuts on individual programs.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a deficit hawk, said he wanted to reopen the White House tours, shut down since earlier in the month. He said his proposal would take about $8 million from the National Heritage Partnership Program and apply it toward ""opening up the tours at the White House, opening up Yellowstone National Park and the rest of the national parks.""

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters previously the decision the cancel the White House tours was made by the Secret Service because ""it would be, in their view, impossible to staff those tours; that they would have to withdraw staff from those tours in order to avoid more furloughs and overtime pay cuts.""

But in remarks on the Senate floor, Coburn said, ""This is a Park Service issue, not a Secret Service issue.""

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the funds involved in Coburn's amendment would not go to the Secret Service, and as a result the tours ""would not be affected."" He also said the Heritage program, a public-private partnership, helps produce economic development and should not be cut.

The vote was 54-45 against the proposal. Montana Sen. Max Baucus, whose state borders on Yellowstone National Park, was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans.

The Park Service has announced some parks may open late to automobile traffic this spring because budget cuts have reduced funds available to clear roads of winter snow.

The overall legislation locks in the $85 billion in spending cuts through the end of the budget year, yet provides several departments and agencies with flexibility in coping with them. It extends flexibility to the Pentagon, the departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Justice, State and Commerce and the Food and Drug Administration.

But bipartisanship has its limits, and in private negotiations Republicans rejected Democratic attempts to provide flexibility for the rest of the government.

That set off a scramble among lawmakers to round up support for changes on a case-by-case basis.

The provision to prevent furloughs for federal meat inspectors had the support of industry as well as from both sides of the political aisle and cleared without a vote. It was supported by Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat seeking re-election next year, and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who quietly helped Democrats round up the votes they needed to clear the legislation over a procedural hurdle.

The effect was to transfer $55 million to the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service from other accounts within the department, including deferred maintenance.

""Without this funding, every meat, poultry, and egg processing facility in the country would be forced to shut down for up to two weeks,"" said Blunt. ""That means high food prices and less work for the hardworking Americans who work in these facilities nationwide.""

In contrast to Blunt, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, opposed Democrats when they sought to overcome procedural hurdles earlier in the week.

In the days since, he repeatedly refused to let the bill advance unless he was given a chance to cancel about $50 million in cuts aimed at contract employees at more than 170 air traffic facilities around the country. In the end, his amendment was jettisoned without a vote."

Eleven days earlier, a coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans in the House scuttled the latest attempt at a farm bill, dooming for now disaster assistance for livestock producers still affected by last year’s drought.

Congress returns on Monday with a major overhaul of immigration pending in the House, the farm bill lying in a heap and new fiscal deadlines looming when the government runs out of spending authority on Sept. 30 and reaches its borrowing limit shortly thereafter. The Postal Service, meanwhile, continues to lose millions of dollars every day as a measure to rescue the agency founders in the House.

There is no guarantee that any of these issues will be dealt with.

Even in some of the worst years of partisan gridlock, a deadline has meant something to Congress — until 2013. Drop-dead dates have come and gone this year, causing real-world consequences. On Jan. 1, tax rates went up not only for affluent families, but also for virtually all workers when lawmakers looked the other way and let a payroll tax cut expire. On March 1, after leaders from both parties declared that automatic, across-the-board spending cuts would never happen, they happened anyway because of inaction.

“One hundred percent of Congress opposed it, and we’re doing it,” said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. “That’s a sign of a dysfunctional institution.”"

In fact, he was counting on it. He wanted to show that he was willing to antagonize his supporters to get a budget compromise, putting Republicans on the spot to do the same.

Naturally, Republicans refused. Curbing the rise of Social Security benefits and raising Medicare premiums for higher-income people were two of the highest priorities for Republican leaders just a few months ago. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said last fall that if Mr. Obama proposed them, he would consider allowing tax revenue to go up.

But, on Wednesday, when the president actually did so, Mr. McConnell dismissed the budget as unserious. Not a single Congressional Republican could be found to consider a budget that combines twice as much in spending cuts as it raises in tax revenues.

The Social Security proposal remains a bad idea, and, as this page has explained, it could hurt vulnerable retirees and stymie better ideas to improve the system, like raising the wage cap subject to the payroll tax. But it seems unlikely to happen if Mr. Obama holds to his demand for more revenues in exchange, given the Republican intransigence. For now, it has served its purpose — no one will be able to accuse Mr. Obama of refusing to touch entitlements, and no one can credit Republicans for being at all serious about a deficit-reduction compromise."

House Speaker John Boehner indicates broader talks on the budget must be part of debt-ceiling debate

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew calls GOP stance %22reckless%22

Boehner says it%27s up to Obama to begin talks to end impasse%3A %22He knows what my phone number is.%22

WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown headed into its second week with no sign of resolution to the bitter stalemate as key Republicans in Congress on Sunday linked the current budget impasse to the looming confrontation over a potential default on the nation's debt.

House Speaker John Boehner said the GOP-led House would not pass measures to either reopen the government or increase the government's borrowing authority without concessions from the White House, including talks on reducing federal spending.

""I don't want the United States to default on its debt,"" the Ohio Republican said on ABC'sThis Week. ""But I'm not going to raise the debt limit without a serious conversation about dealing with problems that are driving the debt up.""

President Obama, he said, ""is risking default by not having a conversation with us.""

Asked how the stalemate would end, Boehner said: ""If I knew, I would tell you.""

The government will reach the limit of its borrowing authority on Oct. 17, and Obama has called for lawmakers to pass a bill increasing the limits with no conditions attached.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew called it ""reckless"" and ""dangerous"" for the federal government to veer so closely to a potential default on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt. ""On the 17th, we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire,"" Lew said on CNN's State of the Union.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who led GOP efforts to dismantle Obama's 2010 health care law as a condition of keeping the government open, Sunday outlined three conditions that should be met before Republicans agree to debt-ceiling deal.

""We should look for some significant structural plan to reduce government spending,"" Cruz said on CNN. ""We should avoid new taxes. And, No. 3, we should look for ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare.""

The House and Senate were set to return to work Monday afternoon. The Democratic-controlled Senate is likely to approve a House-passed bill to ensure federal employees currently furloughed receive back pay once the shutdown ends. But there was agreement on little else as the shutdown moved into Day 7.

The partial government shutdown began Oct. 1, after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement on spending bills to keep the government running into the new fiscal year.

House Republicans made dismantling or delaying the health care law a condition of passing a temporary spending bill -- a position rejected by Obama and Senate Democrats.

In recent days, the House has passed several measures to reopen portions of the government -- most of which have been rejected by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is demanding the House vote on a bill to open the entire government without any conditions.

On Sunday, Lew called on the House to vote immediately on a temporary spending measure without linking it to demands on either the health care law or spending cuts. Lawmakers ""need to open the government up,"" he said. ""They can do it today.""

Boehner, however, said he does not have the votes in the House to pass a stopgap budget measure with no strings attached, despite indications that some moderate Republicans would be willing to join Democrats in passing a ""clean"" measure to end the shutdown.

Democrats challenged Boehner's assertion. ""If there are not votes to open the government as Speaker Boehner says, why is (he) so afraid to call the vote and prove it,"" White House senior adviser Dan Pfieffer tweeted Sunday.

""Put it on the floor Monday or Tuesday,"" New York Sen. Charles Schumer said on ABC. ""I bet there are the votes to pass it.""

Republicans insisted Sunday that it was up to Obama to start negotiations to end the impasse. ""We're interested in having a conversation about how we open the government and how we begin to pay our bills,"" Boehner said. ""But it begins with a simple conversation.""

Obama ""knows what my phone number is,"" he said.

In one encouraging sign for federal workers, 350,000 Pentagon employees were returning to work Monday after they were furloughed in the shutdown. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered them back on the job after government lawyers determined that a new law aimed at shielding uniformed members of the military from the effects of the shutdown also extended to many civilian employees who support the military."

In other words, the only thing standing between mainstream Republicans and a hellish future of kowtowing to Ted Cruz, never seeing the inside of the White House and possibly losing the House is President Obama’s refusal to give in to the shutdown blackmail that Cruz & Co. have cooked up. The more pragmatic Republicans, who know that this is a disaster for their party but won’t confront Cruz & Co., have settled on this bogus line: “Well, sure, maybe Cruz and the Tea Party went too far, but it’s still President Obama’s fault. He’s president. He should negotiate with them. He needs to lead.”

President Obama is leading. He is protecting the very rules that are the foundation of any healthy democracy. He is leading by not giving in to this blackmail, because if he did he would undermine the principle of majority rule that is the bedrock of our democracy. That system guarantees the minority the right to be heard and to run for office and become the majority, but it also ensures that once voters have spoken, and their representatives have voted — and, if legally challenged, the Supreme Court has also ruled in their favor — the majority decision holds sway. A minority of a minority, which has lost every democratic means to secure its agenda, has no right to now threaten to tank our economy if its demands are not met. If we do not preserve this system, nothing will ever be settled again in American politics. There would be nothing to prevent a future Democratic Congress from using the exact same blackmail to try to overturn a law enacted by their Republican rivals.

The president has said that he would give the G.O.P. an agenda for negotiations that could start when the government is funded and the debt ceiling lifted. He’s ready to consider trading the medical-device tax in Obamacare for another equivalent source of revenue or having a talk about closing tax loopholes and reforming entitlements — to both lower the deficit and raise revenue to invest in infrastructure or early childhood education. What Obama will not do, and must not do, is pay an entry fee to that negotiation — say giving up the medical-device tax — just to help Boehner down from the tree. Cruz & Co. would claim victory.

The reason so many mainstream Republican lawmakers want Obama to give something to Cruz & Co. is that they want to get out of this mess, but they’re all afraid to stand up to the far-right fringe themselves — with its bullying network of barking talk-show hosts and moneymen. But Obama shouldn’t take them off the hook. Only Republicans can delegitimize the nihilistic madness at the base of their party. (I wouldn’t exaggerate this, but I think Boehner underestimates how many mainstream Republicans feel their party is being stolen from them by radicals — and hunger for a leader who will take them on.)"

At a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., Tuesday Obama said, “a job is a source of pride...proof that you’re doing the right things.” (The Washington Post)

President Obama on Tuesday proposed spending more on creating jobs in exchange for an overhaul of business taxes. But the idea quickly devolved into the type of partisan finger-pointing that shows why any agreement will be so difficult.

With great fanfare, Obama and his aides promoted what they called a new “grand bargain” that would sidestep disagreements and focus on a longtime Republican goal: a rewrite of the business tax code to lower corporate rates.

The overhaul, administration officials said, would generate new revenue that could be used to pay for Obama’s priorities, including hiring workers to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure.

“Here’s the bottom line: I’m willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate tax code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle-class jobs. That’s the deal,” Obama said Tuesday during a speech at an Amazon.com warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn.

The visit was part of his summer campaign to highlight his economic message and frame the fall debate over the federal budget.

“If folks in Washington want a ‘grand bargain,’ how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?” Obama asked rhetorically.

But within hours, Republican leaders in the Senate and House had rejected and ridiculed the idea as a tired repackaging of old proposals.

“It’s just a further-left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago, this time with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), saying he had learned of the proposal late Monday night.

David Plouffe, a longtime Obama adviser, tweeted that the Republican reaction to the proposal “lays them bare again.” He wrote: “Not serious, Pavlovian opposition to even mainstream ideas.”

The White House proposal’s long odds were also underscored by opposition from the Business Roundtable, which represents the nation’s biggest companies.

“All revenues from corporate base-broadening measures should be applied to corporate rate reduction and to modernizing our international tax system, not for unrelated spending,” said Business Roundtable President John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan.

In principle, an overhaul of the corporate tax code could offer room for compromise for both sides. Republicans and Democrats generally agree that the corporate tax code is unnecessarily complex, has excessively high official rates and hurts U.S. competitiveness globally.

The Obama administration and key congressional Republicans, such as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.), also agree that U.S. companies that have amassed profits overseas should pay a tax or fee to bring those funds home. About $2 trillion in such profits remain abroad.

A fee on foreign profits could go a long way toward paying for the jobs proposals Obama wants, which also include opening manufacturing institutes and investing in community colleges to train workers. Obama has proposed $50 billion in jobs-related spending.

White House officials said Tuesday that it makes sense to try to strike a broad agreement on what the two sides agree on even if compromise remains elusive on more contentious topics, such as a long-term budget deal that involves cuts to the social safety net and new tax revenue.

“We should take a look at what we all do agree on,” White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri said during a conference call Tuesday. “This is something that would create jobs in the short term and be a big boost for the middle class.”

But Obama’s proposal did little to bridge the huge disagreements that remain. While the White House has advocated a new corporate tax rate of 28 percent, Republicans are pushing for a lower rate and have rejected the idea of using added revenue for new federal spending.

“This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama’s position on taxes and President Obama’s position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

In his remarks in Chattanooga, Obama challenged Republicans to lay out their own proposals and accused them of trying to gut federal investments in education and energy and roll back the administration’s landmark health-care program.

“If they’ve got a better plan to bring back more manufacturing jobs . . . then let me know, let me hear them,” Obama said.

The White House first introduced a proposal for revamping corporate taxes early last year — one that was almost identical to the one released Tuesday. But at the time, it didn’t address what would happen with the revenue raised as a result of the changes, mainly from a fee on past foreign profits of U.S. companies.

Republicans have argued the revenue should be put toward further reducing corporate tax rates. But administration officials say that doesn’t make sense because the lower rates would be in place indefinitely while the revenue would be a one-time event.

Camp and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who are working on their own tax-reform plan, did not endorse the proposal but expressed satisfaction with the president’s interest in the issue. They said in a joint statement that the “outdated tax code is making it harder for U.S. companies to compete.”

A number of congressional Democrats, meanwhile, backed the proposal while stressing their support for a broader package to replace the deep spending cuts known as sequestration."

Story highlights Some progressives dismayed with compromises and slow pace of change in Obama years Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about President Obama ""Sometimes the administration is standing in the way ... ,"" one Netroots participant says

(CNN) —

Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic firebrand, stood behind a podium at the San Jose Convention Center and neatly summed up the current zeitgeist of the left.

“Is the president perfect?” Dean asked a buzzing audience of left-leaning bloggers, political activists and organizers on Thursday evening. “No. But it sure is better than having Bain Capital, I mean Mitt Romney, in there.”

Dean’s growling joke crystallized the prevailing liberal sentiment about President Barack Obama as the curtain rose on Netroots Nation, the annual progressive conference started in 2006 by the creators of the Daily Kos, a popular left-leaning blog and founding member of an online grass-roots movement that eventually helped lift Obama into the White House.

From the left, Dean open to presidential run

Obama the senator made a pilgrimage to the 2007 conference, then called Yearly Kos, and charmed the assembled bloggers as he mounted what seemed an impossible primary campaign against Hillary Clinton.

In 2013, Obama the president sent a YouTube video. He wasn’t exactly missed.

On a host of issues from National Security Agency surveillance to Wall Street reform to foreclosure assistance to the Keystone XL pipeline debate, the more than 2,000 activists in San Jose for the eighth Netroots Nation expressed dismay about the compromises and slow pace of progress that have so far marked Obama’s tenure in the White House.

“If George Bush was in there, I’d more frustrated,” said Tony Alexander, political director for a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. “But we have Barack Obama, so it’s a little less frustrating.”

But frustrating nonetheless.

To many here, the hard-won battles of the 2012 campaign have not yielded much at all.

“We are in the middle of foreclosure crisis, and we haven’t seen any real action on principal reduction, and we haven’t seen any of the banks get prosecuted for some of things that were supposedly under investigation,” said Liz Butler, a fellow at the Movement Strategy Center, a social justice organization. “A lot of us have concerns within the progressive, social justice and environmental movement about the lack of action on a whole set of issues.”

Scott Paul, a self-described “labor Democrat” and president of the nonpartisan Alliance for American Manufacturing, pointed to Obama’s promise at the Democratic National Convention to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term.

’The American people want to believe in something’

“The first five months are in, and there is virtually no job creation, so they are already way behind on manufacturing,” said Paul, who was enticing conference-goers to his display in the Netroots Nation exhibition hall with classic arcade games such as Galaga and Pac-Man. “How much of it was rhetorical? A lot of it was, clearly.”

Across the hall from Paul’s display, staffers from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a 1 million-member advocacy group founded by two former MoveOn.org organizers, was doing a brisk business handing out blue-and-white bumper stickers declaring, “I’m from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party.”

Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who endeared herself to the left by pushing for student loan reform and greater Wall Street regulation, long ago surpassed Obama as a darling of the left, said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

The president’s attempt to pass sweeping gun control legislation after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School offered a glimmer of hope for liberals, Green said, but that soon faded.

“The American people want to believe in something, someone, and there are moments like the gun debate when the president did what progressives wanted all along, which is propose the boldest possible bill and barnstorm the country fighting for it,” he said.

“But on things like foreclosures, and even jobs, there is the absence of a policy. On some things he is just wrong, and on other things he is just absent. Why isn’t he giving a speech on jobs every single week? Why isn’t he owning that issue? He is almost treating his presidency like he is treading water. There are people who want to rally behind his leadership if he is willing to lead, but he is not.”

Obama recorded a video message for the conference that ran during the opening night of speeches on Thursday. It was sandwiched between the address by Dean and another by Sandra Fluke, the attorney and women’s rights activist who became a Democratic celebrity during the 2012 presidential race when radio talker Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” for advocating for greater access to contraceptives.

“We won’t always agree on everything, and I know you’ll tell me when we don’t, but if we work together, I am confident we will keep moving this country forward,” Obama said in the video, which was met by tepid applause though it highlighted accomplishments such as increasing home sales and passing an extension of the Violence Against Women Act.

The president’s complicated relationship with his party’s activist wing is, in a certain sense, as institutional as it is ideological. Every president, liberal or conservative, has been forced to make compromises that rankled even his most loyal supporters.

Left has long record of restlessness

But Obama’s other challenge is that the political left has long had a knack for restlessness, even with one of its own occupying the Oval Office.

Until the second term of President George W. Bush exposed his party’s fault lines, Republicans for decades had a prized tradition of marching in lockstep with party leadership, especially when the GOP held the White House.

The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is routinely disparaged – even by its own professional class in Washington – as less a party than a feuding and loosely affiliated federation of special interests and demographic groups: organized labor, abortion rights supporters, environmentalists, racial minorities, students and others.

“Every president has to operate within the framework of a lot of competing interests and organizations that are supporting or against him, especially Democrats,” said Jann Dorothy, a Netroots attendee from Sacramento, California, who is supportive of the president. “He has to always balance the various constituencies that are out there. It’s a bit like herding cats.”

Dorothy said that “a lot of people here are frustrated, very upset” about the NSA surveillance and data collection programs that former contractor Edward Snowden revealed this month.

Obama’s approval rating has slipped in the wake of revelations about his administration’s sweeping surveillance programs, but Democrats continue to give him high marks. A CNN/ORC International poll from this week shows Obama’s approval rating among Democrats at 83%, down six percentage points from last month. Among liberals the rating fell three points to 75%

CNN Poll: Obama numbers fall into generation gap

But the lanyard-wearing Netroots crowd bristled at party labels. They were more likely to identify themselves with a particular cause – opposing the Keystone pipeline, for instance, or halting forced deportations of illegal immigrants. Breakout sessions at the conference largely focused on tactical matters such as media strategy and grass-roots organizing, not passing Obama’s political agenda.

“I don’t think there is a terribly strong allegiance to the Democratic Party here,” Dean said in an interview with CNN.

It is a demanding bunch. Everyone who came to Netroots arrived with a pet issue or two, but it was difficult on the conference’s first day to find anyone who said the president had done enough to satisfy his or her demands.

The exceptions to that rule were supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, who applauded the president for backing same-sex marriage and said the administration has accomplished most of what they wanted.

Still, many questions about the president from a reporter were met with shrugs and the occasional eye roll.

The tension revealed itself in a roundtable session Thursday morning with leaders from Organizing for Action, a grass-roots advocacy group that sprang from Obama’s last campaign.

Does group exist only to push Obama’s agenda?

The group seeks to pressure members of Congress to back the White House’s agenda, largely through local media events and partnerships with sympathetic interest groups such as Planned Parenthood.

But several activists who attended the roundtable pointedly questioned the group’s executive director, Jon Carson, about its mission: Is its goal just to help Obama get his agenda passed? Or does it care about other progressive issues that don’t quite jell with Obama’s objectives?

The topic of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport crude oil reserves from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, was repeatedly broached. Several attendees doubted Organizing for Action’s sincerity on climate change given the president’s punting on a decision on construction of the 1,700-mile pipeline.

“Sometimes the administration is standing in the way of the agenda we all voted for,” one participant said.

Carson gamely tried to manage the situation.

“I think what I would say is, we do partnerships primarily on specific actions,” he said. “That’s what we are offering. We wouldn’t ask anyone, ‘Let’s make sure 100% of our agenda lines up before we go yell at (Sen.) Kelly Ayotte before her vote on background checks.’ But when we do line up our agendas on what we care about, we will find at least 80% matching.”

Sara El-Amine, the group’s national organizing director, said, “We can’t be all things to everyone.”

Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about Obama among the convention participants. He is still their president, and as Dean pointed out, it could be much worse.

Former Obama campaign staffers wandered the hallways sharing hugs with friends in the blogger community, and Obama T-shirts are a frequent sight on the backs of conference-goers. Booze-soaked parties are as much a part of the agenda as networking and political organizing. The 2016 presidential race and discussions about putative front-runner Hillary Clinton are only conversation topics when brought up by reporters.

Stop Hillary effort launches

The anxiety here is hard to define, but it might have something to do with the fact that liberals find themselves in the unusual position of being two-time winners on a grand scale.

For a progressive movement that started as an underdog insurgency fighting back against the powerful Bush administration, it’s kind of weird to be on top for five years running. These activists crashed the gate a long time ago. Their ambitions are a bit less sweeping, more prosaic and narrowly focused.

“It’s exciting to be coming together after we all performed really well as a party,” said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman for Emily’s List, a group that supports female Democratic candidates. “We ran really good candidates; we had really good issues and we won. So I think now we all get to stand around and talk about what do we do with a win, which might not be the most natural position for everybody here."

More from the Associated Press:

WASHINGTON — U.S. employers added 195,000 jobs in June and hiring was more robust in the two previous months than earlier estimated. The gains raise hopes for a stronger economy in the second half of 2013.

The Labor Department said Friday that the economy also added 20,000 more jobs in May and 50,000 more in April than initially reported. The unemployment rate stayed at 7.6 percent, but for a good reason: More people started looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are searching for jobs.

Americans' paychecks rose at a healthy pace and have outpaced inflation in the past year. Average hourly pay increased 10 cents to $24.01. That's 2.2 percent higher than a year ago. Over the 12 months ending in May, consumer prices rose 1.4 percent.

Stock index futures rose shortly after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped from 2.56 percent to 2.65 percent, a sign that investors think the economy is improving.

The economy has added an average of 202,000 jobs a month for the past six months, up from 180,000 in the previous six. Hiring and consumer confidence have increase despite higher taxes and federal spending cuts.

Further job growth could lower the unemployment rate and help the economy rebound after a weak start this year. If growth accelerated and unemployment fell, the Federal Reserve might start to scale back its bond purchases before the year ends. The bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates low.

Despite the solid pace of hiring, the economy is growing sluggishly. It expanded at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter. Most analysts expect growth at roughly the same subpar rate in the April-June quarter.

Weak economies overseas cut demand for U.S. exports in May. That led some economists to predict that growth in the second quarter might be slower than forecast. Still, many areas of the economy are improving.

The Fed's low interest-rate policies have encouraged more Americans to buy homes and cars. They've also helped boost stock and home prices in the first half of the year, increasing wealth and lifting consumers' confidence to its highest level in 5 1/2 years.

Auto sales in the January-June period topped 7.8 million, their best first half since 2007, according to Autodata Corp. and Ward's AutoInfoBank. Sales of previously occupied homes exceeded 5 million in May, the first time that's happened since November 2009. New-home sales rose at their fastest pace in five years.

Though fewer exports have hurt manufacturing, factories did field more orders in May. And a measure of business investment rose for the third straight month.

A stronger second half fueled by continued job gains might be enough for the Fed to begin tapering its stimulus. Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that the Fed would slow its bond purchases later this year and end them next year if the economy continued to strengthen.

But Bernanke added that if the economy weakens, the Fed could delay its pullback or even step up its bond purchases again. Several Fed members have since tried to clarify Bernanke's remarks by saying any tapering of the bond purchases would depend on the strength of the economy."

In April%2C the consumer price index fell 0.4%25

Gas prices dropped 8.1%25

Excluding volatile food and energy costs%2C core prices were up only 0.1%25

WASHINGTON (AP) — A plunge in the cost of gas drove down a measure of U.S. consumer prices last month by the most since December 2008. Excluding the drop in fuel costs, prices were largely unchanged.

The consumer price index fell 0.4% in April from March, the Labor Department said Thursday. The main reason the index fell was that gas prices plunged 8.1%.

For the 12 months that ended in April, overall prices rose 1.1% — the smallest year-over-year increase in 2½ years.

Excluding volatile energy and food costs, ""core"" prices ticked up 0.1% last month. Core prices have risen only 1.7 percent in the past 12 months. That's just below the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.

Scant inflation is allowing the Fed to continue its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy. Worries about lower inflation or even deflation might push the Fed to step up its low interest-rate policies to stimulate more borrowing and spending and push prices higher.

Deflation is a destabilizing cycle in which prices and wages fall steadily. It can slow economic growth.

Unusually low inflation means consumers can stretch their paychecks and buy more goods and services. But if it were to fall further, it could stoke fears of deflation.

""Subdued demand means that core inflation is likely to edge lower, as retailers will be forced to pass previous falls in raw material costs onto customers,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ""The Fed may soon put more emphasis on fading inflation trends.""

A little inflation can be good for the economy, because it encourages businesses and consumers to spend before prices rise further.

Aside from sharp swings in gas prices, consumer and wholesale inflation has been mild this year. The combination of modest economic growth and high unemployment has kept wages from rising quickly. That's made it harder for retailers and other firms to raise prices.

The average national price for a gallon has fallen since reaching a peak this year of $3.79 on Feb. 28. The average price was $3.60 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA.

The Fed has said it will keep the short-term interest rate it controls near zero at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, as long as the inflation outlook remains mild.

It is also buying about $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to keep longer-term rates low. That's intended to encourage borrowing and spending, which drives economic growth.

Many economists expect the Fed to begin to taper those purchases by the end of the year, particularly if hiring stays healthy. But too-low inflation could encourage the Fed to maintain or even step up the pace of its purchases."

Instead, Tennessee and Louisiana topped Bankrate's list of the 10 most retiree-friendly states, which equally weighted cost of living, taxes, access to healthcare, crime rates and climate.

Some chillier spots, including Nebraska and North and South Dakota also made the list. They may not be dream retirement destinations, but these states are actually ideal for retirees because of their lower taxes and cost of living and lack of crime, according to Bankrate, a financial information website.

""If you can bear [South Dakota's] temperatures, it's a pretty good place to live on a fixed income,"" said Chris Kahn, an analyst at Bankrate.

Florida, meanwhile, is notably absent from the top 10. While it boasts warm weather and reasonable state and local tax rates, a relatively high cost of living and crime rate sunk the ""Sunshine State"" to nineteenth place, Kahn said.

Related: 25 best places to retire

These 10 states, however, offer a better balance between affordability and quality of life in retirement, according to Bankrate.

1. Tennessee: Not only does it have a Florida-like climate, but Tennessee also boasts the second lowest cost of living in the country. Combined with a low tax burden and great access to medical care, Tennessee is ideal for retirees living on fixed incomes, Kahn said. The only downside: the state has one of the country's highest crime rates.

One of the state's oldest towns, Sevierville, Tenn., provides close access to a national park where retirees can picnic, hike and fish, and it's an easy drive to Knoxville.

2. Louisiana: Another balmy locale, the state has an average temperature of 66.7 degrees -- behind only Hawaii and Florida for warmest average climate. Louisiana residents also enjoy low taxes, above-average access to medical care and a relatively cheap cost of living. Like Tennessee, though, it suffers from a crime rate that is among the nation's highest.

3. South Dakota: It may not be a retirement hot spot, but Bankrate says it should be. The state has the country's lowest crime rate, and an estimated state and local tax burden of just 7.6% -- lower than every state but Alaska. The downside: with an average temperature of 46 degrees over the past 30 years, it's pretty darn cold there.

For small town lovers, Aberdeen, S.D. holds a renowned film festival and has a historic downtown that plays host to farmers markets, haunted walking tours and holiday parades.

4. Kentucky: The Bluegrass State is one of many Appalachian states to dominate Bankrate's top 10. While it may not have Florida's sunny beaches, it does boast an extremely low cost of living, warmer-than-average temperatures and a below-average crime rate.

In Louisville, retirees can stay active by walking or biking on the Louisville Loop, a pedestrian path set to eventually cover more than 100 miles. The smaller town of Danville, Ky. meanwhile, is ideal for horse lovers.

5. Mississippi: Beyond its warm weather, Mississippi also provides cheap living costs and a lower tax burden. But retirees may want to choose where they live carefully: the state has a high crime rate and subpar access to medical care. It has only 178 doctors per every 100,000 residents -- almost 100 less than the national average.

6. Virginia: This coastal state came in above average for most factors that Bankrate analyzed, including climate, access to healthcare and cost of living. Its crime rate is one of the lowest in the country, with only 2,446 property and violent crimes per 100,000 people.

An affordable college town, Lynchburg, Va. offers the beauty of the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, as well as historic Civil War sites.

7. West Virginia: Another Appalachian state, West Virginia is boosted onto the list by low crime, a cheaper cost of living and above-average access to medical care. Still, it has a colder climate than some of the other states.

Quiz: Where's your dream retirement?

8. Alabama: Warm temperatures, low state and local taxes and a relatively low cost of living all pushed Alabama into the top 10. Yet it suffers from below-average access to medical care and a relatively high crime rate, with 4,026 crimes per 100,000 people -- almost double that of Virginia.

Home to a campus of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, Ala. offers botanical gardens and nature preserves and 19th century architecture. Near the Georgia border, Fort Payne, Ala. is a quintessential small town with activities that include an annual fiddling convention and a stop at the ""world's largest yard sale.""

9. Nebraska: Beyond its cornfields, Nebraska offers excellent access to hospital care, a below-average crime rate and living costs among the country's cheapest. But with a lower than average temperature, it's another state for retirees who don't mind the cold.

10. North Dakota: Like neighboring South Dakota, this state is not for retirees looking for warm weather. But it does have the second lowest crime rate in the nation, a mild estimated tax burden of 8.9% and 5 hospital beds available for every 1,000 residents.

Money 101: Planning for retirement

To compile the list, Bankrate analysts ranked climate using average temperatures over 30 years (1981-2010) and valued cost of living with statistics from the Council for Community and Economic Research. Taxes were ranked using the Tax Foundation's analysis of state and local tax burdens. Access to healthcare was based on hospital beds per 1,000 residents and doctors per 100,000 residents from the Kaiser Family Foundation and U.S. Census Bureau, while crime rates were ranked using violent and property crimes per 100,000 people from the 2011 FBI Uniform Crime Report."

Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Friday that a provision in House GOP leadership’s “no budget, no pay” plan is unconstitutional.

“That’s unconstitutional,” Issa said of House leadership’s plan to withhold the pay of members of Congress if they don’t pass a budget by April 15.

The plan offers to raise the debt ceiling for three months, and the Senate must pass a budget by the end of that time period-April 15. If they fail to pass the budget by April 15, members of Congress wouldn’t be paid.

Issa said that would interfere with the 27th amendment to the Constitution, which doesn’t allow pay for members of Congress to change until after an election. “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened,” the 27th amendment reads.

Hours before, American Majority Action spokesman Ron Meyer also said the plan was unconstitutional for the same reason. Because of that, Meyer said “No Budget No Pay” couldn’t “take effect until next Congress.”

Meyer also said in an email that “numerous conservative members of the House have already come out and said they won’t vote for a plan which doesn’t cut spending.” At this time, it’s unclear if “No Budget No Pay” will cut any spending.

UPDATED (5:40pmET): In a statement to Breitbart News after this piece was published, Issa said he “strongly support[s] the House Republican leadership’s proposal to link the debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget by the Senate which has gone 1360 days without passing a blueprint for federal spending. While the 27th Amendment prohibits Congress from varying its own pay within a given Congress, as I noted in my interview it can certainly withhold pay. I have not read the legislative text of the ‘No Budget, No Pay’ proposal and how it approaches historically difficult questions about Congressional compensation. I would note that there has even been legal action taken challenging the current system that gives Members of Congress an automatic pay-raise. I have been an advocate for the strategy of linking a debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget as an effective way of forcing President Obama to focus on our nation’s long term fiscal situation. I expect the final proposal brought before the House will have resolved any constitutional questions and that it will have my support.”"

Nobody told Congress.

A hearing Thursday on long-term unemployment held before the 19-member Joint Economic Committee began with just a single lawmaker in attendance. Panelists testifying on the problem and its potential solutions spoke only to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the committee's vice-chair, for the beginning of the roughly 90-minute session.

The all-but-complete absence of congressional interest was first documented by National Journal reporter Niraj Chokshi, who tweeted a photo of the hearing. Shortly after the photo was posted, several other lawmakers did trickle in to participate. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) arrived eight minutes into the hearing. Once the hearing had been under way for 35 minutes, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) was also in attendance, according to Chokshi. Eventually Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also joined, bringing the crowd to four.

More than 4.6 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks, according to the latest job figures, a rate of 3.0 percent. That's higher than at any point since World War II, including the 2.6-percent peak during the recession of the early 1980s. The official unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6 percent, down from 10.0 percent at the recession's darkest moments, although much of the reduction has been due to people leaving the workforce -- simply giving up hope of finding a job.

Jobs advocates have continually chastised Congress for focusing on the federal budget deficit instead of the shortage of employment in the U.S., which still features more than four job seekers for every open position in the country.

Senators who did not attend the hearing included Sens. Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), John Campbell (R-Calif.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) also did not attend.

The Joint Economic Committee is one of only a handful of congressional panels that features members of both the House and Senate. Its hearings are thinly attended at times, but the contrast between Thursday's hearing and a March 14 hearing on ""Solving The Federal Debt Crisis"" is revealing. That hearing on debt opened with five members of Congress in attendance, including three Democrats and two Republicans. Over the course of the nearly two-hour session, several other members of the committee filed in.

Kevin Hassett, the author of Dow 36,000, which predicted a fantastic rise in equities before two subsequent crashes, said he wasn't surprised. ""There are often moments like that at hearings. Very few are ever heavily attended. People came in late, after the picture, I suppose,"" he told HuffPost.

At the hearing, Klobuchar presented a study indicating that long-term unemployment is disproportionately affecting young workers, black and Hispanic workers, and workers with lower levels of education. The study is in keeping with other work that shows the economic recovery has been far better for some groups than others. The wealthiest 1 percent of households have received 106 percent of the gains since the recession bottomed out.

Dr. Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, said by the time he testified at about 11 a.m., two senators -- Klobuchar and Murphy -- were in the room. ""There were people in the audience,"" he said, noting that Klobuchar sounded motivated on the subject. ""That can make it worth it,"" he added. ""If one senator sponsors a bill with some of your information, that's a pretty big reward for your effort.""

Holzer testified about the various hardships that the long-term unemployed faced and the differences between older unemployed citizens and younger unemployed citizens. He proposed wage insurance for people who transition from manufacturing jobs to jobs with lesser pay, having the federal government pitch in to make up the difference. Holzer said he has testified before Congress 15 times over the years, and there is always a risk of a low turnout.

Keith Hall, a senior research scholar at the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center, is a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner who testified at the hearing. ""It's disappointing, I have to say,"" he told HuffPost about the attendance. ""It is a little bit disappointing, because you'd really like to see a more engaged discussion, and it would be nice to see that both sides were there and both sides were talking.""

Hall said that attendance was low probably because Congress isn't doing anything about long-term unemployment. With no bills to choose from, there's little value in becoming educated on the issue. The lack of interest may also be a consequence of the slow start to the year for the House of Representatives, which held just one markup session legislation on any topic in the first eight weeks of 2013.

""They're talking about the problem and they're looking for solutions, but there's really no hard proposal on the table,"" said Hall, ""so while this is informative and helpful, they're not dealing with some proposal where they're close to working on something.""

Congress is a long way off, Hall said. ""I think it's good this is hitting their radar screen, but there's a lot of work to go to get the economy back in shape and get the long-term unemployed back in shape, and they need more than just a hearing a two,"" he said.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article indicated that Sen. Klobuchar had been alone for the first half hour of the session. She was joined by Sen. Murphy after 8 minutes alone."
http://news.yahoo.com/a-shutdown-free-future-is-in-the-cards-213854346.html,,[],A shutdown-free future is in the cards,"Merry Christmas, America. The House just took a step toward ensuring an entire year without government shutdowns.

Despite a brief minirevolt among hard-line conservative Republicans, the House on Thursday approved a budget resolution that will set spending levels into 2015 with bipartisan support. The nonbinding resolution aims to replace parts of sequestration by offering $63 billion of “sequester relief” and will set spending levels at $1.012 trillion in fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion in fiscal year 2015.

The House passed the resolution 332-94, and the Senate is expected to pass it next week. Because budget resolutions are not intended to become law, President Barack Obama will not sign it, but the measure will provide the appropriations committees in the House and Senate guidelines for spending over the next two years.

The agreement, which is by no means historic, comes five years after Congress agreed to its last bicameral budget resolution and several failed attempts at a grand bargain. The resolution, which was negotiated between House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Republican, and Democratic Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, takes only minuscule steps toward reining in the federal debt and deficit. It includes no substantive reforms to the tax code or to the nation’s costly entitlement reforms, nor does it increase tax rates (although it does increase so-called fees on certain services).

Republican and Democratic leaders appeared satisfied with the proposal when it was released earlier this week, but they weren't triumphant about its achievements. Given the recent level of discord, lack of productivity and general toxicity in Washington, many appeared impressed with themselves by the mere fact that the parties could come to any sort of agreement at all.

""We're very unhappy about it, but not enough to say, therefore we're going to make matters worse by not having an agreement,"" Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.



Story continues

At issue for many Democrats is the lack of tax increases in the proposal and the absence of an extension for unemployment insurance. Republicans complained that the measure doesn’t go far enough to achieve debt reduction.

Earlier this week, a coalition of conservative groups moved to pressure Republican lawmakers to oppose the deal, an effort that received a sharp rebuke from Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who was furious that they spoke out against the proposal before it was finalized.

“It's not everything I wanted, but when groups come out and criticize an agreement that they've never seen, you begin to wonder just how credible those actions are,” Boehner told reporters on Thursday. “I came here to cut the size of government. That's exactly what this bill does. And why conservatives wouldn't vote for this is — or criticize the bill — is beyond any recognition I can come up with.”

In the end, conservative groups couldn’t muster enough opposition, and enough Democrats came on board to pass the bill.

The result will be a future untainted by the threat of government shutdowns for the next two years. But do not lose heart, political animals! Congress will no doubt find plenty of other petty issues to debate in the meantime."

House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday there were ""a lot of opinions about what direction to go"" on government shutdown negotiations after a meeting with House Republicans. (The Washington Post)

A campaign to persuade House Republicans to lift the federal debt limit collapsed in humiliating failure Tuesday, leaving Washington careering toward a critical deadline just two days away, with no clear plan for avoiding a government default.

Senate leaders quickly moved to pick up the pieces, saying they were “optimistic” that they could reach agreement to advance an alternative proposal that would raise the debt limit through Feb. 7 and end a government shutdown, now in its third week.

But it was unclear whether a deal struck by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could pass the Senate before the Treasury Department exhausts its borrowing power Thursday.

Meeting that deadline would be impossible if Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or other conservative hard-liners chose to throw up roadblocks, Democrats said. Republican leaders were leaning on Cruz and his allies to avoid unnecessary delays.

“The clock is ticking,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Republican in the Senate. “Given the consequence of what we’re talking about here, . . . I would hope that we would have genuine interest among all parties in terms of trying to get this done as quickly as possible.”

View Graphic Finding common ground hasnt been easy for lawmakers during the Obama administration.

Any deal would also have to win approval in the House, where Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his leadership team had once again lost all control of their majority. After a long day of trying with increasing desperation to cobble together a debt-limit plan that could win the support of 217 Republicans, Boehner and his top deputies gave up and abruptly canceled a scheduled vote on the measure.

(Related: Who controls the House GOP? No one.)

On Tuesday evening, they left the Capitol without further plan or explanation.

“We are done for the night,” a weary Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said as he left a marathon session in Boehner’s office that began as an airing of complaints from rebellious conservatives and soon ballooned into a full-blown emergency session of senior lawmakers and committee chairmen.

The chaos on Capitol Hill was already reverberating through the financial world. U.S. financial markets closed down slightly Tuesday, while Fitch Ratings, the third-largest credit-rating agency, took a step toward a potential downgrade of the government’s AAA rating. Fitch warned that “political brinksmanship and reduced financing flexibility” were elevating the risk of default.

Unless Congress acts by Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will be left with just $30 billion in cash and a fluctuating flow of incoming tax revenue to pay the nation’s bills. While Lew is unlikely to begin missing payments immediately, independent analysts say he would run short of funds no later than Nov. 1.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that aides to the two Senate leaders would work through the night to finalize details of the emerging Senate measure. “They had a basic agreement,” Durbin said of Reid and McConnell. “All pointing in the right direction.”

McConnell spokesman Don Stewart added in a statement: “Given tonight’s events, the Leaders have decided to work toward a solution that would reopen the government and prevent default. They are optimistic an agreement can be reached.”

In addition to lifting the $16.7 trillion debt limit, the emerging measure would fund the government through Jan. 15, delaying the next threat of a shutdown until after the holidays. It would set up a conference committee to hammer out broader budget issues, such as whether to replace deep cuts to agency budgets known as the sequester with other savings.

Republicans who shut down the government in a bid to undermine President Obama’s health-care program would win no major changes to the law. But they would get additional safeguards to ensure that people who receive subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Democrats dropped their demand to delay a new tax on existing health insurance plans, a change intended to benefit organized labor. And Republicans backed off their push to deny the Treasury Department flexibility to manage the nation’s books after Feb. 7, an aborted attempt to ensure that the short-term extension of the debt limit doesn’t somehow drag on into the spring.

Durbin, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat and chief vote counter, predicted that the final package would easily pass the Senate with support from both parties.

“With McConnell’s name on it,” he said, “we feel it will get a good, strong vote.”

Its fate in the House, however, was uncertain. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has pledged the support of all 200 Democrats, meaning Boehner would have to supply almost two dozen votes.

Late Tuesday, Democrats — and some Senate Republicans — were urging Boehner to draft the emerging Senate deal into legislation and let the House vote as soon as Wednesday. Given a House-passed bill, Reid could move much more quickly to final passage in the Senate, sending a bill to Obama’s desk before the Thursday deadline if Cruz and his allies did not object.

House GOP officials said they had yet to decide how to proceed. Passing the Senate bill before the Senate had even taken a vote would amount to a complete capitulation to the upper chamber, the latest embarrassment in a speakership riddled with dark moments.

Ironically, the current debacle began with Boehner’s friends in the Senate — recognizing that McConnell was close to a deal with Reid — deciding to pause those talks to give Boehner a chance to consolidate his weakening hold on power.

If Boehner had been able to rally support for a measure more palatable to Republicans, it would have strengthened McConnell’s hand.

Boehner “would establish himself as the leader of the House, which is good for the country,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters as he left the Senate GOP’s weekly luncheon Tuesday afternoon. “This is offense for us,” Graham said optimistically. “This is a defining moment for the speaker.”

Graham, Saxby Chambliss (Ga.) and other GOP senators had pleaded with Boehner late last week to try to pass a bill that would give Senate Republicans leverage in their talks with Reid. On Monday, Boehner met with McConnell and several other Senate Republicans. And on Tuesday, Boehner was ready to go.

He started the day by convening a 9 a.m. meeting of his rank and file, a session that opened with a prayerful group sing-along to the hymn “Amazing Grace.” But as Boehner began searching for items to attach to the debt-limit bill, his majority quickly dis­integrated into squabbling ideological factions.

Boehner’s initial proposal was to include two provisions that would have given conservatives some small measure of satisfaction in exchange for ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit. One would have delayed a tax on medical devices that helps finance the new health-care law. The other would have ended employer-provided health subsidies given to lawmakers and members of the executive branch, who are required to join the new health-care exchanges.

But conservatives quickly complained that it wasn’t enough. The bill would not cut spending, they said, or reform entitlement programs, or erase a clause in the health law that requires employers to provide coverage for contraception. And it clearly would not achieve their ultimate goal of ending the program they call Obamacare.

As the bickering continued, senior aides to rank-and-file Republicans resorted to watching the Twitter feeds of congressional reporters to learn who was demanding what.

By midafternoon, House leaders appeared to be rallying around a new measure. This one would not delay the medical-device tax, but it would add congressional staffers to the group of federal employees who would no longer receive any help from their employer to buy health insurance.

The proposal amounted to a $5,000 pay cut for those with individual coverage and a $10,000 cut for those with families. But conservatives theorized that Senate Democrats would have to approve it or risk looking as if they were protecting their own health benefits. And that would motivate them to reopen the health-care law, the theory went.

House leaders scheduled a vote for late Tuesday evening.

But in the end, that idea didn’t fly either. One by one, recalcitrant lawmakers were dragged to Boehner’s office. One by one, they emerged shaking their heads.

“I’ve got one vote and I’m a no,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), one of the most conservative House members, told waiting reporters.

Mainstream conservatives were also unhappy. After shutting the government down for 15 days, they would get nothing — not even the meager concessions McConnell and Reid had been discussing.

The final blow came shortly after 5 p.m., when Heritage Action for America, the powerful conservative group that drove Republicans to attack Obama’s health-care initiative, sent an e-mail urging lawmakers to vote no because the House bill “will do nothing to stop Obamacare’s massive new entitlements from taking root.”

Soon after, Boehner canceled the vote. An hour later, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) issued an alert telling lawmakers that the House would be in session Wednesday. No specific legislation was listed for consideration.

As for the timing of any votes, Cantor advised: “TBD.”

As we predicted before last November’s elections, tax reform will be on the agenda in 2013 – but has its best chances in the states. We are seeing that demonstrated Thursday by Louisiana’s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal.

Jindal unveiled what could be, if approved by the legislature, the boldest, most pro-growth state tax reform in U.S. history. His plan, outlined in Baton Rouge this morning during a joint meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Committee, calls for the elimination of all state personal and corporate income taxes, as well as the state franchise tax on capital stock. This would be replaced by an increase in the state sales tax rate to 5.88 percent, up from 4 percent. The sales tax would also apply to a broader base of goods and a number of services previously untaxed.

Many governors around the country have proposed rate-reducing tax reform, but Jindal’s plan sets a gold standard for pro-growth reform. His proposal could mean more disposable income for families while increasing the job-creating capacity of employers across the Pelican State.

It would also make Louisiana’s tax code more conducive to economic growth. A recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report ranked taxes according to their negative economic impact. The study concluded that taxes on income and capital, which Jindal’s plan would eliminate, were the most damaging.

Louisiana ranked 32nd on the nonpartisan Tax Foundation’s 2013 State Business Tax Climate Index. If Jindal’s plan is approved and signed into law, the state will jump to No. 4 on that index.

Jindal’s proposal is a model not just for other states but also for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. His plan adheres to the conservative principle that the tax code should not be used to pick winners and losers in the economy. It demonstrates that the purpose of real tax reform is to make the tax code more efficient and competitive – not to raise additional revenue. Jindal’s plan creates a predominantly consumption-based tax system and does so in a way that he estimates will raise the same amount of revenue for the state as current law.

President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats appear to view tax reform as a vehicle for higher taxes. The White House and folks at MSNBC would have one think that House Republicans have become extremists for insisting that tax reform not result in a net tax increase. Yet back in 1986, the last (and, many contend, only) time Washington passed comprehensive tax reform, there was bipartisan consensus that it should be revenue-neutral.

Then-Senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and then-Ways & Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago, agreed with President Ronald Reagan that reform should clean up the tax code – not be a Trojan horse for higher taxes. This is what Jindal’s proposal would do.

Tax reform is one of the most politically difficult undertakings for lawmakers. It becomes almost impossible, however, when the public perceives it as a covert attempt to raise taxes.

Georgia offers a cautionary tale. Two years ago, state legislators introduced a reform package that would have significantly cut the state income tax – particularly important, since the state is flanked by two states with no income tax – while increasing reliance on sales tax. There was one major problem: The plan as a whole resulted in a multibillion-dollar tax increase. Fellow legislators, and the public, revolted against it.

Though the Georgia plan was reworked so it was no longer a net tax increase, the damage had already been done. In the end, it failed to pass. While some Republicans, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are asking the GOP to repeat this folly at the national level, Jindal is wisely not making this mistake in Louisiana.

The national media and Acela-corridor crowd continue to focus on the bickering Washington, but they can learn what real tax reform looks like by looking to Louisiana.

WASHINGTON — President Obama and Congressional leaders failed on Friday to stop deep, automatic cuts in federal spending that will immediately shrink the size and ambition of government, even as they vowed an end to the rolling fiscal battles that have repeatedly threatened government shutdowns and economic crisis over two years.

Emerging from an Oval Office meeting with the lawmakers, the president called the cuts “just dumb.” He said they would slow the economic recovery and spoke emotionally about their impact on people who would feel the consequences of government layoffs and disruptions in public services.

“I don’t anticipate a huge financial crisis, but people are going to be hurt,” Mr. Obama said during a 35-minute news conference at the White House, in which he acknowledged that his campaign of highlighting fallout from the cuts had failed to persuade Republicans to consider tax increases as part of a package to avert the $85 billion in reductions over the next seven months.

But both the president and his Republican adversaries said they would not carry the fight over the cuts into a coming legislative effort to finance the government through Sept. 30, essentially declaring a cease-fire in the budget wars that have dominated Washington since 2011."

Obama holds last news conference of his first term

The president recently nominated new Treasury and Defense secretaries

Budget issues%2C guns and immigration are among his second term issues

President Obama fielded questions on gun violence, debt reduction, and other aspects of his second term during the last news conference of his first term.

Here are some of the highlights:

12:24 p.m. The last question from the news conference touches on the makeup of Obama's second-term Cabinet and whether he has done enough to socialize with lawmakers. Obama has faced some criticism that his first four high-profile appointments for his second term have all been white men.

Obama said he's ""very proud"" that in his first four years he had one of the most diverse administrations in history. He notes that some of the most important players in shaping his first-term agenda were women -- Hillary Rodham Clinton at State Department, Kathleen Sebelius at Health and Human Services, and Janet Napolitano at Homeland Security.

""People can expect that record will be built on,"" he said. ""I would just suggest that everybody wait to see who (else) is on my White house staff and my Cabinet before rushing to judgment.

""Most people who know me know that I'm a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party.""

12:20 p.m. Obama says the House GOP probably has the votes to follow through on threats to shut down the government as they grapple with the White House over raising the debt ceiling. But he cautions that it would be a mistake and it would hurt the economy. ""I suspect the American people would blame all of Washington,"" he says. ""If the issue is deficit reduction ... getting our debt in a sustainable place, the Republicans will have a partner in me.""

12:14 p.m. Obama reiterates that he won't negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. He says again that he's willing to have a conversation about ways to reduce the deficit, but the debt ceiling must be raised. ""We've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again,"" he says.

12:08 p.m. Obama says that he's looking into using executive action to bolster gun control in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting that left 26 dead. He expresses dismay about some gun rights advocates, without naming any particular group. ""Those who oppose any common sense gun control measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear. ... There's probably an economic element to that.""

12:00 p.m. CBS News correspondent Major Garrett notes to Obama that there are often debates on the debt ceiling. As a senator, Obama even once voted against the raising of the debt ceiling. Obama says he won't have a conversation ""every month or every three months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills.""

11:54 p.m. President Obama invokes twice that the USA is ""not a deadbeat nation"" as he calls for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. ""The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation."" He makes the case that Congress should pay for services that have been rendered. ""This is not a a complicated concept. ... You don't go out to dinner and eat all you want and then leave without paying the check.""

11:47 p.m. Obama's first question is on gun control. The AP's Julie Pace asks about the probability of passing an assault weapons ban. Obama calls on Congress to ""examine their own conscience.""

11:44 a.m. Obama turns his focus to to his call on Congress to raise the debt ceiling. Not rising it would be a ""self-inflicted wound on the economy."" He adds, ""To even entertain the idea (of not raising the debt ceiling), it's absurd."" Obama lays down a marker for GOP lawmakers on the debt limit. ""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy.""

11:39 a.m. President Obama starts the news conference by declaring, ""We are poised for a good year."" He also makes a case that his administration has made a good start toward deficit reduction. He reiterates that he's open to making modest adjustments to Medicare and other entitlements, but we also need more revenue. Americans wants Washington to get our books in order in ""a balanced way."""

The raise follows a four year hiatus from salary increases for federal workers, although most federal employees have apparently seen their pay increase via promotion or performance. The first increased paycheck will kick in on January 1.

President Obama’s reward to the federal workforce follows his longstanding belief that government work ought to be a first option for Americans. Nonetheless, Obama’s decision to raise federal pay only widens the income inequality gap between federal workers and private sector employees; as of 2011, the average private sector employee made $59,804 in salary, and $28,000 in benefits, while the average federal workers made $74,436 in salary and $40,000 in benefits.

Furthermore, the gap between Washington, D.C. culture and the rest of the country is growing ever larger. Between 2000 and 2012, according to Census Bureau statistics, Washington, D.C. household income jumped 23.3%; the rest of the country, by contrast, dropped 6.6%. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “The Washington, D.C. metro area — which includes the surrounding suburbs in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia — has it even better, with a median household income of $88,233 that ranks highest among the U.S.’s 25 most populous metro areas.”

But Washington, D.C. remains completely dichotomous, with the percentage of residents living 50% below the poverty line increasing 1% during that period.

President Obama’s Christmas present to his federal friends will amount to nothing more than another lump of coal in the rest of America’s stocking.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/24/Obama-at-Knox-College,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Jarrett Stepman'],Obama at Knox College: Collective Responsibility Opposed to Individual Liberty,"President Barack Obama will be making a major speech on the economy at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, a site with deep historical significance.

Knox College was the location of the fifth of seven debates between Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, often known as the “Little Giant” for his small size but large influence in American politics, and Republican Abraham Lincoln.

At Knox, Lincoln and Douglas debated about the institution of slavery, whether it should be restricted in the territories, and its ongoing role in the Republic. Was slavery to remain a traditional, decaying institution left to choke and die under the original Constitution, or was it to be a permanent part of the American social fabric, possibly given new life in the Western territories?

The Lincoln-Douglas debates put Lincoln on the map politically, and even though he lost the 1858 Senate race to Douglas, he triumphed in the 1860 presidential election.

Obama also has a deep connection to Knox College, as it was the site of his 2005 speech on economics when he was a freshman senator. In that speech, he defended the power of government to boost the economy and increase economic opportunity.

Though many American statesmen, including Abraham Lincoln, have believed in government playing a role in building the American economy, Obama’s speeches have turned their philosophy on its head.

In his 2005 speech, Obama attacked the “ownership society” and made an argument for the collective good of government action. This philosophy is opposed to the individual liberty philosophy of the Founding Fathers and of Abraham Lincoln.

Obama said that Americans must have a “sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.

Obama was building up to the “you didn’t build that,” creed that became a key issue during the 2012 presidential campaign. This economic philosophy is fundamentally based on the principle that since individual success relies on the work of others, one owes the rest of society in the form of high taxes.

If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business–you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.

In essence, Obama has twisted the government “of the people, by the people, for the people” into a government that owns you.

But this set of principles contradicts the idea of individual rights and the “self-made man” that Lincoln supported.

Lincoln’s “beau ideal of a statesman” was Henry Clay of Kentucky, a Whig of the previous generation that helped craft the “American System” of economics. This system was in large part based on funding national infrastructure projects through tariffs, along with a national bank that would give the United States a sound system of money.

But Clay did not believe that individuals owed society anything, and he was famous for making the term “self-made man” popular. Clay, after defending corporations as a positive way for individuals to achieve success and get ahead in the world, said in a speech, “In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me, is in the hands of enterprising and self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor.”

This philosophy of both economic development and an acknowledgement that the individual owns his own labor is based on a Lockean natural rights philosophy that permeated the American founding and has been at the cornerstone of nearly every major American political party. It would certainly be in line with Brietbart News’ own “Hamilton,” who very much represents the philosophy of Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists, Henry Clay’s Whigs, and Abraham Lincoln’s Republicans.

Given Obama’s previous speeches on economics, the philosophy that made America the greatest opportunity society in the world and ended the institution of slavery is unlikely to be heard at Knox College."

IRS list obtained by USA TODAY reveals names of 162 groups scrutinized by tax agency

More than 80%25 of groups on the list were affiliated with the Tea Party or other conservative causes

IRS also questioned political activities of progressive and centrist groups

Correction: An earlier version of this story understated the number of groups represented by the the American Center for Law and Justice.

WASHINGTON — Newly uncovered IRS documents show the agency flagged political groups based on the content of their literature, raising concerns specifically about ""anti-Obama rhetoric,"" inflammatory language and ""emotional"" statements made by non-profits seeking tax-exempt status.

The internal 2011 documents, obtained by USA TODAY, list 162 groups by name, with comments by Internal Revenue Service lawyers in Washington raising issues about their political, lobbying and advocacy activities. In 21 cases, those activities were characterized as ""propaganda.""

The list provides the most specific public accounting to date of which groups were targeted for extra scrutiny and why. The IRS has not publicly identified the groups, repeatedly citing a provision of the tax code prohibiting it from releasing tax return information.

More than 80% of the organizations on the 2011 ""political advocacy case"" list were conservative, but the effort to police political activity also ensnared at least 11 liberal groups as of November 2011, including Progressives United, Progress Texas and Delawareans for Social and Economic Justice.

The IRS controversy first exploded in May, when Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had targeted Tea Party groups for additional scrutiny beginning in early 2010. The IRS placed a hold on those applications for more than 20 months, an inspector general's investigation found.

On Nov. 16, 2011, IRS lawyers in Washington sent a list of cases to front-line agents in Cincinnati, along with comments and guidance on how to handle political organizations.

Tax law experts say those comments appear to show IRS employees trying to apply the murky rules governing political activities by social welfare groups.

But the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit legal institute that represents 33 of the groups appearing on the IRS list, said it appears to be ""the most powerful evidence yet of a coordinated effort"" by the IRS to target Tea Party groups.

""The political motivations of this are so patently obvious, but then to have a document that spells it out like this is very damaging to the IRS,"" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the ACLJ. ""I hope the FBI has seen these documents.""

The IRS categorized the groups as engaging in several advocacy-related activities that could have barred them from tax-exempt status, such as lobbying and ""propaganda.""

But the word ""propaganda"" doesn't appear in section 501(c)(4), which governs the social welfare status that most Tea Party groups were applying for, said John Colombo, a law professor at the University of Illinois. Instead, it appears in section 501(c)(3), which governs public charities.

""There would be no reason I would think to flag them if it's for a 501(c)(4) status,"" Colombo said. ""That's very odd to me.""

In three cases, IRS lawyers noted that groups appeared to be connected to Republican politicians: Stand Up for Our Nation Inc., linked to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin; Reform Jersey Now Inc., linked to Gov. Chris Christie; and American Solutions for Winning the Future, founded by former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich's group was approved last year.

Five groups were flagged as having ""anti-Obama"" materials in their applications or on their websites.

For instance, the IRS said the website of the Patriots of Charleston contains ""negative Obama commentary."" Though the IRS didn't cite examples, a November 2011 article on the group's site says: ""Obama's and the Democrats' track record of disaster is based upon a combination of their ignorance and their fundamental desire to convert America into a ruling class of wealthy all-powerful elitists and a single class of serfs.""

""The web site, as we explained to them on multiple occasions, is really a blog"" that members can submit commentary to, said Joanne Jones, the group's vice chairwoman. ""I'm not going to tell you we weren't political. We were to an extent, but we were within the limits of the law. For example, there's one clear-cut issue: We did not endorse candidates.""

""To focus in on somebody saying something anti-Obama,"" she said, ""it's almost like the speech police there. It's disturbing. It's the kind of overreach that leads into Obamacare.""

The group received its tax exemption in September 2012.

RHETORIC OF SOME GROUPS QUESTIONED

It wasn't just anti-Obama rhetoric the IRS was looking out for. Progress Texas was identified by the IRS as engaging in lobbying, propaganda and political activities. IRS lawyers in Washington noted ""anti-Rick Perry"" rhetoric, referring to the Republican Texas governor, then a presidential candidate.

Progress Texas received a tax exemption as a social welfare group in June, 2012.

Campaign-finance watchdogs say the IRS scrutiny came out of a justified effort to police ""dark money"" in politics. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations and unions — and even non-profit groups — could engage in independent political advertising, social welfare groups became a vehicle for funneling undisclosed cash into the election system.

That's the position of Progressives United, a group founded by former senator Russ Feingold, D-Wis., that itself appeared on the 2011 IRS target list.

""The fact that our group received some scrutiny does not change at all our opinion that scrutiny like this from the IRS, it's their job. The law applies to us as it would any conservative group,"" said Progressives United's Josh Orton. ""I feel like there's this group of campaign finance nihilists who want to expand this into an argument that there should be no scrutiny at all. They want a wild west of election law, because they want to continue using secret corporate money to influence elections.""

Crossroads GPS, a group affiliated with GOP strategist Karl Rove, spent $70 million on the 2012 election. Its 2010 application for a tax exemption, obtained by the non-profit news organization Pro Publica last year, said it would spend 50% of its resources on ""public education."" In the 2011 list, the IRS noted ""significant anti-Obama rhetoric."" Crossroads has not received a tax exemption.

'WE ARE TOTALLY ABOVE BOARD'

The Tea Party of North Idaho filed its tax-exempt application in February, 2010 — the same month IRS screeners in Cincinnati first brought Tea Party applications to the attention of officials in Washington, according to IRS employee testimony before a congressional committee.

A lawyer in the IRS Exempt Organizations Technical Unit in Washington wrote the Idaho group had ""No significant amount of clear campaign intervention; however little issue advocacy or educational; significant inflammatory language, highly emotional language, little to no educational information on issues.""

The IRS lawyers recommended that screeners in Cincinnati look for other materials — including ""press releases, commentary, articles, and research reports,"" according to the IRS list.

That's when Leslie Damiano, who co-founded the North Idaho group, started getting what she considered to be intrusive questions from the IRS. She said the tax agency wanted to know who her donors were, and what companies they own. They wanted to know the educational background of the group's board members. And they wanted to know whether candidates were invited to the group's meetings, and whether it made endorsements.

""We're a conservative organization. We invited some independents,"" she said. ""We never had any rallies that were off the charts by any stretch of the imagination.""

Frustrated with the process, the Tea Party of North Idaho withdrew its application in 2012.

""We had an accountant, we had a bookkeeper. We were totally above board with everything we did,"" Damiano said.

REDUCING THE NATIONAL DEBT

Some groups caught in the IRS' net had no connection to national politics on either side. The Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Murrysville says it's ""dedicated to the preservation of the open and natural, rural character of Murrysville, Pa.,"" although the IRS said it endorsed some local candidates. The Sarasota Bay Tiger Club is one of several similar Florida clubs that provide ""a non-partisan forum on current political issues."" The club says it has ""never endorsed political candidates nor advocated a particular ideology,"" but the IRS said in its spreadsheet that it was ""unclear"" if that was the case.

The list also includes the Association to Reduce the National Debt, which was seeking to be recognized as a charity so it could solicit tax-deductible contributions — and give those contributions to the U.S. Treasury to put toward the national debt.

Founder Seth Eisenberg said the group was not political — and he told the IRS that.

IRS tax specialists noted ""no political campaign activities."" But two years after applying, the association still hasn't gotten his ruling letter. And without that letter, contributions are not tax-deductible and no one will give, he said.

All for a group that said it wanted to give the government money.

""I thought this would be a fast-tracked application. A no-brainer. But it got caught up in this whole political controversy,"" Eisenberg said. ""It's the greatest irony that ever was.""

Dionne: In State of Union, Obama tries to change the direction of our politics","President Obama is a freer man than he has been at any point in his presidency. He is free from the need to save an economy close to collapse, from illusions that Republicans in Congress would work with him readily, from the threat of a rising tea party movement and from the need to win reelection.

This sense of freedom gave his State of the Union address an energy, an ease and a specificity that were lacking in earlier speeches written with an eye toward immediate political needs. It was his most Democratic State of the Union, unapologetic in channeling the love Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson had for placing long lists of initiatives on the nation’s agenda. Obama sees his second term not as a time of consolidation but as an occasion for decisively changing the direction of our politics.

Here was an Obama unafraid to lay out a compelling argument for the urgency of acting on global warming. He was undaunted in challenging the obsession with the federal budget — and in scolding Congress for going from “one manufactured crisis to the next.” By insisting that “we can’t just cut our way to prosperity” and that “deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan,” he brought to mind the great liberal economist John Maynard Keynes. He sought to add another big achievement to near universal health-care coverage, announcing a new goal of making “high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.”

And Obama made clear his determination to shift the center of gravity in the nation’s political conversation away from anti-government conservatism, offering a vision that is the antithesis of the supply-side economics that has dominated conservative thought since the Reagan era.

If supply-siders claim that prosperity depends upon showering financial benefits on wealthy “job creators” at the economy’s commanding heights, Obama argued that economic well-being emanates from the middle and bottom, with help from a government that “works on behalf of the many, and not just the few.”

The “true engine of America’s economic growth,” he said, is a “rising, thriving middle class.” He continued: “It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country, the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love.” With that last phrase, he linked gay rights to an older liberalism’s devotion to class solidarity and racial equality.

An Obama no longer worried about reelection was the worst nightmare of conservatives who feared he would veer far to the left if given the chance. In the GOP’s response, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) conjured that liberal bogeyman, declaring that the president’s “solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more.”

But Rubio’s rhetoric felt stale, disconnected from the Obama who spoke before him. Obama did speak for liberalism, yes, but it is a tempered liberalism. His preschool proposal, after all, is modeled in part on the success of a program in Oklahoma, one of the nation’s reddest states. Most of the president’s initiatives involve modest new spending and many, including his infrastructure and manufacturing plans, are built on partnerships with private industry.

Even the president’s welcomed call to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour and to index it to inflation was cautious by his own standards. In 2008, Obama had urged a $9.50 minimum wage, and it rightly ought to be set at $10 or above.

Moreover, the president’s words were carefully calibrated to the issue in question. On immigration reform — in deference to cross-party work in which Rubio himself is engaged — Obama kept the rhetorical temperature low, praising “bipartisan groups in both chambers.” But he invoked all of his rhetorical skills on the matter of gun safety, a more complex legislative sell. His gospel-preacher’s variations on the phrase “they deserve a vote” will long echo in the House chamber.

No, the liberated Obama is not some new, leftist tribune. He’s the moderately progressive Obama who started running for president before there was a financial crisis or a tea party. In his 2006 book “The Audacity of Hope,” he proposed to end polarization by organizing a “broad majority of Americans” who would be “re-engaged in the project of national renewal” and would “see their own self-interest as inextricably linked to the interests of others.” On Tuesday night, creating this majority was what he still had in mind.

USATODAY

A good bit of Chris Christie%27s appeal stems from a pension overhaul.

Most of the states and cities in trouble have gotten where they are under Democratic leadership.

Mayor of San Jose%2C Calif.%2C is leading an effort of Democratic mayors to amend his state%27s constitution.

This month's races for governor sent a widely noted message that Republicans will do much better if they nominate center-right candidates like New Jersey's Chris Christie than far-right candidates like Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli.

Less remarked was the message that the New Jersey race sent to Democrats. It is not often that a state votes for a Democratic president by nearly 18 percentage points one year and then for a Republican governor by an even larger margin the next.

One lesson is that public disgust with government — and particularly government spending — includes anger over the unaffordable sweetheart deals that states and localities signed with public employee labor unions, a core Democratic constituency.

A good bit of Christie's appeal stems from a pension overhaul he engineered that pushes back retirement ages and requires workers to contribute more. Similarly, in Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker faced down public-sector unions and survived a recall election. ""Wisconsin's pension system is the only one in the country that is fully funded,"" Walker writes in his bookUnintimidated, which comes out today.

Fueling taxpayers' anger is that they are financing benefits no longer available to most private-sector workers. Some state and local government workers can retire in their 50s, after 33 years of service, and continue drawing the same income.

Estimates for the total shortfall of public pensions start at about $700 billion. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office said that $2 trillion to $3 trillion was more accurate. Even a long bull market won't make the problem go away.

Some of the pension shortfall is the result of governments not putting as much into the plans as they promised. But a prime reason that pension costs have spiraled out of control is that spineless public officials buy votes by creating liabilities that won't come due until long after they leave office.

If Democrats become the party that ignores this crisis, they will face a lot more New Jerseys and Wisconsins in their future. Democrats aren't the only ones who have created extraordinary pension liabilities, but most of the states and cities in trouble have gotten where they are under Democratic leadership.

Detroit is Exhibit A for municipal irresponsibility. It negotiated generous pensions, even overpaid in some cases, as the city began its long descent into bankruptcy. Illinois tops most lists of states in trouble.

Some Democratic officeholders see the growing resentment against public-sector pensions and are trying to get in front of the issue. The mayor of San Jose, Calif., Chuck Reed, is leading an effort of Democratic mayors to amend his state's constitution to allow cities to renegotiate pensions of current employees for future years worked.

For Democrats, the choice is clear. They can let their communities fall deeper and deeper into debt. Or they can lead on the issue, and even make a progressive case for pension reform. Excessive retiree benefits — which account for 20% of San Jose's $1.1 billion budget, for instance — drain governments of the money needed for education, housing, parks and public safety.

If Democrats don't take on this issue, they will see their communities deteriorate. They will also invite more Republicans like Chris Christie to come in and begin the work that they refuse to do.

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said he thinks ""Muslim brotherhood members"" have ""influence"" in President Barack Obama's administration.

In an interview on WND Radio published on Thursday, Gohmert criticized immigration reform efforts in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, claiming that ""radical Islam is at war"" with America.

""It’s very clear to everybody but this administration that radical Islam is at war against us,"" Gohmert said.""And I’m hoping either this administration will wake up or a new one will come in at the next election before irreparable damage is done.""

Gohmert then implied that ""Muslim brotherhood members"" influence the Obama administration.

""Thank God for the moderates that don’t approve of what’s being done,"" Gohmert continued. ""But this administration has so many Muslim brotherhood members that have influence that they just are making wrong decisions for America.""

This is not the first time Gohmert has brought ""radical Islam"" into a conversation about immigration.

On April 17, Gohmert claimed that ""radical Islamists"" were being ""trained to act like Hispanic[s]"" in regards to crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We know al Qaeda has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border,"" Gohmert said. ""We know that people that are now being trained to come in and act like Hispanic [sic] when they are radical Islamists.""

Gohmert's comments echo a Tea Party group that blamed the Boston Marathon bombings on Obama and ""radical Islam."""

S%26P 500 gains more in Obama%27s first term than his last four predecessors

President%27s tenure coincided with end of bear market and Great Recession%2C creating fuel for rebound

History shows that presidential second terms are not as bullish for stocks

NEW YORK — Despite critics that brand him as anti-business and anti-Wall Street, President Obama's first term in the White House has been bullish for stocks.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 85% since Obama was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009, says S&P Capital IQ. That stellar return tops first-term gains of Obama's past four predecessors: George. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.

Using the Dow Jones industrial average, Obama ranks third in first-term stock performance of all presidents; Franklin D. Roosevelt is No. 1, says Bespoke Investment Group.

On March 3, 2009, six days before the end of the worst bear market since the Great Depression, Obama urged skittish investors to buy beaten-down U.S. stocks.

At a time when fear was high and it seemed like stocks would never stop falling, says Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory firm Yardeni Research, valuations ""are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.""

""You have to give him credit for that market call,"" Yardeni added.

Obama's prognostication was spot on. Despite the criticism he has received since the Great Recession for backing massive taxpayer-funded bailouts of banks and automakers, and using borrowed money to stimulate the economy, stocks have responded positively.

The current bull market, which turns four years old March 9, is up 120% and ranks eighth best of all time, Bespoke says.

Does the president deserve the credit? Probably not, Yardeni says. ""There is a tendency to correlate investment cycles to political cycles,"" he says.

""But it is not the sole determining factor, nor the most significant factor.""

J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, says while Obama deserves some credit, he also benefited from a ""little bit of luck,"" the knowledge that big stimulus packages were in the pipeline, as well as being in ""the right place at the right time.""

The Obama bounce was driven by the following factors:

• Oversold market was due for a rebound. The stock market cratered 57% in the bear market that ended two months after Obama took office. And the 18-month-long Great Recession, was over five months after Inauguration Day.

Stocks tend to rise when the economy emerges from recession. In FDR's first term beginning in 1933 after the Great Depression, stocks rallied 149%, says S&P Capital IQ.

• Help from the Fed. The Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policies to jump-start the economy, including 0% short-term interest rates and the purchase of government and mortgage-backed bonds to keep borrowing costs low, have been a major driver of stock prices during Obama's term, Yardeni says.

""I would say that the great performance of the stock market has a lot more to do with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke than Obama,"" Yardeni says.

History says stock returns are more muted in a president's final term in office. Since 1900, stocks have risen just 10.2%, on average in term two, vs. a gain of 67% in first terms, says Bespoke."

At the moment, everyone is screaming about the “scandal” of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.

Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.

Advertisement

The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations.

The organizations at issue are known as 501(c)4 groups (call them C4s for short) after the section of the tax code that applies to them. They’re nonprofit “social welfare” organizations that by law must be devoted primarily to programs broadly serving their communities, not private groups. IRS forms reveal what the agency considers to be mainstream C4s: religious groups; cultural, educational and veterans organizations, homeowners associations, volunteer fire departments. In recent years, however, overtly political groups have been claiming C4 status, which allows them to keep their donor lists secret and to avoid paying taxes on certain income.

Our lunatic campaign finance system is what turned the typical C4 from a volunteer fire department into a conduit of anonymous political cash. Big donors were given the green light to spend freely on elections by the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. That wasn’t good enough for some; they wanted to distribute their largess secretly.

C4s were there for the exploitation, and the result has been a wholesale decline of donor disclosure on the national level: As recently as 1998, nearly 100% of all donors to federal campaigns were publicly identified, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. By the 2012 presidential election, that was down to 40%.

The beneficiaries of the C4 tax break, understandably, will employ any subterfuge to keep it. That’s what’s behind the current firestorm over disclosures that in 2010 and 2011, IRS personnel screened requests for C4 status by applicant organizations with “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12"" in their names.

Those weren’t the only groups whose applications were selected for extra scrutiny on the reasoning that they might be devoted to more than “social welfare.” According to an IRS Inspector General report made public this week, they represented only about a third of the 298 applications selected. That was certainly too coarse a screen, and by January 2012 the IRS had scrapped those definitions. It had substituted a screen designed to capture “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the constitution and bill of rights, [and] social economic reform/movement.”

Advertisement

Conservatives contend that this is still an anti-conservative screen. It sounds perfectly neutral to me, unless someone knows of a conservative organization devoted to “expanding government,” or unless right-wing groups are supposed to have a monopoly on “social economic reform.” In any case, the inspector general found that most of the 298 selected applications indeed showed indications of “significant” political activity that might have made them ineligible for the tax exemption.

It’s about time the IRS subjected all of these outfits to scrutiny. The agency’s inaction has served the purposes of donors and political organizations on both sides of the aisle, and contributed to the explosive infection of the electoral process by big money from individuals and corporations.

Nor is Congress innocent. The lawmakers have dodged their responsibility to make the rules crystal clear. On the rare occasions when the IRS has tried gingerly to impose regulatory order, members of Congress have forced the agency to back off. There should be a rule in Washington that if you give regulators deliberately vague guidelines, you’re not allowed to protest when they try to figure out where the lines are.

Thanks to ambiguity about what it means to be “primarily” concerned with “social welfare,” political activists have reaped a bonanza for years while the IRS ignored their chicanery. And once again, now that the agency has tried to regulate, the regulated parties have blown its efforts up into a “scandal.” It’s amusing to reflect that some politicians making hay over this are the same people who contend that we don’t need more regulations, we just need to enforce the ones we have. (Examples: gun control and banking regulation.) Here’s a case where the IRS is trying to enforce regulations that Congress enacted, and it’s still somehow doing the wrong thing.

Keep that in mind when you hear politicians — and they’re not exclusively Republicans — grandstanding about how the IRS actions are “chilling” or “un-American.” It turns out that none of the “targeted” groups actually was denied C4 status. Nevertheless, says Sheila Krumholz, director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “There’s a sense of discomfort that the IRS was doing much of anything.”

The IRS wasn’t actually doing much. The biggest C4s, including one founded by GOP operative Karl Rove and another run by ex-Obama campaign staffers, got their C4 status routinely. The little guys got questionnaires.

C4s are curious creatures in the tax code. They’re allowed to engage in lobbying, but not (“primarily”) in campaign activity. Their donors don’t get a tax deduction, but the organizations are tax-exempt. For example, they don’t have to pay taxes on income they earn by investing donated funds. But what makes C4s especially attractive to people who want to funnel money into politics is this: They don’t have to identify their donors.

Remember the mysterious $11-million donation to the campaign for California’s anti-union Proposition 32 last November? When the state Fair Political Practices Commission punctured its anonymity, it found not one, but two 501(c)4 organizations behind it. The FPPC, which is still investigating, has already called this a case of “campaign money laundering.”

As of September last year, the center found, some $254 million, or 20%, of all outside spending came through C4s. The biggest C4 in the electoral arena was Crossroads GPS, an affiliate of American Crossroads, a campaign organization founded by Rove. The Obama camp’s C4 was known as Priorities USA.

The IRS was swamped by the wave. The number of groups seeking C4 status from the agency rose from 1,500 in 2010 to 3,400 last year. Meanwhile, the agency was being pulled in two directions. In February last year, seven Democratic senators complained that the IRS was too “permissive” with its rules, which judged a C4 not to be engaged “primarily” in electioneering as long as no more than 49% of its spending went to such activities. In August, 10 GOP senators warned the agency to deep-six any efforts to tighten the rules on C4s.

Already in 2011, an IRS disclosure that it was auditing five big donors to determine whether they owed gift taxes for donations to C4s had caused a political uproar. (The gift tax can be up to 35% of a donation in excess of $14,000 per recipient and a $5.25-million lifetime exemption, paid by the donor.) GOP lawmakers accused the IRS of “targeting constitutionally protected political speech.” As Ellen Aprill, a tax law expert at Loyola Law School, observed later that year, “at that point, the IRS threw in the towel” — even though there was little doubt that the tax levy was proper and plainly constitutional.

The danger inherent in the latest faux controversy is that the IRS will have its wings clipped before its investigation of C4s is fully fledged. Politicos and pundits are in a lather over the questions the agency put to targeted organizations to determine their social welfare bona fides — things like the identity of their board members and the amount of time and money spent on “electoral issues,” and endorsements of candidates. These facts would be pretty fundamental to determining whether an organization is political, wouldn’t you say?

The IRS also asked some groups for the identity of their donors. The inspector general contends that request was inappropriate. Still, if the IRS discovered that a major donor to a C4 was, say, the politically active billionaire Sheldon Adelson, wouldn’t that suggest that the group might not be a plain vanilla “homeowners association”? By the same token, when the pro-Obama C4 Priorities USA disclosed that it had five anonymous donors, one of whom contributed $1.9 million, or 84% of the total, wouldn’t it help an investigator to know who that person is?

Let’s remember that a tax exemption handed over to any group costs all of us money. It’s proper for the IRS to scrutinize applicants. The biggest laugh line uttered in this affair is that the IRS is somehow “harassing” these public-spirited organizations by asking them to justify their status. Here’s a good rule of thumb: You don’t want to get harassed by the IRS? Then don’t claim a tax exemption you may not deserve.

Mr. Obama, addressing the annual convention of the Disabled American Veterans, said that his administration was finally shrinking a backlog of years of benefits claims — by 20 percent in the past five months. But new waves of claims were coming in, he added, including from aging Vietnam veterans able to seek help for ailments that may stem from exposure to Agent Orange, and from recent combat casualties suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries.

“This time of war may be coming to an end, but the job of caring for our veterans goes on,” Mr. Obama said. “And our work caring for our newest veterans has only just begun.”

The president noted that even though the last veteran of World War I died two years ago, survivor benefits still go to the children of those who fought in that war, as well as in the Spanish-American War, and even to the daughter of a Civil War veteran — just as benefits will go to the heirs of what he called “the 9/11 generation.”"

USA TODAY

President Obama met Friday with Senate Republicans

Sen. Susan Collins%2C R-Maine%2C is seeking consensus for a plan to end the shutdown and avert default

House Republicans continue separate negotiations with the White House

WASHINGTON — Negotiations to end the government shutdown and avert default continued into the weekend as House and Senate Republicans traded offers among themselves and with the White House in efforts to find a pathway out of the impasse.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president and Congress are ""obviously in a better place than we were a few days ago in terms of the constructive approach that we've seen of late"" but there was still no agreement. ""We're talking about a very fluid situation.""

President Obama told business leaders on a conference call Friday that he hoped a deal could be struck this weekend. The president also spoke with 25 governors from both parties.

After a meeting Friday at the White House between Obama and Senate Republicans, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said, ""The question is: Can you get something in the next 72 hours? The president seems committed to being engaged in it, and he hadn't been up to this point, so I'm optimistic.""

House and Senate Republicans appear to be pursuing different negotiations with the White House, and it is unclear whether any proposal can win over Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who leads congressional Democrats in the talks.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have been in communication but James Lankford, R-Okla., said House and Senate Republicans are ""working independent"" of each other.

""There's not the sense of 'Let's the two of us have the exact same plan and try to work together,'"" Lankford said.

Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., met separately with McConnell and Boehner on Friday and told reporters they were hopeful the House would move first. ""I think the House going first would be the best thing. That would be the preferred outcome,"" Graham said.

Democrats have resisted GOP efforts, led by Boehner, to engage in budget talks until the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is increased in advance of the Oct. 17 deadline.

Boehner and Obama spoke by phone Friday afternoon but reached no agreement except to keep talking.

The shutdown, in its 11th day, began when Republicans demanded a delay or defunding of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to keep the government running. The funding discussion has become entwined with proposals to increase the U.S. borrowing limit so the nation can continue to pay its bills on time. Republicans have moved on from focusing on the health care law and seek broader concessions on fiscal issues.

Congress will continue to work through the weekend. House Republicans will huddle Saturday morning, and the Senate is scheduled to vote on a key procedural hurdle to move forward with a 15-month increase in the debt ceiling with no conditions attached.

Boehner has offered a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks, but Carney said Obama believes that is too short a time frame and creates the possibility of another standoff right before the Thanksgiving and holiday shopping seasons.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is working with senators in both parties on a budget framework that includes a six-month stopgap funding bill through March and a debt ceiling increase through January. The extensions would give Congress breathing room to reach a broader budget agreement.

""I believe that still gives us plenty of leverage to work out a long-term fiscal plan, but it removes the threat of an immediate default,"" Collins said Friday.

House Republicans have also proposed a short-term stopgap spending bill to reopen the government after Obama rejected their proposal for only a debt ceiling increase.

Senate Republicans seemed more inclined to support a framework with longer-term time agreements than House Republicans seek, suggesting a divide between the two chambers on the way forward. ""I think everybody agrees that the length of time dictates the framework of what's in the agreement, so you don't get as much for a shorter term and you get more for a longer term,"" Burr said.

Some Republicans seem eager to resolve the impasse. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., cited a ""devastating"" NBC/Wall Street Journal polled released Thursday which showed the Republican Party's favorable rating at an all-time low. ""I know that they're reading the polls,"" McCain said of House Republicans.

McCain has been a vocal critic of the GOP's strategy in the shutdown fight, particularly their efforts to dismantle the president's health care law. The senator said the negotiations are lagging because of Obama's wariness of House Republicans.

""The president is very reluctant to commit to anything because he has to deal with the House of Representatives, but I'm encouraged by the attitude that's been displayed,"" McCain said. ""He sees progress, but we're a long way from (a deal.)"""

But while Congress convened once again Thursday to weigh a set of mini-spending bills, President Obama hit the stump 20 miles away -- taking his bid to pressure Republicans, once again, on the road.

At a construction company in Rockville, Md., Obama blasted the ""reckless Republican shutdown in Washington,"" and called on Congress to fix it by passing a budget ""with no partisan strings attached.""

He warned that the economic impact will get ""worse"" the longer it drags on, and accused House Speaker John Boehner of catering to ""extremists"" by not bringing a straight budget bill to the floor.

Republicans, meanwhile, complained that Obama had called them to the White House a day earlier without offering any concessions.

""It was essentially a negotiation about not negotiating,"" Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said. He added: ""It's time for Democrats to start acting responsibly. It's time to work with us and get our way out of this mess.""

Ahead of the president's visit on Thursday, the White House made clear the president was not budging off his position that Republicans must pass a ""clean"" spending bill, free of provisions dealing with ObamaCare. ""He will not negotiate. He will not offer concessions to Republicans in exchange for not tanking the economy,"" press secretary Jay Carney said.

The president held a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday with bipartisan congressional leaders, but the session ended as it began -- with each party retreating to previously stated positions and a compromise nowhere in sight.

Obama is now returning to a tactic he's employed many times before, making his case to supporters at campaign-style events in a bid to increase pressure from the outside on his political foes. The tactic, though, continues to open the president to Republican accusations that he's veering clear of the negotiating table, where a deal presumably would be struck.

""At times like this, the American people expect their leaders to come together and to try to find ways to resolve their differences,"" Boehner said Wednesday evening after the White House session broke up. ""The president reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate.""

Ever since the president rallied for the passage of a national stimulus package in 2009, Obama has made campaign-style speeches part of his repertoire in advocating for legislation.

The past year has been filled with these kinds of events. Last December, Obama rallied Detroit union supporters over tax hikes amid the fiscal cliff showdown

Then in February, he pressured Republicans, from a shipyard in Virginia, to strike a deal on the sequester to avoid harsh spending cuts. The tactic didn't work -- the ""supercommittee"" tasked with solving the problem ended up deadlocked, and the cuts went into effect.

Then came a national push for gun control legislation. Then again in May, Obama launched an effort to pressure Congress to hold down student loan rates.

It's unclear whether Obama's pressure campaign will work this time. Republican leaders are no doubt cognizant that during the last partial government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, their party was largely blamed for the impasse and suffered in the next elections.

But the party is holding the line, arguing that their demands that ObamaCare be curtailed are in line with what the American people want.

While Obama is on the road, House Republicans are trying to increase pressure on the president's party by calling up a series of mini-spending bills and daring Democrats to oppose them. The House on Thursday, in a 265-160 vote, approved a bill to fund the National Guard and Reserve, and debated another to fund the Veterans Affairs Department. On Wednesday, the House -- without much Democratic support -- approved bills to fund the national parks and the National Institutes of Health. Another bill was passed allowing the District of Columbia to spend its own funds.

Tempers were flaring among the rank-and-file as leaders failed to reach a compromise.

Lawmakers spent the evening Wednesday shouting at each other. In perhaps the most intense exchange, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., repeatedly accused his GOP colleagues of waging ""jihad"" on Americans.

Miller, who was a champion of the federal health care law when it was being drafted, claimed Republicans who are now complaining about the national parks being closed did not show the same concern over health care. He said: ""When you were on the jihad against Americans' access to health care, shutting down the parks wasn't a problem. Shutting down NIH wasn't a problem.""

Miller was then ruled ""out of order."" After he left the floor, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, said he was ""disgusted"" by Miller's comments.

""We should all reject his comments,"" Simpson said, adding that Miller should be formally censured ""but I won't call for it."""

Larry Summers%2C Obama%27s former economic adviser%2C seen as gaining support recently

Janet Yellen helped craft Fed response to financial crisis

White House has said only that a decision will be made in the fall

President Obama will pick the first woman to head the Federal Reserve — one of the world's most powerful jobs -- over a veteran Washington insider, economists surveyed by USA TODAY predict.

Thirty-two economists said they expect Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen to succeed Chairman Ben Bernanke next year. Four predicted Obama will nominate Larry Summers, his former economic adviser and President Clinton's Treasury secretary.

The survey was done last week amid a flurry of media reports suggesting that the field was narrowing to a choice between Yellen and Summers or that Summers was the front-runner.

The White House has said only that a decision will be made in the fall. In an interview with The New York Times published over the weekend, Obama said he has narrowed his choice to ""some extraordinary candidates."" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew declined to express a preference in an interview on ABC's This Week on Sunday.

Yellen is ""extremely well-qualified and she's been there through the (financial) crisis,"" says Diane Swonk, chief economist of Mesirow Financial. ""We need continuity.""

Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist of Morgan Stanley and former head of monetary affairs at the Fed, thinks Obama will pick Summers.

""The president really has tended to reward loyalty,"" Reinhart says, ""and Summers has that history with the president that Yellen doesn't.""

The presumptive horse race between Yellen and Summers to be the nation's top economist has transfixed Washington in a uneventful political summer even though the White House says a nominee won't be announced until fall.

After reports last week that Summers may be emerging as the favorite, Senate Democrats began a petition in support of Yellen and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed her in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""It would be great to have a woman,"" Pelosi said.

Bernanke hasn't said whether he plans to step down when his second four-year term ends in January, but his departure is widely expected.

The Fed chairman is the most influential voice on a policymaking committee that can speed up or slow down U.S. economic growth by lowering or raising interest rates, among other moves that ripple across the global economy.

Yellen, 66, chaired the Council of Economic Advisors under Clinton and headed the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank for six years before becoming vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors in 2010.

Obama likely would relish the opportunity to nominate the first female Fed chief, says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS.

Like Bernanke, Yellen has used a collegial style to push through bold programs by building consensus on the Fed's politically diverse Federal Open Market Committee.

""She convinces people through the strength of her argument but she's not argumentative,"" says Swonk, with Mesirow Financial.

Summers, 58, is widely regarded as brilliant but sometimes arrogant. ""Summers doesn't play nicely with others,"" Swonk says. ""Congress doesn't like him."" As Treasury secretary, she says, he took part in the 1990s banking industry deregulation that led to the 2008 financial crisis.

Reinhart says criticism of Summers as domineering is overstated, noting he held senior positions in two administrations that required him to work with colleagues.

As Obama's chief economic adviser in his first term, Summers was a key architect of the policies that helped pull the nation from recession and he is viewed as having a steady hand in a crisis.

Most telling, Reinhart says, is that the White House apparently is floating Summers' name. ""But we haven't heard anything that can really be construed as a trial balloon about Yellen,"" he says."

http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/18/news/economy/federal-reserve-taper/index.html,2013-12-18 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],"Federal Reserve tapers its stimulus program, citing stronger job market","Federal Reserve officials decided Wednesday to start gradually reducing their massive economic stimulus program.

Beginning in January, the Fed will buy $75 billion in bonds each month, down from the $85 billion it had been buying since September 2012.

""In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases,"" the Fed said in a statement.

The Fed decided to cut back on both types of bond purchases -- mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries -- by $5 billion per month each.

The bond-buying program has become so large, it's expected to push the Fed's assets to $4 trillion this week -- money the Fed basically created out of thin air.

The new cut represents the beginning of a gradual wind-down process which Wall Street has nicknamed ""tapering.""

But the complete end to Fed stimulus is still probably years away.

Fed officials have been stressing lately that tapering does not mean ""tightening."" In fact, the Fed extended its commitment to keep short-term interest rates ""exceptionally low"" until either the unemployment rate falls to around 6.5% or the inflation rate exceeds 2.5% a year.

At a press conference immediately following the announcement, Bernanke stressed that the Fed's actions did not amount to a withdrawal of support for the economy. ""Nothing we did today was intended to reduce accommodation,"" he said.

Most officials expect rates to rise in 2015, despite the fact that inflation will likely still be below the target at that point.

Bernanke also explained that the Fed had ""enhanced"" its forward guidance on keeping interest rates low.

""The committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low, as well as inflation that is too high,"" Bernanke said.

But rates will remain low for a while, so consumers can still expect to lock in historically cheap rates on mortgages, car or business loans, albeit probably not at the record lows seen earlier this year.

Stocks jumped following the announcement, with the Dow gaining 200 points after the news.

Related: Will the market actually cheer tapering?

How we got here: Traditionally, the Fed has used low interest rates to stimulate the economy in times of stress, but in the most recent financial crisis, it was forced to take unprecedented measures.

First, the Fed slashed its key interest rate to near-zero in 2008.

Next, in a program known as ""quantitative easing,"" or QE, the Fed started buying bonds like U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to lower long-term interest rates too.

That second move came in three rounds that have since been nicknamed QE1, QE2 and QE3.

Among them, QE3 was the only program that wasn't given an explicit end-date. Instead, the Fed said it was looking for substantial improvement in the job market. But there's room for interpretation on what exactly that means. The Fed already botched some of its communications surrounding the word ""substantial.""

Back in May, for example, Chairman Ben Bernanke said he believed the Fed would start to taper ""later this year,"" ending the bond-buying program completely in 2014, when the unemployment rate falls to around 7%.

Wall Street believed him, and stocks started falling and bond yields started rising over the summer.

But then the Fed met in July, September and October without taking action, and the unemployment rate fell to 7% in November, but still there was no taper.

Only one Fed member -- Eric Rosengren of the Boston Federal Reserve -- formally dissented against Wednesday's decision. He felt that unemployment was still too high and inflation was still too low to begin pulling back on stimulus.

Bernanke will attend one more policy meeting next month, before his term as Fed chair ends January 31. The rest of the Fed's exit strategy will have to be left to his presumed successor, Janet Yellen.

President Obama nominated Yellen for the position in October, and the Senate is expected to confirm her this week."

New York City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez rallies with fired Domino's workers.

Employees of a Washington Heights Domino's claim they were fired from their delivery jobs after complaining to management about unfair wages. Workers at the 181st street chain participated in last Thursday's nationwide walkout in solidarity with the country's underpaid fast food workers, which included strong numbers of workers and supporters in New York City. Following the walkout, delivery workers—who are paid under $6 an hour and rely on tips to make a living wage—were asked to work extended hours inside the restaurant but were not offered increased hourly pay for their time inside the store. After bringing the issue to management's attention, the 24 employees were fired.

In response to last week's strike by fast food workers, Manhattan Domino's Pizza provided a crystal-clear example of why fast food workers are striking and organizing for better wages and working conditions:To recap: Some workers staged a walkout because of inadequate pay. Management's response was to get other workers to work atto keep the store staffed. And when they complained—about something illegal, mind you—they were fired.

Wage theft is very common at New York City fast food outlets, with 84 percent of workers saying they've experienced things like being forced to work off the clock, not being paid overtime, or, as in this case, being made to work at the tipped worker minimum wage while doing work that won't get them any tips. And given how common these forms of lawbreaking are, it's clear that corporate management tacitly condones wage theft.

Sign the petition telling Domino’s Pizza to reinstate the 20 employees they fired."

The deal, while modest in scope, amounts to a cease-fire in the budget wars that have debilitated Washington since 2011 and gives lawmakers breathing room to try to address the real drivers of federal spending — health care and entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security — and to reshape the tax code.

For a Capitol used to paralyzing partisan gridlock, the accord between Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, was a reminder that even fierce political combatants can find common ground. Mr. Ryan praised the deal in the most elementary terms as a way to “get our government functioning at its very basic levels.”

Both negotiators promised an end to uncertainty and the lurching from crisis to crisis, at least for a year. But both parties sought to preserve their ability to force another showdown over fiscal matters; the government’s statutory borrowing authority will lapse as early as March, another potential crisis."
http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-push-extend-emergency-u-jobless-benefits-202401686--business.html,,[],Democrats push to extend emergency U.S. jobless benefits,"By Caren Bohan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats are pushing to extend emergency unemployment benefits, saying they are needed to help the economy and provide a safety net for Americans struggling in a sluggish job market. Extending unemployment benefits is a priority of President Barack Obama, and his fellow Democrats see an opportunity to include such an extension in a possible budget deal that is being negotiated by a bipartisan panel led by Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington. ""This is a human crisis for hundreds of thousands of people,"" said Michigan Congressman Sander Levin, senior Democrat on the House of Representative Ways and Means Committee and a lead sponsor of legislation in the House that would continue federal unemployment benefits through 2014. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, is a lead sponsor of identical legislation in the Senate. Without the legislation, 1.3 million Americans will see their benefits expire in the week of December 28, Democrats warned. That would have ripple effects through the economy because it would curb household spending while the economy is growing at only a modest pace. The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7.3 percent in October, according to the Labor Department. Federal unemployment benefits kick in for out-of-work Americans who have exhausted their state unemployment aid, which in many states runs out after 26 weeks. The emergency aid began during the Great Recession in 2008 and has been renewed every year since, most recently as part of the budget deal to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" of automatic tax increases. The budget negotiating panel faces a December 13 deadline to reach a deal. A month later, on January 15, funding for federal agencies is due to run out unless Congress can agree on spending measures. Democratic supporters of the unemployment insurance legislation said there are other possible bills to which they might seek to attach the extension, but they view the budget negotiations as the best avenue for getting it passed by Congress.

And he accepted our demand.""

""And then I told the president, 'Okay, we'll give you everything you want.' And he accepted our demand.""

With the passage of this bill today, it’s pretty clear that we’re sending a message to the Democrat-controlled Senate that it’s time to do your job. … The principal [note: in a statement this dumb, you'd think they'd at least spell ""principle"" correctly] I think is pretty simple: no budget, no pay. Listen, American families have to do a budget. They understand you can’t continue to spend money that you don’t have. We’re committed to doing a budget on the House side – a budget that will balance over the next 10 years. It’s time for the Senate and the president to show the American people how they’re willing to balance the budget over the next 10 years.

So House Republicans suspend the debt limit through May 19, giving President Obama authority to effectively raise the debt ceiling on his own, they do it with basically no meaningful strings attached, and they do it after having repeatedly pledged to never, ever raise the debt limit without cutting at least one dollar in spending for each dollar of debt limit increase. But despite having utterly capitulated, House Speaker John Boehner declared victory (although he apparently did so while trying to dodge the press ):Hold on, what? House Republicans just passed legislation raising the debt limit in essentially unlimited fashion ... and their post-vote messaging doesn't even mention the fact that they just raised the debt limit? Instead, they're talking about how they sent a message to the Senate about passing a budget resolution that is already mandated by the 1974 Budget Impoundment and Control Act.

It's not that I was expecting them to come out and hail the demise of the Boehner rule, but do they really think this nonsense is convincing spin? Apparently so:





@GOPLeader via web Interesting. For years, the economy struggled & the Senate never acted. It took one week with Senate pay on the line, for them to step up.

Hahaha, talk about living in a fantasy land. The idea that any single senator, let alone a majority of them, give a damn about the possibility of their paychecks getting delayed by a few months is hilarious. I mean, in 2010 the average net worth in the Senate was more than $13 million dollars, and yet House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is seriously trying to sell this idiotic talking point. What a joke.

You'd think House Republicans would be trying to repair the brand damage that their hostage taking bluff caused, but instead they pushing stupid rightwing Twitter derp. The explanation is obvious: they are scared to death of their own political base. They know their base is wrong, and they know if they did what their base wanted they would have no chance of winning a general election. If that wasn't the case, they wouldn't have caved on the debt limit. But they are nonetheless trembling in fear.

As a result, instead of taking part in a declaration of victory for common sense, they continue to spew nonsense. And it won't end anytime soon: to win over conservative House members, GOP leadership promised to deliver a balanced budget. This budget is going to make the Ryan budget look like a Christmas tree. As Greg Sargent reports, it will literally shred government to ribbons. There's no other way to balance the budget. Of course, the budget will be dead on arrival because Democrats will never support it. That's probably the one bit of good news here for Republicans: the one thing they don't have to fear is their ideas getting implemented into law."

They think the trends are going to go in their direction at the end of the week, or early next week at the latest; because again, the press is largely sympathetic to their arguments on this.”

—

In short: The government is going to shut down because Obama knows the media has his back and therefore feels no pressure to enter into negotiations that might avert a shutdown. In fact, Obama is apparently okay letting the government shut down because he knows the media won’t make him pay a political price for it.

So what we have here is the media’s pro-Obama bias as a big factor in a potential shutdown.

As we have seen all year, when it comes to settled laws on issues such as gun control, voter ID, and immigration, the media are big believers in the kind of “civil bipartisan compromise” that results in changing those laws — as long as all that “civil bipartisan compromise” comes from the GOP.

But the media have completely abandoned their championing of “civil bipartisan compromise” with respect to this budget crisis, and as a result, Obama knows he has the media on his side and is therefore comfortable in his position not to negotiate. And Obama’s refusal to compromise is hurtling America towards a government shutdown.

What we have here is a situation wherein media bias is helping to inflame a crisis. In other words, were the media acting responsibly, objectively, and professionallly, this would actually decrease the chances of a shutdown. Obviously, though, the media wants its cake and to eat it too. The media are behaving in a way that increases the chances of a shutdown and then the media will blame the GOP for what the media helped cause.

Now we also know why Obama felt so secure golfing during this weekend’s shutdown crisis, instead of rolling up his sleeves like a leader to make a deal. Why not? He knows the media won’t blame him for anything, including shutting down the government.

Next up: A grande push to solve the nation's long-term debt problems.

The CEO of Starbucks already mobilized his customer base, gathering signatures to reopen the government and hike the debt ceiling in order to stave off a U.S. default.

The 1.7 million petition signatures that his baristas collected may or may not have had anything to do with the end of the stand off. But Schultz is convinced it helped.

On Friday Starbucks published ads in USA Today and the Washington Post taking a victory lap of sorts for the shutdown petition, saying ""We are all reminded and inspired how a spirit of civility and common purpose can help move America forward.""

Now he plans to call on his customers to push Washington to solve its budget woes. When Congress voted Wednesday night to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, it set new deadlines that will likely result in another budget showdown.

So in a second letter to the 300 other business leaders, Schultz has vowed to do more.

""I continue to believe we cannot be bystanders about our collective future,"" he wrote. "" We are going to have to become more engaged so that Washington doesn't fall back into this kind of unnecessary crisis every few months.""

Schultz didn't offer any details about his plans for the future. But he did say that the response to the petition drive ""has inspired me to think more about what we can do at Starbucks to continue to use our scale for good.""

In December 2011, as Congress debated the so-called ""fiscal cliff,"" he asked employees at its approximately 120 D.C.-area stores to write ""Come Together"" on coffee cups when serving customers.

Schultz has also taken high-profile positions on several other controversial issues that have little to do with Starbucks' business.

Last month he issued a public plea asking customers not to bring their guns into Starbucks. He has also been an outspoken advocate of same-sex marriage, telling shareholders who don't agree ""you can sell your shares of Starbucks."""

The showdown puts more than 700,000 active and retired public workers — school teachers outside Chicago, university employees, lawmakers, and rank-and-file state workers — in the middle over how to fix the nation's worst-funded state retirement system.



Cullerton's Senate Democratic majority sent his legislation to the House on a 40-16 vote as he called on colleagues to join him in support of a pension plan that has ""strong constitutional principles.""



The Senate leader contended Madigan's version of pension reform is ""risky"" because it will be found unconstitutional and will cost the state more time in trying to enact reform.



At the center of Cullerton's legislation is his belief that the people in the systems must be allowed to have a choice of new pension options in order to get around the Illinois Constitution's contractual obligation long believe to ban any diminishment or impairment to pensions.



But the series of options under the Cullerton plan would save about a third of the $150 billion that the Madgian proposal would save — a point that has prompted most of the Senate Republicans to side with the speaker rather than Cullerton.



""This is not the bill that would do the most for the people of this state,"" said Senate Republican Christine Radogno of Lemont.



The Madigan proposal centers on raising the retirement age, scaling back cost-of-living increases and calling for current workers to kick in another 2 percent of their paychecks that would be phased in over this summer and next.



The speaker again today predicted his legislation is the version that will pass. He has said his proposal would be signed by Gov. Pat Quinn and pass constitutional muster with the Illinois Supreme Court.



The Cullerton legislation incorporates his long-held belief that employees must be offered a choice when it comes to cutting benefits, an exchange necessary for a pension plan to fall within the legal and contractual contours of the state constitution."

Plans to Close Offices for 10 Days to Cut Costs,"WASHINGTON — After months of agonizing about how to deal with the effects of government spending cuts, senior F.B.I. officials in Washington have decided how they will reduce the bureau’s spending: they will shut down its headquarters and offices across the country for roughly 10 weekdays over the next year.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s plans mean that on those days, the bureau will have only a skeleton crew on hand, which raises questions about how effectively it can respond to crime.

While the shutdown conjures images of the recent movie “The Purge,” in which the government allows people to commit crimes like murder and rape for 12 hours once a year, F.B.I. officials said they would have plans for agents to return to work if there was a terrorist attack or a crime like a kidnapping.

Senior agency officials in Washington decided the closings were the easiest way to furlough employees, whose compensation accounts for roughly 60 percent of the bureau’s budget, according to people briefed on the plan. It costs the F.B.I. about $16 million a day to pay its employees, and it is far more cost effective to have the entire work force stay home at the same time than to allow employees to choose the days they want off, the people said. Other federal law enforcement agencies are expected to adopt similar furlough plans as cost-cutting measures."

After all, it was the housing market that triggered the financial crisis, and the vast proliferation of low-quality loans that had fueled the housing bubble. But politics delayed those reforms, and now the president is reopening the issue with a call to wind down the two main federal mortgage agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “For too long, these companies were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag,” the president said this week. “It was ‘heads we win, tails you lose.’”

Well, not entirely. The U.S. government and taxpayers did rescue these agencies in 2009 (to the tune of nearly $200 billion), and, after injecting them with capital and essentially nationalizing them, these companies started to turn a profit as the housing market slowly recovered. This month, they contributed more than $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and have been one factor in sharply reducing government deficits.

Even more, Obama’s targeting of Fannie and Freddie is part of a larger narrative — on both the left and the right — that banks and government colluded to produce the financial crisis and the continuing drag on the United States. To be fair, Obama in the same speech this week acknowledged that much of the housing crisis was the product of “banks and the government…[making] everyone feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren’t ready and didn’t have the payment.” But that chord is a decidedly minor one in a general atmosphere of blame.

Over the past decade, we have collectively spun a story of the financial crisis. It goes something like this: in the 2000s, government regulation of the financial system loosened as large banks, in collusion with free-market ideologues in government, convinced regulators that risk was a thing of the past. They then took advantage of easy money and lax regulation and began to push mortgages to speculators and low-credit individuals, who bought homes they couldn’t afford. Those mortgages were then packaged and used as the fodder for financial derivatives, which turned bad loans into a global crisis. Meanwhile, millions of people lost homes and jobs; the government spent hundreds of billions to bail out the banks, and those millions of citizens were left with shattered credit, no employment, and fractured communities such as Detroit.

There is much that is true in this story. Its basic contours were repeated this week in the Justice Department case against Bank of America over lax lending practices in 2008. And Fannie and Freddie, independent agencies backed by the government, were the linchpins, buying up those mortgages and providing a seemingly endless backstop.

What’s missing from the story is crucial, however. Obama alluded to it in his speech, but he buried the details. Often neglected is the degree to which so many felt that they needed to own a home. That wasn’t created by banks and government, even though it was encouraged. The “ownership society” had been touted not just by President Bush in the 2000s, but by Clinton, Reagan, and by Americans of all parties and ideologies since the founding of the republic. There is nothing more “Jeffersonian” than owning your own land and home (and slaves…but that is another issue). The United States pulled immigrants in part because of the availability of land and the promise of independence that owning land afforded. Freed slaves after the Civil War were promised — though not actually granted — “40 acres and a mule” because having land was seen as a necessary component to liberty and freedom.

After World War II, agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration along with other New Deal creations such as Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) spurred more widespread home ownership, with returning GIs both swarming into colleges and then into vast new housing developments in the suburbs. Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), founded in 1970, was meant to augment that process with even more quasi-government intervention in the mortgage market, with the goal of reducing the risk local banks might incur in making new home loans.

These programs then combined with banks to produce the increase in home ownership, from 62 percent in the 1950s to almost 70 percent in the 2000s. The programs worked not because the docile masses were convinced to own homes but because the drive to have a home is deeply embedded in American culture (and many other cultures as well). Government and banks facilitated the realization of these desires, but it is beyond a stretch to claim that they created those desires. They stoked them, and often took advantage of them, but they did not implant and create them.

That part of the story is sadly, thought understandably, overlooked and underplayed. Targeting government ineptitude and Wall Street greed is a far better sell politically, and a better sell for the media, than speaking of collective responsibility for our dreams trumping our means. Aiming for a home, holding that as a goal, and living in a society that allows for the potential to meet it are powerful and productive fuels. But succumbing to the easy lure of a promise too good to be true, which was what many of those mortgages in the 2000s were, required multiple breakdowns, one of which is individual desire clouding judgment.

The easy story of what happened over the past years is now in danger of becoming a set “truth.” It is so often repeated that it often goes unquestioned. But while that story has much to offer, it entirely elides how our individual desires, combined with a long history driving us toward the supreme value of owning a home, were vital ingredients in our recent fate. That story also infantilizes “the American people” by suggesting that so many of us were dupes and rubes, easily manipulated by government and business into making bad choices.

Blaming venal banks and inept government will not transform our system, however satisfying it may feel. Shuttering Fannie and Freddie will not force a shift in people’s desires, though it will make it harder for banks to prey on those desires. Ending the government guarantee of mortgages via these agencies will lead to tighter credit standards, and hence less access to credit for those less well-off. That may be for the best, but it is hard to see that not generating backlash. Rather than unwinding these agencies, we should focus on those lending standards, and when they should be relaxed and when not.

Overall, we would be better served by understanding that many of the struggles of recent years stem from a mismatch between what we dream of and what this system is currently able to provide. Some of the gap is due to bad regulation, Wall Street greed, and speculation. Much of it, however, is due to a radical change in our economies that has upended 20th century industries and jobs and continues to do so. Responding to that change and recalibrating our expectations without giving up our dreams — that is where our focus should be, and must be."

House will take up its version of the bill this month

Bill would cut food stamp program by about half a percent

Amendment cuts government%27s share of crop insurance premiums for some farmers

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Monday passed a five-year, half-trillion-dollar farm bill that expands government subsidies for crop insurance, rice and peanuts while making small cuts to food stamps.

The bill passed on a bipartisan 66-27 vote. The legislation, which costs almost $100 billion annually, also would eliminate subsidies that are paid to farmers whether they farm or not. All told, it would save about $2.4 billion a year on the farm and nutrition programs, including across-the-board cuts that took effect earlier this year.

Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the bill would support 16 million American jobs, save taxpayers billions and put into place ""the most significant reforms to agriculture programs in decades."" But it would still generously subsidize corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, sugar and other major crops grown by U.S. farmers.

The legislation would also set policy for programs to protect environmentally sensitive land, international food aid and other projects to help rural communities. The Senate passed a similar farm bill last year.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Monday that his chamber will take up its version of the farm bill this month. Debate in the House is expected to be contentious and much more partisan than in the Senate, with disagreements among the GOP caucus over domestic food aid that makes up almost 80 percent of the bill's cost.

Last year, the House declined to take up the legislation during an election year amid conflict over how much should be cut from the food stamp program, which now serves one in seven Americans and cost almost $80 billion last year. That cost has more than doubled since 2008.

The bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee last month would make much larger cuts to food stamps than the Senate version, in a bid to gain support from those House conservatives who have opposed the measure. The Senate bill would cut the food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by about $400 million a year, or half a percent. The House bill would cut the program by $2 billion a year, or a little more than 3 percent, and make it more difficult for some people to qualify.

In his statement Monday, Boehner signaled support for the House bill's level of food stamp cuts, saying they are changes that ""both parties know are necessary."" Other Republicans are expected to offer amendments to expand the cuts, setting up a potentially even more difficult resolution with the Senate version.

On the Senate floor, senators rejected amendments on food stamp cuts, preserving the $400 million annual decrease. The bill's farm-state supporters also fended off efforts to cut sugar, tobacco and other farm supports.

Senators looking to pare back subsidies did win one victory in the Senate, an amendment to reduce the government's share of crop insurance premiums for farmers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said their amendment would affect about 20,000 farmers.

Stabenow argued the amendment would result in fewer people buying insurance and undercut a separate provision in the bill that would require farmers buying crop insurance to comply with certain environmental standards on their land.

Currently the government pays for an average 62 percent of crop insurance premiums and also subsidizes the companies that sell the insurance. The overall bill expands crop insurance for many crops and also creates a program to compensate farmers for smaller, or ""shallow,"" revenue losses before the paid insurance kicks in.

The crop insurance expansion is likely to benefit Midwestern corn and soybean farmers, who use crop insurance more than other farmers. The bill would also boost subsidies for Southern rice and peanut farmers, lowering the threshold for those farms to receive government help.

The help for rice and peanuts was not in last year's bill but was added this year after the agriculture panel gained a new top Republican, Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran. Critics, including the former top Republican on the committee, Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, said the new policy could guarantee that the rice and peanut farmers' profits are average or above average.

Critics said the bill would subsidize large corporate farms when farm country is in the middle of an economic boom. Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has long criticized farm subsidies, said the legislation would simply redirect subsidies and ""needlessly cut nutrition and conservation programs designed to help the hungry and the environment.""

Boehner criticized farm subsidies in the House bill, which are similar to those in the Senate bill, saying his ""concerns about our country's farm programs are well known."" Boehner, a former member of the agriculture panel, has voted against recent farm bills. But he acknowledged that the rest of the chamber might not agree with him.

""If you have ideas on how to make the bill better, bring them forward,"" Boehner said in a statement directed to his colleagues. ""Let's have the debate, and let's vote on them.""

The Senate bill also would:

- Overhaul dairy policy by creating a new insurance program for dairy producers, eliminating other dairy subsidies and price supports. The new policy includes a market stabilization program that could dictate production cuts when oversupply drives down prices. The program faced little opposition in the Senate but a similar overhaul in the House bill is expected to face resistance in that chamber, where Boehner last year called the new stabilization program ""Soviet-style."" He reiterated those concerns in his statement Monday, saying he will support an amendment on the floor to challenge the proposed policy.

- Make modest changes to the way international food aid is delivered, a much scaled-back version of an overhaul proposed by President Barack Obama earlier this year. Senators adopted an amendment that would slightly boost dollars to buy locally-grown food close to needy areas abroad. Currently, most food aid is grown in the United States and shipped to developing countries, an approach the Obama administration says is inefficient but that has support among farm-state members in Congress.

- Consolidate programs to protect environmentally-sensitive land and reduce spending on those programs.

- Expand Agriculture Department efforts to prevent illegal trafficking of food stamp benefits."

(CNN) —

When the U.S. economy collapsed, millions of us lost our homes, our jobs, our retirement savings and our faith in the American dream. What we gained was a very clear view of the vast – and growing – divide between the rich and the rest of us.

Like many hardworking Americans earning minimum wage, Margaret Lewis knows firsthand what it’s like to live on the edge. She works as a transporter for passengers with disabilities at O’Hare International Airport. She wakes up at 1 a.m. to go to work, and spends the early morning hours pushing wheelchairs to gates and helping travelers on and off planes.

With tips, and Illinois’ minimum wage – which is $1 above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour – Margaret makes about $18,000 a year, or $10,000 below the federal poverty limit for a household of five.

Margaret lives with her four school-age children in a three-bedroom apartment on Chicago’s South Side. Two recent shootings on her block make her fear for her children’s safety, but she cannot afford to move. Margaret is unable to pay the $850 per month rent, so she and her family perform janitorial tasks for the landlord to make ends meet. The children’s clothing is all secondhand, Margaret uses food stamps to make sure everyone is fed and when it is time to buy shoes for school, she has to save an entire paycheck.

Mary Kay Henry

Christine L. Owens

Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the last increase in the federal minimum wage. For the last three years, while the prices of gas and milk have risen steadily and the richest 1% have enjoyed huge tax breaks, the federal minimum wage has remained frozen at $7.25 an hour, which amounts to just $15,080 a year – as long as you get paid for any time you take off. That’s more than $7,000 below the federal poverty line for a family of four. As a result, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has slowly eroded – in just three years, its real value has sunk to $6.77 per hour, a nearly 50-cent drop.

The Bush tax cuts, which are simply the perquisite of the moment for the 1%, allow for the richest to prosper at the expense of middle-class and low-income workers. While CEOs make millions and their corporations make billions as part of a so-called economic recovery, the majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. This struggle is exacerbated by the low federal minimum wage. As middle-class jobs are increasingly replaced by low-wage work, however, this is the economic reality for a growing number of Americans.

Unless Congress raises the federal minimum wage, economic security for workers in low-wage jobs, the fastest-growing sector, will disappear. It is incumbent on members of Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and index it to inflation, putting more money into the pockets of ordinary Americans to boost our economy and aid a real, long-term recovery.

The Rebuild America Act has been introduced in both the House and the Senate to do just that, while also raising the federal minimum wage for tipped workers, which has been a meager $2.13 since 1991. The Fair Minimum Wage Act, not yet introduced, is also a call for a more decent wage. Support for these bills is support for an economic recovery that extends to all Americans.

This legislation could make a difference for Bruce Gross, a father of three in Baltimore. He worked as a sandblaster, supporting his wife, their twin boys, daughter and two nephews, until the economy crashed. Now, Bruce makes $7.36 an hour as a telemarketer.

Bruce’s wife is sick and unable to work, leaving him as the sole breadwinner. Bruce estimates he brings home about $200 every other week and his bills are more than double that. Bruce and his family recently sat in the dark for a few days because he had to choose between paying his electric bill and buying groceries.

When things got really rough, Bruce asked neighbors if they could spare a few slices of bread and some cheese for sandwiches. He is heartbroken that he is unable to provide even basic necessities, like food and school supplies, for his children.

People who work for a living should be able to make a living from their work. Low-wage workers should not have to scrape by, while many of the companies they work for are making more money now than they were three years ago. The federal minimum wage hasn’t kept up with inflation, but CEO pay has risen 725% over the last 30 years and 80% of all real income growth has gone to the richest 1% of Americans.

The real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968. Had it kept pace with rising living costs, the minimum wage would exceed $10.50 per hour today. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has been reorganizing over the past 30 years away from middle-wage jobs in manufacturing and construction and toward low-paying jobs in the rapidly expanding service, retail and restaurant industries.

We have little reason to expect large corporations that are the principal employers of low-wage workers to voluntarily offer higher pay; rock bottom wages are a core profit-making strategy for retail giants and fast food chains. Nor does reality match the myth that prosperity at the top will eventually “trickle down” to workers at the bottom: corporate profits are at their highest level as a share of GDP, and wages at their lowest, since the 1950s.

Neither facts nor common sense support a federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25. It wasn’t low-wage workers who crashed the economy. It was not a raise for these workers, but rather an unquenchable thirst for profit, that led to Wall Street’s disastrous game of financial Russian roulette. Why, then, should low-wage workers pay the price?

How high must profits go before a modest wage increase isn’t raised as a specter of impending corporate doom? It’s easy to exploit such fears in this economic climate, but these tired old canards – trotted out in every minimum wage fight – are just an excuse for political inaction and continued corporate greed.

The bottom line is that people who work for a living put their money right back into our economy. What business in this country needs right now is customers and too many hardworking Americans aren’t making enough money to get by. If we raise the federal minimum wage and demand the 1% pay their fair share to reduce income inequality, we will boost our economy, help small business grow and create jobs.

I stand behind the need for reform.

The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law. We think it's a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.

One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees. The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation.

But even hesitance has a cost. The need for reform is undeniable. Since 2001, excluding the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the cost per service member in the active-duty force has risen by 41% in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ""that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD's leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we'll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.""

Here's what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire —regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees. If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year — just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.

Here's an example: If a serviceman enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, under this policy his lifetime benefit would be about $1.7 million instead of $1.8 million. For a service member who retired at the average military retirement age of 44, the difference would be smaller, about $30,000 over his or her lifetime. This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees.

And to be clear, the money we save from this reform will go right back to the military. Veterans aren't Washington's piggy bank. They deserve fair compensation. And we owe them a benefit structure they can count on.

That said, when Congress was considering the bill, many raised concerns that these reforms would affect the retired pay of service members who are medically retired and those receiving survivor's benefits. So Senator Murray and I have agreed to amend the law to exclude them well before the reform takes effect in December 2015.

But I stand behind the need for reform. In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom. The commission's recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That's why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.

For me, there's simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ""disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization."" Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops' combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same.

Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.

The first time fast food workers at multiple restaurants across a city ever went on strike was in New York City in November, and after a second one-day strike in New York, city after city followed. With high unemployment, unions under attack and on the defensive, and labor law that does little to protect workers, low-wage workers in a decentralized industry were just about the last people who were supposed to rise up and demand more. But this week, fast food workers in seven cities will be walking out

Today, Monday, is a day of widespread rallies and walkouts, with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and city council members on hand to support the strikers. But:



This week’s wave of strikes got an early start Friday night, when workers walked out at a Brooklyn Domino’s to protest the firing of an activist co-worker, Gregory Reynoso, following their April strike. Striker Jose Cruz told Salon that about 90% of the workers on the busy evening shift joined the work stoppage, forcing cancellations of deliveries. (Workers at two other Domino’s locations, a Papa John’s, and a McDonald’s also took part in Friday’s prequel strike.)

On Friday, state Sen. Eric Adams helped deliver letters in support of Reynoso to Domino's.

Monday:





@FastFoodForward 13 fast food workers just walked-out of McDonald’s at 341 5th Ave. Only managers remain. #iamfastfood http://t.co/...

Today, workers and allies will rally at multiple locations in New York City at noon and at Union Square at 3pm. In coming days, workers in Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee, Kansas City, and Flint, Michigan, will also strike, and workers in Seattle—who raised complaints of wage theft last week—will take action in other ways. This isn't a short-term fight, but the beginning of what will likely be a long campaign building pressure on the fast food industry to change. If you see workers striking outside a fast food restaurant, join them if you can. But whatever you do, don't weaken the fight by crossing their line and going inside.

Tell these brave fast food workers that you stand in solidarity with them."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/18/republican-official-house-to-vote-on-debt-ceiling-increase/,2013-01-18 00:00:00,[],House Republicans offer path to avert debt ceiling stand-off -- for now,"House Republicans said Friday they would allow a vote next week on a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, a move that could avert a risky stand-off with President Obama -- at least for now.

Meeting at a retreat in Virginia, House GOP leaders said they would move on a measure allowing the government to borrow for about three more months. Without an extension, the country is expected to exhaust that authority by mid-February, risking the possibility of a market-rattling default.

While Obama has warned Republicans not to challenge him on the debt ceiling, Republicans still see that issue as key leverage to extract spending cuts from Democrats at a time when the debt is well above $16 trillion.

They made clear Friday that they'd continue to press for deficit reduction, but said the next long-term debt-ceiling vote would be conditioned on Congress debating a bona fide budget.

""Unless the Senate acts, there will be no consideration of a long-term debt-ceiling increase,"" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said.

The Senate has not passed a full-scale budget since 2009, which has drawn lots of criticism from Republicans but protected Democrats controlling the chamber from politically difficult votes.

""Before there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending,"" House Speaker John Boehner said. ""The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a budget for four years. That is a shameful run that needs to end, this year.""

To further pressure Congress, the Republican plan would condition pay for lawmakers on passing a congressional budget measure.

""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem,"" Boehner told Republican lawmakers at the retreat. ""The principle is simple: `no budget, no pay.""'

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid welcomed the House Republican move, without specifying whether the Senate would support it.

""It is reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage,"" said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson. ""If the House can pass a clean debt-ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also said: ""We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education and programs middle class families depend on.""

Republican leaders have been grappling with how to gain leverage in their battles with Obama over the budget. Boehner successfully won about $2 trillion in spending cuts as a condition of increasing the government's borrowing cap in 2011.

Obama, however, successfully pressed through a 10-year, $600 billion increase on upper-bracket tax payers earlier this month.

Other choke points remain, including sharp across-the-board spending cuts that would start to strike the Pentagon and domestic programs alike on March 1 and the possibility of a partial government shutdown with the expiration of a temporary budget measure on March 27.

Failing to meet those deadlines would have far less serious consequences than defaulting on U.S. obligations like payments to bondholders, government pension recipients and myriad other commitments when the government confronts a cash crisis and can no longer borrow to make payments. That could cause a meltdown in financial markets and would inflame voters already disgusted with Congress.

Boehner has previously invoked a promise that any increase in the government's borrowing cap would be matched, dollar for dollar, by spending cuts or ""reforms"" that could include curbs on the long-term growth in retirement programs such as health care for the elderly. Friday's announcement did not repeat that specific promise.

The measure picked up support from key Republican conservatives, including the current and former chairmen of the Republican Study Committee, a powerful group inside the House Republican party.

""In order to allow time for the Senate to act, next week's bill will extend the debt limit for three months,"" the Study Committee said Friday in a statement. ""This is a necessary first step as we work to halt the decline of America and puts the focus where it belongs: on the Senate who has failed to do their jobs to pass a budget for more than three years.""

Obama's budget is due early next month but is expected to be released several weeks later.

But now, experts say Brown’s actions may be sparking a tax migration for the high income earners whom the state relies on to pay its bills.

“You’d be a fool not to leave California,” says Ed Botowsky of Chapwood Investments who manages the finances of several professional athletes and high income Californians. Botowsky says some of his clients have already made the decision to flee the state to avoid the tax crunch.

Seven states including Florida, Texas, and Nevada do not have a state income tax. That can mean big savings for millionaires willing to make the move. Tiger Woods’s move from California to Florida will save him an estimated $7.5 million in taxes this year alone. His golf rival, Phil Mickelson, who recently expressed concern over California’s tax squeeze, could save $8 million this year by following Tiger’s lead.

An estimated 62.7% of California’s general revenue fund comes from personal income taxes. With roughly 41% of the state’s entire revenue coming from the top 1% of California income earners, the state is especially vulnerable to even modest fluctuations in the migration of its millionaires.

“The higher reliance on personal income tax is a double-edged sword,” said Fitch Ratings Senior Director Douglas Offerman.

Michael Genest, who formerly ran California’s state finance department, says he worries what will happen if the millionaire migration dries up the revenues Gov. Jerry Brown is banking on.

“What happens if revenues fall through the floor? He’s going to be right back where we were in 2008,” Genest said.

The recent 5% federal tax increase on high earners, coupled with California’s 13.3% state income tax, may prove more than millionaires are willing to take, especially since they have options and can move easily.

“They’re going to have an exodus of people,” said John Karaffa, president of ProSport CPA, a Virginia-based firm that represents nearly 300 professional athletes, primarily in basketball and football. “I think they’ll see some [leave California] for sure. They were already a very high tax state and it’s getting to a point where folks have to make a business decision as well as a lifestyle decision.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/obama-economic-speech_n_3645371.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],Obama Economic Speech Tells GOP To Drop The 'Endless Parade Of Distractions',"WASHINGTON -- Against the backdrop of a stable but still lethargic economy, President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged Congress to end what he deemed worsening gridlock and to join him in crafting a constructive agenda for jobs, immigration reform and health care implementation.

The speech, which was widely hyped in advance by the administration, was heavy on broad themes while touching on a few specifics. The president pitched a refinancing plan for mortgages, a long-term fix to student loans, worker training programs, and a renewed focus on manufacturing jobs and infrastructure repair. Speaking at Knox College, he called on Congress to offer constructive input on all these fronts.

""Over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible,"" the president said. ""The good news is, a growing number of Republican senators are trying to get things done, like an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars. But a faction of Republicans in the House won’t even give that bill a vote, and that same group gutted a farm bill that America’s farmers and most vulnerable children depend on.""

""With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball,"" he said. ""And I am here to say this needs to stop. Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires.""

While declaring that the economy stood in a better place now than when he took office, Obama also conceded that the status quo was not good enough. The current state of income inequality, he stressed, ""isn’t just morally wrong; it’s bad economics."" America, he added, had to make new investments such as ""rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, [and] upgrading our transportation and information networks.""

The speech, which is one of several that the White House has planned, was pitched as a pivot of sorts back to economic issues after months of focus on other items -- from the legislative (gun control) to the headline-grabbers (the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS). The setting itself was meant to be an emotional springboard. The president had delivered the commencement address at Knox College as a senator in 2005, an address that he and his advisers have routinely cited as the best distillation of his economic principles.

But it was impossible to not place the speech in a broader political context. It was being delivered, in part, to pre-frame upcoming fights, rather than help win current ones.

The late summer months have been a notoriously tough part of the political calendar for the president -- from health care town halls in 2009, to the lead-up of the 2010 elections, to the debt ceiling standoff in 2011. And advisers to the president acknowledge that they are keen to avoid getting caught flat-footed again. Their efforts have even greater urgency considering that several major battles with congressional Republicans are on the horizon.

The government must pass a budget by the end of September. Lawmakers must also figure out what to do with the spending cuts caused by sequestration or risk having them become even larger in the next fiscal year. Negotiations on the latter are virtually non-existent, while both sides remain far apart on the former. As The New York Times reported on Wednesday, congressional Republicans are crafting spending bills that would ""gut"" the president's top priorities.

The most ominous legislative showdown, however, appears to once again involve the raising of the debt ceiling. A small number of Senate Republicans have insisted that there be no increase if it includes any money whatsoever to fund the president's health care law.

So far, other Republicans have declined to join that chorus. ""I don't support that,"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told MSNBC on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), meanwhile, has warned his colleagues not to play political games with the faith and credit of the U.S. government.

But the pressure is mounting. The Club for Growth, a top conservative campaign group, asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to sign on to a letter promising not to fund Obamacare as part of any debt ceiling agreement.

Over in the House, meanwhile, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said that he will not ""raise the debt ceiling without real cuts in spending,"" a mantra that preceded a similar showdown in 2011. Boehner has alternatively said he would not allow the country to default -- making it hard to gauge how serious a threat this truly is -- but Politico, citing Republican sources, reported Tuesday night that ""there are loads of GOP lawmakers who are perfectly willing to gamble with default.""

""We’ve seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn’t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up – a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can’t afford to repeat,"" Obama said. ""Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel – by cutting programs we don’t need, fixing ones we do, and making government more efficient – this same group has insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that has cost jobs, harmed growth, hurt our military, and gutted investments in American education and scientific and medical research that we need to make this country a magnet for good jobs.""

The latest estimates have the debt ceiling being hit roughly around the end of October."

But Golden State Republicans aren’t just on the opposite side of issues from Democrats. Lately, they’ve been at odds among themselves.

The divisions were on display when the state’s 15 Republicans split almost evenly on a vote to end the government shutdown and extend the nation’s borrowing authority. All 38 Democrats, in contrast, stuck together in support of the measure.

The Republicans also split on roll calls this year to cut the food stamp program, provide Superstorm Sandy relief, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and end a program that promotes U.S. agricultural products abroad. No California Democrats broke ranks.

The GOP differences have been stark on immigration.

While Republican Reps. Jeff Denham of Turlock and David Valadao of Hanford joined Democrats in support of legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally, some of their California GOP colleagues vehemently oppose what they regard as amnesty for lawbreakers. Others are open to granting legal status to some immigrants but oppose a path to citizenship.

It’s no surprise to find divisions within the largest state delegation in Congress, given its size, regional differences on issues such as farm policy, and the political vulnerability of some of its members.

Democrats have broken ranks too. Freshman Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert), for example, drew flak for joining Republicans in voting to delay Obamacare’s individual mandate. Seven of the state’s Democrats recently broke from their party to support a Republican-written bill that would let insurers continue selling policies that don’t meet new federal standards under the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans have been unified on plenty of issues, such as their disdain for Obamacare, but appear to be thumbing their noses at party discipline these days more than the Democrats.

“California Republicans always tend to be independent cusses,” said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). “I think it’s a DNA thing.”

Said Steve Frank, a strategist for the Tea Party Caucus of California: “It’s every man for himself. They’re looking for what’s best for themselves politically.”

Advertisement

The divisions reflect fissures within the larger House Republican ranks that have presented Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) with a challenge akin to trying to herd cats. Republicans have been tugged one way by the tea party and another way by business-oriented establishment Republicans.

“The Republican Party is in the midst of an internal debate over where it should be going,” said Jon Fleischman, a former state GOP official who publishes a conservative blog.

Some of the cracks within the GOP ranks are the result of geography.

“California is a huge and diverse state with districts that have little in common other than they happen to fall within our state’s borders,” said Dave Gilliard, a Republican consultant in Sacramento. “Ed Royce’s constituents in Yorba Linda have little in common with Doug LaMalfa’s in Weed.... These guys are not fearful of the tea party or business lobbyists or anyone else. Their votes are dictated by their own beliefs and how they perceive their district.”

Advertisement

Royce, of Fullerton, said Republicans were “struggling” to determine the best course forward for the country, given challenges such as the national debt. “Part of it is in the nature of Republicans. They’re harder to corral.”

California Republicans as a whole, like the rest of the House GOP, have become more conservative over the last 25 years, according to an analysis of voting patterns by University of Georgia political scientist Keith T. Poole.

The variation among California Republicans covers a “wider spectrum on the ideological scale” — still on the conservative side — than it has in the past, according to UC San Diego political scientist Gary Jacobson, who has studied the data. “This means that Republicans are relatively less uniform in their ideological locations, as measured by their roll-call voting patterns, than they were prior to this Congress.”

Reps. John Campbell of Irvine, Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa, Royce and McClintock have compiled the most conservative voting records this year in the delegation. All four voted against ending the government shutdown. Reps. Paul Cook of Yucca Valley, Ken Calvert of Corona and Valadao, all of whom voted to end the shutdown, are at the other end of the range. On average, however, they are a bit more conservative than House Republicans as a whole, according to Jacobson.

Advertisement

Voter-approved changes to the state’s political system also may be contributing to the divisions.

A new political map put four Republicans in districts where Latinos make up 40% or more of the population and five in districts that are at least 30% Latino. Denham and Valadao represent heavily Latino Central Valley districts that rely on immigrants to pick crops.

Advertisement

“If they want to hold on to their seats, they certainly can’t behave like standard-issue Republicans,” Jacobson said.

Rohrabacher, the senior California Republican in the House, attributed the divisions to more competitive districts.

Dan Schnur, a former GOP strategist who directs USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said the state’s new primary system that pits the top two finishers against each other in the general election, regardless of their party, means that candidates do not need to rely as much on the party base but must work more aggressively to reach out to independents and centrists from the other party.

“The biggest impact of the top-two primary is not during the election but afterwards,” he said. “You send someone to Sacramento or Washington, and once they get there, you’ve created a much greater incentive for them to look for ways to work with members of the other party.”

Calvert, chairman of the California Republican congressional delegation, attributed his caucus’ 8-7 split to end the government shutdown to differences over tactics.

Overall, he said, “we’re together 90% of the time.”

The law raises minimum pay in the most populous state from its current rate of $8 per hour to $9 by July 2014 and $10 by January 2016. The state with the highest minimum wage currently is Washington, where employers must pay at least $9.19 per hour.

The measure won support from Democrats, passing the state Senate by a vote of 26-11 and the Assembly by 51-25. But it was opposed by many Republicans, who said it would hurt small businesses and ultimately cost some low-wage workers their jobs.

Brown, protective of California's tenuous economic recovery, had initially opposed the bill but agreed to support it after leaders of both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature agreed to postpone the effective date of the raise until 2016.

State Assemblyman Luis Alejo, who authored the wage hike bill, said the increase would help working people pay for necessities in a state where rising costs have long outpaced wage increases for the poor and working class.

""We have created a system where we pay workers less but need them to spend more,"" Alejo said in a statement. ""That causes middle-class families to fall down the economic ladder. It's the reason our middle class is shrinking and the reason we are facing the largest gap between upper- and lower-income Californians in at least 30 years.""

The minimum hourly wage in the state had stagnated after rising to $8 in 2008, but remains higher than the federal minimum of $7.25.

Will he continue to insist upon tying a repeal or delay of Obamacare to a funding bill? Or will he bring the Senate-passed funding bill to the House floor and hope that he can convince 17 Republicans to join hands with the chamber’s 200 Democrats and vote to re-open the federal government?

It all depends on whether he chooses to follow or ignore the Hastert Rule. The choice isn’t an easy one, as his speakership quite likely hangs in the balance.

The Hastert Rule is named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who did not bring bills to the floor unless those bills were supported by a majority of House Republicans. It is not a formal rule, but rather a promise to uphold the will of a majority of the majority. House Republicans expected Boehner to uphold the rule and he pledged to do so.

But the shutdown and the upcoming showdown over raising the debt limit underscore Boehner’s leadership dilemma – almost any bill that a majority of House Republicans support is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Josh Huder

Fewer laws were passed in the last Congress than in any Congress since 1861, and based on the number of floor votes taken so far this year, the current Congress is on track to be even less productive. It is also the most partisan Congress since the Civil War era.

As the shutdown gets under way, many are looking for signs of what kind of leader Boehner will be. Instead, they should consider what kind of leader he can be, given the political hand he’s been dealt.

Gone are the days of House speakers plying members with promises of pork and campaign money. Earmarks have been banned, most incumbents do their own fundraising, and for many of the chamber’s newer members, ideology trumps party loyalty.

The electoral landscape doesn’t help. In 1995-96, when the federal government last shut down, 34% of House Republicans represented districts that Bill Clinton won in 1992. Today, just 7% of House Republicans come from districts that President Obama won last year. There is almost no electoral incentive for these members to compromise. The bottom line is that Boehner’s arsenal is limited. He is hamstrung by the very institution and members he is supposed to lead.

So what are Boehner’s options at this point? He could, as he has done previously, pass a funding bill on the backs of House Democrats. The 2011 and 2012 omnibus spending bills, the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2012 Payroll Tax Bill all passed the House because of Democratic support. And earlier this year, Boehner brought the Violence Against Women Act and the Hurricane Sandy Relief bill to the floor, despite opposition from a majority of House Republicans. These bills had bipartisan support in the Senate, making it difficult for Boehner to dig his heels in and stand behind his conservative majority.

Flash forward to now. What is the House speaker’s calculus, given that the Senate passed its funding bill on a party-line vote?

Absent the pressure to appease Republican senators, Boehner will have a tough time justifying any move to defy the will of his party’s majority. Convincing House Republicans to pass the Senate’s funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible, should he wish to remain speaker.

No House speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party. And no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive Congresses in history. But these are Boehner’s choices.

While Hastert relied on a majority of the majority, Boehner has had to rely on a minority of the majority, together with a majority of the minority, to pass important legislation. The “Boehner Rule” is hardly the stuff to which great leaders aspire. It may, however, prove more productive than following the lead of his majority.

The solid job growth wasn't enough to push down the unemployment rate, which stayed 7.8 percent last month, the Labor Department said Friday. The rate for November was revised up from an initially reported 7.7 percent.

Stock futures inched higher after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Robust hiring in manufacturing and construction fueled the December job gains. Construction firms added 30,000, the most in 15 months. That increase likely reflected hiring needed to rebuild after Superstorm Sandy and also gains in home building that have contributed to a housing recovery.

Manufacturers added 25,000 jobs, the most in nine months.

Even with the gains, hiring isn't strong enough to quickly reduce still-high unemployment. For 2012, employers added 1.84 million jobs, an average of 153,000 jobs a month, roughly matching the job totals for 2011.

But the stable hiring last month shows that employers didn't panic during the high-stakes talks between Congress and the White House over tax increases and spending cuts that weren't resolved until New Year's.

That's an encouraging sign for the coming months, because an even bigger federal budget showdown is looming. The government must increase its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by around late February or risk defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.

Friday's report did point to some weakness in the job market. For example, the number of unemployed actually rose 164,000 to 12.2 million. The unemployment figures come from a survey of households; the number of jobs that were added each month comes from a separate survey of businesses.

Still, the economy is improving. Layoffs are declining. And the number of people who sought unemployment aid in the past month is near a four-year low.

The December jobs report showed that hourly pay is staying slightly ahead of inflation. Hourly wages rose 7 cents to $23.73, a 2.1 percent increase compared with a year earlier. Inflation rose 1.8 percent over the same period.

The once-depressed housing market is recovering. Companies ordered more long-lasting manufactured goods in November, a sign that they're investing more in equipment and software. And Americans spent more in November. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic growth.

Manufacturing is getting a boost from the best auto sales in five years. Car sales jumped 13 percent in 2012 to 14.5 million. And Americans spent more at the tail end of the holiday shopping season, boosting overall sales that had slumped earlier in the crucial two-month period."

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.3 percent last month, after a revised 0.3 percent drop in April.



Consumer spending in April was previously reported to have declined 0.2 percent.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 346,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the previous week were revised to show 1,000 more applications than previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to fall to 345,000 last week.

The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 345,750.

A Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there were no special factors in the state data.

Employers added 175,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month, with the unemployment rate ticking up a tenth of a percentage point to 7.6 percent. Job gains have averaged 172,000 over the last 12 months.

The Federal Reserve, which has been closely monitoring the labor market, said after its policy-setting meeting last week downside risks to the outlook for the jobs market had diminished since the fall.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could trim the $85 billion in bonds it has been buying each month to keep interest rates low and bolster the economy sometime later this year and likely bring the program to a close by mid-2014.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell 1,000 to 2.965 million in the week ended June 15.

U.S. consumer spending rebounded and incomes recorded their largest increase in three months in May, adding to data that have suggested the economy has shifted to firmer ground.

Last month's consumer spending increase was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in April.

Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Though the pace of spending has slowed from the 2.6 percent rate notched in the first three months of the year, consumers will likely continue to drive growth in the second quarter.

Recent data, including housing, regional factory activity, business spending plans and consumer confidence, have pointed to an economy that is regaining some speed after stumbling early in the second quarter.

That is broadly supportive of the Fed's view last week that the downside risks to the economy's outlook have waned.

That theme held as other details of the Commerce Department report showed income grew 0.5 percent last month, the largest gain since February, after nudging up 0.1 percent in April. That reflects a steady pace of job gains.

There was also a bit of inflation in the economy last month, pointing to some pick-up in demand.

A price index for consumer spending inched up 0.1 percent in May after declining two straight months. A core reading that strips out food and energy costs also rose 0.1 percent after being flat in April.

Over the past 12 months, inflation rose 1 percent, still below the Fed's 2 percent target. The index had increased only 0.7 percent in the period through April.

Core prices were up 1.1 percent from a year ago after rising by the same margin in April.

Moving Right,"Even if all the hidden money funneled into campaigns through private 501(c) organizations had come from businesses — unlikely given the contributions by noncorporate groups like Planned Parenthood and the N.R.A. — corporate spending would not reach $400 million, still a small share of the total.

Perhaps this should not be surprising. For companies, spending on elections can be risky. Business executives might prefer lobbying, where they spend far more than on campaign contributions, not because the limits are more relaxed but because swaying legislators on both sides of the aisle is more effective at getting what they want. And such lobbying is less likely to kindle anger among consumers, shareholders and other constituents than spending to change the outcome of elections.

“While Citizens alters the ability of corporations to contribute to campaigns, it does not alter their substantial risk in doing so,” the political scientists Wendy L. Hansen, Michael Rocca and Brittany Ortiz of the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, argued in a recent study.

Still, corporations’ reluctance to open their checkbooks suggests an intriguing alternative explanation for the rise of Republicans who are willing to defy their will: companies may have spent too little. Their money was swamped by that of big individual donors who are more ideologically extreme. In 2012, the top 0.1 percent of donors contributed more than 44 percent of all campaign contributions. In 1980 their share of contributions was less than 10 percent.

Corporations have a pro-Republican bias, of course. But it is not quite as extreme as pop culture would have it, and is certainly less pronounced than organized labor’s pro-Democrat leanings.

Effective lobbying requires both Republican and Democratic friends. Political action committees run by businesses are known for spreading money on both sides of the partisan divide. They give to incumbents. They choose winners. They show little partisan loyalty.

In the 2006 elections, when the G.O.P. controlled Congress, corporate PACs gave 65 percent of their money to Republicans. In 2008 and 2010, after the Democrats had swept both the House and Senate, they split their contributions roughly fifty-fifty."

Despite the bill sailing out of the House last week on a strong bipartisan vote, Senate Republicans say the plan unfairly forces veterans to pick up the cost of new spending. The provision generating heated opposition from Veterans of Foreign Wars and allied lawmakers would cut retirement benefits for military retirees by $6 billion over 10 years.

""It's unacceptable to single out our men and women in uniform in this way,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who on Monday is joining New Hampshire veterans groups to protest the bill.

The turbulence comes ahead of a key test vote on Tuesday. In sharp contrast to the confident statements issued by House leaders ahead of their vote last week, Senate leaders indicate they're still corralling support.

""The struggle is still on in the United States Senate,"" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in an interview on Sunday.

Democrats need to hold most their caucus of 55 senators together and pick up a handful of GOP senators in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill.

But the Republican ""no"" votes were piling up over the weekend. Unlike in the House side, where Speaker John Boehner aggressively battled conservative groups trying to kill the bill, GOP leaders in the Senate are signaling opposition, or at least resistance, to the package. One member of the leadership team, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, announced Friday that he opposes the deal because it breaches spending caps put in place by a 2011 budget deal ""and doesn't include meaningful spending reforms that address our debt and deficit.""

Meanwhile, Ayotte and other senators are rallying opposition against the military retiree provision.

The bill includes a 1 percent reduction in cost-of-living benefits for many retirees under 62 years old. It also requires most federal civilian employees to pay more toward their pensions -- however, that provision affects only new hires, while the change for military retirees could affect those currently serving.

""Unfortunately, our current and future military retirees were not provided with similar protections that current civilian federal employees are receiving under this act,"" Ayotte, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., wrote in a letter to colleagues.

They called the provision ""unacceptable."" They estimated that a 42-year-old sergeant first class retiree would lose roughly $72,000 under this change.

The three senators indicated they could support the bill if the military retiree provision is changed. It's unclear whether Senate leaders would consider making such changes -- as that likely would require another vote in the House.

Durbin, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" predicted Senate leaders will need ""about eight Republicans"" to support the bill on Tuesday -- indicating he expects about three Democratic defections.

""I feel we'll have a good, strong showing from the Democratic side. But we need bipartisan support to pass it,"" he said.

On the other side of the Hill, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan was defending his compromise budget deal, and suggesting congressional Republicans will be more demanding of Democrats during the upcoming debit-limit talks.

""We as a caucus -- along with our Senate counterparts -- are going to meet and discuss what it is we're going to want out of the debt limit,"" the Wisconsin Republican told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we're going to accomplish out of this debt-limit fight.""

Congress faces a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a budget bill or risk another partial government shutdown. The debt-ceiling deadline is expected to hit sometime in February."

USA TODAY

Most states could exceed federal minimum wage by end of 2014%2C analyst predicts

Low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth

Opponents say raising minimum wages will mean fewer jobs

The retail-worker strikes that swept the nation in 2013 did not move Congress to raise the minimum wage, but a growing number of states are taking action.

The minimum wage will rise in 13 states this week, and as many as 11 states and Washington, D.C., are expected to consider increases in 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project. Approval is likely in more than half of the 11, says NELP policy analyst Jack Temple.

The trend reflects growing concerns about the disproportionate spread of low-wage jobs in the U.S. economy, creating millions of financially strained workers and putting too little money in consumers' pockets to spur faster economic growth.

On Jan. 1, state minimum wages will be higher than the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour in 21 states, up from 18 two years ago. Temple expects another nine states to drift above the federal minimum by the end of 2014, marking the first time minimum pay in most states will be above the federal level.

""2014 is poised to be a turning point,"" Temple says. ""States are seeing the unemployment rate is going down but job growth is disproportionately concentrated in low-wage industries. (They're) frustrated that Congress is dragging its feet.""

Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island legislatures voted to raise the minimum hourly wage by as much as $1, to $8 to $8.70, by Wednesday. In California, a $1 increase to $9 is scheduled July 1. Smaller automatic increases tied to inflation will take effect in nine other states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Meanwhile, states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, Minnesota and South Dakota plan to weigh minimum-wage hikes next year through legislation or ballot initiatives.

In Minnesota, the state House and Senate have each passed bills to raise the minimum wage and plan to iron out their differences early next year after failing to approve similar measures the past two decades.

""You're coming out of a deep recession, and people are landing jobs, but they're low-paid,"" says state Rep. Ryan Winkler, sponsor of the House bill.

The legislative movement has been partly fueled by walkouts this year in at least 100 cities by fast-food workers who are calling for $15-an-hour pay and the right to form unions. Wal-Mart workers have staged similar protests.

While the demonstrations were not explicitly intended to prompt minimum pay increases, they've made the issue ""more urgent,"" Temple says.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 3.6 million hourly paid workers received wages at or below the federal minimum in 2012 — almost 5% of all employees on hourly pay schedules.

President Obama recently said he supports legislation in Congress that would lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three steps over two years and then index it to inflation. But the measure faces an uphill climb in Congress.

Proponents of minimum-wage hikes note that low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth in the 4-year-old recovery, and increases over the past four decades have not kept pace with inflation.

Opponents say the increases raise employer expenses and will lead to layoffs. ""If your costs are going up and you can't raise prices, you have to find a way to produce the same product at a lower cost,"" says Michael Saltsman, a research fellow at the Employment Policies Institute.

Where minimum wage is going up

On Jan. 1, the minimum wage in 13 states will increase to these amounts.

State New minimum wage Arizona $7.90 Colorado $8.00 Connecticut $8.70 Florida $7.93 Missouri $7.50 Montana $7.90 New Jersey $8.25 New York $8.00 Ohio $7.95 Oregon $9.10 Rhode Island $8.00 Vermont $8.73 Washington $9.32

Story highlights NEW: Most FAA workers will face furloughs, LaHood says Ray LaHood warns of major impact from forced spending cuts as soon as April Transportation secretary calls on fellow Republicans to compromise The spending cuts are scheduled to be implemented starting March 1

Upcoming forced government spending cuts will heavily impact the Federal Aviation Administration, triggering flight delays nationwide and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Friday.

“Travelers should expect delays,” LaHood told reporters in calling for fellow Republicans to work toward compromise to avert the worst impacts of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts set to take effect March 1.

The full impact won’t be felt until April as furloughs and other staffing reductions of air traffic controllers come into effect, said LaHood, who has announced his intention to step down from President Barack Obama’s Cabinet.

“Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff,” LaHood said. “Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country.”

In addition, control towers at smaller airports such as Boca Raton, Florida, and Joplin, Missouri, would be closed, he said.

Asked why he was brought to the White House briefing room to address reporters, he said: “I would describe my presence here with one word – Republican.”

“They’re hoping that maybe I can influence members of my own party” to compromise with Obama and Democrats on an alternative to the mandatory spending cuts agreed to in a 2011 deal to increase the federal borrowing limit, LaHood said.

LaHood is a former member of the House of Representatives from Illinois.

In a letter to airline associations, the Defense Department and other “aviation colleagues” released on Friday, LaHood said plans under consideration to absorb the mandatory spending cuts included furloughs for most FAA workers, eliminating midnight shifts in 60 control towers and shutting down more than 100 towers at smaller airports.

The FAA operates towers at more than 400 airports nationwide.

The Homeland Security Department has separately warned of longer security lines at airports if budget cuts take effect, another potential headache for air travelers.

And all of them have one thing in common: They were sent home on unpaid furlough last week after a political standoff between the president and Congress forced a partial shutdown of the federal government. More than 800,000 federal workers were affected at first, though the Pentagon has since recalled most of its idled 350,000 employees.

What these sidelined government employees are doing with their spare time varies as widely as the jobs they perform. Some are tightening their budgets at home, watching what they spend on food and other necessities, fearing it could be weeks before they earn another paycheck. Others are having a tough time keeping their workplace projects shelved and agency emails unread.

While Congress and the White House work on a deal to ensure furloughed workers receive back pay once the shutdown ends, some expenses can't be put off, whether it's replacing a broken furnace for $6,500 or buying diapers for a baby due before the month ends.

Here are the stories of just a few of the government workers directly affected by the shutdown.

As the government shutdown began its second week, Donna Cebrat was focused on stretching each dollar of her savings under the assumption she might not be able to return to work for a month or longer.

""Instead of having a dinner, I'll have a bowl of cereal. Maybe for dinner and lunch. Or maybe I'll go down to McDonald's for a hamburger off the dollar menu,"" said Cebrat, 46, who works for the FBI at its office in Savannah, Ga. ""Lots of budget cuts. Not that I was living extravagantly before.""

Cebrat makes her living processing requests for public access to FBI records made under the Freedom of Information Act. She lives alone in a middle-class suburb and estimates the money in her savings account could last her anywhere from two to six months.

Story continues

She checks headlines for any news on negotiations between the president and Congress, but said she avoids reading full stories or watching shutdown reports on TV that would only bring her down further.

""I don't need to see the name-calling,"" Cebrat said. ""I just need to see the headline.""

Otherwise Cebrat has spent her days sanding and repainting her bathroom walls — a new tub, toilet and vanity will have to wait until next year — and taking walks in her neighborhood. She's avoided trips to the mall or the movies.

Catherine Threat sat at the bar, typing a note to her friends on Facebook.

""How do I serve my country from this barstool in the only restaurant in this tiny town outside a training base that is mostly shut down?"" she wrote.

The 40-year-old staff sergeant in the Army Reserve returned from Afghanistan in July, taking a civilian job at Fort McCoy in central Wisconsin.

Then, last week, she and most of her colleagues were furloughed — a maddening existence for a woman who isn't used to sitting still for very long.

So she headed to Chicago to help fellow veterans patrol the streets to help keep school children safe. It wasn't much different from the foot patrols she did during her three years in Afghanistan.

Foot patrols there created a presence, built bonds and deterred violence.

""That's what we're doing here, too,"" she said as she stood with other veterans outside an elementary school in a neighborhood that has had gang violence and other crime.

The assignment was short-lived. Threat was called back to Fort McCoy, along with hundreds of other civilian employees.

She didn't see the recall as a victory ""because there are still a lot of people out of work"" because of the shutdown.

But either way, she was grateful for the chance to serve in Chicago.

""Sometimes, I think this has almost been better for me. I've gotten more out of it than I'm contributing,"" she said, quietly monitoring children walking by her.

""But hopefully, I contributed something.""

Jonathan Corso sat at his dining room table, the signs of a terrible week all around him.

At his feet, his family's beloved dog, Dixie. The sad-eyed, 14-year-old spaniel/mutt has terminal cancer and the day before had been given only about a month to live. Under his feet, the banging of workmen installing a new $6,500 furnace at his Decatur, Ga., bungalow after the old one broke.

And there was Corso, home at 9:30 on a Friday morning. He would normally be at work at the Atlanta regional office of the Economic Development Administration, a small federal agency that provides help and construction grants to industrial parks, colleges and local governments.

Corso, 44, and his wife, Liza, who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were both furloughed.

In recent years, their federal jobs seemed stable while people working in state and local government and many private companies saw wage freezes or layoffs.

But now this.

The couple has savings, and they and their 7-year-old son should be fine financially for a while.

There have been a few silver linings: The couple went to lunch together on a weekday. Corso, a marathoner, began his daily 10-mile run at 6 a.m. rather than his more onerous 4:45 a.m. usual start time. That allowed him to stay up one night to watch a baseball game.

""We're trying to make the best of it right now,"" Corso said.

Rob Howard has been working through the shutdown, but not at his day job as an information technology specialist for the federal Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, which oversees people on probation and supervised release.

Instead, he's volunteering for So Others Might Eat, a Washington organization that serves meals to the poor and homeless. On Oct. 4, he was a coffee server. Two days later, he washed dishes after lunch.

""I just want to keep busy during this time,"" said Howard, 45, who lives in Upper Marlboro, Md.

He has also gotten work done around his house, finally finding time to redo the floor in an upstairs bathroom. He took out the old linoleum and put down some black and white tile, which he said sat in his garage ""forever.""

Howard also spent time cleaning.

""I could probably have a party at my house right now because it's spotless,"" he said.

One day he made two trips to the gym.

""I can't stay idle too long or I'll lose my mind,"" he said.

Darquez Smith found himself furloughed from his job with the National Park Service just as his fiancee is due to give birth to their daughter later this month.

Smith, 23, of Xenia, Ohio, is spending his time off looking for a new job. Working as a park ranger at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which tells the story of the Wright brothers, is his only source of income.

""Mentally, it's definitely no fun at all,"" said Smith, who has an interview lined up with a company next week. ""It's never fun to be out of work and not have the ability to go to work, and still have bills to pay.""

Smith said he's looking for work in information technology and is pursuing an IT degree at Central State University.

By the time rent is due Nov. 1, Smith said he'll need to be back at his Park Service job or have found other work. Utility bills and car insurance will soon follow, along with the added costs of raising a newborn.

""For me as a student, a full-time worker paying all the bills myself, with a lot of responsibilities, there's never really a day off or a fun day,"" he said.

During the government shutdown in 1995 and 1996, Dan Madrzykowski would occasionally sneak onto the Gaithersburg campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and check on some lab work or crunch some numbers.

""NIST is not really a bureaucracy; it's more a series of labs. People are driven differently,"" said Madrzykowski, a fire protection engineer from Damascus, Md., who's worked for the agency for 28 years.

This time, security is tighter after 9/11, and rules forbidding furloughed employees from working are strictly enforced.

So Madrzykowski, whose work has helped develop better tactics and equipment for firefighters, is devoting time to projects for a professional group, the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. And he's had to break his habit of answering email on his government-issued Blackberry from firefighters around the country.

Last week, Madrzykowski and colleagues had planned to begin work on developing standards for radio communications equipment to function in the extreme temperatures that firefighters face. The research is used by industry groups to set standards for equipment manufacturers.

That work will wait.

Madrzykowski said his biggest worry is that NIST won't be able to recruit and retain young researchers because government work no longer has the stability that once made it attractive.

""I'm old. My wife works. We've got a little bit of a cushion,"" he said. ""But for young people in a metro area, they're barely making it. We've lost several young people to private industry.""

Now, as President Obama has observed, the nation is divided by a different threat: widening income inequality. He could respond much as Mr. Johnson did — with an executive order aimed, this time, at raising the pay of millions of poorly paid employees of government contractors.

Recent studies have shown how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concessions and property leases currently flow to companies that pay low wages and provide few if any benefits, even as executive pay among federal contractors has risen. In effect, tax dollars are being used to fuel the low-wage economy and, in the process, worsen inequality.

This research has been underscored by a recent complaint filed with the Labor Department by Good Jobs Nation, a group representing low-wage workers employed under federal concession agreements. The complaint alleges that food franchises operating at federal buildings in the District of Columbia have ignored minimum-wage and overtime laws. The group has also organized walkouts by low-wage workers of vendors licensed to operate at Smithsonian museums, actions that have dovetailed with recent walkouts by fast-food workers around the nation.

Many laws and executive actions, mostly from the 1930s and 1960s, require fair pay for employees of federal contractors. But over time, those protections have been eroded by special-interest exemptions, complex contracting processes and lax enforcement. A new executive order could ensure that the awarding of contracts is based on the quality of jobs created, challenging the notion that the best contractor is the one with the lowest labor costs."

http://news.yahoo.com/audit-usda-paid-millions-in-federal-aid-to-dead-farmers-172308601.html,,[],Audit: USDA paid millions in federal aid to dead farmers,"More than $30 million in federal aid has been doled out to deceased farmers in recent years because of lax oversight by U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, according to a government audit.

An inspection by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office revealed that the USDA’s conservation and crop insurance programs failed to match subsidy claims against the Social Security Administration’s file of deceased individuals. The payouts went to about 4,500 farmers between 2008 and 2012.

According to estimates in the report, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) made $10.6 million in payments to 1,103 deceased individuals for a year or more after their deaths. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) made $22 million in subsidies and allowances to 3,434 program policyholders for two or more years after death.

This is a drop in the bucket given the $20 billion the USDA spends yearly to help more than 1 million participants, says Bob Young, chief economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.

“In the overall grand scheme of things, it was not a whole heck of a lot of money,” Young told Yahoo News. “Any dollar that is not spent properly is an issue, admittedly. But, wow, in terms of overall percentages of money that were put out of whatever, I thought it was kind of amazing that it was as small as it was.”

The USDA’s written response to the audit stated it “generally agrees with the report’s findings and recommendations” but defended the agencies by pointing out that the programs had close working relationships with participants and imposed yearly reporting.

“Although NRCS and RMA can identify some deceased participants during their normal operations, we do not believe that identifying deceased individuals during normal operations is a reliable substitute for having a systematic process,” federal auditors wrote.

Young says he doubts very few farming families tried to deliberately fraud the government.

“Sometimes you’ll end up with some time between when a person passes away and the time the estate gets restructured or whatever, and you’ll get a payment that gets caught in the middle,” Young says.

Story continues

The RMA, the report notes, put a computer system in place and started checking claims against the government’s list of deceased persons in May.

The GAO’s fraud findings come at time when Washington is squabbling over the cost of the current farm bill, which expires in two months.

In its report to Congress, federal auditors said their findings “may call into question whether these safety net programs are benefiting the agriculture sector as intended.”"

Court officials said they have only confirmed that 94 Social Security numbers were obtained and they don't believe the larger number was compromised, but they wanted to alert the public to the possibility as a precaution.

The broader information ""just happened to be on a server in an area that was accessed,"" said Veronica Diseth, director of the courts' information services division.

The breach happened because of vulnerability in an Adobe Systems Inc. software program, ColdFusion, that has since been patched, court officials said. The hack happened sometime after September but wasn't caught until February, they said.

Telephone and email messages were left for Adobe representatives seeking comment.

Mike Keeling, the courts' information technology operations and maintenance manager, said officials were alerted to the breach by a business on the East Coast that had a similar intrusion.

""They recognized our information in their breach log,"" Keeling said, which led them to install the patch provided by Adobe and start an investigation.

When court officials were first alerted to the breach, they believed all of the information accessed was public record, and didn't think confidential information was taken, but following an investigation by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the broader breach was confirmed in April, said courts spokeswoman Wendy Ferrell.

Court officials said a law enforcement agency also investigated the case but they declined to say which one. They said the investigation was concluded and there was no information on who might be to blame.

Keeling said he didn't believe the courts were a specific target.

""The hackers were probably opportunistic,"" he said. ""They were more than likely just fishing for data.""

Ferrell said that once the breach was confirmed, it took additional time to go through the files and increase security to the website, which is why there was a lag in notifying the public. The 94 known names breached are being contacted by letter, she said. The rest of the people who are potentially affected come from a defined group:

— Those booked into a city or county jail within the state of Washington between September 2011 and December 2012 may have had their name and Social Security number accessed.

— Names and driver's license numbers may have been obtained from people who received a DUI citation in Washington state between 1989 through 2011, had a traffic case in Washington filed or resolved in a district or municipal court between 2011 and 2012, or had a superior court criminal case in Washington state that was filed against them or resolved between 2011 and 2012.

Keeling acknowledged that confidential information should have been kept in a different area, ""and now they are.""

""I can say nothing more than it was an oversight on our part,"" he said.

Keeling said officials have added a number of additional security measures, including isolating anything that could be sensitive into more protected areas, implementing code to prevent hackers from getting to other parts of a server, and new encryption rules.

Ferrell said no one from the Administrative Office of the Courts or any court in Washington state will be asking for personal information over the phone or via email related to the breach.

State officials have set up a website and hotline to answer public questions about the break: http://www.courts.wa.gov/databreach and 1-800-448-5584.

Michael Cockrill, the state's chief information officer, said security experts have determined there were no breaches at state agencies, which are on a separate network.

""Cybersecurity and cyberterrorism attacks continue to rise in number and sophistication every year, affecting the private and public sector, and countless individuals,"" Cockrill said in a written statement. ""The AOC data breach is a sobering reminder for every branch and every level of government that protection of personal and confidential data entrusted to government is a paramount responsibility.""

Cockrill said Gov. Jay Inslee has directed his office and Consolidated Technology Services in the executive branch to assist the Office of the Courts to enhance the security of its judicial data.

Washington state Court Administrator Callie Dietz said that if any of the 94 people who are contacted by the court request credit monitoring, ""we certainly will provide whatever we can do for them."""

Obama stressed that he is willing to work with lawmakers wherever they can agree, but the tone he struck amounted to a rebuke of Republicans, whom Americans largely blame for pushing the United States to the brink of an economic calamity.

“The American people are completely fed up with Washington,” Obama said in a White House speech attended by many of the aides who worked day and night through the various stages of the latest fiscal stalemate.

Hours after he signed into law a bill hastily cobbled together to end the crisis, Obama said events over the past two weeks had inflicted “completely unnecessary” damage on the U.S. economy.

An increase in borrowing costs caused by the near-debt default was harmful and consumers cut back on spending with hundreds of thousands of government workers suddenly idled, he said.

“There was no economic rationale for all of this,” he said.

Though bruised by the battle, Obama emerged as the clear winner. He immediately sought to use the political capital gained to advance a domestic policy agenda centered around a fresh round of budget talks and an effort to win approval of two stalled items, immigration reform and a farm bill.

He did not mention an urgent challenge facing him now: Repairing the flaws in his signature healthcare law that have prevented many Americans from even signing up for it.

Obama issued an aggressive challenge to Congress, particularly the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, to stop focusing on who wins and loses political battles and get to work with him on issues critical to improving the economy.

LOBBYISTS, BLOGGERS, TALKING HEADS

“All of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict and focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do,” he said.

Obama said his opponents should “go out there and win an election” and push to change policies they do not like, but not try to break apart America’s system of governing.

Republicans were not impressed.

“Eventually the president has to realize Republicans won the majority in the House, and he has a shared responsibility to govern,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner. “If the president continues to refuse to negotiate, or make any real concessions, I don’t know how he expects to get anything done to help the American people.”

A senior Senate Republican aide said: “Where was he during this whole thing? To pop your head up at the end and lecture doesn’t do anything.”

Obama’s refusal to negotiate over the U.S. debt ceiling was credited by his aides as having forced Republicans to accept most of his terms for an agreement.

Even so, the strategy carried the risk of making him appear reluctant to engage his political opponents.

Leon Panetta, who served as Obama’s defense secretary, offered what seemed to be indirect criticism of Obama this week at a reporters’ breakfast hosted by the Wall Street Journal.

“You have to engage in the process. This is a town where it’s not enough to feel you have the right answers. You’ve got to roll up your sleeves and you’ve got to really engage in the process . . . that’s what governing is all about,” the Washington Post quoted Panetta as saying.

The agenda Obama laid out for the rest of the year appeared to presage more partisan fighting. He called for House action on two major items that cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate earlier this year but collapsed in the House: an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system and passage of a $500 billion farm bill.

Obama also renewed his plea for a “balanced approach” to the U.S. budget - language that means he wants to see some sources of new revenue in the budget, such as closing corporate tax loopholes, instead of simply cutting government spending.

House Republicans have ruled out tax increases.

“I understand we will not suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. Democrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues,” Obama said. “And sometimes we’ll be just too far apart to forge an agreement. But that should not hold back our efforts in areas where we do agree.”"

(CNN) – The Internal Revenue Service is playing defense on a new front: excess spending on conferences.

The IRS spent close to $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012, according to briefings given to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

TIGTA will release an audit Tuesday that details surplus spending at a conference in 2010 for 2,700 people in the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed division.

At a House oversight committee hearing on the issue next week, lawmakers will focus on the August 2010 conference held in Anaheim, California, at a cost of $4 million. Several IRS employees stayed in presidential suites at hotels, the committee learned. Such suites currently cost between $1,500 to $3,500 per night.

""The culture of the federal workforce is one where I don't think you can underestimate that if you don't keep reminding the voters - but also the federal workers - that we're watching, this will happen again,"" Rep. Darrell Issa said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Last year, the General Services Administration drew fierce congressional criticism and scrutiny for spending nearly $1 million on a conference in Las Vegas, also in 2010. It featured a controversial video and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator. The administration implemented efforts to clamp down on such spending.

""It doesn't stay fixed,"" Issa said. ""One example in Anaheim, when they bought their tickets they said, 'Well, we'll pay the per diem rate for these hotel rooms.' They didn't negotiate, they didn't bid it. And this was 2,700 folks. So they could have gotten a considerable reduction. Instead what they said is, 'We'll pay full boat, but we want some perks.' So they ended up with free drinks, they ended up with tickets to games, basically kickbacks.""

Fifteen outside speakers were hired to give presentations at the conference, totaling $135,000, the oversight committee was told. One of the speakers, who was paid $17,000, led a session called ""Leadership Through Art.""

The IRS spent $50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event. One had a ""Star Trek"" theme and was reported on earlier this year, while the other video – in which employees learned the Cupid shuffle dance – was released this weekend.

The purpose of the conference was listed as continuing professional education, but credits were not given to attendees, the committee learned. Also, no sign-in sheets were posted outside training sessions, making it difficult for TIGTA to determine if attendees actually went to the sessions.

The IRS has not taken disciplinary action over the conference, TIGTA told the oversight committee, adding that planners were given cash awards for their efforts.

The report comes as the IRS is already under investigation for its admitted targeting of conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status in 2010 and 2011.

Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel released a statement Friday about the upcoming audit release, saying such spending is ""inappropriate.""

""This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era. While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred,"" he said, adding that such a conference would not take place today.

""Sweeping new spending restrictions have been put in place at the IRS, and travel and training expenses have dropped more than 80 percent since 2010 and similar large-scale meetings did not take place in 2011, 2012 or 2013.""

The federal budget cuts hitting Garden City Regional Airport would save the government more than $300,000 but leave pilots to man landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

The federal budget cuts hitting Garden City Regional Airport would save the government more than $300,000 but leave pilots to man landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

The federal budget cuts were still an abstraction as American Eagle Flight 3429 crossed the snow-crusted plains into southwestern Kansas. Kevin Colvin, a construction manager flying in for work, looked out of the window at the tiny airport below.

“They make it sound like, ‘Oh my God! We’re going to die if we make these cuts!’ ” he said, eating a potato chip, the cuts still two days away. “I think it’s a bunch of BS.”

The cuts came into clearer focus Thursday. Garden City Regional Airport would lose its air traffic controllers, saving the federal government $318,756 and leaving pilots to handle landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

“Oh,” said Dave Unruh, a retired farmer who heard the news as he waited for a flight to Dallas. “Is that part of the deal?”

By Friday, people in this solidly conservative area faced the reality that it was.

“Great!” said Terryl Spiker, a rancher and banker catching the 2 p.m. American Eagle out for the weekend. He crossed his arms over his flannel shirt and smiled. “Just cut a little more.”

As sequestration dawned, reactions in Kansas’s 1st Congressional District ranged from disbelief to concern to a kind of defiant joy that the $85 billion in mandatory spending cuts had arrived at last. In the 2012 House elections, voters here overwhelmingly backed tea party conservative Tim Huelskamp, who recently hailed sequestration as “the first significant tea party victory” in Washington.

Not everyone here sees it that way. Mayor David Crase and airport director Rachelle Powell spent last week writing letters to Huelskamp and other elected officials urging them to save Garden City’s tower, one of 238 at relatively small airports across the country set to close beginning April 1. Crase said the closure would “undo years of investments” at the local, state and federal level. Powell warned of a decline in flights and associated revenue from fuel or fees or dinners at the popular restaurant Napoli’s at the Flight Deck. Though it was too soon to know, she worried that American Eagle might curtail the only regional jet service in and out of southwestern Kansas — a constellation of gridded towns that dissolve into farm fields and ranches and some of the largest meatpacking plants in the world.

Mostly, Powell was worried about what she described as “a severe negative impact” on airport safety. While the early and late American Eagle flights take off and land at a time when the tower is closed, Powell said, air traffic controllers guide the two afternoon flights, along with occasional military jet training runs, medical evacuation flights, casino charters and private jets that have delivered people such as Dick Cheney, Harrison Ford and Huelskamp himself to the high plains.

If the tower is eliminated completely, those responsibilities revert to pilots, who must communicate among themselves to coordinate landings, takeoffs and emergency responses.

Jeff De Busk, an air traffic control manager and father of six who expects to lose his job, recounted two recent near-collisions — both involving pilots on the wrong radio channel — averted by the tower. “I understand we have to cut the budget,” he said. “But this? It just doesn’t make any sense.”

It was around 1 p.m. Friday, and De Busk was sitting before work in the small, low-ceilinged waiting area of the red brick terminal, a space with light blue chairs and mauve couches and a glossy sign — “It’s worth the trip!” — welcoming visitors to the place people just call Garden.

At the moment, the terminal was quiet except for the hiss of the Bunn automatic coffee maker over by the two rental-car counters. You could hear 18-wheelers hum along the two-lane highway outside, and the rattle and snap of the American and Kansas state flags blowing in the wind.

Soon, the passengers began filing in for the afternoon American Eagle to Dallas, which has steadily picked up business since it started last year.

Here were Judy and Earl Kleeman, retirees headed to Florida for a cruise to the Turks and Caicos Islands. “I feel strongly about the need to cut the national debt,” Judy Kleeman said, wondering whether she was willing to fly without the tower. “But I do feel strongly about education, and so many people need help. I don’t know much about air traffic control. I wonder if there was anyone there when I flew in last time.”

Here was Inocencio Feria, who was seeing off a family friend and said he would just drive to Amarillo, Tex., if American curtailed its flights. “It’s just four or five hours,” he said.

John Bogner, a beer wholesaler, was heading to Las Vegas for a convention. He was a family friend of Huelskamp’s, voted for him, and agreed completely that it was time to cut the budget. He was not sure cutting an air traffic control tower was the safest option, he said, “but I guess they have to start somewhere.”

CNN was on the TV, and a reporter was talking about the partisan gridlock triggering the budget cuts. Saeed Abdalla watched and compared U.S. politics to those of his home country of Somalia, where for more than 20 years clan rivalries and power grabs, among other factors, prevented any central government from functioning. He rubbed his forehead.

“American politics is complicated,” he said.

Robert Rouse, an ammonia refrigeration technician in town for the well-regarded industrial boiler class at Garden City Community College, wheeled in his luggage.

“I hate to see somebody lose a job,” he said.

Terryl Spiker and his wife, Ruth, sat down next to him. Besides being generally glad that the cutting was beginning, Spiker said that he was disgusted by both sides in Washington and that any businessman knows how to cut 10 percent of a budget without much pain. Although closing the tower was unnecessary, he said, he was not worried about flying without one. “From this little airport?” he said. “No.”

“Is that legal?” asked his wife, and soon the loudspeaker announced that security was open, just through the double doors.

Thirty people filed through. They scanned their boots, their quilted duffles and their computer cases and walked out onto the runway under what appeared to be an empty blue sky.

De Busk was in the tower, his voice squawking through a speaker in Powell’s office. She looked out through her windows at the silvery jet on the runway. A small propeller plane had just landed, and the jet soon took off.

By the time it returned eight hours later, President Obama had signed the papers officially ordering sequestration to begin. In Garden City, it was dark, the little airport lit up by blue, red and white lights. Here came the plane, and here came the passengers, including Justin Swift, a hotel proprietor who was coming home after a trip to Los Angeles, where he said he had gone through three security checks. “It’s so unnecessary — just fluff,” he said.

He wanted the budget reduced, but shutting down Garden City’s air traffic control tower did not strike him as the best way to do that. “It’s a stupid cut,” Swift said. “But we’ve got to cut. We’ve got to cut more.”"

Portsmouth City Council has approved and finalised a loan to the Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST) which is looking to buy the stricken club.

The Trust has been given a £1.45m bridging loan by the council which it will pay back at a rate of 5%.

The loan will enable the Trust, along with property developer Stuart Robinson, to buy Fratton Park.

Administrators of the club must first release former owner Portpin's hold on the club through the High Court.

Conditions of PST council loan That the club owned and operated by the trust is the same club that was relegated and has membership of the relevant football league

That the club and its assets are bought for £7.68m, which includes provision for the full and final settlement of the football creditors

That the club owned and operated by the trust obtains all rights to the £11.7m of parachute payments

That the trust obtains a legal charge over Fratton Park

That no other legal charges are made against the income or assets of the club, beyond those set out in the trust's business plan, without the prior consent of the council

That the council receives an assignment of parachute payments to repay the loan or that an investor guarantee is provided by the trust for the full £1.45m

That a subscription agreement for the trust's Fan Share Scheme, High Net Worth Investors and Associate Director Scheme is in place, which has been approved by the city solicitor and does not allow money to be taken out of the club until the council has been repaid

That proof of funds from the three schemes has been demonstrated

That a suitably skilled and experienced chief executive is appointed by the trust

The decision to hand over the money was taken at an emergency meeting on Wednesday despite a last-minute appeal by Labour and Conservative leaders to council cabinet to delay the decision.

Cllr Gerald Vernon Jackson said a decision had to be taken so administrators could file papers with the courts.

""Without the money, the city would have been left with no professional football team and officers say the risk to council tax payers is now less than when the entire council voted to help out last August, "" said Jackson.

""The council has first call on the parachute payments from the league in August this year when the loan has to be repaid,"" he said.

Portsmouth have been in administration since 17 February 2012.

The club are currently the subject of a takeover bid by the PST, but approval is conditional on the group taking control of the club's Fratton Park stadium.

Another former owner, Balram Chainrai, claims he is owed £12m and holds the stadium as security through his company Portpin via a fixed charge.

The PST has offered Chainrai £3m for the ground, but the Hong Kong businessman has so far refused to sell.

Administrators PKF are attempting to force the sale of Fratton Park at the High Court and that case will be heard by 19 April at the latest.

The Football League has warned the club must exit administration before the end of the season or face expulsion."

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.

Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage “has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.”

Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes “would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.”

24/7 Wall St. A state’s cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a “right to work state,” meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union’s costs as a condition of employment.

Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation’s highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.

Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-deal-proposes-cuts-160608265.html,,[],"Obama seeks deal, proposes cuts to Social Security","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking an elusive middle ground, President Barack Obama is proposing a 2014 budget that embraces tax increases abhorred by Republicans as well as reductions, loathed by liberals, in the growth of Social Security and other benefit programs.

The plan, if ever enacted, could touch almost all Americans. The rich would see tax increases, the poor and the elderly would get smaller annual increases in their benefits, and middle income taxpayers would slip into higher tax brackets despite Obama's repeated vows not to add to the tax burden of the middle class. His proposed changes, once phased in, would mean a cut in Social Security benefits of nearly $1,000 a year for an average 85-year-old, smaller cuts for younger retirees.

Obama proposed much the same without success to House Speaker John Boehner in December. The response Friday was dismissive from Republicans and hostile from liberals, labor and advocates for the elderly.

But the proposal aims to tackle worrisome deficits that are adding to the national debt and placing a long-term burden on the nation, prompting praise from independent deficit hawks. Obama's budget also proposes new spending for public works projects, pre-school education and for job and benefit assistance for veterans.

""It's not the president's ideal approach to our budget challenges, but it is a serious compromise proposition that demonstrates that he wants to get things done,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

The budget, which Obama will release Wednesday to cover the budget year beginning Oct. 1, proposes spending cuts and revenue increases that would result in $1.8 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years. That figure would replace $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that are poised to take effect over the next 10 years if Congress and the president don't come up with an alternative, thus delivering a net increase in deficit reduction of $600 billion.

Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute to $4.3 trillion in total deficit reduction by 2023.

Story continues

The budget wouldn't affect the $85 billion in cuts that kicked in last month for this budget year.

A key feature of Obama's plan is a revised inflation adjustment called ""chained CPI."" This new formula would effectively curb annual increases in a broad swath of government programs but would have its biggest impact on Social Security. By encompassing Obama's offer to Boehner, R-Ohio, the plan would also include reductions in Medicare spending, much of it by targeting payments to health care providers and drug companies. The Medicare proposal also would require wealthier recipients to pay higher premiums or co-pays.

Obama's budget proposal also calls for additional tax revenue, primarily by placing a 28 percent cap on deductions and other tax exclusions. That plan would affect wealthy taxpayers as would a new administration proposal to place limits on tax-preferred retirement accounts for millionaires and billionaires.

Obama made the same offer to Boehner in December when he and the speaker were negotiating ways of avoiding a steep, so-called fiscal cliff of combined across-the-board spending cuts and sweeping tax increases caused by the expiration of Bush-era tax rates. Boehner rejected that plan and ultimately Congress approved tax increases that were half of what Obama had sought.

""If you look at where the president's final offer and Boehner were ... they were extremely close to each other,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We do think that it's a very good sign that the president has included real entitlement reforms in the budget.""

Boehner, in a statement Friday, said House Republicans made clear to Obama last month that he should not make savings in entitlement programs that both sides agree on, contingent on more tax increases.

""If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes,"" Boehner said. ""That's no way to lead and move the country forward.""

The inflation adjustment would reduce federal spending on government programs over 10 years by about $130 billion, according to White House estimates. Because it also affects how tax brackets are adjusted, it would also generate about $100 billion in higher taxes and hit even middle income taxpayers.

Once the change is fully phased in, Social Security benefits for a typical middle-income 65-year-old would be about $136 less a year, according to an analysis of Social Security data. At age 75, annual benefits under the new index would be $560 less. At 85, the cut would be $984 a year.

The concept behind the chained CPI is that consumers substitute lower-priced alternatives for goods whose costs spike. So, for example, if the price of oranges goes too high for some consumers, they could buy alternatives like apples or strawberries if their prices were more affordable. This flexibility isn't considered in the current system of gauging inflation, a calculation that determines how much benefits grow each year. Taking it into account means such benefits won't grow by as much.

Advocates for the elderly say seniors pay a higher portion of their income for health care, where costs rise more quickly than inflation.

The White House has said the cost-of-living adjustments would include protections for ""vulnerable"" recipients.

""The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement.

AARP's legislative policy director said Obama's budget proposal, while not a surprise, was a disappointment.

""The message seems to be that the president wants a deal and is willing to even sacrifice such important benefits as Social Security as part of that deal,"" said David Certner. The seniors lobby argues that Social Security doesn't belong in the budget talks because it isn't contributing to the deficit and is separately financed with its own dedicated taxes.

Citing the effect on veterans, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said he was ""terribly disappointed"" in the Obama plan and would ""do everything in my power to block"" it.

While Obama has proposed the slower cost of living adjustment plan during fiscal negotiations with Republican leaders, placing it in the budget would put the administration's official imprint on the plan and mark a full shift from Obama's stand in 2008, when he campaigned against Republican Party nominee John McCain.

In a Sept. 6, 2008, speech to AARP, Obama said: ""John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear: I will not do either.""

Obama also proposes $305 billion in cuts to Medicare over a decade, including $156 billion through lower Medicare payments to drug companies and higher premiums or co-pays from wealthy recipients. That's to the right of the conservative budget of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., which barely touches Medicare in the coming 10 years, cutting just $129 billion from the program. The huge Medicare savings from Ryan's proposal, which transforms the system into a program in which the government subsidizes health insurance purchases on the private market, wouldn't accrue until the following decade.

Obama's budget comes after the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-run Senate passed separate and markedly different budget proposals. House Republicans achieved long-term deficit reductions by targeting safety net programs; Democrats instead protected those programs and called for $1 trillion in tax increases.

But Obama has been making a concerted effort to win Republican support, especially in the Senate. He has even scheduled a dinner with Republican lawmakers on the evening that his budget is released next week.

As described by the administration officials, the budget proposal would also end a loophole that permits people to obtain unemployment insurance and disability benefits at the same time.

Obama's proposal, however, includes calls for increased spending. It proposes $50 billion for public works projects. It also would make preschool available to more children by increasing the tax on tobacco.

As Reid rightly pointed out, ""The Republicans were in power—there were more of them."" To be sure, Democrats were trying to score political points at President Bush's expense. But there were no threats, no filibusters and no risk to the full faith and credit of the United States.

Which is what makes the GOP's hostage-taking so unique. Whether motivated by opposition to larger spending or tax legislation, or as a symbolic vote to embarrass the president and his Congressional majority (as Sens. Obama and Reid did in 2006), the 40 debt ceiling increases since 1980 have rarely been unanimous. But never before has the threat to block a debt limit increase been coupled with one party's intent and ability to actually do it. After all, while Republican Speaker John Boehner has the numbers to deny a debt ceiling increase in the House, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell can prevent it from even coming to a vote. Of course, when George W. Bush sat in the Oval Office, GOP leaders including Boehner, McConnell, Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor and John Cornyn didn't just vote for seven increases in the debt ceiling. In November 2004, they all voted for the very kind of ""clean"" debt ceiling bill they refuse to offer President Obama now.

After having increases the national debt by 40 percent since his inauguration in January 2001, President George W. Bush in October 2004 called for his fourth hike in the nation's borrowing authority. His Treasury Secretary John Snow warned, ""Given current projections, it is imperative that the Congress take action to increase the debt limit by mid-November,"" adding that his arsenal of fiscal tools, including tapping money intended for the civil service retirement fund, ""will be exhausted.""

But as the New York Times explained on November 17, 2004, Bush had to wait for his debt ceiling increase for a very simple reason:



Though an increase in the debt ceiling was never in doubt, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress postponed action on it last month, until after the elections, to deprive Democrats of a chance to accuse them of fiscal irresponsibility.

With his reelection safely secured, Republicans delivered Bush's debt ceiling increase in a stand-alone bill, with no conditions, no threats and no poison pills. By 52-44 in the Senate and 208-204 in the House, Republicans led Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) boosted the borrowing limit from $7.4 trillion to $8.2 trillion. Over 100 current Republican members of Congress voted ""aye."" Among them were the today's top two Senate Republicans (Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn) and the entire House leadership team (Boehner, Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan).

And just why did President Bush and his allies insist that 11 percent increase was needed?



Administration officials contend that the annual deficits are undesirable but necessary to help stimulate an economic recovery and fight a global war on terrorism.

""We have an obligation to keep the government in operation.""

""Let me tell you what's involved if we don't lift the debt ceiling: financial collapse and calamity throughout the world. That's not lost upon me. But we've done this 93 times. And if we keep doing the same old thing, then that is insanity to the nth degree.""

As Speaker Hastert's spokesman John Feehery put it just before the House vote:In their rare moments of candor, Republican leaders acknowledge as much . Failure to raise the debt limit, Speaker John Boehner cautioned in January 2011, ""would be a financial disaster, not only for our country but for the worldwide economy."" Paul Ryan, whose 2012 House GOP budget would add $6 trillion in new red ink over the next decade, agreed that ""you can't not raise the debt ceiling."" Lindsey Graham, who has repeatedly demanded Obama ""man up"" on spending cuts, explained why:Apparently, that ""same old thing"" doesn't apply when a Republican is sitting in the Oval Office. It's not just that Ronald Reagan presided over 17 debt limit hikes and a tripling of the national debt during his eight years in the White House or that President George W. Bush nearly doubled it again. The end-of-decade $5.6 trillion surplus forecast by the Congressional Budget Office in 2000 was more than eviscerated by two unfunded wars, two rounds of Bush tax cuts, the unpaid-for Medicare prescription drug benefit and the TARP bank bailout. To accommodate those ""spend and not tax"" policies, Bush and his GOP allies in Congress voted seven times to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. (That vote tally included a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase in 2004, backed by 98 current House Republicans and 31 sitting GOP senators.) And as it turns out, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) voted for all of it.

During the GOP's first debt ceiling hostage-taking in the summer of 2011, U.S. consumer confidence plunged and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost while Uncle Sam racked up almost $2 billion in unnecessary interest payments. As for the uncertainty and credit rating downgrade the debt ceiling debacle produced, S&P pointed the finger at the GOP, the only party willing to countenance a default by the United States:



A Standard & Poor's director said for the first time Thursday that one reason the United States lost its triple-A credit rating was that several lawmakers expressed skepticism about the serious consequences of a credit default -- a position put forth by some Republicans. Without specifically mentioning Republicans, S&P senior director Joydeep Mukherji said the stability and effectiveness of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that ""people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default,"" Mukherji said. ""That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable,"" he added. ""This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns.""

That's exactly right. That kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns and unheard of among Democrats. But among Republican leaders, holding the American economy hostage is just another day at the office. After his first round of debt limit extortion, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted in August 2011:



""I think some of our members may have thought the default issue was a hostage you might take a chance at shooting,"" he said. ""Most of us didn't think that. What we did learn is this -- it's a hostage that's worth ransoming. And it focuses the Congress on something that must be done.""

""What we have done, Larry, also is set a new template. In the future, any president, this one or another one, when they request us to raise the debt ceiling, it will not be clean anymore. This is just the first step. This, we anticipate, will take us into 2013. Whoever the new president is, is probably going to be asking us to raise the debt ceiling again. Then we will go through the process again and see what we can continue to achieve in connection with these debt ceiling requests of presidents to get our financial house in order.""

And as he later explained to CNBC's Larry Kudlow, McConnell's future hostage-taking isn't a threat, but a promise:A new template, indeed. Because while the minority party in Congress has often voted against debt ceiling increases, it never had the either the numbers or the intent to blackmail the president. Until, that is, Democrat Barack Obama entered the Oval Office."

In oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on Wednesday, Scalia made the point that members of Congress have no reason whatsoever to vote against the extension of the Voting Rights Act and that he was “fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless–unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.”

“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said

Scalia’s point was that once a bill has the effect of ensuring that minority candidates get elected from “minority” districts, it is almost impossible, in the political system, to vote against extending the act.

“Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.”

Scalia said there were “certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now” and even the Virginia Senators “have no interest in voting against this” because they would lose votes “if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.”

“Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act,” Scalia said. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”

Sotomayor was not having any of it.

Sotomayor, as a liberal Washington Post columnist noted, “allowed the lawyer for the Alabama county seeking to overturn the law to get just four sentences into his argument before interrupting him. “

When Sotomayor would not relent, Justice Anthony Kennedy had to say, in remarks directed at her, “I would like to hear the answer to the question.”

When the lawyer started talking, Kagan then interrupted him. And in what was described as a “breach of decorum,” Kagan interrupted Scalia’s questioning to argue with Scalia directly on the bench.

Sotomayor would not let Justice Samuel Alito get a word in as well, and Chief Justice John Roberts had to says, “Justice Alito,” to signal that he had the floor.

And when the lawyer for Alabama was about to make his concluding arguments, Sotomayor allowed him four words–“Thank you, Chief Justice”–before aggressively interrupting him.

“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?,” Sotomayor asked.

Before he could explain, she interrupted by saying she had “asked a different question.”

“Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” Sotomayor asked.

And so it went, and the mainstream media that always describe Scalia as “acerbic” for his aggressive questioning did not judge Sotomayor and Kagan by the same standards. Instead, mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post said Sotomayor’s and Kagan’s performances proved they were “ready for battle.”"

In', 'He Won The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary. King Joined The Post S Editorial Board In']",Colbert King: The Republican pity party,"Conservative behavior since President Obama’s reelection in November has evoked, at least in me, a keen sense of sadness. Hardly a day goes by without weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth by the likes of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio and Sean Hannity on Fox News over Obama’s return to the White House. Similar whining is heard among Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Simply put, conservatives are in agony over the president’s smashing victory. Their pain is hard to watch. Only small-minded Democrats would gloat.

What we’re seeing is the impact of losing when you believed with all your heart, soul and mind, buttressed by the predictions of pollsters and pundits, that you would win handily.

The reaction is, for me, heart-rending.

Consider the feeble attempt by House Republicans to recover political ground by threatening Obama over the debt limit.

The poor things, crazed by their defeat, didn’t realize that they had no leverage. They had to back down with a face-saving gimmick to suspend through May enforcement of the limit on federal borrowing.

Consider some Republicans’ return to the issue of what happened in Benghazi, Libya. Did they really think that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would traipse up to the Hill this week, prostrate herself before Congress and confess to something that she knew wasn’t true?

They so wanted her to say that there was mendacity and attempts by the administration to cover up malfeasance in the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility. Some seemed truly distressed that Clinton wouldn’t give them what they wanted. They were so desperate. It was so sad.

And so it has gone since election night. The lamentations abound:

●Obama’s nominations of Jack Lew as Treasury secretary and Chuck Hagel as defense secretary are confrontational; woe unto us.

●“I would have liked to have seen some outreach” in Obama’s inaugural address, complained Sen. John McCain, who, with his Republican cohorts, did everything they could to kick Barack Obama out of the White House.

●The Obama administration will “attempt to annihilate the Republican Party . . . to just shove us into the dustbin of history,” House Speaker John Boehner wailed this week.

And so it goes: one big conservative pity party.

Imagine how hard it must have been to lose.

For four long years they hit Obama with everything they had, assailing him at every turn. No insult was too offensive to be hurled; no abuse too outrageous to be tried; no name too abusive to call.

From Day One, destruction of the Obama administration and preventing his reelection was top priority; the second item too far down the list to remember.

Four years of blame, blame, blame. Blah, blah, blah.

Conservatives on Capitol Hill and right-wing commentators left nothing on the field.

They gave it their all — and came up empty.

What an emotional letdown. How not to feel at least a little sorry for them?

So where do they go from here?

This should be a time for introspection, for conservatives to examine their thoughts and look inside for answers as to why they lost when, at first blush, they had so much going for them. And why were they so dead set on not just defeating but breaking this president?

Hard-liners, of course, will take exception to my characterization of their behavior. What I might call abusive or mean they would probably describe as passionate: their passionate defense of liberty, the Constitution, smaller government, free enterprise and the individual — all things they see Obama as opposing.

The conservative wing regards itself as all that stands between freedom and tyranny, between order and chaos, between values and licentiousness.

And perhaps that self-view explains why they are taking their loss so hard.

It also may help explain why their conduct is so, well, touching.

Conservatives yakking it up in House and Senate chambers and on the airwaves these days are delusional, in much the way that the South deluded itself into thinking it was in the right during the Civil War or that Republicans held fast to the misguided belief that the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was wrong for the country.

American principles endure. But America is changing, just as it evolved during the Lincoln era and just as it emerged from the Great Depression under FDR’s leadership.

What makes this so excruciatingly sad is that some forces on the right are too far gone to see the truth.

But right now, both are being promoted for their tax benefits.

Money put into these products grows on a tax-deferred basis just as it does in retirement accounts. In the case of annuities, the money is eventually taxed as ordinary income when it is taken out. With permanent life insurance, the death benefit goes to the beneficiaries free of income tax, but if it is a permanent policy, as opposed to a term policy, the owner of the policy could also borrow against its cash value and never pay income tax on it. (The insurance company charges interest on the borrowed money, though, and that loan reduces the value of the death benefit if it is not paid back.)

And while insurance companies are using the tax issue as a selling point, that is by no means the full picture. I have written recent columns on how this year’s tax increases have influenced behavior around estate planning and investments. As in those two cases, the decision to buy various life insurance policies or annuities can be unduly influenced by the tax advantages inherent in insurance. Many policies carry high upfront and management fees, have limited investment options and penalize people for withdrawing their money within a few years of buying the policy or annuity.

With these downsides, insurance companies are regularly looking for reasons to sell their products beyond the death benefits of insurance and the steady income stream of annuities."

With the Treasury Department warning that it could run out of money to pay national obligations within a day, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday evening, 81 to 18, to approve a proposal hammered out by the chamber’s Republican and Democratic leaders after the House on Tuesday was unable to move forward with any resolution. The House followed suit a few hours later, voting 285 to 144 to approve the Senate plan, which would fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt limit through Feb. 7.

Mr. Obama signed the bill about 12:30 a.m. Thursday.

Most House Republicans opposed the bill, but 87 voted to support it. The breakdown showed that Republican leaders were willing to violate their informal rule against advancing bills that do not have majority Republican support in order to end the shutdown.

RELATED: DOJ Finally Sues Apple and Publishers for E-Book Price Fixing

Today, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division Bill Baer issued a statement saying that the DoJ will sue to prevent a $20.1 billion deal that could crush competition in the U.S. beer market. Baer writes:

If ABI fully owned and controlled Modelo, ABI would be able to increase beer prices to American consumers. This lawsuit seeks to prevent ABI from eliminating Modelo as an important competitive force in the beer industry.

Recent years have seen a lot of consolidation in beer ownership. In 2008, InBev (the Belgian company that owns Stella Artois and Beck's) bought Anheuser-Busch (the American maker of Budweiser, Rolling Rock, and Michelob, among other brands). It currently owns half of Grupo Modelo (their beers include Corona, Pacifico, and Modelo), but has been trying to buy the other half since the summer of 2012. The DoJ is now arguing that when you throw all those beers together under the same ownership, you get a monopoly.

The move might look like a win for local microbreweries, but specialist beer makers still have reason to be concerned about the beer market behemoth. As The Wall Street Journal's Mike Esterl reported last week, InBev is plotting an entrance into the ""craft"" beer market at the same time as they work on bulking up their mass market offerings. You want a ""peppermint stout,"" a beer with ""caramel-like notes,"" or a blend with hints of ""hibiscus flowers?"" Anheuser-Busch has you covered, apparently."

He laid out the Obama administration's case in an op-ed for The International New York Times that the failure to replace the across-the-board ""blunt spending cuts"" would hurt the U.S. economy.

""As independent economists and business leaders will tell you, these cuts have already slowed economic growth, just as the economy was getting traction,"" he wrote. ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by the third quarter of next year, sequestration will have reduced real gross domestic product by as much as 1.2 percent, which means as many as 1.6 million fewer American jobs.""

The blanket cuts are a product of the 2011 fiscal stalemate and subsequent failed attempts to produce an alternative. The sequester is widely disliked but took effect anyways, shaving spending from nearly every piece of the federal budget, except funds for mandatory programs like Social Security.

Even some Republicans who favor cutting government spending see the sequester cuts as too indiscriminate.

""The real problems are that we're continuing to spend money that we don't have on things that we don't need,"" Sen. Tom Coburn said Sunday on NBC.

""There's tremendous amounts of waste and fraud. We have to protect the promises made to American people. And we can do that, but we can do that spending a whole lot less money than we're doing today,"" he continued.

The next scheduled round of cuts will be even deeper.

The debt ceiling deal Congress reached this month funded the government at current levels and put off a decision on the sequester until January 15.

But their track record of resolving these issues isn't great.

http://news.yahoo.com/a-shutdown-free-future-is-in-the-cards-213854346.html,,[],A shutdown-free future is in the cards,"Merry Christmas, America. The House just took a step toward ensuring an entire year without government shutdowns.

Despite a brief minirevolt among hard-line conservative Republicans, the House on Thursday approved a budget resolution that will set spending levels into 2015 with bipartisan support. The nonbinding resolution aims to replace parts of sequestration by offering $63 billion of “sequester relief” and will set spending levels at $1.012 trillion in fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion in fiscal year 2015.

The House passed the resolution 332-94, and the Senate is expected to pass it next week. Because budget resolutions are not intended to become law, President Barack Obama will not sign it, but the measure will provide the appropriations committees in the House and Senate guidelines for spending over the next two years.

The agreement, which is by no means historic, comes five years after Congress agreed to its last bicameral budget resolution and several failed attempts at a grand bargain. The resolution, which was negotiated between House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Republican, and Democratic Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, takes only minuscule steps toward reining in the federal debt and deficit. It includes no substantive reforms to the tax code or to the nation’s costly entitlement reforms, nor does it increase tax rates (although it does increase so-called fees on certain services).

Republican and Democratic leaders appeared satisfied with the proposal when it was released earlier this week, but they weren't triumphant about its achievements. Given the recent level of discord, lack of productivity and general toxicity in Washington, many appeared impressed with themselves by the mere fact that the parties could come to any sort of agreement at all.

""We're very unhappy about it, but not enough to say, therefore we're going to make matters worse by not having an agreement,"" Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.



Story continues

At issue for many Democrats is the lack of tax increases in the proposal and the absence of an extension for unemployment insurance. Republicans complained that the measure doesn’t go far enough to achieve debt reduction.

Earlier this week, a coalition of conservative groups moved to pressure Republican lawmakers to oppose the deal, an effort that received a sharp rebuke from Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who was furious that they spoke out against the proposal before it was finalized.

“It's not everything I wanted, but when groups come out and criticize an agreement that they've never seen, you begin to wonder just how credible those actions are,” Boehner told reporters on Thursday. “I came here to cut the size of government. That's exactly what this bill does. And why conservatives wouldn't vote for this is — or criticize the bill — is beyond any recognition I can come up with.”

In the end, conservative groups couldn’t muster enough opposition, and enough Democrats came on board to pass the bill.

The result will be a future untainted by the threat of government shutdowns for the next two years. But do not lose heart, political animals! Congress will no doubt find plenty of other petty issues to debate in the meantime."

Republican leaders in the House had hoped to pass a bill providing money for several major government agencies. Instead, they halted the vote after a GOP campaign to reduce spending levels hit an unexpected roadblock: Rank-and-file Republicans refused to approve cuts in programs that home-state governors and mayors rely on to fix roads, streets and bridges.

Conservatives were stunned that their more moderate colleagues could not stomach the reductions they all had agreed to a few months ago as part of an austere Republican budget plan.

But other Republicans saw the revolt as inevitable: The budget slashing that has dominated GOP spending talks over much of the last year may have run its course, they said, suggesting that the time may have come to compromise with the White House.

“It might be a wake-up call,” Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, a soft-spoken grandfather and former Sunday school teacher, said as he rode the Senate subway back to his office. “We may have reached our point.”

If so, the nation’s best hope for avoiding a budget crisis and a possible government shutdown this fall may rest in the office of the low-key former real estate broker.

Isakson has assembled a group of like-minded GOP senators who have been meeting quietly with President Obama’s staff. They’ve been seeking a resolution to the budget stalemate that has preoccupied Washington all year and that threatens to create a new crisis soon after Congress returns to work in September.

Their private talks gained sudden currency with the failure late Wednesday of the spending bill covering government transportation, housing and community development programs. The revolt in the House sent Republican lawmakers home on a sour note, frustrated that they had weakened their hand heading into negotiations with the administration.

White House officials saw the House move as an opening. Budget director Sylvia Mathews Burwell called it an “inflection” point in the long-running budget debate because it showed that the low levels of spending called for in the Republican budget plan are not “workable.”

Congress has failed to pass any of the annual appropriations bills needed to fund government agencies. Because of that, when lawmakers return in September, they will have just nine workdays to devise a stopgap plan or risk a government shutdown Oct. 1 when the current funding bills expire.

“I understand the frustration that they’re dealing with,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said as lawmakers prepared to leave town. But he said the House would not agree to a higher level of overall spending or an end to the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester.

“I just want make clear: The sequestration is going to remain in effect until the president agrees to cuts and reforms that will allow us to remove it,” he said.

Democrats and the White House want to undo the $100 billion a year in sequester cuts, replacing them with a combination of smaller reductions and some new revenue. Republicans want to continue the cuts, but they also want to shift the burden away from defense-related spending, requiring even deeper cuts in domestic programs. That was the plan they signed on to in theory under the budget written in the spring by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee.

The transportation and housing bill was the first look that many House members got at what those deeper domestic cuts would be like in practice. Many balked.

“Most of our members were looking at that, and they got jittery,” said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who said he would have voted for the reductions. “I think it makes it really difficult to move forward.”

In the Senate, the Democratic majority tried to pursue a compromise worked out with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would have spared transportation from some of the steepest cuts.

Advertisement

But even as the House GOP splintered, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, led a filibuster to make sure the Senate would hold the line against increased spending.

“This is so absurd,” an exasperated Collins said after the vote. “I truly don’t know the path forward.”

Isakson says he hopes that talks he has hosted may provide that path. So far, however, the meetings in the Georgia senator’s office have not resolved the stalemate that lawmakers and the administration have been stuck in for months: Republicans want to cut the nation’s Medicare and Social Security retirement programs to reduce spending, while the White House prefers changes in the tax code to bolster revenue.

The group is pursuing a “grand bargain” that could end the cycle of crises for the next decade, but it is well aware that a shorter-term solution for the next year or so may be all that is in reach.

“Here’s a news flash: Washington is not particularly functional,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) before the group met with Obama for an hour Thursday at the White House.

“I don’t think this is going to be solved by a 90-yard Hail Mary pass. I literally think this is going to be 3 1/2 yards and a cloud of dust.”

“We’re not going to pay a ransom for America paying its bills,” President Obama said Tuesday, sticking to his demand that Congress pass a spending bill and raise the federal debt ceiling without conditions. “I’m not budging.”

Instead, Obama doubled down on his favorite metaphor for Republicans’ demands: the GOP as a band of terrorists.

He described their strategy as “hostage-taking” and “extortion.” Breaching the debt ceiling, he warned, would be “insane, catastrophic, chaos,” the fiscal equivalent of using a nuclear weapon. And he dismissed Republican proposals for a new “supercommittee” as a nonstarter unless the GOP reopened the government first.

In other words, the standoff over federal spending and the debt ceiling doesn’t look headed for a quick resolution.

There were sound reasons for the president’s over-the-top rhetoric. Substantively, he’s right about the debt ceiling; once Congress has voted to spend federal money, it has an obligation to allow the Treasury to pay the bills.

But Obama is also trying to solve a problem that’s partly his own fault. In 2011, the president negotiated with Republicans over a similar rise in the debt ceiling and agreed to a bargain that gave the GOP some of the spending cuts it demanded in return.

That deal taught Republican leaders that the debt ceiling could be used as leverage to win concessions on other issues. To borrow the president’s metaphor: In that case, terrorism worked.

Republicans would put it differently: They bargained hard, and Obama blinked. As recently as last week, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was assuring colleagues that Obama would fold in this showdown, just as he did before. White House aides say one big reason for Obama’s adamancy this time is that he doesn’t want the precedent he set in 2011 — reluctantly, at the start of a presidential campaign — to become, well, an entitlement. And he needs to convince skeptical Republicans like Ryan that this time, he won’t negotiate.

There are tactical reasons as well that are pushing Obama to dig in his heels. For one thing, public opinion polls suggest he’s winning; more voters blame Republicans for the standoff than blame either congressional Democrats or the president. That may not last; if a debt ceiling crisis causes real economic harm, voters will blame everyone involved. But for the moment, it gives Obama added leverage, and he’s using it.

Pressure is rising from the business community too. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent millions last year to support mostly Republican candidates, issued a statement Tuesday asking Congress to act quickly on the debt ceiling “to avoid inflicting substantial and enduring damage on the U.S. economy.”

Equally important, Republicans in Congress are divided, while Obama and his Democrats are uncharacteristically united. House Republicans have rolled out a series of changing (and steadily diminishing) demands, from defunding Obamacare to delaying its implementation to launching the Keystone XL oil pipeline to, well, anybody’s guess.

On Tuesday, when House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) made a new proposal for negotiations, he didn’t even try to describe what the GOP was hoping to win. “There’s nothing on the table, there’s nothing off the table,” Boehner said. He just wanted “to have a conversation.”

Meanwhile, several House and Senate Republicans said they’re ready to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling with no conditions. The lesson for Obama is that the other side may be crumbling and the Democrats’ best course is to stand back and watch them crumble.

So how does the standoff end?

As Oct. 17 approaches — the date on which the Treasury says it will run low on cash — the pressure on both sides to stop playing chicken will increase. At that point, despite his uncompromising rhetoric, Obama may find it in his interest to negotiate with the same people he’s now calling hostage-takers — something almost every government does, even when it’s real terrorists they’re talking about.

Advertisement

The deal that’s negotiated is unlikely to satisfy the tea party. The president might, for instance, agree to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling in tandem with a commitment to negotiate later over long-term spending cuts.

And it also won’t solve the problem in the long run.

“We’ll kick the can down the road again,” a Republican strategist predicted — meaning a short-term spending bill and a short-term debt ceiling increase.

Both sides will claim victory; they always do. But the long-term problems of the federal budget won’t be solved, and the next round of the fiscal standoff will begin the next day.

At the heart of the campaign is the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG), a group chartered by NASA Headquarters to assist in planning the scientific exploration of the moon. LEAG is organizing a letter writing campaign to Congress to underscore the importance of the moon.

The LEAG scripted strategy is being orchestrated under the banner “Destination Moon” with a key, straightforward goal highlighted in a flyer: “Use the moon to create a sustained human space-faring capability, advancing exploration of the Solar System.” [See photos from China's first moon lander and rover]

The flyer is to be sent, along with a cover letter, to all members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate committees that have influence on NASA funding, and to all the lawmakers of the LEAG executive committee members.

Gateway to the solar system

“We were waiting to see if Chang’e 3 landed successfully and it did! Now we want to champion the moon from the U.S. side,” Clive Neal, a leading lunar scientist at the University of Notre Dame’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences told SPACE.com. He is a member of LEAG’s executive committee.

The Destination Moon movement is predicated on the value of exploring the moon, from opening the gateway to the solar system, pioneering development of new technologies, as well as advancing economic expansion, enabling new scientific discoveries and promoting international partnerships.

“The moon is the most accessible destination for realizing commercial, exploration, and scientific objectives beyond low Earth orbit,” the flyer reads.

Destination Moon supporters are rallying around other key points:

Lunar resources can be used for fuel and life support for operations in Earth-moon space as well as for voyages to Mars and beyond.

America can still lead the world beyond low Earth orbit by forging collaborations to make the frontier of space accessible to all.

Scientific investigations on the surface of the moon uniquely support studies of early Solar System events that have been erased from Earth’s record.

Nearest near-Earth object

Story continues

Stephen Mackwell, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, advocates a return to the moon.

“The brief Apollo missions were terminated before we could start investigating the requirements for longer term missions away from Earth,” Mackwell told SPACE.com.

“Before we set off to distant destinations, like Mars, it makes sense to use our nearest near-Earth object — the moon — as a test-bed to see how humans will cope with longer duration periods distant from Earth, including on the surface of another planetary body, and how effectively we can make use of in-situ resources to sustain our presence elsewhere,” Mackwell said. [NASA's 17 Apollo Moon Missions in Pictures]

Political boost

Independent of the LEAG letter writing campaign, a U.S. return to the moon is getting a political boost from Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA).

In a Dec. 19 letter to President Barack Obama, the lawmaker calls on the president to hold a White House conference early in 2014 to develop a mission concept for a U.S.-led return to the moon within the next 10 years. The conference would bring together “the best minds from around the country and among our international partners” to forge the initiative, Wolf said.

“As China prepares to send a series of increasingly advanced rovers to the moon in preparation for what most observers believe will ultimately be human missions, many are asking why the U.S. is not using this opportunity to lead our international partners in an American-led return to the moon,” Wolf said.

Wolf’s letter said that the Obama administration’s “recalcitrance in leading a lunar mission is creating a crisis of confidence in the U.S. space program, both at home but also among our partners, including Europe, Canada, Japan and Russia.”

In his three-page letter, Wolf urges Obama to direct the U.S. space program toward a “lunar-focused human exploration program that will reaffirm America's space leadership for the 21st Century.”

Lunar development

How United States politics and China’s moon landing of Chang’e 3 play together is far from clear, said Mike Gold, director of Wash., D.C. Operations and Business Growth for Bigelow Aerospace, a private space firm eager to kick up its own commercial lunar dust.

“The success of this mission was yet another victory for long-term Chinese aerospace planning, progress, and execution,” Gold said. “Chinese leadership clearly understands the importance and potential benefits of lunar activities and we here at home ignore the moon at our own peril.”

Gold told SPACE.com that it’s not a matter of ifthe moon will be utilized for commercial activities, it’s a matter of when and who will enjoy those benefits.

“The moon represents an unparalleled commercial opportunity, and Congress should be looking for ways to expand commercial space operations beyond low-Earth orbit,"" Gold said. ""I hope Chang’e 3 inspires a renewed effort for commercial lunar development but I’m afraid the lack of reaction in Washington speaks volumes.""

It appears that he will urge the government to spend more, while using euphemisms such as “investments” to obfuscate the issue. The speech will likely focus on “investments” in infrastructure and education.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling warned that closing the deficit “doesn’t mean you pull back on everything … I don’t think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way. What you need to do is be smart.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney opined, “The core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same, and it will remain the same — the need to make the economy work for the middle class.” He added that the State of the Union address will speak of “proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and to help the economy grow.”

Obama, as usual, is proceeding with his plans despite polls showing they are unpopular.

Last week a poll by Fox News revealed 73 percent of voters believed cutting spending was the best approach to fixing the U.S. economy, while only 15 percent who favored increased spending. Two out of three people surveyed were against another “economic stimulus.”

A new Pew poll indicated that the budget deficit was now the third most important issue concerning Americans, surpassing terrorism and just behind the economy and jobs. According to the Commerce Department, the last quarter of 2012 featured the economy shrinking by .1 percent.

The difference between Obama and the GOP, which favors cutting spending without raising spending, can be summed up in two quotes: former Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter saying that cuts in spending alone would “strangle our economy,” and Noelle Clemente, with the American Action Forum, asserting that the claims by the White house of cuts they have made are “full of budget gimmicks …We’ve seen that stimulus spending doesn’t work. That’s not the solution. … We know that this is a long-term spending problem and it’s driven by long-term spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”"

Norton confirmed in an interview that she pressed Obama to support the bill and that she doesn't care whether some colleagues felt uncomfortable about the exchange.

""I wasn’t picking a fight with the president, I think the people of the District would expect me to have a conversation with him rather than just asking a question,"" Norton said.

While most lawmakers might not interrupt Obama as he answered their question, Norton said she was compelled to interject when Obama suggested in his response to her that the budget crunch facing the District is similar to how other congressional districts are adjusting during the shutdown.

""That demanded that I give a response,"" she said. ""Obviously we’re the only District in the United States. We’re uniquely in this position.""

Norton insisted she meant no disrespect towards the president. ""He’s a big boy and I’m a big girl,"" she said.

When the meeting ended, Norton said ""I went up to him and we had a wonderful conversation, it was very collegial,. And I told him that I’m just trying to make sure that the District isn’t brought to its knees.""

Addressing a crowd at a gala event for the D.C. Vote nonprofit Wednesday night, Norton said: ""I had to take issue with the president today,""

She said she had to remind Obama that the District is seeking to spend local funds during the shutdown, not federal funds.

Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), accepting an award at the event, described the scene at the White House: ""I thought you were going to hit him or something,"" he cracked after Norton introduced him.

The exchange with Obama came just hours after Norton and Washington Mayor Vincent C. Gray confronted Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and pressed him to support the House bill.

“I’m on your side, don’t screw it up, okay? Don’t screw it up,” Reid told Gray.

Hiring continued at a solid pace in November, and the unemployment rate fell to a five-year low ... for the right reasons.

The U.S. economy added 203,000 jobs in November. Economists surveyed by CNNMoney had predicted payroll gains of 183,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate fell to 7.0% -- the lowest level since November 2008, as more people said they got jobs and joined the labor force.

This is encouraging news for the 11 million Americans who remain unemployed. The job market has been improving for three years now, but at a frustratingly slow pace.

The hiring was broad based, with big gains for sectors that tend to pay low wages as well as those that offer higher salaries. While retailers, restaurants and bars all hired more workers, traditionally higher wage sectors boasted even stronger job growth.

For example, professional and business services added 35,000 jobs.

""This was a strong, good quality report, showing continuing momentum,"" said Deloitte's Chief Financial Officer Frank Friedman. Deloitte alone is planning to hire about 18,000 people this year in its tax auditing and consulting businesses.

""We're optimistic about 2014, and we continue to hire at a pretty robust pace.""

The transportation and warehousing sector added 30,500 jobs, and health care added 28,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, manufacturers hired 27,000 workers and construction companies hired 17,000.

""This year started off lopsided -- low quality jobs were growing, but only in the last few months, the high quality jobs are coming back too,"" said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.

The federal government continued to cut jobs, but state and local governments more than made up for those losses, hiring 14,000 workers.

2013 is on track to be the best year for job creation since 2005, but the job market still has a long way to go until it's entirely healed from the recession.

Only about 63% of Americans over the age of 16 participate in the job market -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one. That's nearly the lowest level since 1978, driven partly by Baby Boomers retiring, but also by workers who had simply given up hope after long and fruitless job searches.

When Wal-Mart (WMT)recently opened two stores in Washington, D.C., more than 23,000 people submitted applications for the 600 job openings.

That means each applicant stood a mere 2.6% chance of being hired. Harvard has a higher acceptance rate.

""It's not uncommon for us to get this number of applications in urban areas when there is such a need for jobs,"" Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said.

But perhaps 2014 will be the year the job market finally breaks out of its funk. The consistently stronger hiring growth could help convince some of the job market dropouts to look for work once again, economists say.

""The economy is poised for takeoff but suffers from headwinds,"" Dhawan said. ""If we can survive January and there's no shutdown, we can take off.""

The United States lost 8.7 million jobs in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As of November, it had gained about 7.4 million of those jobs back."

Employers also added 60,000 more jobs in the previous two months than earlier estimated.

The figures show hiring has picked up in the fall. Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from 146,000 from May through July.

Stock futures fell after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. That suggests investors are worried that the better job numbers will prompt the Federal Reserve to pull back on its stimulus efforts sooner than expected.

One troubling detail in the report: the percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a fresh 35-year low. But that figure was likely distorted by the shutdown, too.

About 800,000 government workers were furloughed for all or part of the shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16. Many were counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff for purposes of the unemployment rate.

But the furloughed workers were still counted as employed by the government's survey that counts jobs because they were ultimately paid for their time off. Federal government jobs fell only 12,000 last month.

Some reports have hinted that hiring was improving. Retail stores, shipping companies, and other services firms stepped up hiring in October, according to private survey of service firms.

And the number of people seeking unemployment benefits has fallen back to pre-recession levels after four weeks of declines. Unemployment benefit applications are a proxy for layoffs. The steady decline suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs.

Economic growth accelerated in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, the government said Thursday. That's up from 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.

But greater restocking by businesses drove much of the increase, a trend that may not be sustainable. Consumers and businesses both cut back on spending over the summer.

Rick Snyder deals democracy another blow,"Enemy of democracy Rick Snyder

In a stunning reminder of how anti-democratic Michigan government is, Gov. Rick Snyder said Friday he would appoint an emergency financial manager for Detroit

This is an affront to democracy on at least two levels. First, we're talking about replacing the elected government of the 18th-largest city in the United States with an unelected bureaucrat expressly to undo actions undertaken by the elected government. Detroit's population is larger than those of Vermont, North Dakota or Wyoming. But Michigan Republicans are fine with—eager to—take democratic local control away from that many people.

Second, the law Snyder is using to appoint an emergency financial manager is a replacement for the emergency financial manager law that Michigan voters repealed in November. Just over a month after that repeal vote, Republican legislators passed and Snyder signed an overwhelmingly similar version of the law during their notorious lame duck session.

It's fitting, I guess, that if you're going to deprive around 700,000 people of their elected local government, you do so with a law nearly identical to one that had previously been repealed by voters. If you're going to act against democracy, you might as well double down. But the whole thing is appalling."

We%27re elected to Congress to make tough decisions.

But instead of coming to the table to negotiate with us%2C Democrats have met our repeated requests to negotiate with inaction and opposition.

This debate is about fairness.

We have arrived at a government shutdown because the Senate has refused to make the tough decisions.

Despite our repeated attempts to negotiate, Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Democratic-controlled Senate are slamming the door on re-opening the government by refusing to talk. In fact, the only communication they've had with us in the past several weeks has been to say they won't negotiate.

They've refused to sit down and engage in a dialogue. They've refused to consider any reforms or changes to the status quo. And they've refused to stop members of Congress from receiving special treatment under Obamacare.

No matter where I go when I'm home in eastern Washington — the grocery store, the local coffee shop, the county fair — the concern is the same: Obamacare is making life harder for everyday Americans. At the doctor's office, the dinner table and in the job market. This is what this debate is really about: real people and real concerns.

But the Senate has chosen to ignore them. They've chosen to take the easy way out — yet again — and ignore the majority of Americans who want Obamacare tied to the debate over government funding. We're elected to Congress to make tough decisions. But instead of coming to the table to negotiate with us, Democrats have met our numerous requests to negotiate with inaction and opposition.

Sen. Reid said he would not negotiate ""with a gun to our head."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called us ""legislative arsonists."" And President Obama accused us of ""holding the U.S. hostage."" This isn't how leaders solve problems. This rhetoric is incendiary and unconstructive. While the Democrats continue to lambast House Republicans with these baseless accusations, we will continue to advance real solutions for the people who elected us.

That's why the House acted early — and first — to keep the government open. Just because the president and Senate disagree with our solution doesn't mean they should refuse to come the table to work out our differences. Now we ask the Senate to fulfill its most basic responsibility and work with us to find a solution.

We voted on Monday night to have the House and Senate negotiate — and to delay the individual mandate and repeal the Obamacare subsidy for members of Congress — because if the American people have to bear the burden of Obamacare, so too should their representatives in Congress. We cannot solve the problems before us if the Senate refuses to talk.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., serves as chair of the House Republican Conference.

As elsewhere across America, that figure doesn't fully measure the misery of the state's economic situation.

But as of this weekend, the situation is going to get a lot worse for about 70,000 out-of-work residents. Having bought into the cries for austerity, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the legislature made it a priority to slash unemployment compensation in February. As a result, North Carolina will be the first to lose a lifeline for the long-term unemployed—the Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program.

That 100 percent federally funded program was enacted because of the Great Recession. It extended the period of time jobless Americans could collect compensation checks to as much as 99 weeks in the worst-hit states. Nationwide, 1.7 million Americans still receive compensation under the EUC. Unless Congress acts, which seems highly unlikely, the entire program expires Dec. 31 this year. But North Carolina is bailing six months early.

The reason North Carolinians will no longer be covered under the federal program is because the legislature cut maximum compensation of the state unemployment program to $350 a week. Under the provisions of the EUC, no such cuts are allowed without a federal waiver, which North Carolina did not obtain.

The stated rationale behind the cuts? North Carolina owes the federal government $2.1 billion it borrowed to cover payments when it ran out of money in the state compensation fund because of the severity of the recession. The goal is to pay off that debt by 2015. Nineteen other states also borrowed money from the feds to cover holes in their compensation funds.

Altogether, between now and 2017, the North Carolina legislature's fiscal research office says, the state will save $3.6 billion from compensation cuts and an additional charge to businesses of $42 a year for each employee. Of the total, 74 percent of the savings will come from cuts in worker compensation.

Not only did the legislature whack how much an eligible jobless person can collect each week—the average is $292.60—it also cut how long a person can collect payments to 20 weeks from the 26 weeks every state has provided compensation for the past half-century. If the unemployment rate falls far enough in North Carolina, the maximum compensation period will be reduced to just 12 weeks, the lowest in the nation.

The package of cuts was originally the work of the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the state's main business lobby.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/10/congressional-negotiators-reach-tentative-2-year-budget-deal/,2013-12-10 00:00:00,[],"Lawmakers unveil tentative budget deal, call for rolling back sequester","Congressional negotiators on Tuesday announced a tentative budget deal that would avoid a partial government shutdown, but also begin to unravel hard-fought spending cuts.

The lead negotiators -- Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- detailed the specifics of the proposal at an evening press conference.

“I’m proud of this agreement,” Ryan said. “It reduces the deficit—without raising taxes. And it cuts spending in a smarter way. It’s a firm step in the right direction, and I ask all my colleagues in the House to support it.”

But the measure could face a tough climb, particularly in the House which is expected to take up the bill first. Ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, fiscal conservatives raised alarm that lawmakers were proposing to roll back sequester cuts.

The proposal would restore about $63 billion in funding that had been cut by the so-called sequester. Officials said the increases would be offset by a variety of spending reductions and increased fees elsewhere in the budget totaling about $85 billion over a decade, leaving enough for a largely symbolic deficit cut of $23 billion over the next decade.

However, fiscal conservatives warned that lawmakers were simply trading increased spending now for “promises” of cuts sometime in the future.

While Ryan predicted that conservatives would support the bill and GOP leaders praised the negotiators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came out against it.

“In the short run, this budget also cancels earlier spending reductions, instead of making some tough decisions about how to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges caused by runaway Washington spending,” he said.

President Obama praised the deal for replacing parts of the sequester cuts, which he said ""have harmed students, seniors, and middle-class families and served as a mindless drag on our economy over the last year.""

Calling the deal ""balanced,"" Obama said he also is pleased Congress was able to break the cycle of crisis-driven decision-making to reach a compromise.

""And because it's the first budget that leaders of both parties have agreed to in a few years, the American people should not have to endure the pain of another government shutdown for the next two years,"" he said.

The deal sets discretionary spending levels at just over $1 trillion, which is higher than the hard-fought level of $967 billion set in a 2011 budget pact.

One senior House Republican source predicted to Fox News that the party would have the votes to pass the deal, though they speculated the GOP may lose a “healthy chunk” on their side.

Both Murray and Ryan expressed confidence the deal would pass as well, and called upon their colleagues to do so.

“I'm confident we won't have 100 percent of the Senate or the House,” Murray said. “But I want people to know this Congress can work.”

The hesitation, and opposition, on both sides, though, indicates that congressional leaders still have a lot of convincing to do. Congress has until Jan. 15 to pass a new budget or they will trigger another partial government shutdown.

House Speaker John Boehner claimed Tuesday he was ""optimistic"" about the chances a deal would materialize, but the speaker may be reluctant to once again try to pass a bill that a majority of Republican members do not support. He resorted to passing a budget bill with a majority of Democrats in October, in order to end the partial shutdown.

The automatic cuts are the consequence of Washington's failure to follow up a 2011 budget pact with further deficit cuts. They would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies when compared with sending limits set by the hard-fought 2011 budget agreement.

The final vote, which was held after the Senate worked well past midnight churning through dozens of amendments, exposed cracks in Democratic unity as lawmakers facing re-election peeled off, citing the proposal's failure to tackle the deficit. In the end, the budget plan squeaked by on a razor-thin 50-49 vote.

Four Democrats opposed it, and one did not vote.

The defections, while amounting to only a handful, nevertheless could spell trouble for Democratic leaders as they head into the next phase of negotiations with House Republicans. Leaders could be pressured by their more moderate members to make a bigger push to balance the budget, even if they don't want to make the kinds of major changes to entitlements that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., prescribes.

Sen. Mark Begich, a moderate Democrat from Alaska, proudly announced Saturday that he opposed the Senate's plan because of its copious red ink.

""While I am happy that Congress is finally talking seriously about our fiscal crisis, this budget didn't go far enough,"" Begich said. ""Alaskans expect us to finish the job and make this staggering deficit manageable. Passing this problem off to our children is not an option.""

Though Democrats say Ryan is relying on unrealistic projections and changes, the House Republican budget aims to eliminate deficits over the next 10 years -- on paper, anyway. The Senate Democrats' budget doesn't come close, despite raising taxes by $1 trillion. Under their plan, the deficit over the next decade never dips below $400 billion and would hover at or near $600 billion by 2023.

This, as Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions repeatedly notes, would add $7.3 trillion to the national debt over that period.

""The content of the plan the majority has now approved demonstrates why they were unwilling to reveal it for so long: their proposal, once accurately understood, cannot be publicly defended,"" Sessions said in a statement.

House Republicans were not without defections of their own. Ten Republicans opposed Ryan's 2014 plan earlier this week. But the Republicans' budget resolution still passed by a more comfortable margin in the House than the Democrats' did in the Senate.

The four Senate Democrats who voted against the Democrats' bill were Kay Hagan, D-N.C.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; and Begich. But there are more up for re-election in 2014 in moderate-to-conservative states where votes for a deficit-heavy budget plan would cause campaign problems.

President Obama plans to release his own 2014 budget next month, an unveiling that will be studied for whether it signals a willingness to engage Republicans in negotiations or play political hardball.

The Democratic budget's $975 billion in new taxes would be matched by an equal amount of spending reductions coming chiefly from health programs, defense and reduced interest payments as deficits get smaller than previously anticipated. This year's projected deficit of nearly $900 billion would fall to around $700 billion next year and bottom out near $400 billion in 2016 before trending upward again. Shoehorned into the package is $100 billion for public works projects and other programs aimed at creating jobs.

Neither the Democratic nor Republican plan will clear Congress in its current form -- plus each is just a blueprint which by itself does not appropriate money.

Democrats and Republicans will now launch into hard bargaining, and each make sacrifices if they are to settle on a bona fide budget, as opposed to passing stopgap spending bills to fund the government year after year.

The White House on Saturday again reiterated its displeasure with the House Republican plan, which does not call for tax hikes on anybody.

""The House Republican budget refuses to ask for a single dime of deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected but instead makes deep cuts to education and manufacturing while asking seniors and the middle class to pay more,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

He said the Senate plan would ""create jobs and cut the deficit in a balanced way."" Carney said it is time for Congress ""to come together to find common ground.""

Begich laid out a series of novel proposals for cutting spending further, including: preventing people making more than $1 million from receiving jobless benefits; allowing senators to give back part of their salary; and cracking down on wasteful spending in the farm subsidy program.

It would take more than that to bring the budget into balance.

The blueprint from Ryan claims $4 trillion more in savings over the period than Senate Democrats by digging deeply into health care and food benefits and other safety net programs. It would also transform the health care program for older Americans into a voucher-like system for future recipients. Many Democrats, who say the sequester has cut too deep as it is, are resisting further cuts to domestic spending as well as the specific changes Ryan wants to make to health care entitlements.

""We have presented very different visions for how our country should work and who it should work for,"" said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. ""But I am hopeful that we can bridge this divide.""

A long-awaited analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that the benefits of an increase in legal residents from immigration legislation currently being debated in the Senate — which includes a pathway to citizenship — would outweigh the costs. While the report was a clear victory for immigration proponents, it came just hours after Speaker John A. Boehner raised potential new obstacles for the bill, saying he would not bring any immigration measure to the floor unless it had the support of a majority of House Republicans.

The report estimates that in the first decade after the immigration bill is carried out, the net effect of adding millions of additional taxpayers would decrease the federal budget deficit by $197 billion. Over the next decade, the report found, the deficit reduction would be even greater — an estimated $700 billion, from 2024 to 2033. The deficit reduction figures for the first decade do not take into account $22 billion in the discretionary spending required to implement the bill, however, making the savings slightly lower.

The report was immediately seized on by backers of the bill as a significant boost to its prospects. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, one of the bill’s authors, said the report “debunks the idea that immigration reform is anything other than a boon to our economy.”"

The showdown puts more than 700,000 active and retired public workers — school teachers outside Chicago, university employees, lawmakers, and rank-and-file state workers — in the middle over how to fix the nation's worst-funded state retirement system.



Cullerton's Senate Democratic majority sent his legislation to the House on a 40-16 vote as he called on colleagues to join him in support of a pension plan that has ""strong constitutional principles.""



The Senate leader contended Madigan's version of pension reform is ""risky"" because it will be found unconstitutional and will cost the state more time in trying to enact reform.



At the center of Cullerton's legislation is his belief that the people in the systems must be allowed to have a choice of new pension options in order to get around the Illinois Constitution's contractual obligation long believe to ban any diminishment or impairment to pensions.



But the series of options under the Cullerton plan would save about a third of the $150 billion that the Madgian proposal would save — a point that has prompted most of the Senate Republicans to side with the speaker rather than Cullerton.



""This is not the bill that would do the most for the people of this state,"" said Senate Republican Christine Radogno of Lemont.



The Madigan proposal centers on raising the retirement age, scaling back cost-of-living increases and calling for current workers to kick in another 2 percent of their paychecks that would be phased in over this summer and next.



The speaker again today predicted his legislation is the version that will pass. He has said his proposal would be signed by Gov. Pat Quinn and pass constitutional muster with the Illinois Supreme Court.



The Cullerton legislation incorporates his long-held belief that employees must be offered a choice when it comes to cutting benefits, an exchange necessary for a pension plan to fall within the legal and contractual contours of the state constitution."
http://news.yahoo.com/judges-sue-social-security-over-case-quotas-075047792.html,,[],Judges sue Social Security over case 'quotas',"Graphic shows annual disability applications

WASHINGTON (AP) — Judges struggling to handle a surge of disability cases sometimes award benefits they might otherwise deny in order to clear cases faster so they can meet quotas imposed by the Social Security Administration, according to a lawsuit filed by the union representing the agency's administrative law judges.

The Social Security Administration says judges should decide 500 to 700 disability cases a year. The agency calls the standard a productivity goal, but the lawsuit claims it is an illegal quota that requires judges to decide an average of more than two cases a workday.

The lawsuit says the requirement violates judges' independence, denies due process rights to applicants and further strains the finances of a disability program that is projected to run out of money in 2016.

Once the trust fund that supports the disability program runs dry, the system will only collect enough money in payroll taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Congress could redirect money from the retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, too.

""Case quotas prevent judges from devoting necessary time to the most complex cases, resulting in waste and abuse,"" said a statement by Randall Frye, president of the Association of Administrative Law Judges and a judge in Charlotte, N.C.

""Many administrative law judges find themselves pressured to grant more claims than they otherwise would because a decision awarding benefits is less complex and time-consuming than a decision which denies benefits,"" the statement said.

The lawsuit was filed by the union Thursday in federal court in Chicago. It names the agency and Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin as defendants. Colvin took over in February after Commissioner Michael Astrue's six-year term expired.

The union scheduled a news conference in Washington on Friday to announce the lawsuit.

An agency spokesman declined to comment. In an interview, Astrue disputed the union's claims.

Story continues

""What's really happening here is that the judges' union doesn't want accountability of its members and it's been trying to sell this story to the media and to the Congress and to the agency for a very long time,"" Astrue said. ""And no one's buying it because it's not true, and no federal judge is going to buy this story, either.""

""There are a very small number of malcontents who want to litigate or put political pressure on the agency rather than do their work,"" Astrue said.

The union represents 1,400 administrative law judges. Its lawsuit describes a disability system in crisis.

About 3.2 million people applied for disability benefits last year, a 25 percent increase from a decade before. Claims have increased in part because of aging baby boomers. As people get older, they become more prone to disabilities.

Disability claims also typically increase when the economy sours. Some people who manage to work despite their disabilities get laid off and apply for benefits, while others apply out of economic desperation.

When people apply for Social Security disability benefits, their cases are initially reviewed by state offices, which reject about two-thirds of claims. If your claim is rejected, you can appeal to an administrative law judge. But the hearing process takes an average of 373 days — a little more than a year — according to agency statistics.

Astrue said the average processing time for a hearing peaked at 542 days shortly after he took over the agency. He said public outcry over the backlog led him to adopt productivity standards in 2007, which helped reduce the wait time.

The hearing process, which is closed to the public, is different from a civil lawsuit or a criminal trial. There is no lawyer for the government. Instead, judges are expected to be impartial decision-makers while protecting the interest of taxpayers and ensuring that applicants get fair hearings. Most applicants have legal representation by the time their claim results in a hearing, the lawsuit says.

The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees Social Security, has been looking into ways to improve the disability system.

""Under the law, ALJs have judicial independence, which seems to mean they can operate with little or no accountability,"" said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. ""Those who appeal their denied claim for disability benefits should not have to wait months, much less years, for a decision because some ALJs don't want to handle their fair share of cases. Nor is it right that some ALJs simply rubber-stamp most of their cases.""

The lawsuit says judges are expected to meet their quotas, regardless of how complicated their cases are, even though many case files exceed 500 pages. Judges have been disciplined for missing the quota, including receiving formal reprimands and facing removal proceedings, according to the lawsuit.

""The pressure exerted on ALJs by the quota is reflected in the substance of their rulings,"" the lawsuit says. ""Some ALJs respond by tending to grant more claims. For other ALJs, the quota impedes their ability to render carefully reasoned, impartial decisions based on a fully developed factual record.""

Frye's statement said: ""The cost of such decision-making adds up. When a judge finds in favor of a claimant, the average lifetime disability payment exceeds $300,000 per individual.""

Astrue countered that approval rates actually dropped since he adopted the performance standards. In 2011, the approval rate was about 35 percent, down from 46 percent a decade before.

Nearly 11 million disabled workers, spouses and children get Social Security disability benefits. That's up from 7.6 million a decade ago. The average monthly benefit for a disabled worker is $1,130.

In 2011, Social Security disability paid about $129 billion in benefits.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/30/technology/california-split-draper/index.html,2013-12-30 00:00:00,['Charles Riley'],Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper: Split California into 6 states,"Is the most populous American state too big for its own good?

Tim Draper, a third-generation venture capitalist with a penchant for big ideas, is promoting a plan that would split California into six separate states.

The proposal calls for the creation of new states called Silicon Valley and West California that would be anchored by the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Orange County and San Diego would be part of the new state of South California. To the north, remaining counties would be divided into regions called Central California, North California and Jefferson.

Why now? According to the proposed ballot initiative Draper filed earlier this month, the Golden State has been rendered ""nearly ungovernable"" by social and economic changes.

California has 58 counties, nearly 40 million people and an economy so large that it would rank among the top 10 countries in the world.

But given the state's diverse geography and industries, Draper's ballot initiative argues that the ""citizens of the whole state would be better served by six smaller state governments.""

""I am endorsing this initiative because it is a way to localize governance and bring more representation to the local level,"" Draper said in document distributed to reporters. ""I am planning to work to get it on the ballot.""

The plan would also create a ""marketplace"" for governments, and voters in each county could pick and choose which state they wanted to be part of.

Draper will need to collect thousands of signatures for the measure to be brought before voters in November. With seemingly little current popular demand for partition, gathering enough support to make the ballot could prove difficult.

The initiative would raise some thorny issues, including the division of water rights -- a life and death economic matter in the deserts of Southern California. There would also be significant Constitutional questions to resolve.

The third-largest state in terms of area behind Alaska and Texas, California has long managed to resist division.

Like Draper, advocates for partition in counties near the Oregon border have in the past evoked the ""Jefferson"" name while pursuing statehood -- a reference to the president who dispatched Lewis & Clark to the Northwest.

Draper founded the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in 1985, and is now running Draper University, an entrepreneurship program. The California native is well known in Silicon Valley for his investments and appearances on a Nickelodeon TV show called ""The Naked Brothers Band."""

He Left The Times In']","Economy adds 165,000 jobs in April; unemployment rate down to 7.5%","WASHINGTON -- The labor market rebounded last month as the U.S. economy added 165,000 net new jobs and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.5%, its lowest level in more than five years, the Labor Department said Friday.

The April jobs figure exceeded analyst expectations of about 148,000 net new jobs and helped counter concerns that hiring was significantly slowing after a disappointing report in March.

The government also issued major upward revisions for job creation in March and February.

The initially disappointing 88,000 figure for March was revised to a more respectable 138,000. The February figure was revised up to 332,000 from the initial report of 268,000. That was the most new jobs added in a month since May 2010.

The private sector added 176,000 net new jobs in April, led by a gain of 73,000 in professrional and business service industry positions, the Labor Department report said. However, government shed 11,000 jobs, with the federal workforce down 8,000 positions.

The unemployment rate ticked down last month from 7.6% in March. The 7.5% rate for April was the lowest since December 2008.

“With an increase of 165,000 jobs in April, and following the significant upward revisions for February and March, the job market looks better than expected despite the sequester or issues like the rising cost of providing healthcare benefits,” said Kathy Bostjancic, director of macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.

The economic recovery has been showing signs of slowing as tax increases, the federal spending cuts known as the sequester and the European recession combine as obstacles to growth.

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.5% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a marked improvement over the 0.4% growth in the last quarter of 2012. But the figure was below expectations, and analysts forecast that growth will slow to about 1% in the second quarter of this year before picking up again.

Economic reports in recent days have been weak, although initial jobless claims dropped last week to their lowest level in more than five years.

Amid concerns about the pace of the recovery, Federal Reserve policymakers said for the first time this week that they were prepared to increase their controversial stimulus efforts.

Obama warned Washington could hurt economy

The president was interviewed on CBS before the Super Bowl

He urged the Boy Scouts to drop its ban on gays

President Obama said Sunday the economy is poised for growth, but not if Washington ""dysfunction"" gets in the way.

""Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis,"" Obama told CBS News in his annual Super Bowl Sunday interview. He urged Congress to avoid an upcoming series of automatic spending cuts.

Obama, who has granted a pre-game Super Bowl interview every year of his presidency, also urged the Boy Scouts of America to drop its ban on gays, expressed concern about the safety of football, and said he would not hesitate to order women into combat.

In a discussion of the economy, Obama said that he is not interested in further raising income tax rates to reduce the federal debt, but that more tax revenue from the wealthy is needed in the form of closing loopholes and deductions; the president also said that he wants to reduce red ink through ""smart"" cuts in the budget and more efficient administration of existing programs.

The president spoke just days after news that the economy shrunk slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012, a development Obama attributed to a sharp drop in defense spending brought on by uncertainty over the ""fiscal cliff"" and other political disputes.

The White House and Congress forestalled the fiscal cliff -- a series of automatic tax hikes and budget cuts -- with a New Year's Day agreement that raised income tax rates on households that make more than $450,000 per year. The deal also deferred automatic spending cuts for two months, to the start of March.

In his CBS interview in the Blue Room at the White House, Obama urged Congress to avoid those automatic spending cuts -- the sequester -- by coming up with a new debt-reduction plan.

As for his own plan, Obama said the issue now is not tax rates, but eliminating loopholes and deductions that favor only special interests. ""There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions, in order to bring down our deficit,"" Obama said.

If the economy is to pick up, Obama said, ""we can't have Washington dysfunction get in the way.""

On other issues, Obama said:

-- He hopes the Boy Scouts of America follow through on a proposal to lift a ban on gays. The president says gays and lesbians ""should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does.""

-- He has no qualms about ordering women into combat, pursuant to a recent Pentagon directive, because they are already in combat ""as a practical matter."" Women ""have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction,"" Obama said.

- He loves football, but organizers at all levels need to do what is necessary to make the game safer. While professional football players are adults who have union protection, Obama said he is more concerned with safety in youth, high school and college football leagues. ""I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to make the sport safe,"" Obama said.

If he had a son, Obama said he'd ""have to think"" about whether to allow him to play football.

The president was not asked -- and did not offer -- a prediction on the Sunday evening game between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers. ""I've got some wings waiting for me upstairs,"" he said."

The Postal Service also said the rise in online retail purchases and other e-commerce was contributing to its increase in that area and was why it would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays.

Since 1981, a Congressional mandate has required the Postal Service to deliver mail six days a week. But on Wednesday the agency argued that since the current stopgap budget measure for the entire government, known as a continuing resolution, did not contain language explicitly mandating six-day delivery, the agency could make the changes without Congressional approval.

But some members of Congress immediately questioned the Postal Service’s claim.

“The passage of the continuing resolution did not suspend that language, as they claim, but in fact extended it,” said Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general government, which has jurisdiction over the post office. “Rather than use very dubious legal arguments to end Saturday delivery, the U.S.P.S. should work hand in hand with Congress to come up with a successful restructuring and reform package that allows them to become more efficient while maintaining vital services like Saturday delivery.”

Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, who led a bipartisan effort to pass a postal overhaul bill last year, called the post office decision disappointing. But he added, “Despite my disappointment, it’s hard to condemn the postmaster general for moving aggressively to do what he believes he can and must do to keep the lights on at the Postal Service, which may be only months away from insolvency.”

Last April, the Senate passed a bill that provided early retirement incentives to about 100,000 postal workers, or 18 percent of its employees, and allowed the Postal Service to recoup more than $11 billion it overpaid into an employee pension fund. The Senate bill did not stop Saturday deliveries immediately, but it would have allowed the agency to consider the issue in two years."

Millions of workers would see their hourly pay jump from $8 to $9 on July 1, 2014 and to $10 on Jan. 1, 2016, under legislation which received strong support this week from the state's Governor Jerry Brown and other legislative leaders.

""The minimum wage has not kept pace with rising costs,"" Brown said in a statement. ""This legislation is overdue and will help families that are struggling in this harsh economy.""

More than 90% of minimum-wage workers in the state are over the age of 20, while nearly 2.4 million of the state's children live in a household with a parent who earns minimum wage, according to the statement.

The proposed bump would boost a full-time worker's income by about $4,000 to around $20,000 a year, still several thousand dollars below the poverty level for a family of four.

California last raised its minimum wage in 2008. If the increase is approved, the state could surpass Washington State, which at $9.19 an hour has the highest minimum wage in the nation -- although Washington's minimum wage is also set to increase at the rate of inflation each year.

States must pay at least the same as the federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 an hour since 2009.

The proposal comes on the heels of a wave of protests across the country by Wal-Mart workers and fast food workers demanding higher wages. President Obama has also pushed for raising the federal minimum wage to $9, with automatic indexing to inflation.

Advocates say increasing wage rates stimulates the economy since low income workers are more likely to spend the extra cash. Meanwhile, business groups argue that wage increases can lead to job losses.

Jack Temple, policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the proposed California law should set a strong precedent for other states. Many of the jobs created during the recent economic recovery have been low-wage positions, he said.

""You're seeing more adults, more families relying on low wage work to make ends meet,"" he said. ""As that trend continues, the minimum wage is only going to become more important."""

Let us never forget that when Bill Clinton left office in January of 2001, the U.S. had a budget surplus of $236 billion with projected budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. During that time, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected a 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion, enough to erase the entire national debt by the end of 2011.

What happened? How did we, in a few short years, go from a large budget surplus into horrendous debt? The answer is not that complicated. Under President Bush we went to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- and didn't pay for them. We just put them on the credit card. The cost of those wars is estimated to be between $4 trillion to $6 trillion. Further, Bush and Congress passed an expensive prescription drug program that was unpaid for. They also reduced revenue by giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. On top of all that, the Wall Street collapse and ensuing recession significantly reduced tax receipts and increased spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps, further exacerbating the deficit situation.

Interestingly, the so-called congressional ""deficit hawks"" -- Congressman Paul Ryan, Senator Jeff Sessions and other conservative Republicans -- all voted for those measures that increased the deficit. These are the same folks who now want to dismantle virtually every social program designed to protect working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. In other words, it's okay to spend trillions on a war we should never have waged and large defense budgets, and provide huge tax breaks for billionaires and multi-national corporations. It's just not okay when, in very difficult economic times, we try to protect the most vulnerable people in our country.

Where do we go from here? How do we now draft a federal budget which creates jobs, makes our country more productive, protects working families and lowers the deficit?

For a start, we have to understand that, from both a moral and economic perspective, we cannot impose more austerity on the people of our country who are already suffering. The time is now for the wealthy and multi-national corporations who are doing phenomenally well to help us rebuild America and lower our deficit.

At a time when the richest 1 percent own 38 percent of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60 percent own a mere 2.3 percent -- we cannot balance the budget on the backs of people who have virtually nothing. When 95 percent of all new income during 2009 through 2012 went to the top 1 percent, while tens of millions of working Americans saw a decline in their income, we cannot cut programs that these workers depend upon.

Instead of talking about cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we must end the absurdity of one out of four corporations in America not paying a nickel in federal income taxes. At a time when multi-national corporations and the wealthy are avoiding more than $100 billion a year in taxes by stashing money in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, we need to make them pay taxes just like middle-class Americans. The truth of the matter is that according to the most recent information available profitable corporations are only paying 13 percent of their income in federal taxes which is near a 40-year low.

While in January 2013, we successfully ended Bush's tax breaks for the richest 1 percent, the truth is that they continue to exist for the top 2 percent, those households earning between $250,000 and $450,000 a year. That must end.

At a time when we now spend almost as much as the rest of the world combined on defense, we can afford to make judicious cuts in our military without compromising our military capabilities.

Frankly, it is time that Congress started listening to the ordinary people. Recently, the Republican Party learned a hard lesson when the American people stated loudly and clearly that it was wrong to shut down the government and not pay our bills because some extreme right-wing members of Congress do not like the Affordable Care Act. Well, there's another lesson that my Republican colleagues are going to have to absorb. Poll after poll make it very clear that the American people overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, according to a recent National Journal poll, 81 percent of the American people do not want to cut Medicare at all; 76 percent of the American people do not want to cut Social Security at all; and 60 percent of the American people do not want to cut Medicaid at all. Meanwhile, other polls have made it very clear that at a time of growing income and wealth inequality, Americans believe that the wealthiest among us and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes.

It is time to develop a federal budget which is moral and which makes good economic sense. It is time to develop a budget which invests in our future by creating jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure improvement and expanding educational opportunities. It is time for those who have so much to help us with deficit reduction. It is time that we listen to what the American people want, and not just respond to the billionaire class and major campaign contributors."

Details of the measure were unclear today and its prospects of passing remained uncertain. But both Democratic and Republican leaders said they agreed on a proposal, the first such sign of progress in more than two years of discussions spurred by a continued downgrading of the state’s credit rating.

The debate has centered on how to reduce costs while balancing the legal protections to public employee retiree benefits laid out in the state constitution. The public employee unions have repeatedly threatened to challenge in court any pension proposal that lacked their support, and they were quick to criticize today's announcement.

Negotiations among the four legislative leaders had centered on plans to slow compounded annual cost-of-living adjustments for public employees—the biggest driver of the state’s $100 billion unfunded pension liability.

“We got it done,” said Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno, who said “the goal” is to vote on the measure next week.

A top aide to Democratic Senate President John Cullerton concurred.

""There is a deal,"" said Rikeesha Phelon, spokeswoman for Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, in an email. ""We are asking our members to return on Tuesday. We are going to spend the next week reviewing the plan with our caucus.""

The senators will join House lawmakers, who were told yesterday to return Dec. 3 to Springfield for a one-day session. The Dec. 3 date is politically significant because it is the day after the filing deadline for the March 2014 primary election, and lawmakers will know what competition they have.

Radogno said the proposal would save about $160 billion and the goal is to fully fund the pension system over the next 30 years.

The proposal would raise retirement ages, create an optional 401(k)-styled plan and scale back the cost-of-living increases.

Increasing the retirement age, now set at various levels based on the type of work, would impact the youngest workers the most. Younger workers could see up to five years added to their retirement ages, Radogno said.

The cost-of-living adjustments would be altered “to be sure that the lower-paid, longest-serving employees have the biggest protection,” said Radogno. It would be largely patterned after a provision she pushed and was included in a bill that Speaker Michael Madigan passed in the House.

Currently, retirees get an automatic 3 percent compounded increase every year.

The plan that passed the House included a formula that gave weight to the number of years a person worked, a way to rein in the size of the annual pension increases of employees that worked only a few years but got huge salaries

Radogno said that proposal has been “tweaked” slightly but would not go into the details

Gov. Pat Quinn issued a statement saying the plan meets his “standard” to eliminate the unfunded pension debt and give the retirement systems financial stability.

“We have more work to do,” Quinn said. “I look forward to working with the leaders and members of the General Assembly over the coming days to get this job done for the people of Illinois.”

Officials for public employee and teachers’ unions, while unfamiliar with the details, said in a statement that they believed the proposal was “an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security” since it was based on previous proposals that they had fought.

“It’s no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits,” said the “We Are One” coalition, an umbrella organization for the state AFL-CIO, the Illinois Education Association, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union and the Illinois Nurses Association.

http://news.yahoo.com/landmark-moment-making-judge-rule-detroit-bankruptcy-231938038--sector.html,,[],Landmark moment in making: judge to rule on Detroit bankruptcy,"By Joseph Lichterman DETROIT (Reuters) - The largest-ever municipal bankruptcy petition in U.S. history faces a watershed moment on Tuesday, as the judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy case is scheduled to rule whether the city is eligible for protection from creditors - an event that has citizens, public officials, creditors, retirees and others awaiting the judge's words and preparing responses. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. EST on Tuesday to announce his decision, which will be followed by the release of a written opinion. Rhodes' ruling will begin a new chapter in the case that first arrived in federal court with Detroit's July 18 bankruptcy petition. [ID:nL1N0FU01E] If Rhodes rules Detroit is eligible for bankruptcy, which most experts expect, the city will begin working toward its next major move, the submission of a plan to readjust its more than $18 billion in debt. No matter how Rhodes rules, the case could drag on through a possibly lengthy appeals process that could delay the city's plan to submit its plan of readjustment by the end of the month. The city's largest union has asked Rhodes to allow any appeal to proceed directly to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, bypassing the U.S. District Court in Detroit. ""There are bankruptcy judges who are known to sometimes take the easier way out and to try and get the people to resolve it rather than make the hard decisions,"" said attorney Chuck Tatelbaum, who has been involved in the financial restructuring of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and who has previously practiced in front of Rhodes. ""He's not one of those. He'll do what's right, but he's not afraid to take the time to make that hard decision that's then going to be reviewed under a microscope by an appellate court,"" said Tatelbaum, who is not involved in the Detroit case. Detroit is burdened by $18.5 billion in debt as it struggles to provide even the most basic services to the city's 700,000 residents. About 40 percent of the city's streetlights do not work and about 78,000 abandoned buildings litter the city, whose population peaked at 1.8 million in 1950. In order to meet federal eligibility requirements, Detroit must prove that it is insolvent, it was authorized to file for bankruptcy and that it negotiated with creditors in good faith or that negotiations were impractical. AUCTIONING ARTWORKS? City unions, retirees and pension funds objected in court to Detroit's filing, contending during a nine-day trial in November that Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr did not negotiate in good faith and drove the city into bankruptcy court instead. Orr, a former bankruptcy lawyer, was appointed in March by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican. Opponents also argue that Michigan's constitution protects pensions from being slashed and that the city has other assets it can sell to pay down its debts, including the works of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Orr has brought in auction house Christie's to place a value on some pieces in the museum's collection. In June, Orr put forward an initial proposal on how Detroit should deal with its $18.5 billion in debt and liabilities that offered unsecured creditors only pennies on the dollar to settle their claims. Orr raised eyebrows by declaring that holders of most of Detroit's general obligation bonds would be treated as unsecured creditors who would be part of a group that would receive pro-rata shares of $2 billion in notes to settle their $11.5 billion in claims. Detroit says about half its liabilities stem from retiree benefits, with $5.7 billion in liabilities relating to retiree healthcare and another $3.5 billion from pensions. Likely cuts to retiree pensions and changes in healthcare benefits have been at the heart of the objections from the city's unions, pension funds and retirees. Orr drew pointed questions from Rhodes over possible cuts during his time on the witness stand in the eligibility trial last month. ""Everybody is hanging on the edge of the cliff waiting to see what the announcement is ... and to me it kind of seems like the train left the station,"" said Brendan Milewski, a 34-year-old retired Detroit firefighter who was paralyzed in 2010 while battling a fire. ""The state and the EM have had a lot of time to steer the course and plot the direction they're going in."" In some respects the Detroit Institute of Arts has become symbolic of the costs of allowing Detroit to fall into bankruptcy. Last week, a group of the largest creditors asked Rhodes to order an independent valuation of the museum's 66,000-piece collection. One of the city's most prized cultural assets, the museum includes paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Matisse, an original cast of Auguste Rodin's ""The Thinker,"" and a fresco mural by Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Christie's has not yet issued its valuation of the museum's collection. Bill Nowling, Orr's spokesman, said in an email last week that the city disagrees with the creditors' filing, but the move helps ""illustrate the lengths they are willing to go to ensure they receive payment.""

Under the Constitution%2C members of Congress can%27t have their own pay cut as part of the %27sequester%27

Congressional offices could see an across-the-board budget cut of about 9%25

Budget cuts could hit some congressional offices harder than others

WASHINGTON — As the rest of the federal government prepares for furloughs, layoffs and sweeping budget cuts caused by the ""sequester,"" the people who could prevent the cuts are the ones whose paychecks are protected: members of Congress.

The 27th Amendment to the constitution — intended to prevent members of Congress from voting themselves a pay raise — also prohibits them from taking a pay cut until after the next election.

Congress will feel the pain in other ways. Members' office budgets, committee staff and leadership offices will all see the same across-the-board cuts as any other discretionary , non-defense spending.

Other legislative branch functions — the Capitol Visitor Center, the Library of Congress's Books for the Blind program, even the Capitol Police — would take cuts of about 9%, according to a report from the Office of Management and Budget.

In the House, each representative gets an annual office budget of about $1.5 million — more for members from expensive and faraway districts.

Some congressional offices may feel the cuts more deeply than others. A USA TODAY analysis of 2011 congressional spending showed that 40% of House members had spent more than 90% of their office budgets — and Congress has cut its own budgets by about 8% since then. Additional cuts imposed by the sequester could force these offices to lay off staff or implement other cost-cutting strategies.

In 2011, Congress passed — and President Obama signed into law — the Budget Control Act, which required the across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion as a way to motivate lawmakers to find some other way of reducing the nation's budget deficit. They didn't.

Much of the $85 billion cost savings this year will come through furloughs, the administration has said. As many as 800,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department will have to take 22 days of unpaid leave before Oct. 1. Active-duty military and civilian defense employees in combat zones are exempt, as are senior political appointees in the Obama administration who don't fall under federal civil service rules.

The Executive Office of the President is subject to the sequester, but White House spokesman Jay Carney — while warning of the dire effects of agency cuts — declined to elaborate on how the presidency would be impacted. Again, the president's salary wouldn't be cut.

When Congress passed the sequester, Washington Rep. Norman Dicks, then the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, warned colleagues that the sequester would mean the elimination of about two legislative aides in a typical congressional office.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., runs two offices — his member office and the House Judiciary Committee, where he's chairman. He said the sequester hasn't come as a surprise — so he doesn't expect that draconian measures will be necessary to come within budget.

""We have been taking this into account with our hiring, both on the committee and in my congressional office. So I hope to be able to avoid that,"" he said. ""Any federal agency that has been listening to what's been going on for the last year and a half since this issue came up, I would hope has also taken that into account in their hiring practices so that they can mitigate the effect. I don't have the faith that all of them have done that.""

The Senate approved a two-year budget deal

The House approved it last week on a bipartisan vote

President Obama said he will sign it before he leaves Friday for Hawaii

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved, 64-36, Wednesday a limited, two-year budget framework to diffuse the threat of another government shutdown and alleviate harsh budget cuts.

Nine Republicans sided with all 55 members of the Democratic Conference, which includes two independent senators.

The agreement was overwhelmingly approved by the U.S. House last week, and it now heads to President Obama for his signature.

The framework sets top-line spending levels for the next two fiscal years at $1.012 trillion and $1.014 trillion, respectively. The GOP-led House and Democratic-led Senate had been unable to agree on spending levels, which helped provoke the 16-day government shutdown in October.

Working off the same budget levels will allow the House and Senate Appropriations committees to move forward on the annual 12 spending bills that fund the government's discretionary spending, which does not include spending on mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare.

""We have a heavy lift ahead of us — drafting, negotiating, and passing these bills in just over one month — but I am certain my colleagues on both the Senate and House Appropriations Committees are up to the task,"" House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., said last week. The current stopgap funding bill runs out on Jan. 15.

The budget deal also alleviates $63 billion in across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester by replacing them with other cuts and new government fees on airlines, new pension requirements for future federal employees, and a 1% reduction in cost of living adjustments to working-age military retirees. It also includes an additional $23 billion in modest deficit reduction over the next decade achieved by extending certain health care cuts through 2023.

The budget deal is one of the final legislative acts in what has otherwise been the most unproductive year on record for Congress.

The GOP-led House has already adjourned for the year, while the Democratic-led Senate is also working to wrap up a defense bill and a number of executive branch nominations before they adjourn for the holiday season.

The deal's negotiators, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said they are hopeful this final act of bipartisanship will usher in a new era of cooperation in a divided Washington.

Murray said the deal could help ""heal the wounds"" of what has been a divisive and partisan year that led to the first government shutdown in nearly two decades and included a bitter and ongoing battle over the implementation of the president's health care law.

Congress will reconvene on Jan. 6 for the second session of the 113th Congress. An overhaul of the nation's immigration laws is the dominant piece of domestic legislation facing this Congress, while congressional Republicans are also angling for additional fiscal restraints in exchange for their support to increase the nation's debt limit. A vote is expected in the spring."

And both sides are gearing up for next time.

Now that our recent brush with financial crisis is behind us, it’s time to start planning for the next one.

That’s the problem Congress set up in the stopgap deal that ended the 16-day government shutdown and averted a collision with the debt ceiling. After all the sound and fury, the two parties agreed only on continuing federal spending at its current level until Jan. 15 and raising the debt ceiling until Feb. 7.

This was the epitome of a temporary cease-fire: An arrangement that freezes in place a situation neither side liked to begin with.

The deal didn’t solve any of the long-term fiscal worries that landed us in this mess. It didn’t even fix the sequester, the meat-ax budget cuts that hit good programs and bad ones without distinction.

Whether we can avoid a repeat performance this winter will depend on what lessons the two sides learn from the fiasco.

Let’s take the Democrats first.

“There are no winners here,” President Obama said politely Thursday morning as the government reopened.

But his aides and his allies in Congress don’t really believe that — at least, not in a practical political sense.

They think the lesson of the crisis was straightforward: Toughness works. When Obama negotiated with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in 2011, he lost. The debt ceiling was raised, but Obama lost both on the substance of the issues and in the eyes of many voters. This time, when Obama dug in his heels and refused to negotiate over the debt ceiling, he won.

“Our goal was to prove to them that we were not going to engage with a gun pointed at our head,” a White House aide told me. “That’s accomplished.”

That doesn’t mean Obama won’t negotiate with Republicans in the next round. Saying he wouldn’t negotiate during the shutdown “was only a tactic; it wasn’t a basic principle,” the aide noted.

In the next round, Democrats hope to be negotiating from a better starting position. They believe Obama has shown he won’t be pushed around, and they also are hopeful that Republicans got the message they can’t use the debt ceiling as leverage any more.

“It’s kryptonite; they won’t want to touch it,” the aide predicted.

In addition, next year’s scheduled sequester cuts will slash defense spending more than this year’s, a fact that might spur Republican hawks toward a deal Democrats want to soften both defense and domestic spending cuts.

And what did Republicans learn?

To Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate Republican leader who negotiated the stopgap deal, the lesson was that government shutdowns end badly for Republicans, and he doesn’t want to try another one. “There’s no education in the second kick of a mule,” McConnell told the conservative magazine National Review last week. “The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We’re not going to do it.”

Does that mean every Republican in Congress has sworn off trying to use the debt ceiling as leverage? Not necessarily.

To some of the tea party members of Congress who spearheaded the doomed strategy to demand an end to Obama’s healthcare law as the price of keeping the government open, the lesson was that their own party wasn’t tough enough.

“It was an incredible victory” at first, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) insisted in a radio interview — until more moderate Senate Republicans turned into an “air force bombing our own troops.”

But the main lesson for many GOP House members, probably a majority, was that Republicans need clearer, more achievable objectives in the next round of negotiations.

“When you have multiple objectives, you can’t have a clear strategy,” a GOP strategist told me. “The Democrats have a clear goal — they want to undo the sequester and increase tax revenues. Republicans still haven’t figured out what their goals are … [beyond] holding firm against tax increases.”

Where does that leave us as the next budget battle approaches in January?

It’s certain there won’t be a “grand bargain” that trades long-term cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spending (Republican goals) for significant increases in tax revenue (a Democratic goal). That idea is now officially dead, at least in the short run.

Since 2014 is an election year, neither party is likely to make large concessions to the other; Republicans’ ambitions to take control of the Senate and Democrats’ hopes of taking over the House will make both sides cautious.

But it’s possible that both sides might agree to modifying the sequester — a “mini-bargain.” Both Obama and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have talked about the idea of sequester “buy downs” — agreements to trade some sequester cuts for more careful spending reductions. “There’s an acknowledgment on all sides that we can’t live with the sequester,” the White House aide said.

But the most likely outcome may look more like a “micro-bargain” — another agreement to kick the can down the road, perhaps with some modest new flexibility on spending cuts.

And for a Congress that defines dysfunction, even a stopgap solution that avoids a government shutdown or a financial crisis would look almost like a victory.

When exactly? Much has been made of Oct. 17 as the drop-dead date. But that's not quite right.

And here's why.

The country reached the debt ceiling in May. Since then the Treasury Department has been using special accounting measures to keep borrowing just under the limit.

But Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said those will run out no later than Oct. 17.

That means the ""extraordinary measures"" could dry up on Oct. 12 or Oct. 15, or some other date. Just no later than Oct. 17.

When they do, Treasury won't be able to borrow and will have only two sources of money to pay bills: The estimated $30 billion cash that Lew expects to have on hand, plus whatever daily revenue that comes in.

The big question: When will that money fall below what Treasury needs to pay on any given day?

The Congressional Budget Office estimates between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31.

Because money owed and revenue coming in varies from day to day, it's hard to pinpoint the precise day when the country could default on some legal obligations -- which include interest on the debt, Social Security payments, and payments to federal contractors.

Related: Debt ceiling: 8 things you need to know but wish you didn't

What economists and budget experts are very clear about, however, is that the closer we get to mid-October the more markets are likely to buck. And refusing to raise the debt ceiling for too long could cripple the economy and investments.

Here's why.

Cash crunch could leave millions high 'n dry: If Treasury doesn't have enough cash on hand to pay what's owed, it will have to make decisions that are legally and ethically questionable, to say nothing of practically difficult.

Some Republicans say that Treasury should prioritize who gets paid first.

Treasury says that would not only be near impossible because of how its payment systems work, it would be wrong. ""Any plan to prioritize some payments over others is simply default by another name,"" Lew wrote in a letter to lawmakers.

Most experts assume that Treasury would do all it could to pay interest owed to bondholders first since failure to do so could unhinge world markets.

But beyond that, who deserves to be next on the list? Seniors, disabled veterans, federal contractors, active-duty military personnel? The federal government has incurred legal obligations to all of them. They and the U.S. economy depend on their being paid on schedule.

Treasury would have two main options, both awful: It could pay some bills in full and delay others; or it could delay all payments due on a given day until it has enough money on hand to pay them all.

Senior Treasury officials indicated in an inspector general's report that the second option would be the most likely and least harmful of the two. But it's hardly painless.

Backlog of payments would grow: Depending on how long the debt ceiling standoff lasts, delays could quickly grow from a day or two to several weeks.

That would starve the economy and create doubt in the minds of investors and ordinary Americans that the United States is good for the money.

""If the confidence in the reliability of payments were cast into doubt, the consequences for the budget, the U.S. economy, the U.S. and global financial systems could be large and lasting and very damaging,"" Douglas Elmendorf, the current CBO director, told Congress recently.

U.S. standing in the world would be hurt. It will be very hard to justify to anyone why the world's largest economy and richest country is willfully choosing not to pay what it owes.

Markets and the economy would tumble: Economist Mark Zandi worries that the stock market could start falling by hundreds of points a day as the calendar moves closer to Oct. 17 if Congress shows no signs it will raise the debt ceiling. And it really won't help confidence if the government shutdown is still going on.

Should it get to the point that Treasury can't pay all bills in full and on time? ""We're going back into recession. It's an economic Pandora's box,"" Zandi told CNN."

Liberals’ love of recycling extends to their ideas, one of which illustrates the miniaturization of Barack Obama’s presidency. He fervently favors a minor measure that would have mostly small, mostly injurious effects on a small number of people. Nevertheless, raising the minimum hourly wage for the 23rd time since 1938, from today’s $7.25 to $10.10, is a nifty idea, if:

If government is good at setting prices. Government — subsidizer of Solyndra, operator of the ethanol program, creator of HealthCare.gov — uses minimum-wage laws to set the price for the labor of workers who are apt to add only small value to the economy.

If you think government should prevent two consenting parties — an employer and a worker — from agreeing to an hourly wage that government disapproves.

If you think today’s 7 percent unemployment rate is too low. (It would be 10.9 percent if the workforce participation rate were as high as it was when Obama was first inaugurated; since then, millions of discouraged workers have stopped searching for jobs.) Because less than 3 percent of the workforce earns the minimum wage, increasing that wage will not greatly increase unemployment. Still, raising the price of low-productivity workers will somewhat reduce demand for them.

If you reject that last sentence. If you do, name other goods or services for which you think demand is inelastic when their prices increase.

If you think teenage (16-19) unemployment (20.8 percent), and especially African American teenage unemployment (35.8 percent), is too low. Approximately 24 percent of minimum-wage workers are teenagers.

If you think government policy should encourage automation of the ordering and preparation of food to replace workers in the restaurant industry, which employs 43.8 percent of minimum-wage workers.

If you think it is irrelevant that most minimum-wage earners are not poor. Most minimum-wage workers are not heads of households. More than half are students or other young people, usually part-time workers in families whose average income is $53,000 a year, which is $2,000 more than the average household income.

If you do not care that there are more poor people whose poverty derives from being unemployed than from low wages. True, some of the working poor earn so little they are eligible for welfare. But an increase in the minimum wage will cause some of these people to become unemployed and rely on welfare.

If you do not mind a minimum-wage increase having a regressive cost-benefit distribution. It would jeopardize marginal workers to benefit organized labor, which supports a higher minimum in the hope that this will raise the general wage floor, thereby strengthening unions’ negotiating positions.

If you think it is irrelevant that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers get a raise in their first year.

If you think a higher minimum wage, rather than a strengthened Earned Income Tax Credit, is the most efficient way to give money to the working poor.

If you think tweaking the minimum wage is a serious promotion of equality by an administration during which 95 percent of real income growth has accrued to the top 1 percent.

If you think forcing employers to spend X dollars more than necessary to employ labor for entry-level jobs will stimulate the economy. If you believe this, you must think the workers receiving the extra dollars will put the money to more stimulative uses than their employers would have. If so, why not a minimum wage of $50.50 rather than the $10.10? Because this might discourage hiring? What makes you sure you know the threshold where job destruction begins?

If you think the high school dropout rate is too low. In 1994, Congress decreed that by 2000 the graduation rate would be “at least” 90 percent. In 2010 it was 78.2 percent. Increasing the minimum wage would increase the incentive to leave school early. One scholarly study concluded that, in states where students may leave school before 18, increases in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to decline.

The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill.

The Washington Examiner‘s Byron York uncovered the new Obama stimulus program that Gang of Eight members and other Senate Republicans inserted into the bill as a sweetheart deal for liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The left leaning Senator was previously critical of the legislation.

“The original Gang bill ended with a section designated Title IV, which was headlined REFORMS TO NON-IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAMS,” York wrote on Sunday. “The Hoeven-Corker version of the bill added a Title V, with the headline JOBS FOR YOUTH. The measure would provide $1.5 billion in the next two years to provide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. It was originally pushed by Democratic Sen. Bernard Sanders, who wanted to come to the aid of young workers who were ‘hard hit by the Wall Street-caused recession.’ Now, Sanders says immigration reform will further damage youth job prospects.”

A provision under that new stimulus program title allows for the use of spending the taxpayer money on the program to provide transportation for youth to and from their jobs.

“(f) USE OF FUNDS.–

(1) IN GENERAL.–The funds made available under this section shall be used–

(A) to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth, with direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or child care, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth in the opportunities;”

The total appropriation for this new stimulus program would be $1.5 billion that would be divvied up among states that applied for the money. According to the proposed statute as written, all the money would need to be spent in a year-and-three-months period.

“The amounts appropriated under this title shall be available for obligation by the Secretary of Labor until December 31, 2014, and shall be available for expenditure by grantees (including subgrantees) until September 30, 2015,” the part of the provision detailing how long the money would be available for reads.

A GOP senate aide told Breitbart News that for the country to be able to spend $1.5 billion on such a program so fast, it would need to buy, lease or rent motor vehicles for beneficiaries of the new government handout. The provision that outlines how the money can be legally used for providing “supportive services” like “transportation,” the aide said, could easily be interpreted to mean the money could be spent buying or leasing or renting vehicles for the beneficiaries.

“This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,” the GOP aide said."

USA TODAY

Nominee for Fed chair calls economy still %27fragile%27

Risks of Fed%27s easy-money policies include overpriced assets and high inflation

Beneficiaries of Fed%27s push to keep rates low include %22all the Americans who own homes%22

Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen told senators Thursday that the Fed's stimulus measures continue to boost the recovery despite their growing risks, and she gave no clue when policymakers will begin to scale back the program.

""The (Fed's bond) purchases have made a meaningful contribution to economic growth and improving the outlook,"" said Yellen during a Senate banking committee hearing on her nomination to become chairman of the Federal Reserve.

If confirmed by the full Senate, she would succeed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke next year and become the first woman to head a major central bank.

Yellen largely echoed Bernanke's pro-growth approach, signaling to economists a continuity of Fed policies. ""One would be hard-pressed to distinguish Yellen from Bernanke"" from simply reading a transcript of the hearing, says J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli.

Yellen, 67, held her ground amid sharp questioning from committee Republicans who argued the risks and costs of the Fed's $85 billion in monthly bond purchases have grown, while benefits to the economy have diminished. The purchases are intended to hold down long-term interest rates and spur economic growth.

She said ""it's important"" that the Fed not taper down its bond buying too soon, ""especially when the recovery is still fragile."" Noting that 36% of jobless Americans have been out of work at least six months, she said, ""We know that long spells of unemployment are particularly painful.""

The economy has been growing at a tepid pace of about 2% a year during the four-year-old recovery, and unemployment, at 7.3%, remains high.

At the same time, Yellen acknowledged the risks of the bond-buying, which include eventual high inflation. She said she's particularly concerned about the formation of asset bubbles, such as those that appeared to develop recently in junk bonds and the stocks of real estate investment trusts. ""These are risks we take very seriously,"" she said, adding she doesn't now see evidence of bubbles that could burst, much like the real estate crash in 2007.

Yellen said she would not rule out reducing the Fed's stimulus or raising interest rates to combat investment bubbles — a stance that is considered controversial by some economists who say monetary policy should be used to boost the economy or fight inflation.

Still, Yellen said: ""At this point, I believe the benefits (of the stimulus) exceed the costs.""

Several Republicans argued otherwise. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the committee's ranking member, cited studies to argue that the benefits of the purchases to the economy have significantly diminished. Meantime, he said, the risks have grown.

Pressed by Crapo on when the Fed will begin to rein in the bond-buying, Yellen would not be specific but said that at each Fed meeting, ""what the committee is looking for is signs that we will have growth that's strong enough to promote continued progress.""

Some economists expect the Fed to begin paring back the program as early as December after a recent government report revealed surprisingly strong job gains of 204,000 in October despite the government shutdown. Many other economists expect the tapering to start in March, noting another congressional budget battle looms early next year.

Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said the Fed's stimulus has artificially inflated assets, such as house prices in certain markets, setting the stage for another possible downturn. ""I'm just worried we're on a sugar high,"" he said.

Yellen said, ""I don't see (rising home prices) as an asset bubble,"" adding that prices in hard-hit markets are simply rebounding from excessively low levels. She added that she doesn't see the stock market's record highs as a bubble.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., bluntly called the Fed's low interest-rate program ""an elitist policy"" that's helping wealthier Americans who own stocks, but ""it hasn't trickled down"" to low- and middle-income households that rely on now-meager bank interest rates for income.

Yellen acknowledged that people who own stocks are reaping big benefits and that those who keep most of their money in savings accounts have been hurt. But Fed policies also have helped heal the housing market, she said, benefiting all homeowners.

""The ripple effects go through the economy and bring benefits to, I would say, all Americans, both those who are unemployed and find it easier to get jobs as the recovery is stronger, and also to those who have jobs,"" she said.

She added that the Fed's easy-money program is the fastest way to accelerate economic growth so that the Fed can eventually raise short-term rates. ""I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,"" she said.

Yellen conceded that the Fed's signals in the spring that it may soon start to pare back the stimulus pushed up interest rates as financial markets misinterpreted the move as foreshadowing an earlier increase in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate. That contributed to the Fed's decision in September to hold off on the tapering.

""We do have to account for what's happening in the markets,"" she said. Noting the bond purchases — which have swelled the Fed's portfolio by $3 trillion since 20008 — are ""unprecedented,"" she added, ""It is a work in progress, and sometimes, miscommunication is possible.""

Yellen argued that ongoing federal spending cuts are hobbling economic growth and making the Fed's mission more difficult. ""I agree that fiscal policy has been working at cross purposes to monetary policy,"" she said. ""Some of the near-term (spending) reductions have certainly subtracted from the near-term momentum of the economy.""

Like Bernanke, she said the cuts should be weighted toward the medium- and long-term future, when the economy is on more solid ground.

Some Democrats pressed Yellen on delays in Fed efforts to implement banking reforms, which grew out of the 2008 financial crisis.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the Fed appears to put far more focus on monetary policy than bank supervision, noting its board failed to approve a $9 billion settlement with banks that illegally foreclosed on homes, leaving the task to staff.

""I absolutely believe our supervisory responsibilities are critical and just as important as monetary policy,"" Yellen said.

Yellen is widely expected to be confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Senate. She has played a leading role in developing the stimulus program and in taking steps to establish clearer Fed communication with financial markets and the public. She also helped form a Fed annual inflation goal of 2% and a policy to keep the Fed's short-term interest rate near zero, at least until unemployment, now 7.3%, falls to 6.5%."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/obama-economic-speech_n_3645371.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],Obama Economic Speech Tells GOP To Drop The 'Endless Parade Of Distractions',"WASHINGTON -- Against the backdrop of a stable but still lethargic economy, President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged Congress to end what he deemed worsening gridlock and to join him in crafting a constructive agenda for jobs, immigration reform and health care implementation.

The speech, which was widely hyped in advance by the administration, was heavy on broad themes while touching on a few specifics. The president pitched a refinancing plan for mortgages, a long-term fix to student loans, worker training programs, and a renewed focus on manufacturing jobs and infrastructure repair. Speaking at Knox College, he called on Congress to offer constructive input on all these fronts.

""Over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible,"" the president said. ""The good news is, a growing number of Republican senators are trying to get things done, like an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars. But a faction of Republicans in the House won’t even give that bill a vote, and that same group gutted a farm bill that America’s farmers and most vulnerable children depend on.""

""With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball,"" he said. ""And I am here to say this needs to stop. Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires.""

While declaring that the economy stood in a better place now than when he took office, Obama also conceded that the status quo was not good enough. The current state of income inequality, he stressed, ""isn’t just morally wrong; it’s bad economics."" America, he added, had to make new investments such as ""rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, [and] upgrading our transportation and information networks.""

The speech, which is one of several that the White House has planned, was pitched as a pivot of sorts back to economic issues after months of focus on other items -- from the legislative (gun control) to the headline-grabbers (the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS). The setting itself was meant to be an emotional springboard. The president had delivered the commencement address at Knox College as a senator in 2005, an address that he and his advisers have routinely cited as the best distillation of his economic principles.

But it was impossible to not place the speech in a broader political context. It was being delivered, in part, to pre-frame upcoming fights, rather than help win current ones.

The late summer months have been a notoriously tough part of the political calendar for the president -- from health care town halls in 2009, to the lead-up of the 2010 elections, to the debt ceiling standoff in 2011. And advisers to the president acknowledge that they are keen to avoid getting caught flat-footed again. Their efforts have even greater urgency considering that several major battles with congressional Republicans are on the horizon.

The government must pass a budget by the end of September. Lawmakers must also figure out what to do with the spending cuts caused by sequestration or risk having them become even larger in the next fiscal year. Negotiations on the latter are virtually non-existent, while both sides remain far apart on the former. As The New York Times reported on Wednesday, congressional Republicans are crafting spending bills that would ""gut"" the president's top priorities.

The most ominous legislative showdown, however, appears to once again involve the raising of the debt ceiling. A small number of Senate Republicans have insisted that there be no increase if it includes any money whatsoever to fund the president's health care law.

So far, other Republicans have declined to join that chorus. ""I don't support that,"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told MSNBC on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), meanwhile, has warned his colleagues not to play political games with the faith and credit of the U.S. government.

But the pressure is mounting. The Club for Growth, a top conservative campaign group, asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to sign on to a letter promising not to fund Obamacare as part of any debt ceiling agreement.

Over in the House, meanwhile, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said that he will not ""raise the debt ceiling without real cuts in spending,"" a mantra that preceded a similar showdown in 2011. Boehner has alternatively said he would not allow the country to default -- making it hard to gauge how serious a threat this truly is -- but Politico, citing Republican sources, reported Tuesday night that ""there are loads of GOP lawmakers who are perfectly willing to gamble with default.""

""We’ve seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn’t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up – a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can’t afford to repeat,"" Obama said. ""Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel – by cutting programs we don’t need, fixing ones we do, and making government more efficient – this same group has insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that has cost jobs, harmed growth, hurt our military, and gutted investments in American education and scientific and medical research that we need to make this country a magnet for good jobs.""

The latest estimates have the debt ceiling being hit roughly around the end of October."

President Obama effectively began the negotiations Monday that he had pledged to avoid, over whether Congress should raise the borrowing limit at the end of next month.

His opening bid: I won’t negotiate.

Obama used the final news conference of his first term to warn a divided Congress to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks or risk turning the United States into what he called “a deadbeat nation.”

Invoking his recent election victory as proof that the American people support his broader approach to taxes and spending, Obama said that, in return for raising the borrowing limit, House Republicans would receive precisely nothing.

“They will not collect a ransom for not crashing the American economy,” Obama said in his opening statement from the East Room of the White House.

President Obama held his final news conference of his first term on Monday to press Congress to raise the debt ceiling. (The Washington Post)

The president’s attempt to make raising the borrowing limit entirely a matter for an unpopular Congress to address marks a shift from the central role he played in 2011, when he was drawn into a summer-long debate over the issue that badly damaged his political standing on the eve of an election year.

Congress eventually raised the borrowing limit, but for the first time, a credit agency downgraded U.S. debt partly because of the political uncertainty those negotiations created.

This time Obama is trying to stay out of the discussion, even as he called a Monday news conference to highlight the dangers of failing to raise the debt ceiling and what he believes is Congress’s responsibility for avoiding them.

The balance Obama is trying to strike — involvement without seeming to be involved — shows how difficult it will be for the president to ignore an issue that could have such a potentially calamitous effect on the U.S. economy, which he said Monday is “poised for a good year.”

“As long as Washington politics don’t get in the way of America’s progress,” he added.

White House officials know privately that Obama will be asked to participate in the debt-ceiling talks, and they believe that the president’s victory in forcing House Republicans to raise some taxes in the fiscal cliff deal will help them exert behind-the-scenes influence over this round

Polls showed that Obama, who secured higher tax rates for the wealthy in those “fiscal cliff” negotiations, emerged in a better position from them than did House Republicans.

As one senior administration official, who requested anonymity to describe how the White House is thinking about the coming weeks, said, “We are stronger for the debt fight because we won the fiscal cliff fight.”

“That’s how we’re going to look at this,” the official said.

Obama indicated as much Monday with a strong defense of his spending priorities, a relatively liberal mix of safety-net protection and money for education, scientific research and other areas he believes will help modernize the American economy.

He said the ideological contest over his and the Republican Party’s visions of government’s role is at the heart of the debt-ceiling debate, rather than a good-faith discussion over ways to reduce the deficit. The larger debate, he has argued, should be separate from the borrowing limit talks.

Obama said House Republicans are “suspicious about government’s commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research.”

“So they’ve got a particular view of what government should do and should be,” he said. “And, you know, that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign.

Obama’s skills as a negotiator drew critics from both sides of the partisan divide throughout his first term. His opponents have called him recalcitrant, while his supporters say he too easily compromises to secure a deal.

But on Monday he framed the debt-ceiling issue as a matter of principle in executive and legislative branch relations, arguing that the country, if it is to recover economically and financially, must stop “lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis.”

“If we continue down this path,” Obama said, referring to regular, to-the-brink talks over raising the borrowing limit, “there’s really no stopping the principle.”

Obama has a busy legislative agenda to push and a small window of time to accomplish it before his reelection popularity turns into lame-duck irrelevance.

At the news conference, Obama was asked if he intended to change the perception in Washington that his administration is too insular and that, as a politician, he doesn’t cultivate enough political friends to help with his agenda.

Part of Obama’s appeal in 2008 was his pledge to rise above Washington’s partisan antagonism, limit the power of lobbyists and bring a new way of governing to the capital. But on Monday he attributed his perceived isolation in the White House to the enduring partisanship that he once hoped to change.

“I’m a pretty friendly guy, and I like a good party,” Obama said. “I think that really what’s gone on in terms of some of the paralysis here in Washington, or difficulties in negotiations, just have to do with some very stark differences in terms of policy.”

He joked that he’ll have more time to work on other relationships now that “my girls are getting older.

“They don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway, so I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house.”

But, he said, the kinds of White House events where he and his wife, Michelle Obama, pose for friendly photos with members of Congress “doesn’t prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.”

“I think there are a lot of Republicans at this point that feel that given how much energy has been devoted in some of the media that’s preferred by Republican constituencies to demonize me, that it doesn’t look real good socializing with me,” he said."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/15/pentagon-spending-nearly-1billion-year-on-unemployment-despite-budget-cuts/,2013-03-15 00:00:00,[],Pentagon spending nearly $1 billion a year on unemployment despite budget cuts,"Even as it faces budget cuts and forced employee furloughs, the Pentagon is spending nearly a $1 billion a year on a program that sends unemployment checks to former troops who left the military voluntarily.

Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers, a Labor Department program, is a spinoff of the federal-state unemployment insurance program. The Labor Department says the overall program is meant to help ""eligible workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own"" such as during layoffs.

But eligibility for the military compensation requires only that a person served in uniform and was honorably discharged. In other words, anyone who joins the military and serves for several years, then decides not to re-enlist, is potentially eligible for what could amount to more than 90 weeks of unemployment checks.

The program's cost rose from $300 million in 2003 to $928 million last year.

""It eats away at other parts of the budget, and is for people they no longer have control of,"" said Air Force veteran Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

""Why are we spending so much on (the program) at a time when we can't afford to build a new fighter jet?"" said Samuel Wright, a former Navy lawyer who helps troops with employment and other legal issues. The Pentagon is facing across-the-board cuts because of automatic spending reductions that took effect this month.

Defense officials and outside experts have become increasingly concerned about the rising cost of the compensation program. And some believe it's evidence of weaknesses in other programs, such as those designed to help veterans find jobs. Some military experts suspect the availability of the money may be discouraging some veterans from actively looking for work and thus falsely inflating data on their unemployment -- data that shows higher joblessness for Iraq and Afghanistan vets than for older ones and for society in general.

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman, said a factor in the higher costs is the increased use of National Guard and Reserve units over the past decade for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is, once they were activated, came home and were deactivated, they were added to the rolls of ex-active duty troops.

Another factor could be the recession, which resulted in higher overall national unemployment rates, he said.

The program for former military members started under a 1958 law aimed partly at helping troops transition from life in uniform to the private sector. Unlike the larger U.S. unemployment insurance program, there is no paycheck deduction from troops to fund the military one. In the private sector, employers pay a tax to fund compensation checks; in the military program, the service branches are the employer.

Claims are filed with the states. The Labor Department then tallies compensation sent to former military members and sends the bill to their individual service branches, as well as to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, where a smaller number of former employees also are covered.

Former military members are subject to the same state requirements as others when they apply to a given state for the money. All states have a requirement of some kind that recipients search for work while getting compensation, the Labor Department says. States vary in the types of search activity needed and the effort required, with some, for instance, requiring two job interviews within a certain period or different types of documentation on the search.

Nearly 120,000 people filed first-time claims for money in the military program over the last budget year, compared with 71,000 in 2008, the Labor Department says. Well over 515,000 have gotten compensation since 2008.

Wright, now director of the law center at the Reserve Officers Association, says the payments ""ought to be for people who are actively seeking re-employment -- it's not just free money.""

Officials worry, too, about what will happen to costs when the military draws down from its wartime size, sending more troops out of the services.

A 2008 analysis for the Pentagon by the RAND Corp. research institution found that the sharp rise in military unemployment payments did not mean the civilian labor market for recent veterans had weakened. The study suggested ""a rethinking"" of the program and also noted the big increase in reservists called up over the decade.

It's not solely the number of reservists activated that matters, but also how many know about, and claim, their legal right to go back to their former civilian employers after coming home from mobilization.

""I think one reason that a lot of (recent) veterans are unemployed and have great difficulty finding work is because employers are routinely violating"" the law on returning troops and that too few are being prosecuted for it, Wright said. He says his law center gets more than 700 calls a month from people complaining about that or other employment or legal issues.

There are plenty of other reasons troops may not go straight from life in uniform to one in the private sector.

The need for ""down time"" -- particularly among those who saw combat -- can be a huge factor in re-acclimating.

Some troops also find it hard to face civilian life after the more authoritarian and regimented style of the military.

It also can take time for some to figure out how their military skills and experience translate to private sector jobs.

And some may not want what's being offered in the job market.

""A lot say, `Hey, I joined the Army or Marines so I could get out of working at McDonald's,""' Wright says.

The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is 9.4 percent, compared with 7.7 percent among all Americans, and has been higher for some years.

The compensation ""could be funding the acclimation period for veterans; some veterans may be declining employment opportunities or choosing not to seek employment,"" said a study last year by analysts at the Center for a New American Security.

That may be inflating the program's cost and ""artificially inflating the ranks of unemployed veterans with individuals who are not actively seeking employment,"" said the study, which looked at how American business executives view hiring veterans.

It said the Defense Department should work to better understand the complex needs of veterans during transition to civilian society and figure out how ""efficient, helpful and necessary"" the unemployment compensation is.

""Questions to be considered include which veterans require an acclimation period, how much time is generally needed and whether (the compensation) is currently supporting recently separated veterans through that acclimation period,"" the authors said."

Perry has launched a high-profile battle for California companies, running radio ads in California touting the Lone Star State's low taxes and favorable business climate. The ads will be heard in San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego and the Inland Empire area east of Los Angeles.

""Building a business is tough, but I hear building a business in California is next to impossible. This is Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and I have a message for California businesses: Come check out Texas,"" starts the 30-second spot.

Perry notes that his state has won the Best State for Business title from Chief Executive magazine for eight years running. He noted that the cost of doing business in California is 6.3% above the national average and Texas' is 4.6% below it.

This is not the first time Texas has looked to raid California for businesses. The governor has made several scouting trips and has written letters to California companies in the past. And, according to the governor's office, nearly three dozen California companies have relocated or expanded in Texas during California Gov. Jerry Brown's term.

Texas isn't the only one knocking on California companies' doors. Several states have courted Golden State businesses in recent years, particularly during California's budget turmoil.

California officials, however, aren't that concerned. Business relocations account for only .03% of annual job losses and the state is doing well economically, according to the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development.

""I can understand why Rick Perry is interested in California. We were the national jobs leader for most of the last year with 257,000 new private sector jobs,"" said Kish Rajan, the office's director. ""Real job creation comes from California's history as a national leader in start-ups and the expansion of homegrown businesses.""

But Perry sees a new opening with California's recent tax hikes, which he says ""increases California's already excessive income and sales tax."" He pointed out that Texas has no state income tax and a low business tax cut.

Perry even reminded golfer Phil Mickelson, who recently complained about taxes in California, about that fact. ""Hey Phil....Texas is home to liberty and low taxes...we would love to have you as well !!"" Perry tweeted last month."

Already, some Senate conservatives are moving against the proposal, which Murray and Ryan say would provide sequester relief by increasing spending by $63 billion over the next two years, but offsetting that increase with $86 billion in new spending cuts and revenues over the next decade. For example, Rand Paul:



“Senator Paul will oppose the reported cap busting deal,” Doug Stafford, Paul’s senior adviser, told POLITICO on Wednesday. “He opposes increasing spending and undoing the minimal sequester cuts in current law, which weren’t even close to enough to begin with.”

“It doesn’t appear to be something I will likely support,” Crapo said. “It’s pretty light on entitlement reform and the entitlement reform that’s done is not structural. It doesn’t do anything to actually change or fix that. We’re looking now to see if it can pass the Congress.”

And Sen. Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said:But even if Senate Republicans don't provide much support for the deal, history suggests it can still pass the Senate because it has the support of Senate leadership and President Obama. The real question is whether Republicans will be able to get it through the House without Democratic help, and whether House Democrats will provide that help if Republicans ask for it.

Yesterday, Ryan said he expected conservatives would support the deal, pointing out that its spending levels are lower than the ones contained in the budget that House Republicans passed last year. And this morning, House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor appeared at a press conference with Ryan to demonstrate their support for the deal—and to try suggest that if Republicans pass it, it will allow them to pivot their focus back to Obamacare instead of dealing with another fiscal crisis.

Nonetheless, conservative groups were already railing against the deal even before it was announced, putting pressure on House Republicans to oppose it—and their efforts may be having an impact:





@jamiedupree Many House GOP lawmakers leaving meeting on budget deal obviously not thrilled with Ryan-Murray budget deal



@edatpost ""Stay tuned"" @Nancypelosi says in regards to whether Democrats will support #budget agreememt.

Obviously, ""not thrilled"" doesn't mean they'll vote against it, but given the history of House Republicans, it would be foolish to discount the possibility. So, if enough Republicans bolt to tank the deal, will House Democrats provide John Boehner cover?The one thing we do know is that whether or not this deal passes, a huge economic issue remains unresolved: Extending emergency unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans. Whatever Congress does with the budget, there's no excuse for cutting unemployment insurance now, especially in the middle of the holiday season.

::

Tell your member of Congress: Don't cut emergency unemployment benefits

Here's more on how Boehner is pushing back against right-wing criticism of the budget deal. Also, other GOP senators opposing the deal include John Barrasso of Wyoming, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/15/Senate-Dems-Set-to-Roll-GOP,2013-10-15 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Senate Dems Set to Roll GOP,"Word on the Hill is that a Senate deal to end the partial government shutdown and lift the debt ceiling will be reached on Tuesday. Although specific details are murky and subject to change, the broad outlines of the deal indicate a complete victory for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democrat caucus. With the partial government shutdown entering its third week, it looks increasingly likely that the GOP will gain next to nothing from the stand-off.

The deal negotiated between Reid and GOP Leader Mitch McConnell would reopen the government through January 15th. The GOP had sought to lock-in lower levels of spending due to next year’s sequester cuts, but that seems off the table now. The deal would also raise the debt ceiling until early February. It sets up another contentious fight over spending and debt in the critical 2014 election year.

In exchange, the GOP secured the creation of a large bi-cameral, bi-partisan commission or committee to explore budget and spending reforms. It also secured a provision to force the Obama Administration to take steps to verify the income of people seeking ObamaCare subsidies. That requirement is in the existing law, but was waived recently by the Administration.

Democrats also seem to have secured a priority for their union allies. The deal, reportedly, would delay for one year ObamaCare’s “reinsurance” tax on group plans. Repealing this tax was a key policy goal for labor.

It is hard to see this deal as anything but a complete capitulation by the GOP. The national debt would increase, without corresponding spending cuts or other reforms. Federal spending would resume at a higher level than required by the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. Given the GOP’s inability to secure any meaningful reforms in these negotiations, it is hard to imagine it would fair better with a commission.

If a deal is reached Tuesday, it could still take several days to pass the Senate. Any one Senator can object to the deal, forcing the Senate to consider the deal through its Byzantine process. It isn’t likely to pass the Senate until well after Treasury’s October 17 deadline for new borrowing authority.

If the House gets the deal several days past the debt deadline, the chamber will come under extraordinary pressure to approve the deal."

The “sequester” -- the drastic set of budget cuts formerly known as the “fiscal cliff” -- seems very likely to go into effect at the end of this week due in no small part to the fact that hyper-conservative lawmakers, such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, actually think it’s a pretty swell idea.

Their obsessive and mistaken belief that the federal deficit is the greatest threat to the republic is leading them to block any compromise with Democrats that would delay or repeal the looming budget reductions.

They want government to get smaller and smaller, even if the cuts will come too quickly and slash too indiscriminately. The supreme absurdity of their position is that this could so damage the American economy that federal revenue will drop and deficit reduction will become even harder to achieve.

The tea party folks may be sincere, loyal citizens, but their notions about how the economy works are exactly that: mere notions. Their core notion is that government needs to do nothing more than get out of the way of business in order for the economy to boom and bloom.

In an 18th century world or in the fiction of Ayn Rand that might have worked, but the reality is different. The United States became the world’s biggest economy in the post-World War II years for many reasons, but one big reason is that government played a pivotal role.

Government built infrastructure like the interstate highway system, paid for crucial research and development, ran the space program, supported a massive military and played referee in the financial realm so that those who wanted to rig the system could not do it as easily as they had in the 1920s.

When, in his first inaugural address, Ronald Reagan famously said government is the problem, not the solution, he established the Republican mantra that has not changed in all the years since. It was a clever bit of rhetoric, but it has turned too many Republicans into economic simpletons. Government can, indeed, be part of the problem sometimes, but it cannot be left out of any solution to the challenges of our complex modern economy.

Pete Peterson, President Nixon’s secretary of Commerce, has campaigned for years against rising deficits and has earned the ire of liberals who think his insistence on restructuring Social Security and Medicare is too extreme and unnecessary. Yet, even Peterson, in an interview on public radio’s “Marketplace” on Tuesday, said many of his fellow Republicans are crazy to think the sequester cuts are a smart idea.

Peterson said the deficit problem is long-term and must be dealt with comprehensively through spending reductions, entitlement reforms and revenue increases, a.k.a. taxes.

What should not happen, Peterson insisted, is a governmental retreat from investing in America’s economic future through funding of things such as education, infrastructure and basic scientific research. Of course, to the tea party Republicans, such talk is heresy.

There is one other fallacy that anti-government conservatives cling to, and they talk about it so much that they have convinced most of the people in the country it is true. That fallacious premise is that President Obama has done nothing to reduce the federal deficit. In fact, the deficit has shrunk as a percentage of GDP every year since Obama took office. Check the numbers. Look it up. We are actually on the right track!

But that will not last long if hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed, if military bases are closed, if the air traffic control system is disrupted or if many other important government services are crippled. That will start happening on Friday when the sequester kicks in. If it does, we will have a bunch of deluded deficit hawks to thank for it."

A file picture dated 01 March 2013 shows a longtime exposure image of clouds moving above the US Capitol in Washington, DC, USA. EPA/JIM LO SCALZO

The federal government officially shut down for the first time in 17 years at midnight on Monday, after House Republicans refused to drop demands that parts of the Affordable Care Act be delayed in return for approval of a mandatory government funding bill.



Federal employees who are considered essential to public safety will be expected to work this week. But most federal offices will be closed until Congress reaches a deal. The shutdown is the first one of its kind since 1996, when the government closed for 26 days under President Bill Clinton.

Despite missing the deadline, debate persisted in the House and Senate early into the morning. The House is still planning to request to establish a conference committee with the Senate, but Senate Democratic leaders preemptively rejected the offer Monday night, saying they would not negotiate until the House had passed a bill to fund the government for six weeks without any extra provisions.



The Senate will likely respond by tabling the offer, which will take the federal government into a partial shutdown scenario beginning Tuesday morning.



House Republican leaders intend to request a conference committee from Senate Democrats to resolve differences on a bill to fund the government. But earlier Monday, Senate Democrats announced they would reject a House request for a conference committee to find a solution to budget woes.

""Republicans are still playing games,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat of Nevada said on the House floor.

Appointing a conference committee would not have averted a government shutdown before the Monday night deadline when government funding levels expire, but it could have put the battling parties in a position to reach an agreement to fund the government faster than the game of legislative ping pong House Republicans played with Senate Democrats on the final day before the shutdown deadline.



Over the past week, the Senate rejected the third proposal from the House to keep the government open while also attacking Obamacare — most recently by delaying the individual mandate to buy health insurance and by prohibiting congressional staff members from federal insurance subsidies under the controversial health care program.

Story continues

As time grew short, President Barack Obama signed last-minute legislation to ensure that members of the military and personnel at the Department of Homeland Security get paid even in the event of a shutdown. And aides scoffed at the conference request as a desperate gambit ensuring that government will turn out the lights at midnight.



Obama, after stepping before cameras to urge an end to the standoff, reached out by telephone to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ― but there was no breakthrough, a White House official said.

As a result of Republicans refusing to hold a budget conference to set spending levels for the year, Congress is funding the government with short-term, stop-gap ""continuing resolutions"" that must be approved when old ones expire. The deadline for approving a new one is midnight Monday.

Earlier this month, House Republicans passed their first version of a spending bill but added a controversial amendment that would defund Obamacare. After a lengthy debate over the bill in the Democrat-controlled Senate, which included a 21-hour protest speech from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, the upper chamber rejected the House bill and returned its version with the Obamacare funding reinserted.

Senate Democratic leaders warned that they would accept nothing short of a “clean” continuation of funding — one without riders such as defunding Obamacare — a move that practically dared Republicans to blink.

House Republicans only dug in their heels deeper. Over the weekend, they approved another bill, one that would delay Obamacare for a year and permanently abolish a tax on medical devices, and the Senate rejected it Monday.

Boehner, Republican of Ohio, chided Senate Democrats Monday for waiting until the day before a shutdown to act and reiterated the House’s intention to use the shutdown battle as a vessel to cripple the health care law.

""This law is not ready for prime time. The House has done its work,” Boehner said on the House floor. “It's time for the Senate to listen to the American people just like the House has listened to the American people and pass a one-year delay of Obamacare.""

Obama, who has vowed to veto any spending bill that tampers with the Affordable Care Act, said Monday that he was not ""resigned"" to a shutdown.



“I suspect I will be speaking to the leaders today, tomorrow and the next day,"" Obama said.

Before the House chose to attack Obamacare using the mandatory spending bill, House Republicans had planned instead to use an upcoming vote to raise the federal government’s debt limit as the vehicle for delaying the law. However, with support from Cruz and his allies in the Senate, House conservatives demanded action immediately. Boehner relented, Democrats refused to budge and the federal government shut down.

The bill delays a new Department of Labor rule that would prevent financial advisers from stealing from your 401(K) plans or IRAs. Allowing financial advisers to rip you off is a great complement to that other plank in the Republican-Conservadem retirement insecurity platform, cutting Social Security.

Here's David Dayen with more details:

The Labor Department proposal, known as the “fiduciary rule,” would change the ethical standards by which employer-based retirement products like 401(k)’s and IRAs are marketed and sold. The rule has not been updated since 1975, before 401(k)’s and IRAs even existed. The Labor Department wants to broaden the definition of a “fiduciary” to cover all financial advisers who offer individual investment advice for a fee. Under the rule, they would be legally required to work in the best interest of their clients. For example, a fiduciary would not be able to push investment products on customers in which they have a financial stake. The agency defines the goal of the proposal as “to ensure that potential conflicts of interest among advisers are not allowed to compromise the quality of investment advice that millions of American workers rely on, so they can retire with the dignity that they have worked hard to achieve.” ... Currently, it is depressingly common for financial advisers, more than 80 percent of whom are not fiduciaries, to self-deal when offering advice. First off, they obtain large fees from the retirement products they sell. According to the think tank Demos, a median-income, two-earner household will pay $155,000 during their lifetime to financial advisers on average. (The lifetime gains for two-earner households from retirement accounts are around $230,000, meaning that nearly two-thirds of the profits go to the industry.) Second, non-fiduciary financial advisers can enjoy kickbacks; right now there is no rule against an adviser from a mutual fund company encouraging clients to put their money in specific funds sold by that company. In fact, that’s the norm, and the adviser typically receives a commission for the sale. Conflicts of interest like this cost retirement investors at least $1 billion a month, because the funds they get channeled into underperform the alternatives. Financial advisers also encourage rollovers into high-cost IRAs when an individual changes jobs. None of these schemes have to be disclosed to the customer, under the current standard. The National Bureau for Economic Research found in a recent study that “adviser self‐interest plays an important role in generating advice that is not in the best interest of the clients.” So in the middle of a retirement crisis, when the majority of Americans already aren’t accumulating the savings they need to maintain their standard of living, sellers of retirement products are skimming close to $60 billion a year off the top through deceptive practices, making a bad situation even worse.

Now that we know what it is, let's move to the next question: Who voted for it?

The House voted 257 to 167 to send the measure to Obama for his signature; the vote came less than 24 hours after the Senate overwhelmingly approved the legislation.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and most other top GOP leaders took no public position on the measure and offered no public comment before the 10:45 p.m. vote. Boehner declined even to deliver his usual closing argument, leaving House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) to defend the measure as the “largest tax cut in American history.”

The bill will indeed shield millions of middle-class taxpayers from tax increases set to take effect this month. But it also will let rates rise on wages and investment profits for households pulling in more than $450,000 a year, marking the first time in more than two decades that a broad tax increase has been approved with GOP support.

The measure also will keep benefits flowing to 2 million unemployed workers on the verge of losing their federal checks. And it will delay for two months automatic cuts to the Pentagon and other agencies that had been set to take effect Wednesday.

View Graphic The impact of tax increases on taxpayers

Many economists had warned that the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts would have plunged the economy back into recession.

Conservatives complained bitterly that the legislation would raise taxes without making any significant cuts in government spending. For much of the day, the measure appeared headed for defeat as Boehner contemplated tacking on billions in spending cuts, a move that would have derailed a compromise that the White House and Senate leaders had carefully crafted.

In the end, GOP lawmakers decided not to take a gamble that could force the nation to face historic tax increases for virtually every American — and leave House Republicans to take the blame.

“I don’t know if playing chicken with the American people at this point is in the best interest of the people,” said freshman Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.).

The bill drew 85 votes from Republicans and 172 from Democrats, meaning well more than half of its support came from the Democratic minority.

With 151 Republicans voting “no,” the GOP tally fell far short of a majority of the GOP caucus. That broke a long-standing preference by Boehner to advance only bills that could draw the support of a majority of his Republican members.

In a sign of the moment’s gravity, Boehner himself cast a rare vote: He supported the bill. So did Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), the GOP’s vice-presidential candidate last year, who parted ways from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a potential 2016 presidential contender, who voted against the measure.

But other top GOP leaders voted no, including Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).

Boehner was humiliated just two weeks ago when the Republican rank-and-file refused to support a GOP alternative that would have permitted taxes to rise only on income over $1 million a year. But when he scheduled a vote on the Senate bill, even some of the chamber’s staunchest conservatives agreed that giving up the fight was probably the best course.

In a brief statement, Obama praised congressional leaders for advancing the legislation, which he said would produce $620 billion in new tax revenue. “But I think we all recognize this law is just one step in the broader effort to strengthen our economy and broaden opportunity for everybody,” he said, noting that the fight over the budget will continue when the new Congress faces the imposition of sequestration cuts in just two months.

But Obama warned again that he would not negotiate with Republicans over the $16.4 trillion debt limit, which must be raised in the coming weeks. “While I will negotiate over many things,” he said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether they will pay the bills they’ve already racked up.”

With that, Obama took off for Hawaii, where he left his wife and daughters the day after Christmas. It was unclear when he planned to sign the fiscal cliff measure, which calls for the top tax rate to rise immediately from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on income over $450,000 for married couples and $400,000 for single people.

The measure will protect more than 100 million families earning less than $250,000 a year from significant income tax increases set to take effect this month — although their payroll taxes will rise with the expiration of a temporary tax cut adopted two years ago.

In addition to avoiding much of the fiscal cliff, the measure will extend federal dairy policies through September, averting a threatened doubling of milk prices. The measure also will cancel a scheduled pay raise for members of Congress.

After weeks of partisan bickering over whether taxes should increase for anyone, the compromise bill rolled through the Senate early Tuesday in a highly unusual New Year’s Day vote. The vote was 89 to 8, with both parties offering overwhelming support.

The moment served as a rare bipartisan coda to what has been one of the most rancorous, partisan Congresses in recent history. The 11 senators who are retiring received hugs and kisses from their colleagues. The current Congress ends at noon Thursday, when the new Congress will be seated, and lawmakers would have been forced to scrap the fiscal-cliff legislation and start over.

Three Democrats voted against the measure, including liberal Tom Harkin (Iowa), and moderates Thomas R. Carper (Del.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.).

Bennet complained that the bill would do little to reduce record budget deficits. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the measure would cause the national debt to be $4 trillion higher by 2022 than if all of the cliff’s tax increases and spending cuts had been allowed to take effect.

Five Senate Republicans also rejected the measure, including tea party favorites Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah).

But 40 others voted for it, including such GOP leaders on tax-and-spending policy as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Ronald H. Johnson (Wis.), a tea party star who frequently consults with House conservatives.

Neither party was entirely happy with the bill. While conservatives complained about new taxes and a lack of spending reductions, liberals complained about its provisions regarding inherited estates.

Although the tax rate will rise from 35 percent to 40 percent, estates worth as much as $5 million — $10 million for married couples — will go untaxed. And an inflation adjustment will guarantee that the size of the exemption will grow to $15 million for couples by the end of the decade.

Still, House Democrats largely embraced the measure, which was negotiated by Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and endorsed by Obama. After receiving a point-by-point 90-minute briefing from Biden on Tuesday, Democrats rallied around the package.

“It’s long overdue for us to have this solution to go forward and remove all doubt as to what comes next for our country,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

But it was a different story among House Republicans, who at first appeared to strongly oppose it. In the early afternoon, the GOP gathered for the first of two lengthy closed-door briefings in the basement of the Capitol.

There, Boehner told members that he wanted to hear their views but would not take a position. Cantor, meanwhile, “forcefully” aired concerns that the measure would raise taxes but not cut spending, said Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Afterward, Cantor emerged and told reporters: “I do not support the bill.”

That view was widespread in the room, where House members vented their frustrations at the Senate for foisting the arrangement upon them. Many rose to say they should take advantage of the legislative process, tack on billions in new spending reductions and force the Senate to respond.

“We should not take a package put together by a bunch of sleep-deprived octogenarians on New Year’s Eve,” retiring Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio) said in a dig at Senate leaders. LaTourette, who has championed ambitious deficit-reduction efforts, faced the prospect of casting his last vote in Congress for a measure that would sharply deepen deficits.

Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) said a consensus was developing that the GOP should amend the Senate’s plan. “I would be shocked if the bill did not go back to the Senate,” he said.

The negative reaction threatened to plunge Washington back into the high-stakes, last-minute drama that has characterized both the fiscal-cliff negotiations and a series of other recent confrontations between the two parties over spending and taxes, including the fight over raising the federal borrowing limit in the summer of 2011.

Senate Democrats and administration officials warned that the Senate would reject any move to amend the measure. The House would be responsible for a dive over the cliff hours before U.S. financial markets were set to open Wednesday after the New Year’s holiday.

For hours, there was no decision on how to proceed. As leaders huddled, rank-and-file members returned to their offices and were greeted with confusing messages from conservatives and constituents.

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has opposed any deal to raise taxes, voiced support for Cantor. But conservative writer William Kristol, wrote a blog post titled “Say Yes to the Mess.”

“Politically, Republicans are escaping with a better outcome than they might have expected, and President Obama has gotten relatively little at his moment of greatest strength,” Kristol said, advising House Republicans to take the deal.

Shortly before dinner, Republicans gathered behind closed doors again to settle on a new plan: Leaders would survey members about the spending-cut package to determine if it could pass. If not, they would allow the Senate bill to move ahead.

Around 8 p.m., they announced a decision. The Senate bill would receive a vote, with the expectation that Democrats and Republicans would join forces to approve the measure.

During floor debate, Camp, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said GOP members should support the bill because it would make “permanent tax policies Republicans originally crafted” under President George W. Bush.

Rep. Sander M. Levin (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, countered that Democrats should back the bill because it would let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy, breaking the “iron barrier” to tax increases since 1993.

Republicans in Congress have been pressuring regulators for years to exempt derivatives that U.S. companies sell overseas from the new rules set by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. For much of 2013, the deregulatory drive enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, with lawmakers casting their efforts as an attempt to harmonize U.S. law with international regulations. But financial reform advocates have attacked the initiative for padding Wall Street profits at the expense of important public protections, and Democratic support has eroded.

In June, the House passed a bill that would completely exempt from U.S. oversight derivatives sold through the nine most popular foreign derivatives jurisdictions. The legislation is occasionally derided as the ""London Whale Loophole Act"" on Capitol Hill -- a reference to the overseas trades that cost JPMorgan Chase more than $6 billion in 2012. London was the epicenter of much of the derivatives trading by U.S. financial firms leading up the 2008 crash, including AIG's infamous Financial Products division. If banks can simply route trades through loosely regulated overseas affiliates, financial reform advocates warn, the most critical aspects of Dodd-Frank will be effectively nullified.

The ""London Whale Loophole Act"" faces opposition from Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama, so it's unlikely to be signed into law. But June's House Agriculture Committee funding bill has much stronger prospects for passage, since it's tied to approximately $19 billion in other spending. That bill would require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -- the agency with responsibility for more than 90 percent of the derivatives market -- to negotiate its regulations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the remainder of the derivatives business.

Big banks have railed against the CFTC guidelines for taking a broad view of what constitutes an American firm. The SEC's proposed rule, by contrast, would bar American regulators from overseeing many offshore partnerships run by U.S. firms, and many trades between U.S. firms and overseas companies. Forcing the CFTC to negotiate with the SEC would almost certainly introduce loopholes into the CFTC's rules, and may shut down the rulemaking process altogether.



""The House bill is nothing more than a backdoor way of killing derivatives reform,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets. ""It's Christmas in July for Wall Street.""



Prior to Dodd-Frank, derivatives trades were essentially secret deals between two companies, with no market or regulatory scrutiny. The 2010 law required companies to trade through a third party that guaranteed each side’s ability to make good on its bets. To buttress the guarantee, each side of the trade was required to post margin -– a small upfront deposit just in case the trade went bad. An offshoring loophole would allow firms to evade these requirements, provided they meet the technical definitions of the loophole.



While Wall Street has pursued multiple avenues to derail the CFTC’s rule, some Senate Democrats cautioned that even the more aggressive regulatory interpretation may ultimately undermine the essence of Dodd-Frank.



Eight Democratic senators, organized by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), on Wednesday signed a letter to CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC Chairman Mary Jo White stating that both the CFTC and the SEC have failed to deal with shadowy financial entities “sponsored” by U.S. banks without any explicit legal guarantee for their obligations.



This type of arrangement was common in the years leading up to the 2008 crash. Citigroup held nearly $50 billion in complex derivatives off its official balance sheet in so-called structured investment vehicles, and Bear Stearns operated risky hedge funds that it officially had no financial obligations to. The financial crisis began in August 2007 when two such Bear Stearns funds failed, and the company decided to pay off its investors rather than take the damage to its reputation from leaving clients out to dry. By the fall of 2008, Citi had decided to suck up its losses on structured investment vehicles, rather than signal to the market it was incapable of doing so.

""A U.S.-based firm should not be able to escape U.S.-mandated swaps oversight simply because its swaps trading is conducted through an offshore affiliate or branch,"" the letter from the Democratic senators reads. ""It is likely that, if your agencies’ current proposals were adopted, foreign firms doing business with the foreign affiliate of a U.S.-based derivatives dealer would opt to forego an explicit guarantee from the U.S.-based entity in return for: (1) more favorable pricing, and (2) the ability to avoid U.S. trading regulations and any attendant costs.""

Both the CFTC and SEC standards would allow an offshore fund organized by a U.S. bank that formally rejected any responsibility for the fund’s solvency to evade American oversight. Reform watchdogs said they worry that U.S. firms will simply route much of their derivatives business through these nebulous entities, leaving the financial system to operate much as it did in the years before the crash.

John Thune: President Obama is late submitting budget to Congress He says White House isn't serious about government living by a budget He says higher taxes, more regulations, higher debt are hurting economic recovery Thune: Recovery from recession under Obama is much slower than under Reagan

(CNN) —

As the House and the Senate debated and passed budgets recently, one person was notably absent from the debate: President Barack Obama.

For the fourth time in five years, the president is late submitting his budget to Congress. So late, in fact, this year both the House and Senate were forced to move forward without him, rendering the president’s budget request completely irrelevant.

Unfortunately, the president’s tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting. Families and businesses have to ensure that their spending, including their debt payments, doesn’t exceed their income, but the president acts as if he doesn’t think that should apply to the federal government.

Recently, when speaking about his budget (which the White House says will be out next week, a full two months after the deadline), the president said that he didn’t want “to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.” Well, perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy.

For four years now, the president’s agenda has been out-of-control spending, massive tax hikes on Americans and burdensome regulations on job creators. Since the president took office, we’ve seen more than $1.7 trillion in new tax hikes, $518 billion in new regulations, and $6 trillion added to the national debt.

The impact of those policies has not been pretty.

Economic growth under this president has averaged just 0.8%. That isn’t anywhere close to the 5% growth needed for a real recovery.

While it’s certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy, it’s important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago. What has he been doing since?

Let’s put this in perspective. Ronald Reagan inherited a bad economy. But Reagan put in place growth-oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations, which turned the economy around.

During the Reagan recovery, the economy grew nearly three times as fast as it has under Obama’s watch. During the fourth year of Reagan’s presidency, the economy experienced robust 7.2% growth. In contrast, the fourth year of Obama’s presidency produced economic growth of just 2.2%. If the Obama recovery were as strong as Reagan’s, our economy would be $1.5 trillion larger today – meaning more jobs, more opportunity, and more take-home pay for Americans.

The fact is Obama’s spending, tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery, jobs and opportunity.

Just take the president’s $2.6 trillion health care overhaul signed into law three years ago. The Federal Reserve recently issued a report stating employers in several regions are laying off workers and cutting back on new hires as a direct result of the president’s health care law.

Four years into the president’s term, 12 million Americans are still out of work and the labor force participation rate has declined to 63.5%. Americans are becoming so discouraged in the Obama economy that they simply stop looking for work. If the labor force participation rate today were the same as when the president took office, the real unemployment rate would be 10.7%.

Yet despite the abysmal failures of the president’s policies, he continues to argue for more of the same.

It’s time to try something new: Time to balance the budget, rein in Washington’s dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the Obama administration, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. It’s time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all Americans.

We should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president’s policies and economic growth. The president’s tax hikes, runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery.

It’s time for the president to get out of the way of the American people and let our economy take off. It’s time to do better than 0.8% growth.

Paul Ryan (R-WI) for his “outrageous attitude” toward the sacrifices those in the armed forces have made.

Appearing on Fox & Friends on Saturday, Jessie Jane Duff, who is at the E7 level, said Ryan, who brokered the deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-WI), does not realize that many active duty military personnel go back to civilian life “broke” and “without a job” and have difficulty getting on equal footing with their “civilian counterparts.” She noted that many veterans have had to leave the armed forces early due to injuries or are suffering from things like PTSD.

The deal Obama signed includes a provision that would “pare down annual cost of living increases in benefits for military retirees under age 62, saving the government an estimated $6.3 billion over a decade.” What that means is a sergeant first class at the E7 level like Duff who retires at age 42 would lose $72,000 in benefits over a lifetime, according to a Fox News analysis.

She said that Ryan was “misleading” Americans into believing that veterans were getting a pay increase by using accounting tricks and lingo when in fact they are not.

Duff, of Concerned Veterans for America, said Ryan was screwing over the types of veterans who were deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq and said it was “outrageous” for Ryan to claim that the benefits were “extremely generous.” She emphasized that not enough people in Congress have served in the military, and they are out of touch with Americans who have served or have family members in the armed forces.

Multiple bills have been introduced in the House to undo the cuts."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-malanga-pensions-california-20130224,0,60801.story",2013-02-24 08:00:00,[],California’s sad pension saga,"When California’s government employee pension system was established in 1932, it was a model of restraint. Private-sector pensions were still rare then, but California lawmakers had a particular reason for wanting a public-sector pension system: Without one, unproductive older workers had an incentive to stay on the job and just “go through the motions” to get a paycheck, as a 1929 state commission put it. Pensions would encourage those workers to retire. The commission cautioned, however, against setting a retirement age so low that it would “encourage or permit the granting of any retirement allowance to an able-bodied person in middle life.”

Accordingly, California set its initial retirement age for state workers (and, beginning in 1939, for local government employees) at 65, at a time when the average 20-year-old entering the workforce could expect to live for another 46 years, until age 66. The system’s first pensions were modest, though far from miserly. An employee’s pension equaled 1.43% of his average salary over his last five years on the job, multiplied by the total number of years he had worked. That formula typically provided longtime workers with pensions equal to half or more of their final salaries.

The pensions were funded by three sources: contributions from employers (that is, state and local governments); contributions from employees (though some governments opted to cover that expense); and money that the pension fund would gain by investing those contributions. With the 1929 stock market crash in mind, California opted for a cautious investment approach.

“An unsound system,” the 1929 commission warned, would be “worse than none.” The employees’ contributions were fixed, so if investment returns weren’t sufficient to fund the promised pensions, the employers’ contributions would have to increase to make up the difference.

In the decades since, that cautious approach has been virtually abandoned as public employee unions have taken control of the system. The retirement age has been lowered, benefits have been increased and investments have become far riskier.

The major changes began in the late ‘60s, during a time of rapidly growing public-sector union power. In 1968, the Legislature added one of the most expensive of all retirement perks — annual cost-of-living adjustments — to CalPERS pensions. Other enhancements followed, including, in 1970, a far more generous pension formula that would allow an employee who worked for 40 years to retire at 60 and collect an annual pension equal to 80% of his salary. If he kept working for another five years, his pension fattened to 90%. In 1983, public safety workers got an even better pension formula, and the age at which they could start collecting was dropped to 55.

Not surprisingly, the costs of the enlarged pensions weighed heavily on California’s budget. In 1991, with the nation mired in a recession and the state in a fiscal crisis, the Legislature closed the existing pension system to new workers, for whom it created a second tier. This less-expensive plan no longer required workers to make pension contributions, and it lowered the value of the pension to 1.25% of final average salary for every year worked; further, a worker couldn’t begin to receive the pension until age 65.

But that economy lasted only until 1999, when the fund’s board concocted an astonishing proposal that would take all the post-1991 state employees and retroactively put them in the older, more expensive pension system. The initiative went further, lowering the retirement age for all state workers and sweetening the pension formula for police and firefighters even more.

CalPERS wrote the legislation for these changes and then persuaded lawmakers to pass it. In pushing for the change, though, the pension fund downplayed the risks involved. A brochure about the proposal that CalPERS handed to legislators read like a pitch letter, not a serious fiscal analysis. It didn’t mention that state law protected government pensions, so that taxpayers would be on the hook for any shortfall in pension funding. In essence, the CalPERS position was that government workers should carry zero risk, sharing the bounty when the fund’s investments did well but losing nothing if investments went south.

During that period, many local governments tried to keep pace with the state, allowing earlier retirements, raising the percent of income paid upon retirement and decreasing contributions from employees.

The retirement system’s projections that it could afford all these changes relied on an 8% return on the money it held, which proved impossible, in part because of the economic downturn and in part because of bad investment decisions. That has left governments on the hook to meet the shortfalls. CalPERS has delayed much of the reckoning by shifting costs down the line, but that only means government budgets are likely to be enslaved to pension debt for decades to come.

Already, local governments are taking a huge hit. Glendale, for example, has seen its annual pension bill rocket from $1.3 million in 2003 to $13.7 million in 2007. San Jose’s tab almost doubled, from $73 million in 2001 to $122 million in 2007, and then rose even faster over the next three years, hitting a jaw-dropping $245 million in 2010. San Bernardino’s annual pension obligations rose from $5 million in 2000 to about $26 million last year. The state budget took a massive hit too: Its pension costs lurching from $611 million in 2001 to $3.5 billion in 2010.

In August, California did pass modest pension reforms, which apply mostly to workers hired starting this year. But Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to reshape the board of CalPERS in a way that would have made it more responsive to taxpayer concerns did not make it into the reform legislation.

CalPERS’ advocacy for higher benefits and its poor investment performance in recent years have locked in long-term debt in California and driven up costs, problems for which there are no easy solutions. As former Schwarzenegger administration economic advisor David Crane, a Democrat, has said of the fund’s managers and board: “They are desperate to keep truths hidden.”

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-vote-ok-85-billion-210201607.html,,[],"Senate vote: OK $85 billion cuts, avert shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved legislation Wednesday to lock in $85 billion in widely decried spending cuts aimed at restraining soaring federal deficits — and to avoid a government shutdown just a week away. President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats rejected a call to reopen White House tours scrapped because of the tightened spending.

Federal meat inspectors were spared furloughs, but more than 100 small and medium air traffic facilities were left exposed to possible closure as the two parties alternately clashed and cooperated over proposals to take the edge off across-the-board spending cuts that took effect on March 1.

Final House approval of the measure is likely as early as Thursday. Obama's signature is a certainty, meaning the cuts will remain in place at least through the end of the budget year on Sept. 30 — even though he and lawmakers in both parties have criticized them as random rather than targeted. Obama argued strongly against them in campaign-style appearances, predicting painful consequences, before they began taking effect, and Republicans objected to impacts on Pentagon spending.

Without changes, the $85 billion in cuts for the current year will swell to nearly $1 trillion over a decade, enough to make at least a small dent in economy-threatening federal deficits but requiring program cuts that lawmakers in both parties say are unsustainable politically. As a result, negotiations are possible later in the year to replace the reductions with different savings.

The administration as well as Republicans picked and chose its spots in arguing for flexibility in this year's cuts.

""My hope is that gets done,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said earlier in the week of the effort to prevent layoffs among inspectors that could disrupt the nation's food supply chain. ""If it does not, come mid-July we will furlough meat inspectors,"" he added, departing from the administration's general position that flexibility should ease all the cuts or none at all.

Story continues

Nor did the White House resist a bipartisan plan to prevent any cut in tuition assistance programs for members of military.

The final vote was 73-26, with 51 Democrats, 20 Republicans and two independents in favor and 25 Republicans and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana opposed.

Political considerations were on ample display in both houses as lawmakers labored over measures relating to spending priorities, both for this year and a decade into the future.

Rep. Mark Mulvaney, R-S.C., said he had wanted the House to vote on Obama's own budget, but he noted the president hadn't yet released one. ""It's with great regret ... that I'm not able to offer"" a presidential budget for a vote, he said. He added he had wanted to vote on a placeholder — ""34 pages full of question marks"" — but House rules prevented it.

Minority Democrats advanced a plan that calls for $1 trillion in higher taxes, $500 billion in spending cuts over a decade and a $200 billion economic stimulus package. Republicans voted it down, 253-165.

They are expected to approve their own very different blueprint on Thursday.

It calls for $4.6 trillion in spending cuts over a decade and no tax increases, a combination that projects to a balanced budget in 10 years' time. That spending plan would indeed be simply a blueprint, lacking any actual control over federal spending.

The issues were grittier in the Senate, where lawmakers grappled with the immediate impact of across-the-board cuts on individual programs.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a deficit hawk, said he wanted to reopen the White House tours, shut down since earlier in the month. He said his proposal would take about $8 million from the National Heritage Partnership Program and apply it toward ""opening up the tours at the White House, opening up Yellowstone National Park and the rest of the national parks.""

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters previously the decision the cancel the White House tours was made by the Secret Service because ""it would be, in their view, impossible to staff those tours; that they would have to withdraw staff from those tours in order to avoid more furloughs and overtime pay cuts.""

But in remarks on the Senate floor, Coburn said, ""This is a Park Service issue, not a Secret Service issue.""

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the funds involved in Coburn's amendment would not go to the Secret Service, and as a result the tours ""would not be affected."" He also said the Heritage program, a public-private partnership, helps produce economic development and should not be cut.

The vote was 54-45 against the proposal. Montana Sen. Max Baucus, whose state borders on Yellowstone National Park, was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans.

The Park Service has announced some parks may open late to automobile traffic this spring because budget cuts have reduced funds available to clear roads of winter snow.

The overall legislation locks in the $85 billion in spending cuts through the end of the budget year, yet provides several departments and agencies with flexibility in coping with them. It extends flexibility to the Pentagon, the departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Justice, State and Commerce and the Food and Drug Administration.

But bipartisanship has its limits, and in private negotiations Republicans rejected Democratic attempts to provide flexibility for the rest of the government.

That set off a scramble among lawmakers to round up support for changes on a case-by-case basis.

The provision to prevent furloughs for federal meat inspectors had the support of industry as well as from both sides of the political aisle and cleared without a vote. It was supported by Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat seeking re-election next year, and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who quietly helped Democrats round up the votes they needed to clear the legislation over a procedural hurdle.

The effect was to transfer $55 million to the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service from other accounts within the department, including deferred maintenance.

""Without this funding, every meat, poultry, and egg processing facility in the country would be forced to shut down for up to two weeks,"" said Blunt. ""That means high food prices and less work for the hardworking Americans who work in these facilities nationwide.""

In contrast to Blunt, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, opposed Democrats when they sought to overcome procedural hurdles earlier in the week.

In the days since, he repeatedly refused to let the bill advance unless he was given a chance to cancel about $50 million in cuts aimed at contract employees at more than 170 air traffic facilities around the country. In the end, his amendment was jettisoned without a vote."

Mission accomplished. Why so many long faces?

Advertisement

President Obama and congressional Republicans went through their first round of cutting in 2011, shaving about $1.5 trillion from federal spending. The “fiscal cliff” deal in January brought another $720 billion, mostly in higher taxes on the wealthy.

Now the automatic spending reduction package known as the sequester is projected to cut spending by about another $1 trillion over the decade, with some $85 billion coming this year. Those changes in spending and taxes will save the government an additional $700 billion in interest over the decade by reducing the need to borrow money, bringing the overall total to more than $3.9 trillion.

Earlier cuts have already had an effect. Although polls show that most Americans think the federal deficit is still growing — almost 2 in 3 people said so in a recent Bloomberg poll — the opposite is true: The deficit hit its peak in 2008 and has begun to shrink rapidly.

Red ink totaled $1.2 trillion last year, will fall to about $900 billion this year and will drop to about $476 billion by the end of Obama’s second term, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Though still a large number, that’s less than 3% of the huge U.S. economy, a share below the level most economists consider threatening.

Advertisement

No one expected that achieving a deficit reduction target would prompt a parade. As politicians know, the public disdains deficits in theory, but in practice has a greater dislike for both spending cuts and tax increases. Still, as the sequester put the final piece of the $4-trillion deficit reduction into place, the reaction among both Republicans and Democrats was notable for its bitterness.

Three reasons underlie the negativity. They involve process, timing and the ultimate goal each side seeks to reach. Those disagreements seem likely to shape continued squabbles over federal spending and taxes for at least the next two years and possibly throughout Obama’s second term, starting with a deadline at the end of this month that could lead to a partial government shutdown. (Both sides seem to want to avoid that.)

Advertisement

The process some on both sides had envisioned was the much-discussed “grand bargain” in which Democrats would agree to cut Medicare and, perhaps, Social Security in exchange for Republican agreement on a tax increase.

In August 2011, Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) failed to reach such a deal. Instead, both sides agreed to the sequester as a backup, gambling that they wouldn’t need it. Republicans bet they would win the 2012 presidential election and be able to enact their own budget solutions. Obama believed that if he won reelection, the Republican “fever” to oppose tax increases would abate.

Advertisement

Both lost their bets. Republican opposition to taxes has only hardened as the party has found itself divided and besieged on other issues after Obama’s reelection. The president forced Republicans to accept the tax increase contained in January’s fiscal cliff deal because he gave them no choice — not acting meant an even bigger tax hike. Since then, Obama has offered up cuts in Medicare and Social Security cost-of-living adjustments that Republicans had sought, but Republican leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to more tax revenue.

Now, Obama has largely given up on reaching a large-scale deal with Republicans, according to former White House officials and others close to him. Where he once talked about the fever breaking, he now tells people that he thinks GOP legislators are unwilling to stand up to their most conservative voters and cannot reach a compromise.

Advertisement

The desire to step away from negotiations is not limited to his side of the aisle. Many Republican policy experts have similarly retreated, advising GOP lawmakers that until they recapture the White House, they can block Obama’s budget priorities but can’t expect to enact their own.

With both sides interested in moving on to other issues, the sequester seems likely to stay in place for the rest of the budget year, which ends Sept. 30, even though it embodies policies that both sides see as their second choice at best.

Advertisement

Both sides also dislike the cuts for a significant timing problem: They begin hitting now, when the economy remains weak, and will probably slow the recovery. At the same time, the cuts do very little to help with the bigger budget challenge down the road.

Sometime in the next president’s tenure, deficits probably will start worsening again. About 40 million more Americans are expected to become eligible for Medicare and Social Security by the end of the decade as baby boomers retire, and as they move onto the rolls, costs will rise fast.

Advertisement

But the political system deals poorly with issues that will come to a head in some future president’s term. Moreover, the size of the problem remains uncertain, dependent on how fast the economy grows and how much healthcare costs rise. Recent data have shown healthcare inflation slowing substantially, causing the budget office to reduce cost estimates by about 15%, or some $200 billion.

No one knows whether that good news on healthcare is permanent, but already it has made liberal Democrats less willing to consider big changes in Medicare right away.

Advertisement

The mistrust each side feels for the other makes a big deal even less likely.

Many Democrats fear Republicans would simply dismantle Medicare if given an opportunity. Republicans feel Democrats lack a sense of responsibility about the government’s long-range financial situation and will spend the government into crisis. And each is unwilling to give up its ideological goals — for Republicans, a smaller government; for Democrats, a more protective one.

All that helps account for Washington’s budget gloom.

As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress last week, “Significant progress has been made recently toward reducing the federal budget deficit over the next few years.” By contrast, “the difficult process of addressing longer-term fiscal imbalances has only begun.”

Steve Stockman says that he not only ""debunked"" the claim that poor families could go hungry if Congress cuts billions in funding for food stamps, but that the program could use an additional 12% cut.

Being poor is easy, especially when you’re not. Or at least that seems to be the lesson from a Republican House aide’s experiment with the Food Stamp Challenge.

On Tuesday, Donny Ferguson—the communications director and agriculture policy adviser for Texas Rep. Steve Stockman—”debunked” the claim that poor families would go hungry if Congress cut billions in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), according to a statement by Stockman’s office. In order to prove his point, Ferguson spent a week living off a food budget of only $31.50, roughly a quarter of the $133.42 which the average food stamp recipient receives in a month.

“I wanted to personally experience the effects of the proposed cuts to food stamps,” said Ferguson in the statement. “I didn’t plan ahead or buy strategically, I just saw the publicity stunt and made a snap decision to drive down the street and try it myself. I put my money where my mouth is, and the proposed food stamp cuts are still quite filling.”

Ferguson’s self-imposed $31.50 food budget emulated a similar challenge undertaken by 26 House Democrats last week. But those lawmakers took on the challenge as a way of protesting the $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP benefits currently being debated in the House.

“Feeding a family on SNAP is difficult as it is, and it would become virtually impossible if these cuts are implemented,” said Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif., in a statement. “That is why I am taking the SNAP Challenge to promote awareness for hunger and highlight the importance of this critical program.”

But according to Ferguson, there’s plenty of room for cuts.

“Not only did I buy a week’s worth of food on what Democrats claim is too little, I have money left over,” he said. “Based on my personal experience with SNAP benefit limits we have room to cut about 12% more.”

New York City Coalition Against Hunger executive director Joel Berg, who has undergone similar challenges twice, called Ferguson’s claims “preposterous.”

“If he’d like to swap lives with a food stamp recipient for a year, I can find 47 million people who would like to take him up on that offer,” he said. The problem is that living on a SNAP-level budget does not provide any sense of what it’s truly like to rely on the program.

“The longer you do this, the harder it is to do, the harder it is to make time to shop, and the further you go into debt,” said Berg. SNAP benefits are allotted monthly, and the average recipient usually runs low on funds after the second week.

In part, that’s because the average recipient isn’t young, healthy, single and employed. About 47% of all households receiving SNAP benefits include children, according to the USDA [PDF]. Additionally, 16.5% of households on food stamps include elderly individuals, and 20% of households include disabled people. Ferguson’s press release gives no indication that he’s feeding anyone other than himself.

“If he had kids, would he be proud feeding his family with what he bought? I suspect not,” said Berg, who noted that Ferguson’s shopping list included no fresh fruit or vegetables. “He seems to be promoting a pretty unhealthy diet, a strong recipe for heart disease and diabetes.”

Ferguson posted online a photo of his shopping receipts along with a spreadsheet of a meal-by-meal breakdown of what he ate during the week. Included in his shopping list were two liters of root beer, a large box of popsicles, eight cups of applesauce and two cans of refried beans.

“I could have bought cheaper vegetables instead of prepared red beans and rice, but I like red beans and rice,” said Ferguson in his statement. “Folks aren’t buying fast food instead of vegetables because of benefit limits, they’re buying fast food because fast food tastes great and vegetables taste like vegetables.”"

Schumer of New York said on Sunday.

The news of the day is obviously President Barack Obama's second inauguration, but yesterday on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) made some news of his own:On Friday, House Republicans waved the white flag of surrender on the debt limit, saying they would raise the ceiling as long as the Senate agreed to make their salary contingent on producing a budget. Technically, that's still a ransom demand, but it's like going from demanding all the gold at Fort Knox to demanding a $5 gift certificate at Glenn Beck's favorite gold e-tailer. Budget documents aren't the same as spending bills—guidelines for spending levels intended to control the budget-making process. They can also include reconciliation instructions, and as we saw with the passage of Obamacare, reconciliation allows the Senate to move forward on legislation without the threat of filibuster.

According to Schumer, Senate Democrats will use reconciliation instructions to provide guidance on tax hikes, allowing the Senate to completely bypass the filibuster. Of course, being able to avoid the filibuster doesn't much matter if House Republicans won't go along with tax increases, but check out this nugget from The New York Times:



A senior Republican tax aide confirmed that Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means chairman, planned to push forward this year with “revenue-neutral” tax reform, with the revenue target adjusted upward to the amount raised by the higher tax rates on the wealthy approved this month to resolve most of the so-called fiscal cliff. The Republican aide said if the Senate can approve tax changes that raise revenues, it is possible that difficult negotiations between the two chambers could produce a final deal that would produce more tax revenue – but not as much as the Senate wants.

Yes, that's just an anonymous aide, so take it with the appropriate level of skepticism, but I still think it's noteworthy that an anonymous GOP aide is dropping hints at accepting new tax revenues through tax reform. In light of the comments, if I had to guess how things will play out form here it'd be this: The sequester will get replaced by a deficit reduction package that includes some new revenue through tax reform, a matching amount of cuts to Social Security and Medicare (but not Medicaid) contingent on the success of tax reform, and a different set of domestic and defense discretionary cuts to replace the ones in the sequester (which won't be contingent on anything). When that package is done, it will effectively mean the ""Grand Bargain"" is achieved. Republicans will grumble, but won't push forward on government shutdown. The White House, meanwhile, will turn its focus from deficit reduction to other policy areas. Of course, that's just my prediction of what will happen. As always, I reserve the right to be wrong."

The heart of President Barack Obama’s speech Tuesday was the same focus on jobs and middle-class economic uncertainty that’s driven every State of the Union of his presidency.

But that was far from the only ground he covered.

The president reeled off a laundry list of small-bore proposals: He called on Congress to hike the minimum wage to $9 an hour and invest $50 billion on rebuilding roads and bridges. He proposed universal preschool for 4-year-olds and linking some federal grant decisions to research schools on their ability to keep tuition costs in check. And he urged Congress to put his full gun control agenda up for a vote.

5 things we learned from the State of the Union

Nearly every idea in his speech had a couple of things in common: Virtually all of them are core Democratic priorities presented in language that delighted the base. None of them were shoot-for-the moon ambitious. They were either old ideas repackaged or markedly modest new ones. And few if any of them are likely to become a reality under the current Congress.

State of the Union: More same old, same old

In a sharp contrast to his first address to Congress four years ago, the president paid lip service to bipartisanship, but he made clear that it was a luxury, not a driving priority. He invited Republicans to join him in a bipartisan effort… to back the Democratic policy vision.

If the speech came across more like a wish list than an action plan with a good chance of making it past the House, that’s because it was. Just laying the exhaustive string of liberal policy priorities seemed to be the point – a companion to the ideological offensive in his inauguration speech.

The top priority Tuesday wasn’t necessarily jobs, or guns, or climate change, or voting rights. It was the sum of all those parts, a liberal vision that Obama clearly hopes will nudge the country in that direction.

What Obama said

“It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead,” the president said. “It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few.”

The framing in Tuesday’s speech was designed to help the president score two wins: in the long term, a progressive legacy, and in the short run, an advantage in the budget battles and debt ceiling drama.

With the GOP laying responsibility for a looming sequester at the White House door, the president pointed to Republicans’ emphasis on the need for entitlement reform as proof that they’re laying the burden for deficit reduction on cops and teachers and seniors instead of “the wealthiest and most powerful.”

“Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan,” he said. “A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.”

Obama dares Congress to get the job done

It’s a message designed to resonate with working-class voters, and the Republican Party’s standard-bearer for the evening, Sen. Marco Rubio, countered with a mirror-image appeal to the same demographic.

“Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare,” Rubio said. “I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.”

Rubio says Obama would hurt the middle class

The approach was much the same as the president’s, an ideological vision unweighted by grand, ambitious plans to make it a reality.

In fact, for an exhaustive speech, Obama’s State of the Union was notably short on some key specifics.

The White House has so far brushed off calls for a price tag for the proposals in Tuesday’s speech, promising a full accounting when the president sends his next budget to Congress. But in the end, the policy details may be less important than the political timing. The White House and congressional Republicans remain locked in a brutal message war over the sequester, now just over two weeks away.

True, the president offered many good ideas. But we already know that almost none of those ideas will make it past a hostile House of Representatives.

On the other hand, the G.O.P. reply, delivered by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, was both interesting and revelatory. And I mean that in the worst way. For Mr. Rubio is a rising star, to such an extent that Time magazine put him on its cover, calling him “The Republican Savior.” What we learned Tuesday, however, was that zombie economic ideas have eaten his brain.

In case you’re wondering, a zombie idea is a proposition that has been thoroughly refuted by analysis and evidence, and should be dead — but won’t stay dead because it serves a political purpose, appeals to prejudices, or both. The classic zombie idea in U.S. political discourse is the notion that tax cuts for the wealthy pay for themselves, but there are many more. And, as I said, when it comes to economics it appears that Mr. Rubio’s mind is zombie-infested.

Start with the big question: How did we get into the mess we’re in?

The financial crisis of 2008 and its painful aftermath, which we’re still dealing with, were a huge slap in the face for free-market fundamentalists. Circa 2005, the usual suspects — conservative publications, analysts at right-wing think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute, and so on — insisted that deregulated financial markets were doing just fine, and dismissed warnings about a housing bubble as liberal whining. Then the nonexistent bubble burst, and the financial system proved dangerously fragile; only huge government bailouts prevented a total collapse."

It's not just Republicans/right-wingers/Tea Party people; there's a lot of Democrats/progressives/other left-leaning folks who apparently don't ""grok"" the concept either.

With that in mind--and at the risk of sounding patronizing--here's a very basic demonstration of the problem and the reality:

Here's a modified version of the current Federal Income Tax Brackets (I've rounded off the numbers to make it easier to follow):

Taxable Income / Tax Rate

$0 - $10,000 / 10%

$10,000 - $30,000 / 15%

$30,000 - $80,000 / 25%

$80,000 - $200,000 / 28%

$200,000 - $400,000 / 33%

More than $400,000 / 35%

So, let's suppose that someone made $80,000 (taxable) last year, but makes $80,001 (taxable) this year.

(Note: I'm not even getting into deductions and all the other stuff; I'm just talking about the end-of-the-line taxable income for simplicity's sake)

The folks I'm talking about THINK that they paid 25% in taxes last year ($20,000), and they THINK that this year, because they made $1 more (pushing them into the 28% tax bracket) that they're going to owe 28% on everything ($22,400).

That is, they think that they owe an extra $2,400 in taxes even though they only made $1 more in income, and therefore are going to lose $2,399.

However, they're wrong about both what they owed last year AND what they'll owe this year.

Last year, they owed:

10% on the first $10,000 = $1,000

15% on the next $20,000 = $3,000

25% on the next $50,000 = $12,500

= a grand total of $16,500

...as opposed to the $20,000 that they thought they owed.

This year, they'll owe:

10% on the first $10,000 = $1,000

15% on the next $20,000 = $3,000

25% on the next $50,000 = $12,500

28% on the next $1 = $0.28

= a grand total of $16,500.28

...or just $0.28 more than last year, not $2,400 more, and certainly not the $22,400 they thought they owed.

The same holds true at every level: You're only paying the higher rate on any income ABOVE the threshold in question, not on EVERYTHING.

Hope this helps some folks when talking to others, and hope I didn't come off as a dick in doing so...

http://apps.chicagotribune.com/bond-debt/about.html,,['Chicago Tribune'],Chicago Bond Debt,"Published Nov. 1, 2013, 11:55 p.m.

Over the course of eight months, Tribune reporters examined thousands of pages of documents — including city spending records, bond offerings, accountants' reports, tax certificates, land records and City Council proceedings — to analyze how the city of Chicago issues general obligation bonds and spends those funds.

The team built comprehensive databases to follow the money over years of city spending. Reporters also studied bond regulations and tax codes and spoke with a variety of financial and legal experts to fully understand the process, tax rules and best practices.

To examine borrowing, the Tribune examined documents and data on 49 separate bond series issued 2000 to 2012. Each of the series has separate principal amounts, or maturities, that come due at varying dates. Each maturity has an interest rate, or coupon, attached to it. That's the annual amount bondholders will earn on the principal.

In total, the deals accounted for $9.4 billion in principal. However, because many of the bonds carried coupon rates that were higher than what the market was offering, the city received additional income from the bonds, known as premiums. Those amounts, along with interest earned on the money before it was spent, brought the total amount of bond proceeds up to $9.8 billion.

The Tribune used offering documents given to investors, known as official statements, as well as pledges known as tax certificates, to collect information on the maturities, interest rates, duration and other characteristics of the bonds. The tax certificates are available only for tax-exempt bonds. Reporters also relied on reports from independent accountants, known as verification reports, to collect this information. Verification reports are only available on bond deals that include the refinancing of old debt.

The various documents were cross-checked for accuracy. In the rare cases when the amounts from the three documents did not match, the differences were slight. In those cases, reporters relied first on the tax certificates, then the verification reports and lastly the official statements. For taxable bonds that did not include refinancing, the Tribune used the official statements to collect data.

Reporters also used those documents to figure out how money was allocated. For example, proceeds from a single bond may be used to fund building projects or refinance old debt. Bond money is also used to pay closing costs and, in many cases, pay the first few years of interest owed, known as capitalized interest. Reporters gathered all of this information from the documents and entered it into a spreadsheet for analysis.

In addition to information on the bonds, the Tribune collected data on spending. To do this, reporters scanned paper records from the city's annual supplement to the comprehensive annual financial report, or CAFR, and then used a computer program to create a database of the records. However, the city stopped reporting this information in 2011. So reporters submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to the city seeking computerized records of the spending. The city provided 13 years of spending data that were aggregated by project and budget year.

When bond proceeds come in, the city places them into separate funds. The funds are designated as either capital or equipment. Capital funds are intended to pay for expenses related to building projects. Equipment funds are reserved for shorter-term purchases, such as vehicles, software and radios. Each fund is connected to a bond series. The city was unable to provide a key to describe which fund matched up to which bond series. So the Tribune used records from the city's CAFRs as well as its capital improvement program to match bond funds to specific series.

Reporters then ran queries on the data, sorting and categorizing the information by the type of expenditure. For example, $1 billion in bond proceeds went to judgments or other legal expenses. Other categories include landscaping, new police stations, police station rehab, street resurfacing and sidewalk construction.

To determine whether expenditures were short or long term, the Tribune turned to the tax certificates. Those documents include detailed charts on the city's plans to spend bond money. Included in the charts are determinations of economic life. Economic life is an accounting term that captures the length of time the city expects something to last. Any item from capital funds that had a useful life that was 10 years or less was determined to be short-term. All of the items from the equipment fund data provided by the city were included on the short-term list.

The Tribune did not include some spending from the capital funds in its short-term calculations, even though many of those items had economic lives that were 10 years or less. The reason: It was unclear whether items had been part of larger construction projects that have longer lives.

To check whether the economic life of the item was shorter than the duration of the bond, reporters matched the short-term expenditures to the earliest maturities of the bonds that paid for them. For example, the city often bought software with an economic life of six years using a bond in which the earliest maturity was 15 years.

In its list of short-term expenditures, the Tribune also included closing costs on the bonds, capitalized interest, the paying off of short-term bank loans and refinancing deals known as refunding bonds.

To determine whether a refunding bond was short term in nature, the Tribune analyzed annual payments on the bonds, known as debt service. Using verification reports from independent accountants, reporters compiled payments by year for the old bonds and, after aggregating them, compared them to the new bonds used to refinance them. For both the old bonds and the new bonds the newspaper calculated the present value of future dollars. This is a standard finance calculation that discounts the value of future dollars, which are affected by inflation. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because its purchasing power decreases as inflation increases.

Any refunding deal that will end up costing taxpayers more in the long run was deemed a short-term expense."

The Republican-controlled House on Tuesday passed a “fiscal cliff” deal that President Obama and the Senate had reached late Monday. The late-night vote completed a day in which the legislation had appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

President Obama and the Senate reached a sweeping deal late Monday that the Republican-controlled House began considering on Tuesday, setting up a late-night vote to complete a day in which the legislation appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

President Obama and the Senate reached a sweeping deal late Monday that the Republican-controlled House began considering on Tuesday, setting up a late-night vote to complete a day in which the legislation appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

The bill was 153 pages long. It was written only the day before, by Washington insiders working in the dark of night. It was crammed with giveaways and legislative spare parts: tax breaks for wind farms and racetracks. A change to nuclear-weapons policy. Government payments for cheese.

And, most significantly, the bill will raise taxes but do relatively little to cut government spending or the massive federal deficit.

To a tea-party-influenced crop of House Republicans, the bill to resolve the “fiscal cliff” crisis was everything they had wanted to change about the way Washington worked. Too rushed. Too bloated. Too secretive. Too expensive.

“There’s lots and lots of pork in this bill,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), one of its most outspoken opponents.

On Tuesday, however, it passed on their watch. After the Senate approved the compromise, it briefly appeared that the GOP-led House would rebel against the bill. But the threat faded: For many Republicans, it appeared, the risk of rejecting the bill — and courting economic calamity — outweighed their unhappiness with the bill’s contents.

Tax breaks for rum producers and racetrack owners are some of the growth that lawmakers have added to the ”Fiscal cliff” deal. The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold talks about some of the lesser known measures in the new legislation and how the deal could be blocked or amended. (The Washington Post)

The fiscal-cliff bargain had been worked out on the phone by Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), two 70-year-olds with a combined 68 years in office in Washington. They stepped in after President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried, and failed , to reach a far-reaching agreement to tackle the debt.

Instead, McConnell and Biden lowered their ambitions and cut a “small deal.” It will raise marginal tax rates only for a sliver of high-earning individuals and avert a massive budget cut by pushing it back for two months.

But “small” was really not the the best description. The bill carries a substantial cost.

Although it will raise some taxes, it also will extend the vast majority of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts, as well as loopholes for many businesses. In all, the bill will cause deficits to rise by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that estimated increase is based on the massive tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect without a resolution to the fiscal cliff.

House Republicans wanted the Bush tax cuts to be extended. But they had also wanted big spending cuts. To many conservatives among them, the bill looked like a massive failure of will.

“To pass something at 2 o’clock in the morning, when the senators didn’t even get a real good chance to look at it, we’re tired of that,” said Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), elected in 2010 and defeated in November. He faced the prospect of casting his final vote in Congress on this package.

“I think it’s important to do it right. There’s a lot of us who feel that way. This is what we did with Obamacare — now look what we’re living with,” Walsh said, referring to the health-care law. “We don’t want to do that again.”

The bill that McConnell and Biden crafted was also not small in a physical sense. It ran to more than 24,000 words of small type. And many of those words had nothing to do with the marquee controversies of the fiscal cliff.

Instead, McConnell and Biden had included Capitol Hill’s version of stowaways: “riders,” unrelated provisions, attached to this bill because somebody in power wanted badly for them to pass.

“It’s a train, leaving the station, as they used to say,” said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “Climb aboard and go for a ride.”

There were dozens of rider provisions that had nothing to do with the cliff. The renewable-energy industry got one worth $12 billion over 10 years. The owners of auto-racing tracks got one that will cost $78 million. A $1 million break will help coal-mining operations on Indian lands.

Another oddball provision dealt with excise taxes on imported rum, which the U.S. government mainly funnels to the territorial governments of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This deal said that arrangement will continue.

Nobody had said a word about excise taxes and rum on the floor of the House or the Senate in the two years since the provision was renewed the last time.

“I keep saying, let’s take the occasion to reform it,” said Pedro Pierluisi (D), Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in Congress. Pierluisi believes that too much of this money gets funneled back to rum distillers instead of being used for economic development. “It didn’t happen this time around.”

The list went on. One provision renews an Agriculture Department price-support program through which the government buys cheese and butter from dairy farmers. That averted not a fiscal cliff but a dairy cliff: Milk prices were set to rise sharply.

The bill also blocks a 0.5 percent cost-of-living pay increase for members of Congress, reversing parts of an executive order Obama issued last week — because Congress had yet to set the federal government’s pay scale for 2013.

Another provision dealt with nuclear weapons. It will alter a law setting conditions under which the president could reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Before, this could happen only after the president certified that Russia was abiding by its treaty obligations.

The bill changed “that” to “whether.” It was unclear on Tuesday which lawmaker had demanded this. Or, for that matter, why.

To many new House Republicans, this bill looked like the kind of overstuffed, underscrutinized monster they had promised to stop. In their “Pledge to America,” made before the 2010 elections, the GOP had promised to post every bill online for three days before it got a vote.

On Tuesday, with only a few hours to look at the Senate bill, House legislators complained that they had not begun to understand what McConnell and Biden had concocted.

“It’s the only responsible way to proceed: to make sure we see and understand what’s in the bill and what we’re voting on,” said Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.). “I think most of the American people would expect that. It’s how business should be done here in Washington, instead of being forced into a vote and finding out what’s in it later on.”

But in the end, Barletta voted for the bill. He had heard that Senate leaders were saying they wouldn’t vote on an amended House bill. The Senate had left the House with little choice: Accept this path to avert the cliff, or there would be no other.

“I’m not willing at this point to risk tax hikes to all Americans not knowing what the Senate will do,” he said. “We will have that fight over spending. No question.”"

After the failure of the House Republican leadership to find enough support for its latest proposal to end the fiscal crisis, the Senate’s Democratic and Republican leaders immediately restarted negotiations to find a bipartisan path forward. A spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Mr. Reid was “optimistic that an agreement is within reach” with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.

With so little time left, chances rose that a resolution would not be approved by Congress and sent to President Obama before Thursday, when the government is left with only its cash on hand to pay the nation’s bills.

“It’s very, very serious,” warned Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. “Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable.”"

If you don’t pay your mortgage, he said, you’re a “deadbeat.” You’ll find it harder to borrow in the future, and if you do get a loan, you’ll be paying a higher rate.

The problem is he’s not being scary enough. The consequences of a government default are truly terrifying. If he wants to get the House GOP off its collective behinds, he needs to tell the American people how terrifying. Here are five points he should have made:

1. “Do you have a floating rate loan? An adjustable mortgage or home-equity line? You’ll be paying more--possibly hundreds of dollars per month more.”

Advertisement

Adjustable rate loans are keyed ultimately to Treasury rates. Let’s say a default causes a spike in the index rate of half a percentage point--and it could be a lot more. On a $300,000 adjustable-rate mortgage every half-point increase in the rate will cost you nearly $100 more per month. Your credit card interest will rise too.

2. “Do you own stocks or equity mutual funds? Look out below.”

During the August 2011 debt-limit stalemate, stock prices fell by about 17%, according to a Treasury white paper on the effects of that crisis. They didn’t recover until well into 2012. Over the last few weeks, the S&P 500 index has fallen by 4% from its high Sept. 18. As the debt-limit deadline comes closer, expect for more losses. And if a default actually happens, the stock market drop could be twice or three times what was seen in 2011, when the country came close to a default but didn’t cross the line.

3. “Do you own money market funds? Expect a panic.”

These popular cash-like savings accounts are especially vulnerable to changes in short-term rates and to short-term panics. In 2008, the Treasury had to step in with a $50-billion guarantee to keep the funds from “breaking the buck""--that is, seeing their price per share falling below $1. This will be worse. Much worse. Money market fund investors should brace themselves.

4. “Saving for college or your retirement? You’ll have to wait a few years.”

The cratering of individual stock, bond, and savings accounts will mean horrific pain for Americans who are coming close to needing their nest eggs. There will be no escape. Stock markets will plunge, and bond markets will plunge. In 2008, people say their nest eggs slashed in value by almost half. If you need the money soon, you might have half of what you thought you had.

5. “Looking for a job? Fat chance.”

During the 2011 crisis, the Treasury observes, consumer confidence fell 22% and business confidence fell 3%. The credit markets seized up, making it impossible for small businesses to get loans for hiring or expansion. If you think it’s hard finding a job now, while we’re in a nominal recovery, wait till all your local businesses put their hiring plans on hold.

The most insane notion being bandied about by the tea party wing of the Republican Party is that a default would be no big deal. But as long as President Obama fails to communicate to all Americans the pure frightfulness of the consequences, they’ll go on saying that.

It would be a big deal, and every man, woman and child in the United States would feel it. There will be no safe harbor. It’s not just about rattling the financial markets. It’s us. President Obama needs to make sure every voter in every state hears the message."

Obama will announce Sylvia Mathews Burwell%27s nomination on Monday

Burwell runs the Walmart Foundation%2C the retail giant%27s philanthropic wing

Burwell has been credited with plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Obama on Monday will nominate Walmart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget director, a senior administration official said.

If confirmed by the Senate, Burwell would take the helm at the Office of Management and Budget at a time of heated budget battles between the White House and congressional Republicans. She would also bring more diversity to Obama's second-term Cabinet following criticism that many top jobs were going to white men.

The president will announce Burwell's nomination during a White House ceremony Monday morning, said the official, who requested anonymity in order to confirm the nomination ahead of Obama.

Burwell is a Washington veteran, having served as OMB's deputy director in the Clinton administration and chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Burwell currently runs the Walmart Foundation, the retail giant's philanthropic wing, and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.

The official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.

Burwell's nomination signals that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that took effect Friday. While the president has warned of dire consequences for the economy as a result of the cuts, the White House does not want to the standoff with Congress to keep the president from focusing on other second-term priorities, including filling out his Cabinet and pursuing stricter gun laws and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

Obama made quick work of filling key national security openings in his administration, but has been slower to fill other Cabinet openings, including the OMB post. Vacancies also remain at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commerce and Energy Departments, and the U.S. trade representative.

Burwell would replace acting OMB director Jeffrey Zients, a well-liked figure in the Obama administration, who has been discussed as a contender for other top jobs."

A recent inspector general audit suggests a full-blown crackdown on fraud could save $222 million a year.

The amount appears relatively small considering the government pays out roughly $70 billion in annual food stamps benefits. But negotiators will likely consider every penny of potential savings as they try to bridge the gap between the GOP-led House’s proposed $40 billion cut and the Democrat-led Senate’s $4.5 billion cut.

Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, are part of the larger farm bill but are being dealt with through the House’s separate Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity bill.

House Speaker John Boehner recently said the bill “strengthens one of our nation’s welfare programs for the neediest Americans … roots out waste, fraud and abuse, encourages able-bodied adults to find work and saves taxpayers more than $39 billion.”

Among the anti-fraud measures in the bill, also known as H.R. 3102, is one that requires states to get tough on households that repeatedly ask for replacement EBT cards, which have largely replaced food stamps or vouchers as the method by which Americans purchase food at stores.

Others focus on retail “trafficking” and provide funding for pilot programs that could potentially improve existing state-federal partnerships that “identify, investigate and reduce retailer fraud.”

Some question whether targeting fraud gives enough bang for the buck.

Kansas GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp points out that fraud accounts for a small percentage of spending for the food stamp program. Enrollment has increased by 70 percent since 2007 to serve more than 44 million low-income Americans, according to the 2012 Agriculture Department Office of Inspector General report.

“The massive growth in food stamp spending has little to do with fraud, and much more to do with a poorly designed welfare program,” Huelskamp, who has a doctorate in agriculture policy, told FoxNews.com. “We need true reform that transforms food stamps from a way of life -- and targets help to the truly needy.”

Senate Democrats are asking the negotiators, or conferees, to reject the steeper House cuts, arguing Congress should not balance the federal budget “on the backs of the most vulnerable.”

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, this week signed a letter along with 38 other chamber Democrats and independents urging the conferees to reject eligibility changes that would “prevent millions of children, seniors and families facing a constant struggle against hunger from accessing nutritious food.”

Aside from the cuts being considered on the Hill, recipients automatically had benefits cut starting Friday when funding increases included in President Obama’s 2009 stimulus law come to an end.

The office of Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, declined to provide information about how much H.R. 3102 would save by cutting waste, fraud and abuse.

The projected potential savings from fraud-cutting is detailed in the inspector general report, which found $3.7 million in questionable monthly payouts across 10 states.

Much of the fraud involves the owners and/or employees of smaller, so-called convenience stores exchanging or trafficking SNAP benefits for cash, cigarettes, drugs and guns.

The $222 million figure was reached by multiplying the number by 12 to get an annual amount, then by five to get an estimate for all 50 states.

The audit found some of the recipients had “erroneous” Social Security numbers; were receiving duplicate benefits in the same state; getting benefits “simultaneously” from at least one other state; listed as “disqualified from getting benefits; were “potentially deceased” or using a dead person’s Social Security number to collect benefits.

Huelskamp is proposing requirements for “able-bodied adults to be productive” and to turn food stamps into a block grant, similar to the plan in House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal.

“It’s time for wholesale reform that really helps people, instead of nibbling around the edge of long overdue reform,” he said."

Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute, highlighted how the permanent political class that relies on lobbying and influence peddling makes more money by “growing the size of government,” which leaves no incentive on either side of the aisle to limit government.

As a result, he noted the three richest counties and seven of the top ten wealthiest counties in the nation are in the Washington, D.C. region. The District also consumes the most fine wine in the nation. He asserted the business in Washington is now “not politics” but “money.”

Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, said the best and the brightest now come to Washington because they see Washington as a Tammany Hall that will allow them to get rich off of influence peddling. He noted that Washington D.C. runs the equivalent of a $4 trillion private equity fund every year and essentially doles out 25% of the country’s wealth to those who are connected.

“Nobody has ever turned a camera on them,” Bannon said, indicating he intends to change that in the future. “This is a permanent political class that has now formed an aristocracy. That’s why nothing has changed in Washington.”

Bannon explained people arrive in Washington as country lawyers and then decide to “turn the business of government into a family business” by having their wives and kids work in lobbying.

“And this is how they become a permanent political class,” he concluded.

Hannity mentioned that Washington politicians “kick money back to family, friends, or people that hire them when they retire.”

And Schweizer concurred. He claimed the permanent political class is bipartisan and those who are a part of this permanent aristocracy either marry or are born into it.

Schweizer noted former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, a Republican, and former Louisiana Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, partnering up to lobby after they left Congress. He cited Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida whose daughter-in-law does defense lobbying while he sits on one of the most powerful subcommittees dealing with defense issues.

Schweizer also pointed out that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has two sons who have also lobbied for projects in which their father was involved.

According to Schweizer, this type of bipartisan nepotism that would not be tolerated in corporations is why “political debates are like professional wrestling, it’s not always what it appears to be.”

“It’s a massive cultural problem in Washington, D.C.,” he lamented, adding that the problem is going to get worse.

Bannon said if one follows the money, it is clear there is no incentive for the permanent political class to cut spending. And because there is not an incentive to cut spending, Bannon said, Americans are stuck with a party of “big government” and a junior partner that is the party of “little big government.” Unfortunately, Bannon said the country lacks a party that is truly focused on limited government.

“There is no pressure on them to cut. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to the business model,” he explained. “The permanent political class of both political parties are benefiting from it.”

Hannity promised more segments in the future with Bannon and Schweizer as they make Americans more aware of the rampant crony capitalism Washington’s permanent political class tries its best hide."

Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)

Volkswagen faces pressure from labor interests on its supervisory board to grant workers a stronger voice at the plant. And Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper, reported Monday that UAW President Bob King and five other officials discussed the Tennessee plant with the company's employee relations chief last week at VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg. [...] German law gives labor representatives half the seats on the Volkswagen's supervisory board, where some members have raised concerns about the Chattanooga plant being alone among the company's large factories without formal labor representation.

Southern auto workers may get some added power in the workplace thanks to strong unions overseas. While states like Tennessee have enacted just about every anti-union law they can think of, making it extraordinarily difficult for workers to form unions, foreign auto manufacturers can face pressure at home to take a step back and not take advantage of all those anti-union laws:So while American companies are refusing to sign a binding agreement making it less likely that garment workers in Bangladesh will be burned or crushed to death, German workers are exerting pressure against the regressive labor laws of another low-wage labor source: Tennessee. In the Volkswagen case, such pressure could lead not to a union with a collective bargaining agreement, but to a works council, in which worker representatives have a say in plant management.

Such a step is probably not imminent, but just the prospect of increasing worker power at the plant has Tennessee Republicans nervous; after all, the whole southern Republican pitch in recruiting companies to relocate business to their states consists of promising workers who'll accept low wages and will be too afraid to talk back. So deeply rooted is the Tennessee Republican hatred of unions, in fact, that when Sen. Bob Corker was asked about the revival of a GM plant under union contract, in Tennessee:



""On the one hand I'm happy that people have jobs,"" Corkers said of a recent announcement that the plant would add or keep up to 1,800 jobs to expand production. ""But on the other hand I certainly hope there aren't inroads made at additional facilities.""

Heaven forbid! It sure is a scary thing to have jobs coming to your state if they might give workers ideas about having a say in their wages and working conditions."

Walmart, which pays its workers an average wage of $8.81 an hour, recently gathered a few headlines when it threatened to cancel construction on three stores in Washington D.C. after the city council wanted to force them to pay a living wage of $12.50 an hour.



What does McDonald's and Walmart have in common? They both push their workers onto public services and food stamps.

Walmart's wages and benefits are so low that many of its employees are forced to turn to the government for aid, costing taxpayers between $900,000 and $1.75 million per store, according to a report released last week by congressional Democrats.

Congress is currently busy arguing about cutting food stamps . The Paul Ryan budget would cut $33 Billion over 10 years. The theory is that programs like food stamps discourage work Hannity likes to ask the question of whether Americans are ""better off on food stamps"" or ""better off with a job"".The spin by the right-wing is that food stamps are just welfare for the lazy.

As McDonald's budget demonstrated, it isn't a question of having a job or not. 47% of SNAP participants are under the age of 18. Another 8% are over the age of 60. 36% were white (non-Hispanic), the largest group.

But the really big number is 58%. That's how many SNAP recipients lived in a household with earnings from a job. Increasingly the face of someone getting food stamps is a working poor family.

However, the lie behind food stamps being a benefit for the undeserving poor is more than just a slander of the working poor. It's also a distraction away from who primarily benefits from food stamps.

""Here's where the profits come in,"" Nestle says. ""A vast percentage of Food Stamps' money goes into the pockets of soda companies and snack food companies...and also the stores that sell these foods.""

Wal-Mart ""gets a large fraction of Food Stamp dollars,"" which contributes 25% to 40% of revenue at select stores, according to Nestle. ""These companies, therefore, have a vested interest in making sure Food Stamps are allowed for any purchase at all.""

Funding for Food Stamps comes from the Farm Bill, which is currently being debated in Congress. ""You can bet the food companies like it just the way it is and they are lobbying"" to prevent restrictions on how Food Stamp dollars are spent, Nestle says.

As the head of this division at JPMorgan, Christopher Paton, told Bloomberg, ""They act and feel very much like a debit card. A lot of stores increasingly take food stamps."" What convenience! And Paton points out that his bank is the largest processor of food stamps in the country. These are boom times for such services -- a new report from the US Department of Agriculture reports that 43.6 million Americans are now using food stamps, nearly 14% of the population, which is a record number. Paton notes this trend himself: ""Volumes have gone through the roof in the last couple of years,"" he says. ""This business is a very important business to JPMorgan in terms of its size and scale."" And the numbers bear him out. According to the company's most recent quarterly filing with the SEC, the Treasury & Securities Services segment, which is the division that includes the food stamp business, was up 2% in the last three months of last quarter and brought in $5.47 billion in net revenue for most of 2010.

You can't help but notice the irony of Walmart helping its employees get on food stamps, and then profiting from their food stamp dollars. In fact, if you take a step back and think about it, what that sounds like is not public welfare, butwelfare.And if you think that stops at McDonald's and Walmart, think again. The food stamps/corporate welfare model goes all the way to Wall Street JP Morgan helped gut the American economy, got saved by the American taxpayer, and is now profiting on the misery of the working poor at the expense of the American taxpayer again.Is this a great country or what?!?

The hidden fact is that food stamps are corporate welfare in more than just one way. It's not just that McDonald's, Nestle, JP Morgan and Walmart make money from managing and selling products for food stamp money. They also benefit in a much more important way: social stability.

All those millions of working poor that are just barely making it because of food stamps, will continue to put up with things and work for an increasingly slim chance of an opportunity to get ahead as long as they still have some food in their bellies.

All that ends when people can't feed themselves.

Any student of history or current events of the world knows that hungry people have nothing to lose.

Do you think Walmart and McDonald's can continue to pay starvation wages and not see their workers organizing into unions to demand higher pay if those same workers are hungry?

Programs like food stamps ensure the serfs of this country don't organize and rebel. Talk to any North African dictator and they will agree that if you take away that last bit of the social safety net things will get ugly real fast.

How has the profile of food stamp recipients changed in the last decade?

The number of SNAP households that have earnings while participating in SNAP has been rising for more than a decade, and has more than tripled — from about 2 million in 2000 to about 6.4 million in 2011.

Sutter'],There’s no ‘magic wand’ for jobs,"Story highlights Commenter: ""You think the President just waves his magic wand and jobs are created?"" John Sutter: Congress, the president and all of us can help Sutter: The long-term unemployed encounter widespread discrimination Commenter: ""You do whatever you have to to get work""

Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion. He heads the section’s Change the List project, which focuses on human rights and social justice. E-mail him at CTL@CNN.com.

Here’s one from the obvious file: There’s no “magic wand” that – poof! – creates jobs in the United States, or anywhere else.

In response to my column this week on long-term unemployment, some of you commented that the president doesn’t have superpowers to create jobs for the rest of us. Or you pointed out that he should be part in the process – but job-creation is actually something Congress or business leaders should take on instead.

I thought those were great points.

Here’s my favorite comment – mostly because it uses the term “pea brain” (and yes, it’s in reference to me, but you’ve gotta love a nerdy insult, especially when it includes a vegetable):

John D. Sutter

“Are you so stupid that you think the President just waves his magic wand and jobs are created? Let me give you a lesson in government Sutter. Maybe your pathetic conservative pea brain will be able to grasp one fact: The President proposes and Congress legislates. So it is the Republican Congress that is keeping that poor woman unemployed. They have done nothing to aleviate (sic) her plight …”

The “poor woman” the commenter, who used the screen name “tom sellier,” referenced is Kim Peters, an unemployed mom who invited me into her home Tuesday to watch the State of the Union. Overall, Peters, who has been unemployed on and off for five years, didn’t take much comfort from the speech. She’s more worried about keeping a roof over her head.

Some of the most cutting things Peters had to say focused on House Speaker John Boehner, whose apparent indifference toward the State of the Union – scowling, licking his lips, looking very “get me outta here” – made her angry. Her point of view, and I think there is some merit to this, is that President Obama wants to promote infrastructure projects and other “stimulus” efforts that would create jobs, but Republicans are so focused on the deficit they won’t consider spending money on that.

She wasn’t thrilled with everything Obama said either.

Drafting public policy that will create jobs and put people back to work is a tricky thing. That’s part of the reason I argued the first and easiest thing we all can do to help the long-term unemployed is to treat them as equal humans.

Currently, they’re some of the most maligned people in our society.

Companies put out ads saying they only will consider employed candidates. Recruiters toss their resumes before taking a look. Generally, I think the national sentiment is that unemployed people must have done something wrong to end up jobless.

As a person who’s been laid off before, I can tell you that’s not always the case. It’s unfair to give unemployed people less of a chance at getting back on their feet. If anything, I think they deserve more consideration. It’s the fair thing to do.

Other readers said getting a job is an individual’s responsibility.

“I’ve been unemployed and it sucks … BUT you do whatever you have to to get work you dig ditches, you wash dishes, empty trash, you may even have to move your home,” wrote mikemc58. “Point is you have to think outside the box and get out of your comfort zone. Wishes and dreams aren’t going to do it. Get off your butt hit the streets everyday asking, looking, volunteering, for a job. And listening to Obama drone on about how good the economy is useless, because as we all know, ‘we’ who live in the REAL world know it’s NOT. GOV is not the answer, personal responsibility and self motivation is the key to finding new work.”

That’s another fair point, although I think individual effort only goes so far when there are 3.4 unemployed workers for every job opening in the United States in December, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it’s important to empathize with people who become stuck in a cycle of hopelessness and depression the longer their unemployment continues. That’s not an easy cycle to break.

One more thing to bring up about the comments: While many of you wrote in to ask how you can help long-term unemployed people get back on their feet, several of you attacked Peters – criticizing her ownership of a TV, saying she shouldn’t have cable if she doesn’t have a job (she actually doesn’t have cable, but that’s beside the point) and speculating about what type of cell phone she uses.

What silliness, right? And it speaks to the underlying problem here: We’re inclined to attack unemployed people – to judge their financial situations and to speculate about what might have put them out of work. That’s unhelpful. And discriminatory.

Peters, the woman I featured, told me that ending ignorance will help end unemployment. Government and business leaders must help, too. But I think she’s right: a simple shift in attitude – trading ignorance for empathy – can and will make a huge difference.

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-promises-veto-gop-124006328.html,,[],White House promises veto of GOP spending plan,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House stepped in Monday with a veto threat against a House GOP plan to advance a round of 2014 spending bills that would ease sequester-imposed cuts on the Pentagon while forcing even deeper cuts on non-defense programs.

Those cuts would come in areas like education, energy and water development and foreign aid.

In a statement, the White House budget office said the cuts called for in the GOP plan would force thousands of poor children off of Head Start, harm special education, cut federal law enforcement and dent medical research grants to thousands of scientists. It called on the Democratic Senate and GOP House to reach a broader agreement on the budget before advancing spending bills.

The veto promise comes as the House is set this week to consider the first of 12 spending bills for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. The first measure totals $73 billion and awards a 3.5 percent increase for veterans programs while cutting construction costs at military bases. The House is also slated to debate and pass a $39 billion measure this week boosting the Homeland Security Department's budget by almost $1 billion compared with current levels.

Democrats and the White House don't have a problem with the substance of the first two bills. Rather they oppose the overall level of funding set by Republicans for the day-to-day operations of federal agencies.

The statement promised a veto of every spending bill until Washington reaches a bargain on ""an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future.""

At issue is the almost $1 trillion portion of the $3.6 trillion federal budget that must be approved by Congress each year. This so-called discretionary spending has been cut sharply with the imposition in March of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. The Pentagon is absorbing cuts of 7 percent this year and domestic discretionary programs are bearing a 5 percent cut from last year's levels.

Story continues

Hopes are fading for a budget bargain that would replace the cuts, which leaves lawmakers stuck with even bigger cuts for the upcoming year. Appropriated funding for the ongoing budget year totals $984 billion; the House measures total $967 billion, an almost 2 percent cut below already austere current spending.

Under a 2011 budget deal, the panel was supposed to receive almost $1.06 trillion for the 12 appropriations bills; the House panel is instead stuck with $967 billion under the across-the-board cuts imposed because Congress and President Barack Obama were unable to follow up the 2011 deal with further deficit cuts. The Democratic figures are $91 billion higher, a 9 percent increase from current levels.

Obama and Senate Democrats support advancing the annual spending bills at the higher levels called for under the hard-fought 2011 bargain, replacing the cuts with a mixture of tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. But conservatives controlling the House insist that the spending bills be written at the post-sequestration cap of $967 billion.

The GOP plan opposed by Obama restores cuts to the military while making cuts to domestic programs favored by Democrats even deeper. The deepest cuts — almost 20 percent — would come from a huge domestic spending bill that funds aid to local school districts, health research and enforcement of labor laws. Cuts to housing, foreign aid, transportation and community development grants would be severe, though a popular program that provides food aid to pregnant women and their babies is likely to emerge intact.

Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., appears to be embarking on a strategy to advance a handful of the annual spending bills by funding them at levels closer to Obama's budget than the tea party budget that passed the House in March. GOP conservatives have balked at such moves in the past, saying they're a trick aimed at boosting spending, but some Democrats were willing to give Rogers the benefit of the doubt by voting for the veterans and homeland security measures during Appropriations Committee consideration last month.

Neither the House nor the Senate are likely to have much luck in advancing the measures very far unless a broader deal is made."

In a morning appearance alongside emergency first responders he suggested could lose their jobs under the automatic cuts, Obama complained that congressional Republicans refuse to consider what he calls a “balanced” approached to budgeting.

“So far, at least, what they’ve expressed is a preference where they’d rather have these cuts go into effect than close a single tax loophole for the wealthiest Americans -- not one,” Obama said as he delivered brief remarks. He took no questions from the White House press corps.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

The automatic cuts, set to take effect March 1, would harm the economy, cost American jobs and even threaten military and law enforcement readiness, Obama said.

The Tuesday appearance is the president’s latest event in a public campaign to portray the GOP as standing in the way of “balanced” reductions to debt and deficit. Obama says he is willing to cut wasteful government spending to reach that goal but insists the deal must also involve reform of the tax code in a way that produces new tax revenue.

Republicans also want to find a way to avoid the dramatic spending cuts, set up by Obama and Congress as a way to force the parties to work out a compromise, but they want to do it without imposing new taxes.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) predicted last week that the automatic cuts would probably take effect unless lawmakers come up with a long-term plan significantly cutting spending and wiping out the deficit in the next decade.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Obama renewed his call for a short-term fix that would give the parties more time to work out a bigger plan.

If Republicans and Democrats can’t get a big budget agreement done by next Friday, Obama said, then Congress should pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would prevent the so-called sequester cuts from taking effect.

Rather than simply a plan to “kick the can down the road,” Obama said, the fix would “give them time to work together on a plan that finishes the job of deficit reduction in a sensible way.”

The president spoke grimly of the consequences of letting the deadline pass without such a fix.

Emergency responders such as police and firefighters would see their disaster response degraded, he said. Border patrol agents would have their hours reduced.

FBI agents will be furloughed and federal prosecutors “will have to close cases and let criminals go,” Obama said, while teachers are laid off and many Americans lose access to preventive care including cancer screenings.

“It seems like every three months around here, there is some manufactured crisis,” Obama said. “We’ve got more work to do than to just try to dig ourselves out of these self-inflicted wounds.”

(CNN) - Long-term unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans expired Saturday after Congress failed to pass an extension. Reinstating those benefits is expected to be one of the first priorities for congressional Democrats in the new year.

“Extending unemployment insurance is the right thing to do for millions of Americans who are trying to support their families,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement Saturday. “What makes matters worse, the loss of benefits comes just a few days after the holidays.”



Like most Democrats, Wasserman Schultz laid the blame for the expiring benefits - now reverting back to 26 weeks of coverage - squarely at the feet of congressional Republicans.

Many Republicans have in turn argued that the extended emergency federal benefits - passed during the Great Recession - are a disincentive for job hunting and are no longer necessary as the economy improves and unemployment ticks down.

Rand Paul: Extending jobless benefits a 'disservice' to workers

Unemployment isn’t going down fast enough, say Democrats. They argue that without the extended benefits, recipients will severely curtail their spending and be a drag on the economy.

“As we continue our work to create more good paying jobs, it is essential that we extend unemployment benefits to the millions of American families who still need and rely on them,” Wasserman Schultz said.

President Barack Obama also weighed in Friday, according to the White House. In a phone call to Sens. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Dean Heller, R-Nevada, Obama voiced his own support for reinstating the prolonged unemployment benefits, the goal of a bill co-sponsored by the two men. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has pledged to take the benefits up as soon as the chamber returns from its break early next month.

Heller has been one of the few Republicans to vocally support extending the benefits – although House Speaker John Boehner has expressed some willingness to negotiate on the matter.

In a statement announcing his extension bill, Heller argued that “providing a safety net for those in need is one of the most important functions of the federal government.”

“As Nevada’s unemployment rate continues to top the charts nationwide, many families and individuals back home do not know how they are going to meet their basic needs,” Heller said.

A number of Democrats also took to Twitter on Saturday to argue for extending the benefits.

Blow'],The Appalling Stance of Rand Paul - The New York Times,"I don’t put much past politicians. I stay prepared for the worst. But occasionally someone says something so insensitive that it catches me flat-footed.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said Sunday on Fox News: “I do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they’re paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers.”

This statement strikes at the heart — were a heart to exist — of the divide between conservatives and liberals about whether the social safety net provides temporary help for those who hit hard times or functions as a kind of glue to keep them stuck there.

Whereas I am sure that some people will abuse any form of help, I’m by no means convinced that this is the exclusive domain of the poor and put-upon. Businesses and the wealthy regularly take advantage of subsidies and tax loopholes without blinking an eye. But somehow, when some poor people, or those who unexpectedly fall on hard times, take advantage of benefits for which they are eligible it’s an indictment of the morality and character of the poor as a whole."

Sen. Chuck Schumer: ""Leave Wall Street aloooone!""

We had the majority! It seemed somehow appropriate that as a new majority dawned for Senate Democrats, two candidates who had been propelled by the growing ""net roots"" (Democratic-leaning bloggers), had made the difference in the end.

IC: You don’t think Elizabeth Warren makes a villain out of Wall Street? CS: I am just going to leave it at what I said. IC: Forget Warren then. Is this a problem for your party? CS: You don’t want to go after them for the sake of going after them. The left-wing blogs want you to be completely and always anti–Wall Street. It’s not the right way to be. IC: So are the left-wing blogs as bad as the Tea Party ones in this case? CS: Left-wing blogs are the mirror image. They just have less credibility and less clout.

Chuck Schumer, 2009, in his book Positively American:Chuck Schumer, now Left-wing blogs had credibility when they were helping Schumer's DSCC win control of the Senate. Now that we're criticizing Wall Street? No credibility! And we're just like the Tea Party, having cost Democrats a half-dozen seats and the Senate majority in the last couple of years.

Oh, you mean we haven't pushed the Democratic Party outside of the national mainstream?Weird, then. On the other hand, it wasn't bloggers trying to save Sen. Scott Brown's hide in 2012, like good ol' Chuck:



There is a good little story. [Looks to aide] I can tell this. I went to Scott Brown and said, “If you give us the sixtieth vote for the Citizens United rollback, we won’t go after you.”

If it was up to Schumer, he would've traded an entire Senate seat for one meaninglessvote on a bill that would've died a quick death in the House. God knows his Wall Street benefactors would've beenat that!

From my perspective, intra-party relations have never been better. It seems odd that Schumer is trying to start an internecine war at this very moment, particularly with a tough 2014 up ahead. And as the number three Democrat in the Senate, his words carry outsized weight. But it's clear that the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party is feeling the heat from its resurgent populist wing: the Warrens, Baldwins, Browns and Merkleys.

Republicans are locked in their own bloody civil war. Schumer (and his Third Way allies) may have just signaled that we may be in for some bloodshed of our own. In fact, he appears eager to lead Wall Street's counter attack."

The changes would apply to current active-duty and retired military personnel under the age of 62. Many military families view these changes as a broken promise and, Breitbart News has learned, are convening a “Twitter Town Hall” Monday night in opposition to the budget deal. The grass roots event is targeting Senators up for reelection next year with the hashtag #KeepYourPromise.

“The President and Congress’s failure to watch the back of those who have served their country for twenty or more years in the military, particularly over the last twelve years of war, will ensure the next generation of potential recruits understands that their word means nothing,” Jeremy Hilton, an organizer of the event told Breitbart News.

Hilton is a Navy veteran and in 2012 was named “Military Spouse of the Year” by Armed Forces insurance. His wife currently serves as an officer in the Air Force.

“Military families understand that costs must be constrained,” Hilton continued. “[B]ut all of us have watched DoD flush money down the drain in Afghanistan, here in the states by buying Aeron chairs “because we have to spend it before the end of the year”, or multi-billion congressional boondoggles….we have seen waste that borders on the obscene.”

The Ryan-Murray deal pushes active-duty and veterans into a new pension plan that lowers their yearly cost-of-living adjustment. Instead of keep pace with inflation, the new yearly adjustment would be equal to inflation minus 1%. Once the veteran turns 62, the yearly adjustment would fully account for inflation going forward.

The change is expected to save around $7 billion over the next decade. The money coming out of veterans’ pension checks wouldn’t go to deficit reduction or paying down debt, however. It would go to finance increased government spending.

Rep. Paul Ryan defended the cut to military pensions over the weekend. “We give them a slightly smaller adjustment for inflation because they’re still in their working years and in most cases earning another paycheck,” Ryan said.

Ryan’s defense is beside the point. It isn’t really a question of whether or not a veteran can “afford” the pension benefit cut. It’s a question of whether the government should honor a commitment it’s made to its military personnel, especially at a time when the demands on them and their families are so great.

John Thune: President Obama is late submitting budget to Congress He says White House isn't serious about government living by a budget He says higher taxes, more regulations, higher debt are hurting economic recovery Thune: Recovery from recession under Obama is much slower than under Reagan

Editor’s Note: Sen. John Thune, a Republican, represents South Dakota. He is chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Finance Committee.

(CNN) —

As the House and the Senate debated and passed budgets recently, one person was notably absent from the debate: President Barack Obama.

For the fourth time in five years, the president is late submitting his budget to Congress. So late, in fact, this year both the House and Senate were forced to move forward without him, rendering the president’s budget request completely irrelevant.

Unfortunately, the president’s tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting. Families and businesses have to ensure that their spending, including their debt payments, doesn’t exceed their income, but the president acts as if he doesn’t think that should apply to the federal government.

Recently, when speaking about his budget (which the White House says will be out next week, a full two months after the deadline), the president said that he didn’t want “to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.” Well, perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy.

For four years now, the president’s agenda has been out-of-control spending, massive tax hikes on Americans and burdensome regulations on job creators. Since the president took office, we’ve seen more than $1.7 trillion in new tax hikes, $518 billion in new regulations, and $6 trillion added to the national debt.

The impact of those policies has not been pretty.

Economic growth under this president has averaged just 0.8%. That isn’t anywhere close to the 5% growth needed for a real recovery.

While it’s certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy, it’s important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago. What has he been doing since?

Let’s put this in perspective. Ronald Reagan inherited a bad economy. But Reagan put in place growth-oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations, which turned the economy around.

During the Reagan recovery, the economy grew nearly three times as fast as it has under Obama’s watch. During the fourth year of Reagan’s presidency, the economy experienced robust 7.2% growth. In contrast, the fourth year of Obama’s presidency produced economic growth of just 2.2%. If the Obama recovery were as strong as Reagan’s, our economy would be $1.5 trillion larger today – meaning more jobs, more opportunity, and more take-home pay for Americans.

The fact is Obama’s spending, tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery, jobs and opportunity.

Just take the president’s $2.6 trillion health care overhaul signed into law three years ago. The Federal Reserve recently issued a report stating employers in several regions are laying off workers and cutting back on new hires as a direct result of the president’s health care law.

Four years into the president’s term, 12 million Americans are still out of work and the labor force participation rate has declined to 63.5%. Americans are becoming so discouraged in the Obama economy that they simply stop looking for work. If the labor force participation rate today were the same as when the president took office, the real unemployment rate would be 10.7%.

Yet despite the abysmal failures of the president’s policies, he continues to argue for more of the same.

It’s time to try something new: Time to balance the budget, rein in Washington’s dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the Obama administration, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. It’s time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all Americans.

We should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president’s policies and economic growth. The president’s tax hikes, runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery.

It’s time for the president to get out of the way of the American people and let our economy take off. It’s time to do better than 0.8% growth.

Suppose that a government imposes fiscal austerity in a realistic fashion, with spending cuts getting steadily deeper relative to baseline over a period of several years. If the negative impact of these cuts is fairly large — which all the evidence coming in suggests is the case under current liquidity-trap conditions — and if the country starts from a fairly high level of debt — as the austerity countries do — something alarming is likely to happen. Instead of falling, the ratio of debt to GDP is likely to rise for years.

In part this is because a weaker economy shrinks revenues, offsetting a large part of the direct austerity. What pushes it over the top is the weakening of GDP, which increases the ratio.

I ran my own version of their simulations for a hypothetical country — call it Osbornia — which starts with debt at 100 percent of GDP and a budget deficit that would, left to itself, be consistent with a stable debt ratio thanks to 2 percent growth and 2 percent inflation. On this economy I impose 5 years of tightening at the rate of 1 percent of potential GDP each year, with a multiplier of 1.3 (which is about where recent estimates have been converging). Output ends up 6.5 percent below the baseline; debt looks like this:

Photo

Why does this matter? As the paper says,

Although this effect is not long-lasting and debt eventually declines, it could be an issue if financial markets focus on the short-term behavior of the debt ratio, or if country authorities engage in repeated rounds of tightening in an effort to get the debt ratio to converge to the official target.

(My emphasis).

And, of course, this destructive behavior is especially likely if said country authorities are firm believers in the notion that austerity does not depress output; they’ll see the weak performance either as “structural” or as showing the need for more confidence. Either way, they’ll see it as a reason to tighten even more.

Tax refund fraud has exploded in recent years. Scammers typically use stolen names and Social Security numbers to file phony electronic tax forms for IRS refunds.

About 1.6 million Americans were victims of ID theft/tax refund crimes this year through June, up from 1.2 million taxpayers in all of 2012, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, said in a report.

""Identity theft is a growing epidemic,"" said J. Russell George, TIGTA's chief.

Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, a hot spot for these crimes, said in a statement that TIGTA's analysis shows the IRS is making progress, but much remains to be done.

TIGTA said that while the number of frauds has risen, the amount of federal revenue lost to these crimes has decreased. In 2011, the government lost $3.6 billion in potentially fraudulent tax refunds, down from $5.2 billion in 2010.

The thieves are increasingly working from abroad, TIGTA found. In 2011, someone using a single mailing address in Lithuania made more tax filings with fraudulent Social Security numbers than any single U.S. address, TIGTA said.

The Lithuanian address received $220,489 in fraudulent IRS refunds; an address in Shanghai received $156,533.

""The constantly evolving tactics used by scammers to commit identity theft continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the IRS,"" the agency said in a statement on Thursday.

TIGTA said the IRS must do more to spot red flags signaling potential fraud in tax filings, such as multiple filings from the same address, and to help victims more quickly.

The IRS said it agreed with TIGTA's recommendations."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/opinion/keeping-air-travel-competitive.html,2013-08-14 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],Keeping Air Travel Competitive - The New York Times,"In a federal lawsuit filed on Tuesday, the Justice Department makes a strong and convincing case for why the proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways should be blocked under antitrust laws.

The deal would create the world’s largest airline, reduce competition and undoubtedly lead to higher fares and fewer flights. The two airlines have more than 1,000 overlapping domestic routes and together control a large majority of the traffic at important airports like Dallas-Fort Worth International and Ronald Reagan National near Washington. The Justice Department estimates that consumers would pay hundreds of millions of dollars more in fares and fees if the airlines were allowed to merge.

The airlines have argued that the deal would allow them to compete more effectively against United and Delta, which have come to dominate the industry after merging with other airlines in recent years. But American and US Airways have it backward. Those earlier mergers are precisely the reason this consolidation is a problem. Fares and fees have increased across the industry and especially on routes where mergers reduced competition in the last five years. Since 2008, Delta merged with Northwest, United combined with Continental and Southwest took over AirTran. Allowing another merger would concentrate power in four big carriers, down from five.

Mergers have also increased the dominance of the big carriers in their hub airports. Not surprisingly, the attorneys general of Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia — most of which have airports with a large number of American or US Airways flights — have joined in the Justice Department lawsuit, knowing the merger would hurt consumers in their states. At Reagan National, for instance, the combined airline would control 69 percent of all takeoff and landing slots."

http://news.yahoo.com/fiscal-cliff-deal-leaves-lots-issues-dangling-232914021--politics.html,,[],'Fiscal cliff' deal leaves lots of issues dangling,"The ""fiscal cliff"" compromise on taxes leaves a big part of the nation's budget crisis still dangling.

Lawmakers bought a little time with a New Year's agreement to hold income tax rates steady for 99 percent of Americans while allowing payroll taxes to go up. But they left themselves only two months to settle seemingly irreconcilable differences over how much the United States should borrow and spend and where painful budget cuts should land.

Here's a look at what's been resolved and what's left hanging:

___

AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS

The bipartisan deal approved by the Senate and House put off dealing with the nearly $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set for this year.

Unless Congress stops them by March 1, automatic cuts of about 8 or 9 percent are set to sweep through nearly all federal agencies, with half the money coming out of the military.

Both parties talk about the need to control spending, but lawmakers don't want the kinds of chaotic cuts now barreling toward them. Republicans worry that the Pentagon would be hamstrung; Democrats say vital federal programs would be crippled.

Federal workers would face furloughs or even layoffs, Americans would see all sorts of government services curtailed, and businesses would feel the pinch of reduced government spending.

___

DEBT LIMIT SHOWDOWN

Around the same time, the United States would lose its ability to borrow money to pay its debts, unless Congress acts. That's a big deal, especially since the government borrows about 31 cents of every dollar it spends.

The U.S. bumped against its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit Monday, but the Treasury Department is using special accounting measures to avoid default for now. Private economists say those methods could probably stretch through late February or early March.

After that, the United States would risk its first-ever default.

Hopes of wrapping the issue into the year-end negotiations were dashed, setting up the potential for another standoff. House Speaker John Boehner says any debt increase must be paired with equal spending cuts. Obama says the debt ceiling is too important to negotiate.

Story continues

The last time such a showdown brought the nation close to default, in the summer of 2011, it roiled the financial markets and contributed to Standard & Poor's decision to strip the U.S. government of its AAA bond rating.

___

A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?

Yet another deadline looms on March 27. The stopgap measure that funds government activities expires; congressional approval will be needed to keep the government running. It's another chance to fight over spending.

In 2011, the nation came within hours of a partial government shutdown that would have furloughed an estimated 800,000 government workers, closed national parks and halted the work of the IRS.

___

THE NATIONAL DEBT

The ""fiscal cliff"" deadline was originally designed to force lawmakers to confront trillion-dollar annual budget deficits that pile the nation's debts higher each year. As larger and larger numbers of baby boomers receive retirement benefits in coming years, the strain on the budget will be unsustainable.

Obama says Medicare's climbing costs must be addressed to fix this. Republicans want to rein in Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs more sharply. Many Democratic lawmakers object. And tampering with programs so popular with voters is never easy.

The ""fiscal cliff"" was supposed to be a way to force Washington to confront the long-term debt problem. The next two months will be another opportunity to come up with a plan or dodge the issues again.

The tough, unpopular decisions are further complicated by concerns that cutting spending too quickly could damage the nation's sluggish economic recovery.

___

WHAT'S DONE

The year-end ""fiscal cliff"" deadline did inspire compromise between Republicans and Democrats on some hotly debated tax questions. Some of the issues settled:

— Payroll taxes are going back up, after being trimmed for two years to help stimulate spending and boost the economy. For most workers, that means paychecks will shrink by 2 percent — another $1,000 for someone earning $50,000 a year. The wealthiest pay a lower share of their income, however, because the Social Security payroll tax applies only to the first $113,700 of earnings.

— The top 1 percent are getting socked with higher income tax rates. Income over $400,000 for individuals or $450,000 for couples will be taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent. Everyone else gets to keep their current income tax rates, which date back to the George W. Bush-era tax cuts.

— The wealthiest Americans will pay higher taxes on their investments. Rates for their capital gains and dividends are rising from 15 to 20 percent. And the tax on estates worth more than $5 million will go up to 40 percent, from 35 percent.

— The alternative minimum tax — designed to keep the wealthy from using loopholes to avoid taxes — will be permanently indexed for inflation so it doesn't catch millions of middle- and upper-middle-income people in its net.

— Tax breaks for families with children, college tuition and low-income workers will continue for five years. A diverse group of temporary business tax breaks were extended for one year.

— Emergency federal unemployment benefits to help 2 million people out of work for at least six months will be extended a year.

— A scheduled 27 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors will be held off for a year in what's become a congressional ritual.

There is a lot to say about the Congressional budget deal, and we do that later on the editorial page. For now I wanted to dwell on the outrageous failure of Congress to extend federal long-term unemployment benefits.

After Jan. 1, 1.3 million Americans will lose their benefits, so extending them is vitally important. In addition to simple fairness, the benefits are an economic boon since those who receive them spend the money on essentials such as food and shelter; they don’t save it or give it to a hedge fund.

As Ezra Klein pointed out today in The Washington Post, unemployment for five weeks or less has dropped nicely, but long-term unemployment, which lasts more than 27 weeks, has not.



“No one has a very good answer for these workers,” he wrote. “They’re often stuck in areas of the country where jobs are scarce. They face a vicious cycle of employment discrimination in which employers don’t want to hire them because they’ve been unemployed for so long, which in turn extends their unemployment and makes it even harder for them to find a job. And now we’re just cutting them loose.”

To be clear, the benefits extension was not even included in the budget talks. Paul Ryan and the other Republicans bet that Democrats, eager for a sequester deal, wouldn’t insist on unemployment at this stage. And they were right.

But don’t mistake this for a problem with Congressional process. It’s not. It comes from deep ideological opposition among right-wing Republicans to the very idea of unemployment benefits. Their view is that these benefits coddle people who should just by golly go out and find a job.

It will be a national disgrace if Congress does not help people who simply cannot find new jobs after being thrown out of work by the recession.

There’s a chance that Democrats can get the extension through before Friday, when lawmakers stop pretending to do something in Washington and go off on vacation so they can slurp up more cash from the campaign-finance troughs back home. But I’m not betting on it."

USA TODAY

President Obama said Friday he likes the proposed congressional budget deal, but Congress should also extend soon-to-expire unemployment insurance.

""You've potentially 1.3 million people who, during Christmastime, are going to lose their unemployment benefits, at a time when it's still very difficult for a lot of folks to find a job,"" Obama said before meeting with a group of newly elected mayors from across the country.

""That's not just bad for those individuals and for those families, that's bad for our economy and that's bad for our cities,"" Obama said.

The House approved a two-year budget agreement on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to vote next week.

The two-year plan would avoid ""the constant brinksmanship and crisis governance that we've seen up on Capitol Hill that impedes growth and makes businesses and investors less certain about wanting to put their money in,"" Obama said.

The budget, he said, is something the federal government can do to help mayors create jobs, the topic of Obama's meeting with the mayors.

The president also again advocated an increase in the minimum wage, saying ""that could have a tremendous boost in a lot of the cities where there are a lot of service workers.""

After the meeting, some of the participating mayors said they also discussed income inequality, early childhood education, the Detroit bankruptcy, and other issues specific to their cities.

""It's very clear the president is focused on wages and benefits,"" said Bill de Blasio, the mayor-elect of New York City.

Previously', 'He Was Policy Editor']",Larry Summers withdraws name from Fed consideration,"Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and senior White House economic adviser, has withdrawn as a candidate for Federal Reserve chairman in a startling development that raises urgent questions about who will lead the central bank when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke steps down in four months.

Summers withdrew after an intense uproar among liberal Democrats, women’s groups and other advocacy organizations against his potential nomination — a highly unusual assault on the candidate who President Obama favored for the job.

Obama has said he is considering two other candidates for the post, Fed Vice Chairman Janet L. Yellen and former Fed vice chairman Don Kohn. But he was leaning toward picking Summers, people close to the White House say, and the economist’s decision to take his name out of the ring might lead Obama to pursue a wider range of candidates.

Summers helped Obama navigate the depths of the financial crisis and recession, providing a degree of support that Obama has told aides he deeply valued. No official, with the possible exception of former Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner, did more to influence the president’s response to the traumatic events he faced at the beginning of his term, which Obama plans to highlight this week as he marks the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis.

On Sunday, Summers telephoned the president to tell him he was withdrawing his name from consideration.

“It has been a privilege to work with you since the beginning of your Administration as you led the nation through a severe recession into a sustained economic recovery,” Summers wrote in a letter to the president.

He added: “This is a complex moment in our national life. I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interest of the Federal Reserve, the Administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation’s ongoing economic recovery.”

Obama accepted Summers’s decision, lauding him and saying that he planned to continue to consult his former adviser.

“Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,” Obama said. “I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country.”

The decision marks a disappointing turn of events for the renowned economist, who had operated at the highest levels of academia and government. But he has been dogged by controversies. Summers has come under fire for his support for deregulating parts of the banking sector while he was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. While president of Harvard University in 2005, he also sparked controversy for his comments on women’s aptitude in math and science.

People close to the White House said Summers faced not only a rebellion among liberal Democrats but also other challenges, including a debate over whether to launch a military strike against Syria that stretched out the Fed process and gave more time for opposition to build.

“It was just a perfect storm of bad timing,” said one person close to the White House, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about private deliberations. “It would have been absolute war, and the president would have had to spend all of his political capital. Larry decided not to drag him through it.”

The contest for Fed chairman had taken on the form of a political campaign this summer, as allies of Summers and Yellen advanced their cases in the news media — and in behind-the-scenes whispering campaigns.

A wide array of current and former Obama officials backed Summers, arguing that his crisis experience and economic prowess made him an exceptional candidate. Yellen’s supporters, meanwhile, noted that she has deep Fed experience and has been an architect of the central bank’s efforts to reduce unemployment.

The drama started after word of Summers’s candidacy first circulated early this summer — when most Fed watchers thought Yellen would be appointed.

Liberals on Capitol Hill, as well as a wide array of economists, erupted. They said he had a brusque personality that would be problematic at the Fed.

Summers’s allies took to the media, noting that he was an architect of the president’s push for tough financial regulations after the crisis and couldn’t be so difficult to work with if he had garnered the support of so many of his White House colleagues.

When questioned on Capitol Hill, Obama made many of the same points in defense of his former adviser. But given the heated opposition, Obama decided to announce publicly that he would wait until the fall to make a decision, hoping to buy time and cool tensions.

Some former administration officials say, in retrospect, that the White House got the strategy wrong. While the noise from Capitol Hill died down for a while — and Senate leadership privately told the White House it would do all it could to get Summers through — key voices in the opposition grew louder.

In the past week, Democratic Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio), members of the banking committee, which would have had to endorse Summers, announced that they would vote against him. Another committee Democrat, Sen. Jeff Merkely (Ore.), had said long ago that he would oppose Summers, and it was widely assumed that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would have joined them as well.

That would have meant that Obama would have had to court Republicans to get Summers confirmed — a difficult task at the same time he would be trying to strip away Republican support for a deal to keep the government open and raise the federal borrowing limits.

“The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), a liberal who said he would have voted against Summers if he was approved by the Senate banking committee.

Obama is now short on time to make a nomination, given that the Senate often takes a few months for confirmation. While some speculated Sunday that Obama might turn to Geithner, a person close to the former Treasury secretary said he does not want to be considered.

The decision may give a lift to markets, which were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the Fed nomination process and the perception that Summers would have been less supportive of the Fed’s efforts to reduce unemployment.

“This news should be positive for the markets,” said Millan Mulraine, director of U.S. rates research at TD Securities. “We could see a rally.”

Summers’s friends expressed regret that the perception of him has been more caricature than reality, arguing that he would have pushed the Fed strongly to reduce unemployment and to demand more transparency in the financial system."

The tea partiers -- primarily Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) -- are blocking the Senate from appointing conferees to a conference committee with the House to work out the radical differences between the two budgets each side has passed.

That is often done in the Senate by unanimous consent. Other times, there are votes instructing conferees on how to try to shape the final bill. But the conservative cohorts want more. They are demanding that the Senate bar the conference members from doing anything that would raise the federal debt limit -- a demand that McCain lambasted for much of the week as unprecedented.

The debate intensified Wednesday, when McCain charged that the tea party members' opposition amounted to distrust of the House GOP leadership. And Cruz admitted it did. ""Let me be clear. I don't trust the Republicans,"" he said, lumping them in with Democrats.

But McCain has held his ground, suggesting on Thursday that senators who object to conference negotiations don't understand ""how business has been done"" in Congress. Moreover, McCain asserted that most GOP senators agree with him that it's time to stop stalling and go to conference.

Most senators asked by The Huffington Post said they do agree with McCain.

""I think it's a good idea to get a commitment not to raise the debt limit, but I trust the normal course of business -- that we're not going to use reconciliation to raise the debt limit,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. ""We can have a motion to instruct our conferees not to raise the debt limit by 51 votes, so I'm fine with going to conference.""

""People have strong feelings, and that's what it's all about,"" Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) explained of the tea party conservatives. ""But myself personally, I would very much like to see this resolved very quickly so that we can go to conference. I would like to see us appoint conferees.""

Even Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), a deficit hawk and the top Republican on the Budget Committee who said he understood the concerns over raising the debt limit, pointed out that the ultimate goal was to iron out differences through regular order.

""I think the right thing to do is get ourselves to conference,"" Sessions told HuffPost. ""Eventually we need to go forward and reach an agreement, the president needs to be engaged, and a conference provides an opportunity to do that.""

""I think there ought to be discussion, but ultimately we have to go to conference,"" said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).

Some senators said they found the stall tactics to be political grandstanding.

""It's all a political game,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) told HuffPost, adding that he supported regular order. ""This is a slowdown because the House wants a slowdown. As soon as the House doesn't want the slowdown, it will get released.""

Coburn's comments are oddly in line with recent arguments used by Democrats in the budget fight. House Republicans spent four years calling for regular order while berating the Senate for failing to pass a budget. When the Senate finally passed its budget resolution in March, Republicans were suddenly reluctant to convene a conference committee, even though without one, there can be no formal federal budget for the fifth year in a row.

Indeed, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday he's had ""private conversations this week on how we might move ahead, but we've not made any decisions at this point.""

Even some kindred conservatives in the House, however, said they would like to see the budget finished.

""These guys are blood brothers. I love 'em. In fact I would suggest to you, in all deference to Sen. McCain, they're far more in line with the rank-and-file members of the House than Sen. McCain is,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. ""That's probably an understatement.""

But Franks suggested that the best way to convince people in the long run was play by the rules, and keep making the argument. House leaders, he said, had to keep their eye on the bigger picture of what is possible, even if Franks disagrees.

""I understand the equation they're dealing with is almost untenable, mathematically,"" Franks said. ""If they do what people like me would like them to do, sometimes we end up, because we're so outnumbered, not being able to sustain that.""

And even though the tea partiers' fears may be realized, Franks said he thinks the process should proceed.

""What we have to do, still in a regular order situation, is to get the strongest thing that we can from the Senate that's the best for the country possible and do the same in the House, and then hope that the respective leaderships appoint the people that can sustain the best outcome possible,"" Franks said. ""If we have the right people on our conference side, I wouldn't be afraid of that at all.""

McCain said he couldn't speak for his colleagues in the House, but pointed out that the same group of senators threatened to filibuster the debate on gun control legislation and were ultimately convinced not to block debate.

""Any small group of senators can object to moving to conference on any piece of legislation because they object to their provision not being included in it?"" McCain said in a brief hallway interview. ""That would be a dreadful precedent to set in the United States Senate.""

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate GOP conference, was confident the matter would be resolved. He told HuffPost his colleagues had a ""legitimate fear"" over the debt limit, but stressed the need to figure out a path forward.

""Obviously we want to see a continued debate about the budget,"" Thune said. ""I think that's good for us, because we've been talking about debt, spending and taxes. I think those are good arguments for Republicans."""

Boxes and wooden crates filled with household items bound for the U.S. mainland are stacked high in the Rosa del Monte moving company’s cavernous warehouse, evidence of the historic rush of people abandoning this beautiful island.

The economy here has been in recession for nearly eight years, crimping tax revenue and pushing the jobless rate to nearly 15 percent. Meanwhile, the government is burdened by staggering debt, spawning comparisons to bankrupt Detroit and forcing lawmakers to severely slash pensions, cut government jobs and raise taxes in a furious effort to avert default.

The implications are serious for Americans outside Puerto Rico both because a taxpayer bailout would be expensive and a default would be far more disruptive than Detroit’s record bankruptcy filing in July. Officials in San Juan and Washington are adamant that a federal bailout is not on the table, but the situation is being closely monitored by the White House, which recently named an advisory team to help Puerto Rican officials navigate the crisis.

The island’s problems have ignited an exodus not seen here since the 1950s, when 500,000 people left for jobs on the mainland. Now Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, are again leaving in droves.

They are choosing the uncertainty of the job market in Orlando or New York City or Philadelphia over what they view as the certainty that their dreams would be crushed by the U.S. territory’s grinding economic problems.

“We used to move a lot of machinery into Puerto Rico, and executives who worked in the pharmaceutical industry here,” said Neftaly Rodriguez, whose father founded Rosa del Monte. “Now we are packing people up to go out. Everybody is looking for a better opportunity.”

Puerto Rico lost 54,000 residents — 1.5 percent of its population — between 2010 and 2012 alone. Since recession struck in 2006, the population has shrunk by more than 138,000 to 3.7 million, with the vast majority of the outflow headed to the mainland.

The brutal combination of a long recession, a shrinking population and overwhelming debt has left Puerto Rico’s political leaders struggling to manage a conundrum: How do they tame at least $70 billion in debt while marshaling the resources to grow a shrinking economy and battle corrosive social problems, including a homicide rate that is nearly six times the U.S. average?

The crisis has left Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Javier Garcia Padilla juggling competing demands for budget cuts and other types of austerity demanded by Wall Street rating agencies, and the incentives and other spending needed to ignite growth.

“Sometimes, you are between the wall and sword,” Padilla said in an interview.

Not long after Padilla took office in January, Wall Street debt rating agencies downgraded the island’s bonds to just one rung above junk status. Like states, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy. Also, Puerto Rico’s constitution offers bondholders strong guarantees that they would be paid before pensioners and public workers if the government went broke.

“I can assure you that Puerto Rico will not default,” Padilla said. “Puerto Rico will pay our debts. It is a constitutional obligation. But for me it is also a moral obligation.”

Still, with Detroit’s bankruptcy filing fresh in the minds of investors, the downgrade ignited widespread concern that the island was sliding toward default, which would hurt many investors across the United States. Because of their high yields and exemption from federal, state and local taxes, Puerto Rican bonds are held by three out of four municipal bond mutual funds, according to Morningstar, a market research firm.

“Some people might say, ‘This is their problem.’ But Puerto Rico is part of the United States, you own this problem,” said Pedro Pierluisi (D), Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative to Congress. “It is not like you can ignore it.”

For now, the debt problems have done damage mainly in Puerto Rico, where it substantially raised loan costs for a government that has come to rely heavily on borrowing to fund its daily operations.

“You cannot pay daily expenses with your credit card, and that’s what Puerto Rico has been doing for years,” said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director of the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan think tank. “We borrowed just to keep the lights on.”

Puerto Rico’s expansive web of debt includes standard government bonds as well as those floated by public corporations, including authorities for water and sewer, highways and electric power. Together, those bills have nearly tripled since 2000, as successive administrations turned to the bond market to plug gaping budget deficits. In addition to the $70 billion in government debt, the government also faces $37 billion in unfunded pension obligations, according to Morningstar.

The explosion of borrowing coincided with a marked slowdown in the economy, and when a lucrative tax credit for manufacturers was phased out in 2006, the island fell into recession.

For decades, Puerto Rico’s economy was powered by U.S. firms that set up factories here that allowed them to tap a large, relatively low-cost labor market and to book profits under the favorable tax laws, while keeping cash-intensive research and development operations — and the accompanying big tax write-offs — on the mainland.

First, shoe factories and textile mills dominated the economic landscape. Later, pharmaceutical firms turned the island into a hub of drug manufacturing. According to one investor research report, 16 of the 20 top-selling drugs in the United States are made on the island.

But eventually many of the clothing plants moved to more promising ports. Then a series of key drug patents expired, contributing to a sharp decline in manufacturing. Since 1996, the number of factory jobs in Puerto Rico plummeted from 160,000 to 75,000.

And while government workers make up about a quarter of the commonwealth’s workforce — much higher than the U.S. average of 16 percent — their ranks are shrinking as the pervasive debt and economic problems careen toward a reckoning. Now, just over 41 percent of working-age Puerto Ricans are in a job or even looking for one.

Miguel Rodriguez, 50, who was working on his résumé at a government employment office in San Juan, said he has been out of work for four years, making it difficult to support himself or pay child support. He noted that his plight is not unusual. “Here, it is very hard to find a job,” he said.

As work has disappeared, more Puerto Ricans have relied on the government to survive: About a third of the commonwealth’s population relies on food stamps, and residents of the island are twice as likely as those on the mainland to receive Social Security disability benefits, according to researchers.

All of those problems were compounded by a housing bust that took down three of the island’s banks, while leaving many Puerto Ricans as deeply in debt as their government. Now pawnshops and title loan operations, which give loans to people who put up their car titles as collateral, are a growing presence on the island.

At a Borinquen Title Loans office located in a former bank branch outside San Juan, an employee inspected a potential customer’s car in the small parking lot, while inside, employees were busy on computers.

“We see all kinds of people here,” from former professionals to out-of-work laborers, said area manager Rosemarie Velazquez. “Business has been good.”

Restoring economic growth is a top priority for Padilla, whose signature campaign promise was to create 50,000 jobs. That would normally call for spending, tax cuts and investments. But his other top priority, bringing the debt under control, calls for the government cutbacks and tax increases.

Since taking office, he has tried to do both. Under pressure from the Wall Street rating agencies, his administration has enacted reforms far more dramatic than those made by cash-strapped states on the mainland.

He enacted $1.3 billion in taxes including increased corporate taxes, a broadened sales tax and a new gross receipts levy. The percentage increase in taxes is far larger than what the federal government has ever imposed, according to Richard Larkin, senior vice president of H.J. Sims, an investment firm.

“To say that Puerto Rico’s tax increase for 2014 was monumental is an understatement,” Larkin wrote.

Padilla also has continued government job cuts begun by his predecessor as governor. Together the two leaders have cut about one in 10 jobs from the public payroll.

The changes have put the government on course to shrink the current year’s budget deficit from an estimated $2.2 billion to about $870 million. The plan going forward is to reduce the deficit by half every year, and totally eliminate it by 2016, officials said.

To bolster the severely underfunded government pension plans, Padilla shifted many government workers from traditional pensions to 401(k)-type retirement plans, while raising retirement ages and increasing employee contributions to the plans. He also promised a series of increases in the government’s pension contributions to fortify the severely underfunded plans.

Meanwhile, economic development officials are stepping up efforts to generate growth on the island. The government has enacted tax incentives and offered electricity credits to entice firms that might be discouraged by Puerto Rico’s electricity costs, which are double the average on the mainland.

Officials also are searching for an operator for a $300 million port project that can handle the mega-ships that will soon traverse an expanded Panama Canal, and they are working to bolster the tourism trade, which accounts for a paltry 6 percent of the tropical island’s economic activity. They say they already are seeing success, including new air routes to the island and commitments to build hundreds of new hotel rooms.

“[Previously,] we were lazy and complacent,” said Alberto Baco, Puerto Rico’s secretary of economic development and commerce. “Now we have to act fast.”

But it remains to be seen whether the government’s actions will be enough to stave off the crisis. Earlier this month, the rating agency Fitch warned that Puerto Rico’s general obligation bonds could be downgraded to junk status next summer because of concerns that the commonwealth would be unable to return to the market anytime soon to borrow more at a reasonable cost.

Another downgrade would be a severe blow for Puerto Rico, effectively cutting it off from the market and paralyzing its efforts to dig out from under its mountain of debt.

If that happens, Lamba-Nieves, the director of the Center for a New Economy, said the federal government could feel pressure to step in with some type of bailout. “Puerto Rico might be a little too big to fail,” he said.

President Obama warns of default if debt ceiling is not increased

Obama again blamed the ongoing government shutdown on Republicans

Economically%2C a default would be worse than a shutdown%2C Obama says

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the home state of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

President Obama broadened his focus in the budget battle Thursday, saying a government default on its debts would hurt the economy worse than the ongoing government shutdown.

""As reckless as a government shutdown is ... an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,"" Obama said during an appearance at a construction company in Rockville, Md.

Obama also called on House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to put a ""clean"" spending bill on the floor with no health care restrictions, predicting it would pass and ""the shutdown would end today.""

Boehner ""won't even let the bill get a yes or no vote because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party,"" Obama said.

Default would be the result if Congress does not increase the debt ceiling by Oct. 17, Obama said, noting that the debt limit allows the government to borrow money to pay its debt.

Without the authority, the United States would see its credit rating drop, while Americans would see rises in interest rates that would curb economic activity across the world, said the president.

An ""economic shutdown"" could lead to delays of Social Security checks and disability benefits, Obama said.

He told a crowd of supporters: ""Falling pensions and home values and rising interest rates on things like mortgages and student loans -- all those things risk putting us back into a bad recession.""

As the existing shutdown of government operations entered its third day, Obama again blamed Republican conservatives who want to gut the new health care bill.

""This whole thing is about one thing,"" Obama said. ""The Republican obsessions with dismantling the Affordable Care Act.""

The Republican-run House has passed temporary spending plans that include a one-year delay of Obama's health care law — a provision Obama and the Democratic-run Senate say is unacceptable. The Senate has rejected three attempts to pass a bill paying for government services while also trying to delay all or parts of the health care law.

Obama, who met with congressional leaders at the White House on Wednesday night, repeated his stance that he would not negotiate health care and budget issues until the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is raised.

Republicans, meanwhile, called Obama's no-negotiation pledge an obstacle to his goals.

""Now we hear he's off campaigning today in Rockville, rather than sitting down to get this thing solved,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""It's disappointing.""

Boehner said that House Republicans ""have sent bill after bill after bill to the Senate to keep the government open, and Democrats have rejected every one of them — refusing to even talk about our differences.""

In urging Boehner to call a vote on a bill without health care restrictions, Obama said the ""one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown"" is a spending plan ""with no partisan strings attached.""

Referring to Tea Party Republicans, Obama said the impasse is due to ""one faction of one party in one half of one branch of government.""

Obama spoke less than an hour after the Treasury Department issued a report saying that a default could plunge the nation into a recession worse than the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008.

In previous weeks, the Treasury Department has warned that the debt ceiling will be breached on Oct. 17."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/food-stamp-cuts_n_3671142.html,2013-07-29 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],"Food Stamp Cuts Set To Kick In, Congress Not Paying Attention","WASHINGTON -- Regardless of whether Republicans succeed in cutting food stamps this year, the 22 million American households relying on the program will see their benefits drop in November.

The looming reduction has received little attention since lawmakers set it in motion years ago. The average household's monthly benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will drop by $20 or $25, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington think tank.

""The general public doesn't realize it,"" Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We certainly know the low income people on SNAP don't know the cut is coming.""

Cole's organization is publicizing the cut with a countdown clock. On Monday the clock indicated there are 94 days ""until every SNAP (food stamps) household in America gets a little hungrier.""

But Congress has little appetite for intervention, as the consensus among lawmakers is not whether food stamps should be reduced, but by how much.

The November reduction is happening separately from the debate over cutting food stamps as part of a broader farm bill. The cut is set to kick in because a 13 percent benefit boost from the 2009 stimulus bill is expiring. Initially, the plan was to let inflation catch up with the increase so that SNAP recipients would never see a month-to-month dollar decline.

But in 2010, Senate Democrats and the Obama administration needed money to offset the cost of a series of spending bills. They said at the time they would replace the money later, but they never did. Congressional attitudes toward food stamp recipients have only gotten less generous since then.

The $668 maximum monthly benefit for a family of four will fall to $643, according to the Center on Budget's Stacy Dean and Dottie Rosenbaum. (The average household's monthly benefit is $287.)

""This cut will be the equivalent of taking away 14 meals per month for a family of four, or 11 meals for a family of three,"" Dean and Rosenbaum wrote in a May report. The pair said that states should make sure recipients know when the cut is around the corner.

First and foremost, Cole said her mission is to get the word out in Texas. Her organization represents 21 food banks serving all parts of the state. Cole also wants members of Congress to feel some pressure.

""I want them to not be able to do it without feeling the shame that they're doing something wrong,"" she said.

Bowles and Simpson were the co-chairmen of President Obama's bipartisan fiscal commission in 2010, and their recommendations came to serve as a yardstick for other debt-reduction proposals.

Since the fiscal commission disbanded, Congress and the White House have enacted about $2.7 trillion worth of savings that will occur over the next decade.

The $2.4 trillion in deficit cuts in the new Bowles-Simpson proposal would be made between 2014 and 2023 and come on top of the $2.7 trillion already passed.

Another $2.4 trillion is needed to stabilize the debt and put it on a path to fall below 70% of GDP, according to estimates by the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Related: What you need to know about the sequester

The amount of debt reduction recommended by Bowles and Simpson is a more ambitious goal than President Obama has set.

Obama is aiming for another $1.5 trillion in savings, which would stabilize the debt at 73% of GDP by the end of the decade. And it's a less stringent, more gradual approach than the stated House Republican goal of erasing all annual deficits by 2023.

In any case, they characterize their new recommendation not as the ""best"" or the ""right"" framework. They said they see it simply as the ""minimum that policymakers must do.""

Bowles and Simpson suggest the $2.4 trillion in savings could be achieved through a combination of measures, some of which were in their original fiscal commission 2010 plan:

Taxes: Enacting tax reform that eliminates or minimizes tax expenditures. The revenue raised would be used to reduce deficits and to pay for the cost of lowering tax rates and simplifying the tax code. The new framework calls for tax reform to raise about one-quarter of the $2.4 trillion -- or $600 billion.

Medicare: Reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending by cutting payments to health care providers, changing incentives for providers and beneficiaries, and increasing premiums for high earners, among other changes. Bowles and Simpson say Medicare changes should account for another $600 billion.

Inflation-adjusted payments: Adopting a less generous and some say more accurate inflation formula, known as ""chained CPI,"" for any federal payments that are adjusted for cost of living, such as Social Security benefits. Chained CPI would also apply to inflation adjustments for income tax brackets.

Other measures: Curb farm subsidies and increase how much civilian and military personnel contribute to their health and retirement plans.

The framework calls for half of the $2.4 trillion to be raised through these savings, combined with stricter limits on discretionary spending, along with chained CPI and interest savings.

In addition, the new Bowles-Simpson framework calls for lawmakers to go beyond that $2.4 trillion for the long-term. Among other things, they recommend Congress agree to Social Security reforms this year and earmark future savings for the program.

The Bowles-Simpson recommendations are bound to draw vehement opposition.

Many Democrats oppose changes to entitlement programs unless they only affect the wealthy. And many Republicans refuse to consider raising any new revenue for deficit reduction through tax reform.

Bowles and Simpson plan to release more detailed recommendations at some point in coming weeks to flesh out their framework after consulting with members of Congress.

Since their work on the fiscal commission, they have been trying to coax lawmakers to negotiate a ""grand bargain.""

Most recently Bowles and Simpson co-founded the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a nonpartisan group advocating for debt-reduction. The campaign has a bipartisan steering committee made up of former politicians, deficit hawks and business people, and a CEO council that has drawn fire mostly from the left, but also from some business groups for its call for more revenue."

White House chief of staff Denis McDonough made his first tour of Sunday talk shows to warn about the impact of $85 billion in automatic budget cuts set to hit on March 1.

McDonough also said President Obama wants to work with Republicans on an agreement to reduce the federal debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, provided it includes new tax revenues as well as budget cuts.

""We're going to insist on doing this in a balanced way, a way that allows us to maintain the kinds of investments that middle-class families in this country rely on,"" McDonough said on ABC's This Week.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other Republicans note that Obama got higher tax rates in the ""fiscal cliff"" deal in early January, and this debt reduction agreement should be spending cuts only.

In the meanwhile, the White House and Congress brace for the March 1 ""sequester,"" $85 billion to be split between domestic and defense programs.

McDonough, who also appeared on NBC's Meet The Press and CBS' Face the Nation, said the automatic cuts would gut items ranging from education to mental health to food inspections, as well as critical national security programs.

""You've already heard the devastating list of horribles that the Pentagon has said are going to be out there,"" McDonough said.

In order to avoid all of that, McDonough said Obama is ""ready to do another $1.5 trillion to get up to the $4 trillion target that economists across the country tell us is needed to stabilize the debt over the next 10 years.""

The president will also insists on a ""balanced"" plan, McDonough said; i.e., new tax revenues to be derived by ending certain loopholes and deductions.

""Let's fix this in a kind of balanced way ... with a reasonable amount of spending cuts and a reasonable amount of revenue raisers so that we can get this thing done and move on to the business of the country,"" McDonough said."

The GOP wants to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program so that more recipients must be working or in training to qualify for food stamps. ""Newscasts tell stories of young surfers who aren’t working, but cash their food stamps in for lobster,"" the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) has said in background documents explaining the proposals to reporters.

The newscasts in question are two Fox News stories about one 29-year-old California food stamp recipient who harbors no ambition to get a job.

“This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” the man said in the stories, copies of which Fox distributed to Capitol Hill offices. “It’s free food; it’s awesome.”

Just wanting a job wouldn't be awesome enough to satisfy Republicans' proposed rules, however. While merely seeking work fulfills a requirement of unemployment insurance, SNAP recipients would have to do better.

""If you’re looking for work but can’t find it, and you can’t find a place in a work or training program -- something only a few states make available to all of these individuals -- you will lose SNAP after three months,"" Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget Priorities said in a Wednesday blog post. The Center on Budget has been the foremost critic of the legislation outside of Congress.

Able-bodied adults without children would be eligible for only three months of benefits under the GOP plan unless they're working, training, or volunteering 20 hours per week -- a pre-existing requirement that most states have waived because of high unemployment. Republicans have cited Congressional Research Service data showing that able-bodied adults without dependents had risen to 10.2 percent of the overall SNAP population in 2011, up from 6.6 percent in 2007.

Overall SNAP enrollment surged to 47 million in 2012 because the Great Recession and its aftermath made more Americans poor enough to qualify. Republicans prefer to blame liberal policy for the increase, so their bill would take the waivers away.

Republicans also want states to be able to require working-age SNAP recipients with children older than one year to obey the work requirements outlined in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, meaning at least 20 hours per week at a job, volunteering, or participating in a state-run training or work-search program. But the legislation doesn't require states to make space available to SNAP recipients in such a program. Since it would allow states to keep half the savings from reduced enrollment, critics like Greenstein say the bill essentially pays states to kick people off food stamps.

Despite slacker stereotypes, the share of food stamp recipients who work has risen over time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 30 percent of SNAP recipients worked in 2010, up from fewer than 20 percent in 1990. Most of the rest are either elderly, children, or disabled.

The CBO has estimated that the Republican legislation would result in 3.8 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps next year and would save $39 billion over 10 years. But House Republicans are unlikely to get their way -- even if the bill passes the House on Thursday afternoon, the Democratic Senate is unlikely to accept most of its provisions, and the White House has already threatened a veto.

Even without new legislation, all food stamp beneficiaries will see an across-the-board drop in the value of their benefits this November thanks to the expiration of a boost from the 2009 stimulus bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/veterans-fight-changes-disability-payments-070421575--politics.html,,[],Veterans fight changes to disability payments,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Veterans groups are rallying to fight any proposal to change disability payments as the federal government attempts to address its long-term debt problem. They say they've sacrificed already.

Government benefits are adjusted according to inflation, and President Barack Obama has endorsed using a slightly different measure of inflation to calculate Social Security benefits. Benefits would still grow but at a slower rate.

Advocates for the nation's 22 million veterans fear that the alternative inflation measure would also apply to disability payments to nearly 4 million veterans as well as pension payments for an additional 500,000 low-income veterans and surviving families.

""I think veterans have already paid their fair share to support this nation,"" said the American Legion's Louis Celli. ""They've paid it in lower wages while serving, they've paid it through their wounds and sacrifices on the battlefield and they're paying it now as they try to recover from those wounds.""

Economists generally agree that projected long-term debt increases stemming largely from the growth in federal health care programs pose a threat to the country's economic competitiveness. Addressing the threat means difficult decisions for lawmakers and pain for many constituents in the decades ahead.

But the veterans' groups point out that their members bore the burden of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past month, they've held news conferences on Capitol Hill and raised the issue in meetings with lawmakers and their staffs. They'll be closely watching the unveiling of the president's budget next month to see whether he continues to recommend the change.

Obama and others support changing the benefit calculations to a variation of the Consumer Price Index, a measure called ""chained CPI."" The conventional CPI measures changes in retail prices of a constant marketbasket of goods and services. Chained CPI considers changes in the quantity of goods purchased as well as the prices of those goods. If the price of steak goes up, for example, many consumers will buy more chicken, a cheaper alternative to steak, rather than buying less steak or going without meat.

Story continues

Supporters argue that chained CPI is a truer indication of inflation because it measures changes in consumer behavior. It also tends to be less than the conventional CPI, which would impact how cost-of-living raises are computed.

Under the current inflation update, monthly disability and pension payments increased 1.7 percent this year. Under chained CPI, those payments would have increased 1.4 percent.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that moving to chained CPI would trim the deficit by nearly $340 billion over the next decade. About two-thirds of the deficit closing would come from less spending and the other third would come from additional revenue because of adjustments that tax brackets would undergo.

Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said she understands why veterans, senior citizens and others have come out against the change, but she believes it's necessary.

""We are in an era where benefits are going to be reduced and revenues are going to rise. There's just no way around that. We're on an unsustainable fiscal course,"" Sawhill said. ""Dealing with it is going to be painful, and the American public has not yet accepted that. As long as every group keeps saying, 'I need a carve-out, I need an exception,' this is not going to work.""

Sawhill argued that making changes now will actually make it easier for veterans in the long run.

""The longer we wait to make these changes, the worse the hole we'll be in and the more draconian the cuts will have to be,"" she said.

That's not the way Sen. Bernie Sanders sees it. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs said he recently warned Obama that every veterans group he knows of has come out strongly against changing the benefit calculations for disability benefits and pensions by using chained CPI.

""I don't believe the American people want to see our budget balanced on the backs of disabled veterans. It's especially absurd for the White House, which has been quite generous in terms of funding for the VA,"" said Sanders, I-Vt. ""Why they now want to do this, I just don't understand.""

Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate to approve an amendment last week against changing how the cost-of-living increases are calculated, but the vote was largely symbolic. Lawmakers would still have a decision to make if moving to chained CPI were to be included as part of a bargain on taxes and spending.

Sanders' counterpart on the House side, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, appears at least open to the idea of going to chained CPI.

""My first priority is ensuring that America's more than 20 million veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned, but with a national debt fast approaching $17 trillion, Washington's fiscal irresponsibility may threaten the very provision of veterans' benefits,"" Miller said. ""Achieving a balanced budget and reducing our national debt will help us keep the promises America has made to those who have worn the uniform, and I am committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to do just that.""

Marshall Archer, 30, a former Marine Corps corporal who served two stints in Iraq, has a unique perspective about the impact of slowing the growth of veterans' benefits. He collects disability payments to compensate him for damaged knees and shoulders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. He also works as a veterans' liaison for the city of Portland, Maine, helping some 200 low-income veterans find housing.

Archer notes that on a personal level, the reduction in future disability payments would also be accompanied down the road by a smaller Social Security check when he retires. That means he would take a double hit to his income.

""We all volunteered to serve, so we all volunteered to sacrifice,"" he said. ""I don't believe that you should ever ask those who have already volunteered to sacrifice to then sacrifice again.""

That said, Archer indicated he would be willing to ""chip in"" if he believes that everyone is required to give as well.

He said he's more worried about the veterans he's trying to help find a place to sleep. About a third of his clients rely on VA pension payments averaging just over $1,000 a month. He said their VA pension allows them to pay rent, heat their home and buy groceries, but that's about it.

""This policy, if it ever went into effect, would actually place those already in poverty in even more poverty,"" Archer said.

The changes that would occur by using the slower inflation calculation seem modest at first. For a veteran with no dependents who has a 60 percent disability rating, the use of chained CPI this year would have lowered the veteran's monthly payments by $3 a month. Instead of getting $1,026 a month, the veteran would have received $1,023.

Raymond Kelly, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, acknowledged that veterans would see little change in their income during the first few years of the change. But even a $36 hit over the course of a year is ""huge"" for many of the disabled veterans living on the edge, he said.

The amount lost over time becomes more substantial as the years go by. Sanders said that a veteran with a 100 percent disability rating who begins getting payments at age 30 would see their annual payments trimmed by more than $2,300 a year when they turn 55.

A possible federal government shutdown could put a serious damper on your travel plans.

If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, tourists may experience travel delays and won’t be able to access some of the country’s top sites, including the Statue of Liberty and other attractions run by the National Park Service.

The possible government shut down doesn’t just impact tourists; it can affect school trips, weddings and have a detrimental knock-on effect for local business that rely on tourism this time of the year.

Here are some questions answered to help you navigate a federal shutdown:

Will airports be open and security screening take place? Yes, expect some delays, but security will remain tight. According to the TSA, nonessential employees will be furloughed, but “the majority of our officers who screen passengers/luggage will remain on the job,” TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein tweeted.

Will my flight take off? Yes, federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job.

Can I get a last minute passport? Probably not. The Department of State says that it would continue processing foreign applications for visas and U.S. applications for passports. That’s because it has some funds outside the annual congressional appropriation. But if the government shuts down, you should expect delays. During the other government shut down in 1995-1996, 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas went unprocessed each day, while 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went unprocessed, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.

Will all national parks, museums and zoos sites really be closed? Yes, and you can add battle fields, historic homes, monuments or any other federally funded tourist site to that list. That’s 401 sites in all, including the Smithsonian museums, Great Smoky Mountains, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island in New York, as well as Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.

Can at least watch the Baby Panda Cam? Sadly, you’ll have to get your dose of cuteness somewhere else. The daily antics of the newborn panda cub on the National Zoo’s ""Baby Panda Cam"" have become a popular pastime for thousands of viewers. The zoo said that managing the panda cam requires staff and volunteers.

Wait! What if I am already at a park at a remote camp site? Park officials probably have already notified you that you’ll have to leave. They should have given you 48 hours prior notice for you to make alternate plans.

Can I get a gun permit for a gun I want for my hunting trip? If you don’t already have a gun permit, you probably won’t be able to get one.

Should I plan on taking Amtrak for my trip from Boston to Washington? Yes. Amtrak, which relies on federal subsidies, is vowing to keep operating, saying that, ""Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor and across the country in the coming days and weeks can be assured that Amtrak will remain open for business.""

Will I be able to get back into U.S. after my trip to Niagara Falls? Yes, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers should remain on duty, so you can clear immigration and customs in the U.S., though staffing may be more limited than usual. CBP said it is unsure of how the shutdown will affect the processing of applications filed at the border."

Members of the House of Representatives urged Obama Thursday to appoint a permanent leader of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) who will support aggressive steps to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

The group of 45 representatives, led by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John F. Tierney (D-Mass.), is asking Obama to fill the director spot at the FHFA with a person who will consider a loan principal reduction program to aid ""underwater"" homeowners -- those who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth. The agency oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is currently run by acting director Edward DeMarco.

The signatories noted that there are “approximately 10.9 million residential borrowers” who are underwater on their mortgages.

“It is imperative that we have a strong leader at FHFA to take on these challenges, strengthen the housing market, and promote our nation’s continued economic recovery,” the members of Congress wrote.

The letter is likely to reignite calls in Washington for Obama to fire DeMarco, who assumed his position when the president’s nominee to head the agency was blocked from confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

“In the three and a half years since Edward J. DeMarco was designated Acting Director of FHFA,” the press release announcing the letter noted, “questions have persisted about his repeated failure to utilize the authorities available to FHFA to promote a healthy housing finance market.”

The members of Congress further painted the acting director in the letter as someone who “is not interested in obtaining real-world evidence that might contradict his pre-established views.”

Last summer, DeMarco rankled administration officials and others working to stanch the national foreclosure rate when he refused a request from the Treasury Department to implement a principal reduction and debt forgiveness program for certain underwater homeowners.

At the time, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote DeMarco that he was “concerned by [his] continued opposition to allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) to use targeted principal reduction in their loan modification programs.” Geithner added that he did not ""believe it is the best decision for the country.""

Some analysts expected that Obama would replace DeMarco through a December recess appointment. In October, the Financial Times reported that the Obama administration was ""quietly telling housing industry activists"" that there is a plan to replace DeMarco.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-mounts-local-media-blitz-sequester-141156862--politics.html,,[],Obama mounts local media blitz on sequester,"President Barack Obama will pound away at Republicans on Wednesday over the automatic “sequester” spending cuts in a series of eight local interviews, the White House announced.

Obama will speak to reporters from Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Honolulu, Oklahoma City, Wichita, Kan., San Antonio, Texas, and Charleston, S.C.

“By speaking to anchors from stations around the country, the President will have an opportunity to focus on the harmful local impacts that will be felt if Congressional Republicans refuse to compromise,” an Obama aide said in an email sent to reporters.

The president has been arguing that the only thing holding up a compromise that would avert the cuts—which both sides have characterized as damaging to national security and the fragile recovery—is Republican opposition to closing tax loopholes that chiefly benefit wealthy Americans or rich corporations. Republicans say Obama already got all of the tax hikes he’s going to get in the deal on the fiscal cliff, and that it's time to focus on spending cuts.

The GOP has also hit the president for proposing fresh infrastructure spending. Obama, said the aide, was to defend that approach in the interviews as “smart investments we need to make to boost our economy even as we reduce the deficit.” Infrastructure spending—on roads, bridges and other structures—is tailor-made for interviews with local anchors. The president could list specific projects—and may well do just that.

“The president will announce a plan to cut federal review and permitting timelines for construction projects such as highways, bridges, railways, ports, waterways, pipelines, and renewable energy,” said the Obama aide, who requested anonymity.

“In talking with local anchors, he will also have the opportunity to discuss specific, important projects in their communities that stand to benefit from these initiatives,” the aide said."
http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-push-extend-emergency-u-jobless-benefits-202401686--business.html,,[],Democrats push to extend emergency U.S. jobless benefits,"By Caren Bohan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats are pushing to extend emergency unemployment benefits, saying they are needed to help the economy and provide a safety net for Americans struggling in a sluggish job market. Extending unemployment benefits is a priority of President Barack Obama, and his fellow Democrats see an opportunity to include such an extension in a possible budget deal that is being negotiated by a bipartisan panel led by Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington. ""This is a human crisis for hundreds of thousands of people,"" said Michigan Congressman Sander Levin, senior Democrat on the House of Representative Ways and Means Committee and a lead sponsor of legislation in the House that would continue federal unemployment benefits through 2014. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, is a lead sponsor of identical legislation in the Senate. Without the legislation, 1.3 million Americans will see their benefits expire in the week of December 28, Democrats warned. That would have ripple effects through the economy because it would curb household spending while the economy is growing at only a modest pace. The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7.3 percent in October, according to the Labor Department. Federal unemployment benefits kick in for out-of-work Americans who have exhausted their state unemployment aid, which in many states runs out after 26 weeks. The emergency aid began during the Great Recession in 2008 and has been renewed every year since, most recently as part of the budget deal to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" of automatic tax increases. The budget negotiating panel faces a December 13 deadline to reach a deal. A month later, on January 15, funding for federal agencies is due to run out unless Congress can agree on spending measures. Democratic supporters of the unemployment insurance legislation said there are other possible bills to which they might seek to attach the extension, but they view the budget negotiations as the best avenue for getting it passed by Congress.

E. coli outbreaks. Millions of dollars in economic losses.

These are among the scenarios the Obama administration warned about last month as it claimed the sequester would force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to furlough meat inspectors.

But while the administration prepares to take that step, it continues to pursue a ""partnership"" with the Mexican government to ""raise awareness"" about food stamps among immigrants from that country. When a top Senate Republican proposed cutting off funds for that program last week -- in the form of an amendment to a budget resolution -- Democrats on the Budget Committee shot it down.

It's hard to put a firm price on the cost of the partnership, which was launched under the George W. Bush administration. But an aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who has railed against the partnership for months, said it could easily be in the millions. Since 2004, the program has blossomed to include dozens of meetings and conferences and health fairs with Mexican officials -- all of which cost money, not to mention the cost to the food stamp program of new enrollees brought in as a result of this partnership.

Sessions, in a statement to FoxNews.com, said he believes the public will eventually demand an end to the program, though the Senate Budget Committee allowed it to continue in the vote last week.

More On This...

""We have uncovered extensive evidence that federal authorities have -- during the Bush and Obama administrations -- aggressively undermined a core legal tenet of immigration policy: that those granted admission should be self-sufficient and contribute to the economic health of the nation,"" Sessions said. ""It is amazing that Budget Committee Democrats would unanimously vote to continue funding these costly promotions, especially when our debt is causing such profound economic harm.""

According to a letter from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to Sessions last September, the ""partnership"" since 2004 has included roughly 91 meetings between U.S. and Mexico embassy and consulate staff; 29 health fair events; and 31 roundtable discussions, conferences and forums in 20 cities.

Twenty percent of the meetings and activities occurred since 2008, according to Vilsack's letter. Sessions is concerned the collaboration amounts to a vehicle for the USDA to pressure people onto the food-stamp rolls -- in this case, noncitizen immigrants from Mexico.

The USDA denies this. In his letter last year, Vilsack said the purpose is ""to help eligible people in need make informed decisions about whether or not to seek assistance.""

The initiative is one of several the agency has ""to promote awareness of nutrition assistance among those who need benefits and meet all program requirements under current law,"" Vilsack told Sessions in the 24-page letter.

However, his letter indicates the number of legal, noncitizens participating in the program -- now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- has increased from 425,000 to 1.23 million between 2001 and 2010.

Meanwhile, the USDA continues to press forward with plans to furlough meat inspectors, describing it as a necessity of the sequester -- though the department has eased off a bit on warnings that this could lead to more foodborne illness, since all meat and poultry will still have to be inspected."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/27/fiscal-hawks-say-government-waste-unspent-funds-could-offset-sequester/,2013-02-27 00:00:00,[],"Fiscal hawks say government waste, unspent funds could offset sequester","While the Obama administration says automatic spending cuts will mean budget pain for Americans everywhere, lawmakers say the government is sitting on more than enough money to soften the blow.

The sequester is expected to take a $85 billion bite out of the fiscal 2013 budget, though only half of that impact is expected to be felt this year.

But lawmakers say the government already has $45 billion in unspent money which could be used to offset the shortfall

""There are pots of money sitting in different departments across the federal government, that have been authorized over either ... a number of months or a number of years,"" Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., said.

Fresh legislation would authorize that money, which hasn't yet been spent, to be used elsewhere.

Price introduced that legislation Tuesday along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. It would require the director of the White House budget office to rescind funds that haven't yet been obligated.

More On This...

""Washington's reckless spending culture has produced this situation where hundreds of billions of dollars are borrowed and then left unspent because Congress routinely bites off more than it can chew,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Republican Sen. Tom Coburn has also identified several programs at the Pentagon he'd set aside, including a video called ""grill sergeants"" in which the instructors show their favorite recipes; money for a plan to send a space ship to another solar system; funds to find advancements in beef jerky from France; and $6 billion on questionable research, including what lessons about democracy and decision-making could be learned -- from fish.

Coburn and others also refer to what they call ""duplication nation"" -- dozens of programs intended for the same purpose.

""There are 50 different literacy agencies, 100 different programs focused on science, tech and engineering,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said.

Nevertheless, one Democrat mocked those who argue Washington should cut back the way families do.

""Can't we just cut 2 percent just like American families?"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., echoing the question posed repeatedly by GOP lawmakers. ""American families don't run prisons. They don't build their own roads. They don't have to put out their own local police department.""

Though Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano argues the sequester threatens border security, Citizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz says the department has $9 billion dollars in unspent preparedness funds.

He also cited one government study that found 47 job training programs across the federal government.

Further, critics point to $90,000 spent to upgrade security at a spring training site in Arizona for professional baseball teams.

Then there's allegations of waste at the General Services Administration. The agency, which runs federal properties, won notoriety when a regional director famously memorialized a lavish government-paid trip to Vegas with a photo of himself in a hot tub.

But aside from the money spent on conferences, lawmakers note that many buildings in the GSA inventory go unused.

In 2010, President Obama said GSA had roughly $15 billion in property that should be sold by 2014. Only a portion has been so far. As of January 2012, the administration claimed they had reduced real property spending by $2.4 billion from the sale of underutilized federal properties and better management.

Some lawmakers hope that the panic over the sequester, which will hit Friday absent any congressional intervention, will force a closer look at wasteful spending.

(CNN) —

The Detroit bankruptcy case is acting as a Rorschach test for so many challenges that bedevil older industrial cities in the United States and beyond. A common one: How do older cities rocked by deindustrialization and the loss of population and jobs redefine their economic function and find a new reason to live in a shifting global economy?

The experiences of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio offer cause for hope and a roadmap for reinvention and renewal.

With the collapse of the steel industry in the early 1980s, the Pittsburgh metro area endured the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in just three years; the city’s population declined by almost 12.7% during the full decade. Fast forward 30 years, and it is clear that the city and broader metropolis have regained their footing through a series of strategic and sustained interventions.

Smart public, private and civic leadership has helped diversify the economy toward health care and technology, building off a solid base of advanced research institutions and medical campuses (“eds and meds”), such as Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Smart urban regeneration tactics have successfully repurposed waterfront locations, historic buildings and even brown-field sites into new walkable places valued by innovative firms and talented workers.

An impressive 25% of the jobs in the Pittsburgh metro area are within three miles of the central business district, compared with just 7% in Detroit. With such employment density, reasonable housing costs and ample cultural amenities, the city now routinely places at or near the top of worldwide livability rankings.

Northeast Ohio – which spans the four metropolitan areas of Cleveland, Akron, Canton and Youngstown – provides a more recent example of renewal. In the early 2000s, the Cleveland Plain Dealer chronicled the “quiet crisis” that was gradually bleeding the region of people, jobs and vitality.

In response, philanthropic institutions pooled their resources and supported a series of institutions and intermediaries, including the Fund for Our Economic Future, BioEnterprise and Nortech, to identify precisely the region’s untapped potential in emerging technology, health care, energy and manufacturing clusters and then help small- and medium-sized firms meet the demand for new products and services.

As in Pittsburgh, these efforts leveraged Northeast Ohio’s stellar network of advanced research institutions and medical campuses, many of which (e.g., the Cleveland Clinic) sit at the cores of the region’s central cities.

The result in less than a decade has been impressive: an additional 10,500 jobs, $333 million in payroll, $1.9 billion in investments, including the first nationally designated additive manufacturing institute in Youngstown.

The examples of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio provide a road map for the renewal not only of Detroit but of older industrial cities more generally.

RoboCop creator: Detroit shows the film’s fictional future is upon us

First, form and sustain a network.

Cities and metropolitan areas are powerful because they are networks – of corporate, philanthropic, university, community and government institutions and leaders. Each element of the network is not big enough or rich enough to power economic restructuring. But, taken together, they have the potential to design and deliver transformative initiatives and interventions.

Second, set a distinctive vision for economic growth grounded in your region’s special assets and advantages.

Shakespeare was right; what’s past is prologue. Northeast Ohio, for example, shows how specialties designed for car manufacturing can be repurposed. As Akron’s tire making industry declined, companies working with local universities shifted their focus and research efforts into the related business of polymers. The former Rubber Capital of the World now makes polymers and plastics that can be used in clean energy and biotech.

Third, find the series of game changers that have the potential to create jobs in the near term and alter the trajectory of your economy over the long haul.

In Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio, the signature game changer has been collaboration–among companies, universities, entrepreneurs and supportive institutions – to help reshape the economy and create a sense of place and to grow quality jobs in quality places.

The revival of Detroit is not a fanciful dream; in fact it has already begun. According to research in progress by the Brookings Institution and The Reinvestment Fund, Detroit’s historic downtown and midtown core is 3 percent of the city’s land mass but home to 37 percent of its jobs, and residential and business growth is underway.

This growth includes new corporate residents like Quicken Loans bringing over 7,000 new jobs downtown since 2007, and older anchor institutions like Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and the College for Creative Studies driving over $1.8 billion in investments to midtown over the past decade.

This resurgence of Detroit’s core builds off the physical “bones” (such as historic buildings, revised riverfront) of the city and the enviable assets in the broader metropolis, including a relatively high concentration of workers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, given the region’s concentration in advanced manufacturing.

And the resurgence is stewarded by the leadership of re-energized networks of philanthropies like the New Economy Initiative, as well as the work of capable institutions like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, Midtown Detroit and Invest Detroit. With such advantages, now is the time to revive the city from the core and set ambitious goals for housing, job and fiscal growth that benefits all residents.

Detroit’s future, in short, is still to be written.

Private, civic, and, yes, public investors like the federal government must double down on this momentum, and invest in that future to make it a bright one.

Story highlights Spending cuts prompt tower closures at small and medium airports, agency tells operators It says 16 more towers will close on September 30 FAA says keeping any of the towers open would require showing it's in national interest The move applies only to contract towers, which use contractors, not FAA employees

(CNN) —

The federal government will close 173 air traffic control towers at small- and medium-size airports on April 7 because of forced spending cuts, the Federal Aviation Administration told tower operators Tuesday. It will close another 16 towers on September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Spenser Dickerson, head of the Contract Tower Association, told CNN that FAA officials gave him the news, capping off a five-day period in which the FAA first told contractors they would close scores of towers, then backtracked on the news.

The FAA said it would consider removing individual towers from the list on a case-by-case basis, if the operators can explain why it is in the national interest to keep them open, Dickerson said.

The news Tuesday, if anything, was worse than previously announced. Last Wednesday, the FAA said it would close 168 towers.

Some Democrats oppose GOP plan for government funding

“We’re extremely discouraged and disappointed that the FAA is taking this action,” Dickerson said. “The rest of the FAA’s budget is getting a 5% haircut; the contract towers are getting a 75% cut, because the FAA is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers.”

“It’s hard for us to see the fairness in the budget cuts. It seems the contract tower program is taking a high, disproportionate cut. We have serious concerns about the safety, efficiency and loss of jobs in almost 150 communities across the country,” he said.

The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The towers are part of the FAA’s contract tower program, in which 251 towers are staffed with contractors instead of FAA employees. Though little-known, contract towers are widely used by the FAA to manage air traffic. Such towers handle approximately 28% of all control tower operations, although the towers being cut account for a little less than 6% of commercial airline operations.

John Cozart, CEO of Robinson Aviation Inc., which staffs contract towers in the South and Southwestern U.S., said the decision was “not unexpected.”

Opinion: Spending cut. Now, GOP, where are the jobs?

“I didn’t think they’d resolve it in favor of the contract tower program. I kind of expected that they would continue on their course,” he said.

Asked for his reaction, he said, “You’re asking a guy who’s having to lay off a ton of people because of this.”

Tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures, because some aircraft can land without air traffic control help, and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant FAA facilities. But the contract tower closings will contribute to the workload at other FAA facilities, which simultaneously will be coping with controller furloughs.

A 2011 report by the Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General said contract towers cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared with $2 million for comparably busy FAA-staffed towers. The lower costs were chiefly from lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers, which had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16. And a typical contract controller near Tampa, Florida, received a base pay of $56,000 per year, compared with a base pay ranging from $63,000 to $85,000 a year for an FAA controller in Sarasota, Florida, the study said.

Dickerson said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts, despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient.

But the forced spending cuts, known as the sequestration, are also affecting FAA staff. Most of the agency’s 47,000 workers, including its 14,700 controllers, have been told to expect one or two furlough days every two-week pay period. And 49 FAA-staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure.

Longer lines at airports due to budget cuts?"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/business/racial-wealth-gap-widened-during-recession.html,2013-04-29 00:00:00,['Annie Lowrey'],Racial Wealth Gap Widened During Recession,"WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans suffered a loss of wealth during the recession and the sluggish recovery that followed. But the last half-decade has proved far worse for black and Hispanic families than for white families, starkly widening the already large gulf in wealth between non-Hispanic white Americans and most minority groups, according to a new study from the Urban Institute.

“It was already dismal,” Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School in New York, said of the wealth gap between black and white households. “It got even worse.”

Given the dynamics of the housing recovery and the rebound in the stock market, the wealth gap might still be growing, experts said, further dimming the prospects for economic advancement for current and future generations of Americans from minority groups.

The Urban Institute study found that the racial wealth gap yawned during the recession, even as the income gap between white Americans and nonwhite Americans remained stable. As of 2010, white families, on average, earned about $2 for every $1 that black and Hispanic families earned, a ratio that has remained roughly constant for the last 30 years. But when it comes to wealth — as measured by assets, like cash savings, homes and retirement accounts, minus debts, like mortgages and credit card balances — white families have far outpaced black and Hispanic ones. Before the recession, non-Hispanic white families, on average, were about four times as wealthy as nonwhite families, according to the Urban Institute’s analysis of Federal Reserve data. By 2010, whites were about six times as wealthy."

Phillip Swagel is a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and was assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from 2006 to 2009.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.

Five years later, it is clear that the decisive actions to stabilize the financial system were those of Oct. 14, 2008, when the United States government put taxpayer money into banks and guaranteed their lending. With American markets closed for the Columbus Day holiday, the chief executives of nine large banks trooped past waiting television cameras into the Treasury to be told — or in a few cases, persuaded — that they would receive $125 billion in taxpayer money from the $700 billion TARP fund and that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would use emergency authority to guarantee bank debt and business checking accounts, neither of which were covered by the F.D.I.C.’s usual deposit insurance. The nine firms together accounted for about half of the assets and deposits in the United States banking system; another $125 billion was to be allocated to the 8,000-plus institutions that made up the rest of the system.

Shoring up banks en masse was meant to assure market participants that the United States government would not allow the banking system to collapse — a serious fear after the failures of Lehman, the American International Group, Washington Mutual and Wachovia over the preceding weeks. There was no promise that every institution would be saved: indeed, some banks were denied access to the two programs and were allowed to fail (and some went bust despite getting taxpayer money). On the whole, however, the Treasury and F.D.I.C. actions arrested the mounting financial market panic in the wake of the Sept. 15 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. The Great Recession was not averted, as the economy plunged in late 2008 and early 2009, with consequences still felt in a subpar labor market. But Oct. 14, 2008, was the beginning of the end of the financial crisis.

The causes of the crisis and policy response are the focus of a symposium on the financial crisis being held Tuesday in Chicago, hosted by former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., whose Paulson Institute is affiliated with the University of Chicago, and by David Axelrod, the former adviser to President Obama who now heads the university’s Institute of Politics. I took part in a session Tuesday morning on the economics of the crisis. The event can be followed using the Twitter hashtag #fiveyearsafter.

Treasury’s capital injections were meant to give banks receiving the funds a buffer against further losses, supporting lending and bolstering confidence in both institutions and the financial system as a whole. Banks accepting TARP money paid a 5 percent dividend on the funds until the Treasury was paid back; this yield rises to 9 percent after five years (meaning that banks still holding onto their TARP funds will soon pay more). The capital injections included modest restrictions on executive compensation, but the government remained a mostly silent partner, taking a seat on a company’s board only for banks in serious distress.

It is hard to imagine, given the subsequent unpopularity of TARP, but the offer of funding initially was hugely popular, with some banks faxing in applications as soon as Treasury posted the form. TARP’s chief, Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari, drew on talented staff from throughout the government to set up a $250 billion investment fund within weeks, evaluating banks and taking the legal and administrative steps to get the money into the financial system. A meeting of the TARP investment committee (on which I served) became a nightly ritual at the Treasury.

While some observers complained that banks were paying less for TARP money than Warren Buffett had wrung out of Goldman Sachs for a September 2008 investment, this was an intentional policy decision to foster broad uptake that would stabilize the banking system as a whole. A further criticism in the fall of 2008 was that banks were sitting on TARP money. This was a puzzling complaint. Banks had every incentive to make loans, since otherwise they would lose money on the 5 percent dividend. And the volume of loans depends not just on banks’ willingness to lend but also on the demand for loans, which was declining given the weak economy. In any case, one could not say that a bank was using its existing resources to make loans but not TARP funds — all dollars inside a bank are green. These facts, however, did not stop this variety of criticism.

While some of the Treasury investments went bad, the TARP bank program on the whole has been a financial success, even returning a profit for taxpayers. As of Sept. 30, 2013, the gain was $28 billion on just over $245 billion invested. The Treasury Department, under Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and now under Secretary Jacob J. Lew, has adeptly handled the process of selling off government stakes in banks to maximize the taxpayer return while avoiding disruptions to financial markets.

The F.D.I.C., through its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, provided a three-year guarantee on bank debt, a program that complemented the TARP capital injections by ensuring that participating banks had not just more capital but also assured access to funding, and could thus avoid the crippling runs that represented the death knell of firms starting with Bear Stearns in March 2008.

Research by two University of Chicago professors indicates that the Columbus Day interventions had a positive return to society of $84 billion to $107 billion, reflecting a balance between the value to firms of the reduced likelihood that they would fail and the increased risk for taxpayers from providing the guarantee. Most of the benefit in this calculation actually arises from the debt guarantees rather than the capital injections, but the TARP capital was essential, since the F.D.I.C. would not have offered the guarantee and put its deposit insurance fund at risk without the extra protection against losses from TARP.

Among individual banks, the biggest winners of the government rescue were the weakest firms, notably Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which had relatively tenuous funding bases and thus were aided the most by the government guarantee on their borrowing. Stronger banks like JPMorgan Chase, in contrast, were disadvantaged by having their competitors propped up. In retrospect, JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, can be seen as an economic patriot for supporting the Columbus Day actions to stabilize the financial system as a whole even though they hurt his company.

The actions taken on Columbus Day 2008 remain contentious, in particular because of concerns about bailouts and of banks that are too big to fail. It is astonishing for the United States government to tell investors, in effect, that it stands behind private firms in any industry. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law includes provisions such as increased capital and liquidity requirements that aim to make financial markets more safe, and new authority for government officials to take over failing institutions with the hope of avoiding the panic that developed in the fall of 2008. Until the next crisis, however, it will be difficult to know whether these measures will be effective, either in allowing for a better policy response or in avoiding a crisis in the first place. In the meantime, the Treasury capital injections and F.D.I.C. funding guarantees stand as the most extraordinary measures taken five years ago to deal with the financial crisis — and the most effective."

In a letter signed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senate Democratic Policy Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democrats and dated Jan. 11, the Democratic Senate leaders wrote they believed Obama “must be willing to take any lawful steps” to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.

They wrote:

In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis–without Congressional approval, if necessary.

The leaders also warned House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to not allow conservative members of Congress to hold the nation’s economy and reputation “hostage” during the upcoming negotiations concerning raising the debt ceiling.

Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said if she had a choice, she would invoke the 14th Amendment “in a second” to raise the debt ceiling if she were president.

Democrats want Obama to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally because they do not want to cut spending, which Republicans will demand in return for authorizing the debt ceiling to be raised.

During the last round of debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of 2011, Obama was asked if he would invoke the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.

Obama replied then that he had talked to his lawyers, and they were “not persuaded that that is a winning argument.”"

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']","E.J. Dionne: In State of Union, Obama tries to change the direction of our politics","President Obama is a freer man than he has been at any point in his presidency. He is free from the need to save an economy close to collapse, from illusions that Republicans in Congress would work with him readily, from the threat of a rising tea party movement and from the need to win reelection.

This sense of freedom gave his State of the Union address an energy, an ease and a specificity that were lacking in earlier speeches written with an eye toward immediate political needs. It was his most Democratic State of the Union, unapologetic in channeling the love Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson had for placing long lists of initiatives on the nation’s agenda. Obama sees his second term not as a time of consolidation but as an occasion for decisively changing the direction of our politics.

Here was an Obama unafraid to lay out a compelling argument for the urgency of acting on global warming. He was undaunted in challenging the obsession with the federal budget — and in scolding Congress for going from “one manufactured crisis to the next.” By insisting that “we can’t just cut our way to prosperity” and that “deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan,” he brought to mind the great liberal economist John Maynard Keynes. He sought to add another big achievement to near universal health-care coverage, announcing a new goal of making “high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.”

And Obama made clear his determination to shift the center of gravity in the nation’s political conversation away from anti-government conservatism, offering a vision that is the antithesis of the supply-side economics that has dominated conservative thought since the Reagan era.

If supply-siders claim that prosperity depends upon showering financial benefits on wealthy “job creators” at the economy’s commanding heights, Obama argued that economic well-being emanates from the middle and bottom, with help from a government that “works on behalf of the many, and not just the few.”

The “true engine of America’s economic growth,” he said, is a “rising, thriving middle class.” He continued: “It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country, the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love.” With that last phrase, he linked gay rights to an older liberalism’s devotion to class solidarity and racial equality.

An Obama no longer worried about reelection was the worst nightmare of conservatives who feared he would veer far to the left if given the chance. In the GOP’s response, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) conjured that liberal bogeyman, declaring that the president’s “solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more.”

But Rubio’s rhetoric felt stale, disconnected from the Obama who spoke before him. Obama did speak for liberalism, yes, but it is a tempered liberalism. His preschool proposal, after all, is modeled in part on the success of a program in Oklahoma, one of the nation’s reddest states. Most of the president’s initiatives involve modest new spending and many, including his infrastructure and manufacturing plans, are built on partnerships with private industry.

Even the president’s welcomed call to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour and to index it to inflation was cautious by his own standards. In 2008, Obama had urged a $9.50 minimum wage, and it rightly ought to be set at $10 or above.

Moreover, the president’s words were carefully calibrated to the issue in question. On immigration reform — in deference to cross-party work in which Rubio himself is engaged — Obama kept the rhetorical temperature low, praising “bipartisan groups in both chambers.” But he invoked all of his rhetorical skills on the matter of gun safety, a more complex legislative sell. His gospel-preacher’s variations on the phrase “they deserve a vote” will long echo in the House chamber.

No, the liberated Obama is not some new, leftist tribune. He’s the moderately progressive Obama who started running for president before there was a financial crisis or a tea party. In his 2006 book “The Audacity of Hope,” he proposed to end polarization by organizing a “broad majority of Americans” who would be “re-engaged in the project of national renewal” and would “see their own self-interest as inextricably linked to the interests of others.” On Tuesday night, creating this majority was what he still had in mind.

Fire me, Marsh told lawmakers. And everyone I work with.

“I have concluded that [my agency] is a congressional experiment that hasn’t worked out in practice,” wrote Marsh, who is the inspector general for the Denali Commission, an economic-development agency based in Alaska. “I recommend that Congress put its money elsewhere.”

This has been tried before. But not often. Old Washington hands could remember only two other federal workers who had lobbied publicly to have themselves defunded. One was a high-level Ronald Reagan appointee. One was a lowly weather observer.

Both failed. Meaning they weren’t fired.

Marsh seems likely to fail, too — even though his requests arrived in Washington in the middle of a battle to cut the budget. His agency seems protected by one of Washington’s most enduring customs: the defense of home-state giveaways, even in times of national austerity.

For now, the main impact of his request seems to be within his small agency — where the great debate over spending has turned into a smaller, tenser confrontation among colleagues.

Until a Washington Post reporter called, Marsh’s fellow employees did not know he was lobbying to have them cut off.

“No. Never heard that,” Joel Neimeyer, the top federal official at the Denali Commission, said when a reporter called. “Thank you for sharing,” he said. Still processing it. This was a man he and other staffers had gone to dinner with: Neimeyer thought Marsh was “charming, with a pretty good sense of humor.”

“What do you think of him sharing it with Congress and not the agency?” Neimeyer asked.

Marsh sent his first requests to Washington this summer. Then, this month — as Congress fought a battle over next year’s budget — he sent another letter, this one to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). He said his opponents in the agency were “shooting the messenger, tackling the referee, or berating the pathologist who has to convey the news one would prefer not to hear.”

Colleagues: Not amused

He’s right that they’re not happy.

“He’s done a great job of flummoxing our ability to serve these communities any better,” Vince Beltrami, a Denali Commission member and a leader of the Alaska AFL-CIO, said Tuesday when the commission met in Anchorage.

They spent more than an hour talking about Marsh. They didn’t spend any time talking to him, though, because he didn’t show up.

“Mike Marsh, are you online?” Neimeyer said.

Silence.

“Mike, or anyone representing Mike, are you online?” he repeated.

So he hadn’t even called in.

In today’s federal government — with budget cuts looming over most agencies — what Marsh did is gob-smacking. This is the duck that hunted himself.

But Marsh believes there is a strong and convincing case for his own unemployment. He laid it out in seven pages, complete with graphics and a bibliography, and sent it to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and to the Office of Management and Budget.

And to The Washington Post.

“At this point, I recommend that Congress no longer send Denali an annual ‘base’ appropriation,” Marsh wrote. Last year, that base appropriation from Congress was about $10.6 million. Marsh doesn’t say the agency has to die, necessarily. It just has to go away. After leaving the federal government, he says, it might survive as an independent nonprofit organization.

A channel for pork

That would be an unusual end for an unusual agency. The Denali Commission began in 1998, as a pet project of then-Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). It is not connected to Denali National Park: Both are named for Alaska’s iconic mountain peak. The commission’s purpose was to help people in rural Alaska, by building power plants, offering job training and improving health care.

It became the channel for a great river of pork. In 2006, in the heyday of both Stevens and congressional earmark spending, he sent $150 million flowing through the agency.

But in 2008, Stevens lost an election. Then, in 2010, Stevens died. Then earmarks were banned.

The river shrank. But it didn’t stop.

The Denali Commission still funnels federal grants to projects in the state, with a staff of about 12. It still enjoys strong support from Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation, which fought presidential efforts to cut its funding. And the Alaska lawmakers have proposed a reauthorization measure designed to give the commission a lasting stream of funding.

“We’ve been successful the last several years, as you know, to keep the money in there,” said Sen. Mark ­Begich (D-Alaska). He thinks the commission provides valuable coordination, to make sure grant money reaches the places where it would help the most.

And he also thinks that if it were going to die, it would be dead already.

“Think about it. The last 41 / 2 years, five years — this would be the time that they slice it to zero,” Begich said. Instead, “it’s been pretty maintained and stabilized.”

To Marsh, however, the commission is an idea that time has proved wrong. For one thing, he says, it often builds projects — power plants or medical clinics — in tiny towns that won’t have the resources to keep them running.

For another thing, Marsh says, the commission is a middleman where a middleman isn’t needed.

If the U.S. government wants to pay for primary-care clinics in Alaska, he told Congress, it should simply send the money straight to the state or to tribal governments that build medical clinics. Why pass it through a little office in Anchorage first?

If Congress listened, that would be the end of Marsh’s job, too.

He does not seem too bothered. “There are certain things in life that aren’t designed to be done alone,” he wrote in an e-mail. Meaning that this inspector general’s job is too much work for one person anyway.

Marsh is a former prosecutor who lives in Phoenix and commutes to Alaska only when he needs to. Before he took this job, he audited state agencies for the Alaska government. “I have a long history of upsetting Alaskans,” Marsh wrote in an e-mail.

He declined to be interviewed in person for this article, saying inspector-general rules won’t allow it. He also would not allow himself to be photographed.

A rare stance

It is a rare thing, of course, that anybody stands up and calls himself a human boondoggle. Most federal workers find their jobs — and their agencies — meaningful.

Those who don’t, quit. Those who don’t quit usually just keep their mouths shut.

But not all of them.

“The first thing that I would urge the Congress to do — and I urge this not from the perspective of being a Republican or a Democrat, but a citizen who pays taxes — would be to discontinue doing what we are doing,” said Orson Swindle, who headed an agency called the Economic Development Administration in the Reagan administration.

Swindle was a former Vietnam prisoner of war who — with Reagan’s backing — wanted to get rid of his own agency. It had become an infamous delivery system for Congress’s pork, funding such pet projects as an attempt to build the Great Pyramids of Indiana.

But Congress liked it the way it was. The agency stayed.

Eventually, Swindle quit, disappointed but not surprised: “We’re sitting there feeding the beast that’s going to eat us,” he says now of the deficit.

A few years later, in 1993, Vice President Al Gore got another such request, in a letter from rural Kansas.

“I feel like that person in the old movie who writes in lipstick on bathroom mirrors, “Stop me before I kill again,’ ” Bruce Bair of Schoenchen, Kan., wrote to Gore. “However, in my case, the legend should be, ‘Stop me before I steal some more.’ ”

Bair was a weather observer for the Federal Aviation Administration, stationed at a little-used airfield in Russell, Kan. Bair was a human backup, to relay weather reports to pilots if the weather machine broke.

It never broke. So Bair felt he was “stealing” his salary of about $11 an hour. Gore read the letter and cited it prominently in his “Reinventing Government” program. But Bair wasn’t fired. In fact, when he quit, the government hired somebody to replace him. Eventually, the FAA shut down the weather station at Russell Airport, home town of longtime Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.).

Today, Bair recalls the episode with a sense of satisfaction: He hated his boss. So there was a thrill in telling the world what a waste they all were.

“I didn’t think there was a chance in a million that any one would ever read that letter,” Bair wrote in an e-mail recently. “I got revenge, all right.”

That’s the list. Two. Now, three.

An unlikely extinction

In Marsh’s case, his request has attracted attention from the oversight committee’s chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), and from Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who sent a letter on Monday asking for Marsh’s independence to be respected.

The answer here “may be reform. It may be shutting the whole thing down. But clearly this auditor is on to something,” said McCaskill, a former state auditor who did tough evaluations of Missouri agencies.

But the commission is a long way from dead. Just this summer, an Ohio congressman suggested cutting it — along with similar agencies that pay for development in the Appalachians, the Mississippi Delta and other regions.

The House voted. All the commissions survived.

And in Alaska, the tables have already been turned on Marsh. The Government Accountability Office is now doing an audit of him, at the request of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Many at the commission — and some on Capitol Hill — have begun to wonder why the agency needs an inspector general who lives in Arizona.

Or one who wants to inspect his agency right out of existence.

“The Denali Commission’s mission continues to be critical,” Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) said in a written statement. “Unfortunately, all IGs are not created equal.”"

Benefits are being reduced by about 5%25 beginning Nov. 1

A household of eight would see benefits reduced %2465 a month

The reductions will be acutely felt in states with a higher food stamp population

The record number of Americans relying on federal aid to put food on the table will have to make do with less starting today, as a recession-era boost to food stamps officially expires.

Benefits are being reduced by about 5% beginning Nov. 1 for all of the nearly 47.7 million Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A family of four will receive $36 less each month because of the reduction, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A household of eight would see benefits reduced $65 a month. The average monthly benefit per household for all 50 states and the District of Columbia last year was $278.

The cuts severely curtail the federal funds that have flowed into local communities and businesses through the states. Georgia, for example, will see total benefits cut by $210 million, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Illinois' share of the cut will be $220 million. For Ohio, it's $193 million. All told, $5 billion less in food stamp benefits will be paid over the next year.

The reductions will be acutely felt in states with a higher food stamp population, particularly in the dozen states where one in five residents is collecting benefits.

Vulnerable populations will be especially affected. In New York, more than 1 million elderly people or those with disabilities will feel the impact, according to the center's analysis. About 2.3 million children in both California and Texas will be affected.

The expiring benefits were always intended to be temporary, and some say calling the end of the benefits boost a ""cut"" is disingenuous. Congress approved a higher level of food stamp benefits for all recipients as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, the stimulus bill enacted in 2009.

""It's a boost that was only meant to be temporary,"" said Rachel Sheffield of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""They're not cutting the program.""

But despite an improved economy, demand for assistance remains at record levels — almost three times what it was in 2000. The cost of the program has ballooned as well. A decade ago, federal spending on food stamps topped $20 billion annually. In the last fiscal year, the U.S. spent a record $78.4 billion. In Washington and in many states, Republicans have backed efforts to curb spending, cut benefits and trim enrollment in SNAP.

The persistent demand and skyrocketing costs have prompted calls from some policymakers to cut spending on the program. Others say reductions are premature and will hurt those still reeling from the recession.

""We know that it's going to increase the people that come to us,"" said Page Crosland of the Capital Area Food Bank, which serves Washington, D.C. — where nearly one in four are on food stamps — along with parts of Virginia and Maryland. ""We're working around the clock to meet this anticipated increased demand.""

The issue is one of the central disputes in the congressional debate over the farm bill, which ramped up again this week. House Republicans have proposed nearly $40 billion in cuts to SNAP over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office has said such a cut could end benefits for nearly 4 million people next year alone. Senate Democrats have backed a $4 billion cut.

That larger dispute has contributed to a relative quiet over the reductions taking effect today. While Democrats and the White House blasted Republicans when they backed deep food stamp cuts in their farm bill proposal, there was no significant effort to stem the reductions now taking place.

Republicans and Democrats will continue to debate their respective farm bill measures, along with broader tax and spending disputes under the plan that ended the government shutdown last month.

With a hiring freeze preventing the IRS from replacing workers who retire or leave for other jobs, existing staffers say they're feeling the pressure of lack of manpower, according to the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents federal employees at the tax collection agency.

The IRS has lost 10,000 employees to attrition in just the past two years, or over 9% of its total workforce.

""We are doing as best we can with a staff of 14 that used to be a staff of 32,"" said one IRS employee about working conditions in a survey conducted by the union.

In an effort to prevent additional budget cuts from wreaking havoc during the height of the tax filing season, the IRS pushed back employee furloughs until the summer, after the April 15 deadline for filing tax returns.

Forced cuts have already begun to take root at dozens of other federal agencies, triggered on March 1 by $85 billion in automatic government spending cuts. Tens of thousands of defense workers have lost jobs and federal public defenders have already started to take unpaid time off at home.

Federal furloughs a non-event? Not so fast

The IRS has been trimming costs in preparation for the forced budget cuts, just like other agencies. That's meant that staff levels have dwindled at the 389 Taxpayer Assistance Centers nationwide. Typically, these centers offer tax and retirement counseling for the elderly and help the poor prepare their returns for free.

The National Taxpayer Advocate estimated that these centers will serve about 5.4 million people by this year's tax filing deadline, down from 6.4 million in 2011, according to a report.

IRS workers told the union that taxpayers are lining up outside the centers ""beginning in the pre-dawn hours"" before the assistance centers open, according to the union survey.

""A lot of people are still depending on face-to-face assistance, and if they can't get that assistance, it causes errors in the returns and delays in the refunds,"" union president Colleen Kelley said.

Budget cuts and lack of staff have increased wait times for those seeking IRS help by phone to 18 minutes on average this tax season. That's up from 13 minutes in 2011, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate's report.

The likelihood that a caller would get a live IRS employee on the phone for tax questions also fell, according to the report. This year only 63% of taxpayers who call the IRS are expected to successfully get help, down from 70% of callers in 2011. More taxpayers just hang up in frustration, the report found.

Identity theft victims are among the worst hit -- having to wait six months to a year if they're seeking tax refunds, the union said.

The situation could only get worse. Currently, IRS employees are facing between five and seven days of unpaid time off, with the first furlough possibly kicking in around Memorial Day, May 27.

The agency has also been cutting costs for travel, training, facilities and supplies, according to a February memo from IRS acting Commissioner Steven Miller.

""The employees are doing an incredible job, given what they're up against -- there's only so many of them and so many hours in a day,"" Kelley said.

The survey was produced from an analysis of thousands of written responses by IRS employees who wrote essays explaining how budget cuts were affecting taxpayer services, said union spokeswoman Dina Long.

A request for comment from Treasury Department was not returned."

The deal, while modest in scope, amounts to a cease-fire in the budget wars that have debilitated Washington since 2011 and gives lawmakers breathing room to try to address the real drivers of federal spending — health care and entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security — and to reshape the tax code.

For a Capitol used to paralyzing partisan gridlock, the accord between Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, was a reminder that even fierce political combatants can find common ground. Mr. Ryan praised the deal in the most elementary terms as a way to “get our government functioning at its very basic levels.”

Both negotiators promised an end to uncertainty and the lurching from crisis to crisis, at least for a year.

Republican National Committee says it has funds to hire five security guards

National Park Service employees who work at memorial placed on furlough in government shutdown

Mississippi veterans were first to cross barricades on Day 1 of shutdown

WASHINGTON — The Republican National Committee is offering to pay security expenses so the World War II Memorial is open for visitors during the government shutdown.

Wednesday's offer from RNC Chairman Reince Preibus was dismissed by Democrats as a stunt. Priebus said the GOP has set aside funds to hire five security guards for the memorial.

Barricades have been placed around the World War II Memorial and other popular tourist attractions because of the shutdown. The 330 federal employees who work at the National Mall and its memorials have been placed on furlough.

The World War II Memorial became a visible symbol of the shutdown's impact Tuesday when 91 veterans from Mississippi crossed the barricades with the help of members of Congress so they could tour the site.

The veterans, some in wheelchairs, came to Washington via the Honor Flight program, which sponsors one-day trips for World War II, Korea and Vietnam veterans so they can visit the monuments dedicated to their service.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress were unable to agree on a stopgap spending bill to fund the government before the new fiscal year began on Tuesday, which is why the shutdown began. President Obama has rebuffed House GOP proposals attached to the bill that would gut his health care law.

""The Obama administration has decided they want to make the government shutdown as painful as possible, even taking the unnecessary step of keeping the Greatest Generation away from a monument built in their honor,"" Priebus said. ""That's not right, and it's not fair.""

Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, called on Republicans to urge House Speaker John Boehner to allow a vote on a stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, without any restrictions.

""We've already been working on a plan to open the Memorial — and the entire government — after the GOP caused them to close,"" Elleithee said in a statement. ""It's called a clean funding resolution and it sounds like the votes are there if the speaker would just call for a vote. It would save the economy a lot of money and get the Memorial and government open a whole lot faster.""

Veterans from Missouri, Illinois and Michigan entered the closed memorial Wednesday, Day 2 of the government shutdown. National Park Service spokeswoman Carol Johnson told ABC News that the Honor Flights are being granted access to the memorial ""to conduct First Amendment activities.""

""These soldiers gave everything in fighting for our freedom and the thought that they would not be allowed into their memorial because of the partisan divide in Washington is beyond the pale,"" said Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who visited with the Illinois veterans at the memorial.

This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: ‘You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.’ They lay all this out for me, and–because they have the spending power–and so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills. Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.

Of course, Obama isn’t mentioning that it is largely his side that wants to spend, while the GOP wants to cut spending.

The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation and so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it. If they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done and you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.

The president’s entire defense is predicated on the premise that spending absolutely must stay at its current levels, an issue he has been entirely unwilling to discuss with Republicans in Congress.

Notice that for the past two years, the House, run by the GOP, has passed budgets while the Democratic Senate hasn’t. Who’s the fiscally irresponsible party here?"

Budget showdown, government shutdown, debt ceiling debacle–the stakes are real but the establishment seems to feed off the chaos they create as a means to foment fear and outrage and translate it into campaign donations for themselves.

Look closely and you’ll see that something seismic is going on under the surface of the manufactured chaos in D.C.

Washington has morphed into an extortion racket, a place where members of the permanent political class threaten to inflict legislative and regulatory pain to extract campaign donations that they can then siphon into the pockets of themselves and their family members.

In a new book featured this Sunday on 60 Minutes titled Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, Peter Schweizer explains how Washington politicians use a set of mafia-style legislative tactics to extort people and industries into donating to them out of fear of political and legal reprisals.

Schweizer interviewed former Chairman of Apache Corporation Ray Plank. Plank said campaign cash and lobbying contracts now function as “protection money” to keep lawmakers and regulators from going after you.

“It’s what you expect from the mafia,” said Plank. “They basically come to you and say, ‘We are going to shove this bat up your ass and give you an enema. You better play ball.’ We saw a great deal of it. It’s an insidious blight.”

There are left-wing progressives on Wall Street and in the high-tech world who bankrolled President Obama’s campaign because they love his radical agenda. But as Schweizer points out, many gave because they know they have to; if they don’t, Obama will come after them.

That’s a lesson the Tea Party knows all too well. After the Tea Party’s historic 2010 midterm victory, Obama unleashed Attorney General Eric Holder to go after the oil and gas sector, which had given four times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. As Obama said in October 2010, “We are going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us.”

Of course, not everyone gets subjected to these Godfather-style shakedowns. Case in point: Obama bundler and former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine of MF Global shame. After “losing” $1.6 billion of MF Global customer money, Corzine walked away without a scratch. In Extortion, Schweizer publishes a devastating quote from Lisa Timmerman, a 17-year MF Global employee who served as the firm’s assistant comptroller for five years, saying: “Corzine is a major Obama fundraiser [which] is keeping prosecutors from bringing criminal charges against him.”

But what about the rest of us? What about the average American mom and dad just trying to stay afloat in the disastrous Obama economy? We don’t have the funds to throw “protection money” at the political extortionists in Washington who are eager to foist things like Obamacare on us. Only Obama’s union cronies and members of the permanent political class are given Obamacare waivers and spared the pain of the policies D.C. inflicts on the rest of us. Big business got an Obamacare exemption that Obama refuses to give ordinary individuals who can’t even sign up for Obamacare on the broken exchange websites, but they’ll still be fined for not doing so!

And what about the GOP establishment? Why haven’t they been able to clean up the extortion racket in Washington? You have to ask yourself, has the party machine fought this corruption or does it participate in it? As a senior House Republican told Fox News on Thursday, it’s “highly unlikely” Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) will be challenged because few have the muscle to match his ability to “raise money.”

In fact, the ability to raise money is apparently key to all the power in Washington. Here’s how bad it’s gotten: the Democratic and Republican Parties actually have a secret price list–officially known as “party dues”–that tells members of Congress how much money they must extract from donors in order to win a chairmanship or a top slot on a powerful Congressional committee. Schweizer somehow obtained the top-secret lists and included the never-before-published documents in Extortion.

But fundraising isn’t the only thing D.C. employs to keep people in line. Over in the Senate, Democrats like Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) use thug tactics on Tea Party members and activists who stand in their way. In a devastating chapter on Harry Reid, Schweizer includes a quote from Reid’s former chief of staff Susan McCue, who in 2005 said Reid seizes on a person’s weaknesses to “disarm, to endear, to threaten, but most of all to instill fear.”

The fact that these strong-arm tactics take place in Washington doesn’t surprise me at all. I’ve fought this type of corruption my entire political career. And those who disagreed with me politically used thug-like tactics to try to bankrupt my family with frivolous lawsuits in Alaska, and it hasn’t stopped to this day.

It’s time for Washington to stop threatening citizens and scaring up dollars through an endless extortion scheme of manufactured crises. It’s time for leaders to lead. That means doing right by voters without requiring them to pay protection money in advance.

You have to wonder whether Constitutional rule of law even exists when separate rules apply for powerful and well-connected men like Jon Corzine. And you have to wonder whether we really have government of the people, by the people, and for the people when the only way We the People can be heard is if we grease the palms of the ruling class.

Enough is enough. If the permanent political class won’t drain the swamp, we will. We should follow the advice in the title of Schweizer’s last book and “Throw Them All Out.” 2014 is just around the corner."

USA TODAY

The partial government shutdown enters Day 10 frozen in the same place. All eyes will be on Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on the consequences if the debt ceiling is not raised by Oct. 17. What you need to know about the shutdown on Thursday, Oct. 10:

Obama convenes talks with Congress

President Obama is reaching out to lawmakers in a bid to move forward on ending the government shutdown. He'll sit down Thursday for separate talks with House Republicans and Senate Democrats, after meeting with House Democrats on Wednesday. Both chambers are in session Saturday, a sign that the deadlock is expected to continue. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has scheduled a key procedural vote Saturday on legislation to suspend the debt ceiling through 2014. But he'll need the votes of six Republicans to cross that hurdle, assuming all 52 Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them stick together.

Military death benefits restored after widespread outrage

The Pentagon reached an agreement with the non-profit Fisher House Foundation to restore $100,000 death benefits to military families that are stalled in the shutdown. The outcry was loud and fierce when news broke that payments to the families of fallen servicemembers were on hold. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet with families as the remains of their loved ones, killed Sunday in a roadside blast in Afghanistan, returned to the United States. Hagel said the foundation will be reimbursed when the shutdown ends.

Number of furloughed workers shrinks as shutdown drags on

The government shutdown is shrinking, even if the political divide is growing. When the shutdown began Oct. 1, an estimated 800,000 federal workers were deemed ""non-essential"" and furloughed. The Pentagon earlier this week recalled almost all of its 350,000 civilian workers. Thousands of other workers in the Social Security Administration are also back at work, and other federal agencies have temporarily recalled employees. There is still no guarantee that federal workers will receive back pay because a bill to do that has so far only passed the House.

One man steps in to clean up at memorials

Chris Cox is a cut above the bickering in Washington. Fed up with the government shutdown, Cox took a lawnmower to the National Mall this week and began cutting grass in areas between the Lincoln and World War II memorials. The South Carolina native, who now lives in the Virginia suburbs of the nation's capital, calls his one-citizen effort the Memorial Militia. ""These are our memorials. Do they think that we're just going to let them go to hell?"" Cox said in an interview with WNEW, an all-news radio station.

Shutdown closes tap on new beers

The prolonged closure of federal offices has given some people a reason to cry in the beer. An obscure arm of the Treasury Department has stopped approving new brews. All beers that get bottled or canned that are sold across state lines must get approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, better known as the TTB. The agency signs off on the label, as well as the recipe if it uses non-traditional ingredients. Brewery taxes, however, are being collected during the shutdown.

(CNN) - Long-term unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans expired Saturday after Congress failed to pass an extension. Reinstating those benefits is expected to be one of the first priorities for congressional Democrats in the new year.

“Extending unemployment insurance is the right thing to do for millions of Americans who are trying to support their families,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement Saturday. “What makes matters worse, the loss of benefits comes just a few days after the holidays.”



Like most Democrats, Wasserman Schultz laid the blame for the expiring benefits - now reverting back to 26 weeks of coverage - squarely at the feet of congressional Republicans.

Many Republicans have in turn argued that the extended emergency federal benefits - passed during the Great Recession - are a disincentive for job hunting and are no longer necessary as the economy improves and unemployment ticks down.

Rand Paul: Extending jobless benefits a 'disservice' to workers

Unemployment isn’t going down fast enough, say Democrats. They argue that without the extended benefits, recipients will severely curtail their spending and be a drag on the economy.

“As we continue our work to create more good paying jobs, it is essential that we extend unemployment benefits to the millions of American families who still need and rely on them,” Wasserman Schultz said.

President Barack Obama also weighed in Friday, according to the White House. In a phone call to Sens. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Dean Heller, R-Nevada, Obama voiced his own support for reinstating the prolonged unemployment benefits, the goal of a bill co-sponsored by the two men. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has pledged to take the benefits up as soon as the chamber returns from its break early next month.

Heller has been one of the few Republicans to vocally support extending the benefits – although House Speaker John Boehner has expressed some willingness to negotiate on the matter.

In a statement announcing his extension bill, Heller argued that “providing a safety net for those in need is one of the most important functions of the federal government.”

“As Nevada’s unemployment rate continues to top the charts nationwide, many families and individuals back home do not know how they are going to meet their basic needs,” Heller said.

A number of Democrats also took to Twitter on Saturday to argue for extending the benefits.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/30/technology/california-split-draper/index.html,2013-12-30 00:00:00,['Charles Riley'],Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper: Split California into 6 states,"Is the most populous American state too big for its own good?

Tim Draper, a third-generation venture capitalist with a penchant for big ideas, is promoting a plan that would split California into six separate states.

The proposal calls for the creation of new states called Silicon Valley and West California that would be anchored by the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Orange County and San Diego would be part of the new state of South California. To the north, remaining counties would be divided into regions called Central California, North California and Jefferson.

Why now? According to the proposed ballot initiative Draper filed earlier this month, the Golden State has been rendered ""nearly ungovernable"" by social and economic changes.

California has 58 counties, nearly 40 million people and an economy so large that it would rank among the top 10 countries in the world.

But given the state's diverse geography and industries, Draper's ballot initiative argues that the ""citizens of the whole state would be better served by six smaller state governments.""

""I am endorsing this initiative because it is a way to localize governance and bring more representation to the local level,"" Draper said in document distributed to reporters. ""I am planning to work to get it on the ballot.""

The plan would also create a ""marketplace"" for governments, and voters in each county could pick and choose which state they wanted to be part of.

Draper will need to collect thousands of signatures for the measure to be brought before voters in November. With seemingly little current popular demand for partition, gathering enough support to make the ballot could prove difficult.

The initiative would raise some thorny issues, including the division of water rights -- a life and death economic matter in the deserts of Southern California. There would also be significant Constitutional questions to resolve.

The third-largest state in terms of area behind Alaska and Texas, California has long managed to resist division.

Like Draper, advocates for partition in counties near the Oregon border have in the past evoked the ""Jefferson"" name while pursuing statehood -- a reference to the president who dispatched Lewis & Clark to the Northwest.

Draper founded the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in 1985, and is now running Draper University, an entrepreneurship program. The California native is well known in Silicon Valley for his investments and appearances on a Nickelodeon TV show called ""The Naked Brothers Band."""

Ahlers'],Budget cuts would hit private air traffic in effort to spare airlines,"Story highlights The Federal Aviation Administration met with airline and airport executives FAA oversees the nation's air traffic system for airlines and private flights Plans include closing some control towers in less busy areas FAA employees have been told they may be furloughed as part of cuts

Federal aviation officials are telling airline and airport executives that they are working to minimize any disruption from imminent government budget cuts to passenger airline service, but warn the mandatory belt-tightening will impact air traffic overall.

At a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would give priority to 77 “core” facilities – large airports and their related air traffic control centers, which it did not identify.

But the agency would reduce staffing system wide and would likely close 238 control towers at less busy airports. Those towers handle 5.8 percent of all commercial air traffic, the FAA said.

Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough

“It was clear at the meeting that the brunt of the cuts were at the cost of general aviation (private and business aircraft), and the agency even recognized that,” said Melissa Rudinger of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a group representing private pilots in Washington.

The Transportation Department faces about $1 billion in budget cuts through the end of the fiscal year unless Congress acts by Friday to avert them. The cuts are part of a political impasse affecting spending across the government.

Much of the agency’s austerity will hit the FAA, which employs about 15,000 controllers and oversees traffic at more than 400 airports used by commercial airlines, business jets and private pilots.

Large airports will also be impacted.

All FAA employees have been told they may be furloughed at least one day every two weeks, inevitably meaning that aviation facilities will have fewer controllers.

While the cuts would inevitably reduce the number of operations – take-offs and landings – the FAA said it would maintain the highest level of safety.

The impact would be greatest at the nation’s small- and mid-sized airfields, the FAA acknowledged.

The 238 control towers facing possible closure met a criteria established by the FAA: They have fewer than 150,000 operations a year and fewer than 10,000 commercial airline operations.

Opinion: Cuts will turn off voters GOP is courting

Of those towers, 189 are “contact towers,” operated under FAA supervision by independent contractors. The remaining 49 are staffed by FAA controllers.

FAA officials said it would consider removing a tower on a case-by-case basis if advocates could justify a change. But any towers spared from closure would have to be off-set by cuts elsewhere, they said.

Most of the changes would occur at the start of April, and would ratchet up over a period of months. The first furloughs would begin April 8, according to a meeting participant.

If a tower is closed, operations at those airports would continue. But controller operations would be shifted to other facilities, or to the pilots themselves, who would radio their intentions to take off, land, and maneuver on the ground.

Ground operations could present the biggest danger to pilots, since it would remove from service controllers who are trained to look for conflicting movements on the runways and taxiways.

Critics say the FAA failed to consider important factors when compiling its list of towers, including whether the towers were also used for military operations and for search and rescue missions.

FAA officials also said Tuesday it would suspend development of its NextGen navigation system so it could reassign employees to control towers. And it would suspend its redesign of airspace – an ongoing program to make the area around airports more efficient.

The FAA also said budget cuts would force it to cut back on maintenance and repairs at “non-core” facilities. Only power, voice and navigational systems would be fixed at those facilities, the FAA told the industry executives.

Rudinger said while the FAA disclosed a few new details about its plans to deal with forced spending cuts – known in Washington as sequestration – it was “certainly not as much detail as we were looking for going into the meeting.”

Participants in the meeting questioned whether the FAA is making the smartest cuts.

”Clearly they have to make the cuts,” Rudinger said. “What’s unclear is how they came up with them. There hasn’t been any transparency in the process.”

Shear', 'Jonathan Weisman']",Obama Seeking to Take Credit and Set Course for Economy,"Mr. Obama’s adversaries on Monday were quick to point out that the president has frequently set out on similar campaign-style efforts to redefine or restate his economic agenda, often accompanied by rhetoric from his advisers about a new direction or emphasis. Congressional Republicans said they were incredulous that Mr. Obama planned to use another set of speeches instead of legislative negotiations to advance his economic agenda.

“It’s a cliché, but if all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. “They don’t know how to do anything else.”

In the fall of 2011, Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to unveil a $447 billion jobs bill that has not passed. In 2012, as his re-election campaign neared its end, he renewed his vision with a 20-page economic plan. In his State of the Union address in February, the president refocused on the economy after beginning his second term focused on gun control, immigration, climate change and gay rights. And just this past May, Mr. Obama announced he was restarting his “Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour,” with stops in Baltimore and Austin, Tex.

“They’ve been saying the same thing for four years,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate. “The previous Democrat Congress passed his agenda — Obamacare, the stimulus, thousands of pages of regulations — and the economy is treading water. More taxes, more regulation, and more failures to unleash American energy jobs are not the answer.”

Administration officials on Monday conceded that the president was partly to blame for the debates in Washington veering away from the economic issues that many Americans believe are the most important. One official said that it was incumbent on Mr. Obama to shift the overall focus of the conversation in Washington, but acknowledged that has not happened.

The officials also criticized Republicans, especially in the House, for seizing on what the White House says are overblown scandals: the targeting of nonprofit groups at the Internal Revenue Service and the actions of officials after the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

They said that some of the distractions in Washington have been out of Mr. Obama’s control: the 2010 oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico; Hurricane Sandy’s destruction late last year and the tornadoes in Oklahoma City in May; tensions in the Middle East and even the Trayvon Martin verdict."

As chief executive of a small Michigan military contractor, Nanocerox, he had already cut his work force by one-third. But it was not enough. And if the government spending cuts mandated by Congress continue, he said, more people will go in the coming months.

The squeeze Mr. Kelly is facing is one reason markets are jittery about what the Labor Department’s latest report on unemployment and job creation will reveal about the economy on Friday. After a strong start to the year, several economic indicators beginning in March have pointed to much slower growth, largely because of the fiscal headwinds from Washington, economists say.

Job cuts like the kind at Nanocerox remain the exception, rather than the rule. On Thursday, the government said weekly unemployment claims were at a five-year low.

The problem is that companies have not been hiring. This week, a survey of private sector hiring in April came in well below expectations, while indications for everything from retail sales to manufacturing have also been soft recently."

The problem is, if Republicans get anything close to their way—and remember, it's Democrats they're bargaining with, so there's a good chance Republicans do get much of what they want— the solution could be as bad as the problem of sequestration. Social Security and Medicaid aren't sequestered. But cutting those programs has been on the Republican wish list for a long time, and will be one of their demands.

The question is how hard Democrats will fight to protect the programs that seniors rely on and that give non-seniors the promise of being able to retire without living in abject poverty.



""The president has made one of his bottom lines that significant revenues have to be on the table,"" said Chuck Loveless, the director of legislation for AFSCME, a major public services employees union. ""If he sticks to his guns on that I'm not worried, but chained CPI is on his shortlist. We oppose that, and it is a significant cut to social security.""

It should go without saying that if Democrats agree to cut Social Security benefits, even at the insistence of Republicans, come 2014 and 2016, Republicans will wage campaign attacks against Democrats for having cut Social Security. But with Republicans so insistent, and a few Democrats wobbly on the issue, New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler says that ""If you go in and decide to fix sequestration, how much longer can you exempt entitlements. It's difficult to do if you want to get bipartisan agreement.""

This is the fight. Can Republicans protect tax subsidies for oil companies by cutting Social Security benefits for seniors? Are Democrats going to make that deal? If Americans don't want Social Security cut—and they don't, even if politicians are calling it ""chained CPI"" and pretending it's not really a cut—that needs to be crystal clear to Congress and the president.

Tell Congress it's time to end tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy."

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2013/01/california-budget-jerry-brown-surplus.html,,[],,"After years of red ink, Gov. Jerry Brown said on Thursday that California’s $96.7-billion general fund is now poised to end next year with a surplus, thanks to years of deep budget cuts and billions in new taxes approved by voters last year.

""We achieved the position we're in because of tough cuts ... and then the people voted for taxes,"" he said. ""We broke the logjam by going to the people.""

READ THE SUMMARY: Gov. Brown's proposed 2013-2014 budget

Schools will be the big winner in the governor's new spending plan, receiving $56.2 billion in state funds, an increase by $2.7 billion over the last year. That funding is set to jump to more than $66 billion by 2016.

The budget also dedicated an additional $350 million to the state’s public insurance program, Medi-Cal, to help implement President Obama’s healthcare law.

Brown’s budget predicts only the second budget surplus in the last decade, with an $851-million surplus projected at the end of the 2013-14 fiscal year -- if all his proposals are approved by lawmakers.

With Democrats firmly in control of both legislative houses and the governor’s office, and without what had become familiar multibillion-dollar deficits, this year’s announcement lacked the anxiety and urgency that had surrounded past budget unveilings.

Instead of railing against proposed reductions in popular programs, activists are now girding for long policy battles based on the ideas put forward by the governor on Thursday.

Those fights will play out in the Legislature over the coming months. While they include sweeping changes in how Sacramento spends its money, those skirmishes, too, will lack the drama over cuts to schools and health services that have dominated Capitol discourse for the better part of the last decade.

Brian Bonlender, Director of the State Department of Commerce said it would be difficult to pinpoint the exact economic impact because it depends on how long the road is out of service, how much traffic was disrupted and delayed by detour routes.

But, based on a flood in 2007 that washed out a section of Interstate 5 in Chehalis and closed Interstate-5 in both directions for four days, he was able to estimate economic losses from Thursday's Skagit River Bridge collapse.

""We’re still calculating, but certainly expect the impact of the Skagit River Bridge disruption to be similar,"" Bonlender said in comments e-mailed to NBC News.

He said total lost economic output from the 2007 floods was $47.07 million, with 290 jobs lost for one year following the closure. The state tax revenue loss was $2.39 million.

Bonlender also noted that Canada is Washington’s No. 2 trading partner ($33.4 billion total imports and exports). It was important to determine how feasible it is to switch some traffic to rail from road, he said.

The bridge collapse will also play havoc with commercial traffic and disrupt the Memorial Day holiday for many Americans who plan to spend the start of the summer season shopping, camping, or taking excursions.

Trucks and traffic from Interstate 5 have been rerouted and Gov. Jay Inslee has urged travelers to avoid the I-5 corridor in the area north of Seattle altogether. That means local businesses will suffer too, as many rely on customers from the main north-south highway.

On the other side of the border, Canadian tourism officials were also concerned that Thursday's bridge collapse would prevent Americans from traveling across the border for a last weekend of skiing, a day's mountain biking or a round of golf.

All this on a holiday, when the AAA motoring organization estimates that nearly 35 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from their homes by car.

Bob Lama, a board member of the Chamber of Commerce in Mount Vernon, Wash., said the collapse will affect not just local traffic, but Canadians coming south and Americans going north.

""It’s going to impact everybody, business and non-business,” Lama told The Seattle Times. “The Department of Transportation has their work cut out for them to figure out what to do.’’

Washington state officials say sections of the highway will have to rebuilt around the four-lane bridge, which carried an average daily traffic of 70,925 vehicles in 2010, according to the National Bridge Inventory Database.

The Washington State Department of Transportation has suggested alternative routes, but they involve smaller roads and bridges that cannot handle the same volume of traffic as the huge Interstate 5, which travels the length of the west coast from San Diego to Oregon and Washington before reaching the border with Canada.

Just north of the collapsed Skagit River bridge, is the huge Cascade Mall shopping center in Burlington, which attracts customers from a wide radius. Canadians from Vancouver and other parts of British Columbia often make trips to the outlet mall looking for bargains because of the near parity nowadays between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

“A lot of Canadian shoppers travel that corridor, said Jenny O'Brien, who handles marketing for the Cascade Mall. ""Obviously it will have an impact, when you get cars off the road.""

She said the mall was working with local communities and state transportation officials to see how altered traffic patterns might affect operations at the mall, which includes a Macy's, a Sears and a TJ Maxx, which is actually opening this weekend.

""This is the main thoroughfare for traffic and commerce going from Seattle to Vancouver,” said Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton. “It’s a far-reaching effect.”

“This is going to affect us not only this Memorial Day weekend, but long into the future,’’ Sexton said.

Canadians are worried too. Amber Sessions, a spokeswoman for Tourism Vancouver, said the city that hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics had more than 8 million visitors last year -- 475,000 of them from Washington state.

""The bridge collapse is on the main road from Seattle to Vancouver: it's not great news, for the flow of cross-border traffic. But it's not catastrophic, at least nobody was killed.""

Sessions said the busiest time for American tourists visiting the city, often referred to as Canada's LA because of its art and film-making community, its theaters and restaurants, was any long U. S. holiday weekend like Memorial Day or Martin Luther King Day in January."

While one major category of claimants — those who said their loan applications had been unfairly denied — remained eligible for payments of up to $50,000 without any documentation, others were required to produce written evidence that they had complained of bias at the time. The Hispanic plaintiffs were indignant.

Adam P. Feinberg, who represents some of them, said: “Once the government puts a program in place for one racial group, even if it decides it is too generous, it cannot adopt a different set of restrictions for another racial group. It’s outrageous.”

The claims process opened in late September, six weeks before the election. In the weeks before the March 25 deadline, facing far fewer claimants than expected, the Agriculture Department instructed processors to call about 16,000 people to remind them that time was running out, despite internal disquiet that the government was almost recruiting claims against itself. The deadline was then extended to May 1.

So far, about 1,900 Hispanics and 24,000 women have sought compensation, many in states where middlemen have built a cottage industry, promising to help win payouts for a fee.

Last October, a court-appointed ombudsman wrote that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people had given money to individuals and organizations in the belief that they were reserving the right to file a claim under the second settlement for black farmers, only to learn later that their names had never been forwarded to the authorities. People familiar with that statement said it was directed in part at Thomas Burrell, a charismatic orator and the head of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, based in Memphis.

Mr. Burrell has traveled the South for years, exhorting black audiences in auditoriums and church halls to file discrimination complaints with his organization’s help, in exchange for a $100 annual membership fee.

In an interview last month, Mr. Burrell said he had dedicated his life to helping black farmers after biased federal loan officers deprived him of his land and ruined his credit. He said his organization had misled no one, and had forwarded the names of all those eligible and willing to file claims."

Now, catfish is at the heart of a dispute as the House and Senate prepare to work out their differences on a new five-year farm bill. The current bill expires on Sept. 30.

At issue is a little-known provision in the 2008 bill that established an office within the Agriculture Department to inspect catfish. But those inspection programs also exist at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the Commerce Department.

The Agriculture Department has traditionally inspected meat and poultry while the F.D.A. has inspected all other foods, including seafood.

Since 2009 the Agriculture Department said that it has spent $20 million to set up the catfish inspection office, which has a staff of four. The department said that it expects to spend about $14 million a year to run it. The F.D.A. spends about $700,000 a year on its existing office."

Nominee for Fed chair calls economy still %27fragile%27

Risks of Fed%27s easy-money policies include overpriced assets and high inflation

Beneficiaries of Fed%27s push to keep rates low include %22all the Americans who own homes%22

Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen told senators Thursday that the Fed's stimulus measures continue to boost the recovery despite their growing risks, and she gave no clue when policymakers will begin to scale back the program.

""The (Fed's bond) purchases have made a meaningful contribution to economic growth and improving the outlook,"" said Yellen during a Senate banking committee hearing on her nomination to become chairman of the Federal Reserve.

If confirmed by the full Senate, she would succeed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke next year and become the first woman to head a major central bank.

Yellen largely echoed Bernanke's pro-growth approach, signaling to economists a continuity of Fed policies. ""One would be hard-pressed to distinguish Yellen from Bernanke"" from simply reading a transcript of the hearing, says J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli.

Yellen, 67, held her ground amid sharp questioning from committee Republicans who argued the risks and costs of the Fed's $85 billion in monthly bond purchases have grown, while benefits to the economy have diminished. The purchases are intended to hold down long-term interest rates and spur economic growth.

She said ""it's important"" that the Fed not taper down its bond buying too soon, ""especially when the recovery is still fragile."" Noting that 36% of jobless Americans have been out of work at least six months, she said, ""We know that long spells of unemployment are particularly painful.""

The economy has been growing at a tepid pace of about 2% a year during the four-year-old recovery, and unemployment, at 7.3%, remains high.

At the same time, Yellen acknowledged the risks of the bond-buying, which include eventual high inflation. She said she's particularly concerned about the formation of asset bubbles, such as those that appeared to develop recently in junk bonds and the stocks of real estate investment trusts. ""These are risks we take very seriously,"" she said, adding she doesn't now see evidence of bubbles that could burst, much like the real estate crash in 2007.

Yellen said she would not rule out reducing the Fed's stimulus or raising interest rates to combat investment bubbles — a stance that is considered controversial by some economists who say monetary policy should be used to boost the economy or fight inflation.

Still, Yellen said: ""At this point, I believe the benefits (of the stimulus) exceed the costs.""

Several Republicans argued otherwise. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the committee's ranking member, cited studies to argue that the benefits of the purchases to the economy have significantly diminished. Meantime, he said, the risks have grown.

Pressed by Crapo on when the Fed will begin to rein in the bond-buying, Yellen would not be specific but said that at each Fed meeting, ""what the committee is looking for is signs that we will have growth that's strong enough to promote continued progress.""

Some economists expect the Fed to begin paring back the program as early as December after a recent government report revealed surprisingly strong job gains of 204,000 in October despite the government shutdown. Many other economists expect the tapering to start in March, noting another congressional budget battle looms early next year.

Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said the Fed's stimulus has artificially inflated assets, such as house prices in certain markets, setting the stage for another possible downturn. ""I'm just worried we're on a sugar high,"" he said.

Yellen said, ""I don't see (rising home prices) as an asset bubble,"" adding that prices in hard-hit markets are simply rebounding from excessively low levels. She added that she doesn't see the stock market's record highs as a bubble.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., bluntly called the Fed's low interest-rate program ""an elitist policy"" that's helping wealthier Americans who own stocks, but ""it hasn't trickled down"" to low- and middle-income households that rely on now-meager bank interest rates for income.

Yellen acknowledged that people who own stocks are reaping big benefits and that those who keep most of their money in savings accounts have been hurt. But Fed policies also have helped heal the housing market, she said, benefiting all homeowners.

""The ripple effects go through the economy and bring benefits to, I would say, all Americans, both those who are unemployed and find it easier to get jobs as the recovery is stronger, and also to those who have jobs,"" she said.

She added that the Fed's easy-money program is the fastest way to accelerate economic growth so that the Fed can eventually raise short-term rates. ""I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,"" she said.

Yellen conceded that the Fed's signals in the spring that it may soon start to pare back the stimulus pushed up interest rates as financial markets misinterpreted the move as foreshadowing an earlier increase in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate. That contributed to the Fed's decision in September to hold off on the tapering.

""We do have to account for what's happening in the markets,"" she said. Noting the bond purchases — which have swelled the Fed's portfolio by $3 trillion since 20008 — are ""unprecedented,"" she added, ""It is a work in progress, and sometimes, miscommunication is possible.""

Yellen argued that ongoing federal spending cuts are hobbling economic growth and making the Fed's mission more difficult. ""I agree that fiscal policy has been working at cross purposes to monetary policy,"" she said. ""Some of the near-term (spending) reductions have certainly subtracted from the near-term momentum of the economy.""

Like Bernanke, she said the cuts should be weighted toward the medium- and long-term future, when the economy is on more solid ground.

Some Democrats pressed Yellen on delays in Fed efforts to implement banking reforms, which grew out of the 2008 financial crisis.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the Fed appears to put far more focus on monetary policy than bank supervision, noting its board failed to approve a $9 billion settlement with banks that illegally foreclosed on homes, leaving the task to staff.

""I absolutely believe our supervisory responsibilities are critical and just as important as monetary policy,"" Yellen said.

Yellen is widely expected to be confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Senate. She has played a leading role in developing the stimulus program and in taking steps to establish clearer Fed communication with financial markets and the public. She also helped form a Fed annual inflation goal of 2% and a policy to keep the Fed's short-term interest rate near zero, at least until unemployment, now 7.3%, falls to 6.5%."

A study released earlier this month from the public policy group Demos states that through various forms of government funding in the private sector, nearly two million people are making $12 an hour or less. The number of workers at Wal-Mart and McDonald's together at $12 an hour or less is currently around 1.5 million, according to the report.

""The sheer number of those workers making so little is surprising,"" said Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst at Demos and co-author of the study.

""We assume people working on behalf of America would be making more, but that's not the case,"" Traub said. ""And many of these people are making less than $12 an hour.""

The report says that when tax dollars underwrite bad jobs, the economy as a whole is weakened.

""People at these levels of income have to go on food stamps or other forms of government assistance and this just compounds the problem,"" Traub argued. ""They're not making a living wage and the economy suffers.""

Federal contracting to the private sector has grown over the years, doubling between 1990 and 2009, though it has decreased slightly since 2010, according to the Demos survey.

But the amount is still huge. American businesses got $446.5 billion from taxpayers last year in the form of grants, loans, and subsidies. Industries receiving funds include manufacturing, construction, food service, health care, retail and manufacturing. The number of workers under that funding totals 2.2 million.

The report says that most of the low-wage workers are clustered in sectors like apparel, construction, education and retail. But even industries seen as higher paying, such as scientific research, are among those with workers making $12 or less an hour.

The biggest offenders came from those companies receiving direct federal contracts. Some 560,000 workers in those firms make $12 an hour or less, says the report.

Breaking down the sectors in all government funding shows retail— with 59,977 people making $12 an hour or less—the largest group with low wages.

""This is another example of our low-wage economy,"" said Jason Bent, a professor of employment law at Stetson University. ""Private companies with government contracts are doing the same thing as those that don't have contracts. They're paying low wages to cut costs.""

Companies receiving some sort of government funding are mandated by law to uphold high employment practices including prevailing wages within a particular area of work.

But the Demos report states that most firms are not holding up their end of the bargain and are actually creating a wage gap.

Traub says the study highlights the disparity between those at the top of firms with government funding and those at the bottom. It singled out CEOs at Lockheed and Northrop Grumman—whose firms are headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area—for making millions in compensation while about 15 percent of federal contract workers in the same region are low-wage.

Low-wage jobs are becoming standard in the economy, say experts. A National Employment Law Project report in 2012 found that three out of five jobs added after the recession have been low-wage jobs, even though just one in five jobs lost during the recession was low-wage.

About a third of all workers in the U.S. make $12 an hour or less. A $12 an hour job is equivalent to a full-time worker with an annual income of $24,000 a year. For 2013, the Federal poverty guideline is an annual income of $23,550 for a family of four.

Traub said Congress will be having hearings on the issue raised in her report later this month. She hopes some action will be taken to brighten the prospects of workers.

""We'd love to have something done, especially since the president called for raising the minimum wage,"" Traub said. ""This doesn't seem right to have people working for America getting pushed to the economic bottom."""

The proposal, which hasn't been made public yet, would give trustees of multiemployer pension plans the discretion to cut guaranteed benefits, so long as those cuts were done as ""early corrective actions"" to financially troubled plans. While corporations in the past have been able to wiggle out of guarantees for future retirees, the promises to current retirees have generally been untouchable.

Several structural factors are driving that deficit upwards. The national trend of de-unionization coupled with job losses from the recession have meant that fewer and fewer workers are paying into funds as more and more retirees are starting to receive benefits. Employers also have an incentive to drop out of these pools when they can afford to do so—paying an exit fee has often proven more enticing than staying on the hook for owed benefits. Furthermore, like other pensions across the country, multi-employer plans were ravaged by the Wall Street-driven economic meltdown of 2008. While about 75 percent of multi-employer plans were considered financially healthy at the beginning of 2008, according to government criteria, only 30 percent were considered to be so by the start of 2009. But many plans have since improved—60 percent are once again stable, and only about 25 percent, many of them relatively small funds, are in critical status. In fact, it’s two large pension funds in particular—the 410,000-participant Central States Fund and an 118,000-member United Mine Workers of America fund—that are responsible for much of the funding crisis. Together, they make up about 5 percent of all workers covered by multi-employer plans and about $26 billion of the $27 billion in liabilities of plans projected to go insolvent, according to the PBGC.

For decades, the corporate answer to retirement security has been to cut pensions wherever possible. In recent years, states have gotten into the game, with Republican governors and legislators—and more than a few Democrats—attacking public worker pensions. Because after all, the private sector has already kicked as many people as possible out of pension plans, so wouldn't it be greedy of public workers not to follow private sector workers into retirement poverty? Now, Congress may be getting into the act , expanding the already vast range of ways existing pensions can come under attack:Multiemployer pension plans do face a deficit, but One thing that often drops out of the hype on troubled pensions is that personal retirement accounts like 401(k) plans are in as much trouble or more. According to economist Teresa Ghilarducci, ""Seventy-five percent of Americans nearing retirement age in 2010 had less than $30,000 in their retirement accounts,"" but ""To maintain living standards into old age we need roughly 20 times our annual income in financial wealth."" Suffice it to say, $30,000 is not 20 times most people's annual income. Continuing to attack pensions and thereby promoting these vastly inadequate personal accounts that are speeding the U.S. toward a generation of elders living in dire poverty, is a disaster waiting to happen. Unfortunately, if Congress weakens pensions, the disaster may not have to wait that long."

The vote came two weeks after the Agriculture Department reported that 17.6 million households did not have enough to eat at some point in 2012 because they lacked the resources to put food on the table. It came two days after the Census Bureau reported that 15 percent of Americans, or 46.5 million people, live in poverty.

These numbers were basically unchanged from 2011, but in a growing economy steady rates of hunger and poverty amount, in effect, to backsliding. Cutting food stamps would accelerate the slide. Food stamps kept four million people out of poverty last year and kept millions more from falling deeper into poverty. Under the House Republican bill, many of these people would be impoverished.

The struggling middle class is also faring poorly. Though the unemployment rate dropped to a low of 7.8 percent last year from a high of 9.1 percent in 2011, median household income was virtually unchanged, at $51,017. In a healthy economy, income would rise when unemployment falls. But in today’s weak economy, much of the decline in the jobless rate is not due to new hiring, but to a shrinking work force — the very definition of a feeble labor market in which employed people work for years without raises and unemployed job seekers routinely end up in new jobs that pay less than their previous ones."

She Joined The Post As A Reporter In She Has Also Been A Staff Writer At The Washington City Paper', 'The Center For Public Integrity.']","Despite government shutdown, federal job seekers bombard agencies with applications","Amid furloughs, pay freezes and political attacks on civil servants, the National Park Service recently posted an opening for a senior communications position that drew 400 applicants. Local universities report waiting lists for federal résumé workshops. And government job gurus are as busy as ever.

The 16-day government shutdown may have been demoralizing for the country’s more than 2 million federal workers, but it did little to deter the hundreds of thousands of people who scour government job listings daily and bombard agencies with résumés, all for the chance to join their ranks.

“Some say, ‘Why would I do this to myself?’ But they still want these jobs,” said Lisa Andrews, head of career services at University of Maryland University College. The school, which serves mostly working adults, offers a federal résumé writing webinar that consistently draws about 100 people at a time, more than any other, she said.

The popularity of federal jobs reflects the continued weakness of the job market, four years out from the end of the Great Recession, federal hiring experts said. As much as the public sector has been buffeted by turmoil in recent months, it is still seen as a haven from something even more uncertain: the private sector.

“The government is still aggressively hiring,” said Lily Whiteman, author of “How to Land a Top-Paying Federal Job.” “You look no matter what is going on because that’s where the jobs are.”

As of Wednesday, there were nearly 8,000 job postings and an average of 43 applicants for each job whose application deadline was that day, said Office of Personnel Management spokesman John Marble.

The federal government, which hired about 90,000 people last fiscal year, is in the midst of a retirement wave. And that, in turn, is triggering a hiring boom. In the last fiscal year, nearly twice as many executive branch employees retired than did in 2009, according to government figures. And the number of federal workers 60 or older has nearly doubled since 2000 to about 262,000. Low morale is a factor, and the partial shutdown did little to improve it.

For many aspiring federal employees, just the idea of retiring, vs. getting laid off, is enticing. Others have done prior stints at federal agencies and want back in. They tell similar stories of leaving for higher pay in the private sector, then coming back to the government for the security and the benefits.

Genise White, 49, of Fairfax County left her job at the Social Security Administration several years ago for a higher-paying private-sector job and wound up getting laid off. She’d rather work for Uncle Sam now.

“Even though you might not be making as much, it’s very hard to get fired. It’s very hard to get laid off, and you get a pretty good retirement package,” she said. “Who doesn’t want that?”

At a federal job seminar in Annandale on Wednesday, in the midst of the final congressional wrangling over a deal to reopen the government, a 60-year-old former civil servant was looking for work. The woman, who would give only her first name, Jeanette, said she worked for the federal government in the early 1990s, then left to work as a project manager for better-

paying government contractors. She has been laid off twice since, most recently in September.

“I’m seven years out from retirement,” she said. “And I want those medical benefits.”

The contrast between the stability of the public vs. private sector was in evidence at a Friday job fair for veterans, service members and their spouses at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. As the war in Afghanistan winds down, fewer private employers are recruiting at the fair, said retired Vice Adm. Norbert R. Ryan Jr. of the Military Officers Association of America, which organized the event.

“It’s stark, the changes between 2007 and now,” he said, “because of the challenges of the economy.”

The shutdown kept some agencies away, too: No one was in the office earlier in the week to send over recruiting materials. But they were still hiring.

The lines of job seekers to talk to big-name contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton were 20 and 30 people deep. But so was the one for the National Security Agency, which receives more than 85,000 applications a year, said spokeswoman Vanee Vines.

Working for taxpayers holds its own allure, said Sharon Gibson, who recruits veterans for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which hired 721 out of 28,000 applicants last year. “It’s about service and giving back.”

“People who want to work for the federal government want to make a difference, and there is no better place,” agreed Elaine Kaplan, acting director of OPM.

Colondra Etheredge, 40, a military spouse, and Kim Williams, 39, an Air Force officer about to retire next month, said given their backgrounds, government work seemed like more of a natural fit than working at a for-profit enterprise. “It’s what I know,” Williams said.

The unflagging interest in federal jobs is even more remarkable given how arcane and difficult the process of landing one can be. Despite efforts to slash essay writing requirements, it remains daunting.

Corliss Jackson spent 18 years in federal government human resources, including at the Office of Personnel Management. After she left to spend more time raising her three children, friends began asking her for help getting federal jobs. She has been working as a job coach nonstop ever since.

During the shutdown, she had a full week of seminars for job seekers. She learned that lawmakers had finally cut a deal to reopen the government just as she was setting up for her second talk of the day at a Fairfax County employment office. The news barely registered with the two women who came to see her. Both had worked as government contractors, and both wanted to be full-fledged federal government workers or, as Jackson put it, “achieve permanency.”

For the past four years, Dawn McClure, 46, has gotten up each morning, gone to her computer and searched for a federal job. A military spouse who followed her husband, an Air Force colonel, to San Antonio from the District in June, McClure has a master’s in human resources and has applied for more than 100 jobs across a host of federal agencies. But she has had no luck getting an interview.

“I’m a professional job applicant,” she said.

The political forces that led to the shutdown worry Ed Jalinske, 34, a D.C. health-care policy analyst who had his own consulting business but now craves the stability of a government paycheck. He is looking for jobs at the Education Department, at the Department of Health and Human Services, and on the Hill.

Watching the government close up shop “definitely gives me some pause because they are setting a precedent for what could end up being the norm during this administration,” he said. “But I’m not going to let it deter me.”"

It was unclear how long the shutdown might go on, and no one in either party could say if Republicans would remain firm in their insistence that Democrats agree to significant changes to the health care law. But on the initial day of the first shutdown in nearly 18 years — when a Republican-controlled Congress battled another Democratic president, Bill Clinton — there was little business getting done in the House or the Senate other than photo opportunities and partisan speeches.

One senior Republican, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, indicated that the stalemate could go on for at least two more weeks until the nation reaches its borrowing limit. He said the deadline to address the debt limit, and avoid a default, could be “the forcing mechanism to bring the two parties together.”

Yet House Republicans also vow to oppose an increase in the debt ceiling unless Mr. Obama delays the health care law.

On Tuesday night, Speaker John A. Boehner and House Republicans tried to ease the effects of the shutdown and force Democrats into negotiation. The Republicans proposed three bills — to finance veterans’ programs, the National Park Service and federally run services in Washington — but because they introduced the measures under a fast-track procedural rule that required a two-thirds vote, each of them failed."

Pat Quinn and lawmakers to fix the state’s hemorrhaging pension system during this month’s lame-duck session.

Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service downgraded Illinois in what is the latest fallout over the $96.8 billion debt to five state pension systems. The New York rating firm’s ranking signaled taxpayers may pay tens of millions of dollars more in interest when the state borrows money for roads and other projects.

“It’s absolutely bad news for taxpayers,” said Dan Rutherford, the Republican state treasurer.

Illinois received its bottom-of-the-pack ranking when it fell from an “A” rating to “A-minus.”

That’s the same rating as California, but California has a positive outlook. Illinois’ fragile overall financial status netted it a negative outlook, putting it behind California overall. The ratings came out now because Illinois plans to issue $500 million in bonds within days.

Exactly how much Illinois’ credit-rating slide ultimately will cost taxpayers is unknown until the demand for the state’s bonds is measured in the markets. But Rutherford estimated the state will pay $95 million more in interest than if Illinois had a AAA rating, which is much higher.

Even before the downgrade was revealed, Quinn said in Chicago the “pressure is higher than ever” to solve the pension problem because “credit rating agencies are screaming at the top of their voice” for final action.

The Democratic governor and lawmakers couldn’t cut a pension deal despite his deadline forthe outgoing legislature to act before the new General Assembly was sworn in Jan. 9.

On Friday, Quinn called for lawmakers to take up legislation sponsored by Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, that combines two rival pension plans emerging from the House and Senate. Both rein in costs by reducing benefits, an action unions have argued is unconstitutional.

Cullerton spokeswoman Rikeesha Phelon said the rating agencies are “confirming what we all recognize. It’s time for action on pensions.”

House Republican leader Tom Cross of Oswego maintained Friday’s downgrade underscores the “gravity of Illinois’ fiscal crisis.” Moody’s already ranks Illinois 50th among the states, and Fitch ranks the state 49th but warns of a negative watch, Rutherford said.

One other ominous point in the Standard & Poor’s report is that inaction could lead to downgrading Illinois to “BBB,” an “unusual” low rating for any state. The agency noted a “lack of action on pension reform and upcoming budget challenges could result in further credit deterioration.”

“Most states will build reserves when the economy is performing well, and that typically provides a cushion when the revenues deteriorate,” said Robin Prunty, the S&P; analyst who heads the agency’s state ratings group. “But Illinois has never really carried or accumulated any kind of budgetary reserves.”

On top of the pension meltdown, Illinois faces more grim budget duties. The state already has made major cuts in school funding in two straight budgets, and the Quinn administration predicted more cuts are on the way. In addition, a 67 percent increase in the income tax rate lawmakers imposed in 2011 starts to decline in 2015. And the state has billions of dollars in unpaid bills.

Story highlights NEW: Most FAA workers will face furloughs, LaHood says Ray LaHood warns of major impact from forced spending cuts as soon as April Transportation secretary calls on fellow Republicans to compromise The spending cuts are scheduled to be implemented starting March 1

Upcoming forced government spending cuts will heavily impact the Federal Aviation Administration, triggering flight delays nationwide and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Friday.

“Travelers should expect delays,” LaHood told reporters in calling for fellow Republicans to work toward compromise to avert the worst impacts of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts set to take effect March 1.

The full impact won’t be felt until April as furloughs and other staffing reductions of air traffic controllers come into effect, said LaHood, who has announced his intention to step down from President Barack Obama’s Cabinet.

“Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff,” LaHood said. “Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country.”

In addition, control towers at smaller airports such as Boca Raton, Florida, and Joplin, Missouri, would be closed, he said.

Asked why he was brought to the White House briefing room to address reporters, he said: “I would describe my presence here with one word – Republican.”

“They’re hoping that maybe I can influence members of my own party” to compromise with Obama and Democrats on an alternative to the mandatory spending cuts agreed to in a 2011 deal to increase the federal borrowing limit, LaHood said.

LaHood is a former member of the House of Representatives from Illinois.

In a letter to airline associations, the Defense Department and other “aviation colleagues” released on Friday, LaHood said plans under consideration to absorb the mandatory spending cuts included furloughs for most FAA workers, eliminating midnight shifts in 60 control towers and shutting down more than 100 towers at smaller airports.

The FAA operates towers at more than 400 airports nationwide.

The Homeland Security Department has separately warned of longer security lines at airports if budget cuts take effect, another potential headache for air travelers.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/08/pf/taxes/tax-reform-north-carolina/index.html,2013-08-08 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],North Carolina's Republican tax reform,"Tax reform is still all talk, talk, talk in Washington. And many expect real action could take years.

But not in North Carolina. The state has taken a very big first step in overhauling its tax code -- enacting its first major reform in 80 years.

The change, signed into law last month, creates a modified flat tax system, with a single income tax rate, an increased standard deduction and fewer tax breaks, as well as the elimination of the personal exemption and a $50,000 deduction for small business owners. It also repeals the state's estate tax.

""It's fairly radical in relation to other states,"" said Kathleen Thies, senior state tax analyst for the tax publisher CCH.

Quiz: How many pages in the U.S. tax code?

The overhaul has been lauded by Republicans, who dominate the state's legislature. They see the changes as a way to attract more business to North Carolina and create jobs.

The big hope: The new economic activity will compensate for the estimated $2.4 billion revenue loss over the next five years as a result of the reforms.

But the overhaul -- which represents a scaled back version of earlier proposals -- has been heavily criticized by many, mostly liberals. They contend its tax cuts will disproportionately benefit the rich and the revenue loss will cut into government services.

Starting in 2014, the individual income tax rate will be 5.8%, and then it will fall to 5.75% in 2015. Those rates are down from the 6%, 7% and 7.75% rates currently in effect.

The standard deduction, meanwhile, will more than double -- to $7,500 for singles, from $3,000; and to $15,000 for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000.

The corporate income tax will also be reduced in 2014 to 6% from 6.9%. It will drop to 5%in 2015. And if revenue growth targets are met, the rate could go as low as 3% thereafter.

Related: States with sweetest corporate tax breaks

For several reasons, North Carolina's reform strays from a pure flat tax system, which would simply apply one tax rate to income and wages, one to business income and a standard deduction for everyone.

Instead, the Tar Heel state's tax overhaul still allows for several tax breaks on top of the standard deduction. Among them: charitable contributions, a child tax credit and a joint deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes.

That combined real estate deduction, however, is capped at $20,000. That could reduce the value of those tax breaks for anyone who's now paying at least a 4% rate on a $400,000 or $500,000 mortgage or for someone who owns multiple properties, according to CPA Rollin Groseclose, who is based in Asheville, N.C.

North Carolina's tax overhaul also strays from a pure flat tax system because individuals still must pay taxes on their investment income, which will continue to be treated as ordinary income.

Lastly, the reform did very little to expand the list of services subject to the state sales tax, noted Groseclose, who is on the board of the North Carolina Association of CPAs.

The independent association, which didn't advocate for any particular proposal, has been calling for a modernized tax code that is less dependent on personal and corporate income taxes, which can be volatile.

The state's biggest opportunity for more revenue would be to apply its sales tax to services, Groseclose said. But the new reforms still leave most of them exempt.

Indeed, he noted, only about 25 or 30 services are subject to tax -- such as dry cleaning. But another 165 to 175 could be -- such as CPA services.

Groseclose sees the new law as a work in progress and expects legislators to continue to make adjustments in the next few years.

It's hard to say yet what lessons North Carolina will hold for lawmakers in Washington as they seek to overhaul the federal tax code.

While the chief tax writers in the House and the Senate may produce tax reform legislation this fall, few expect those proposals to get very far this year or next, a midterm election year.

That's because both parties still can't bridge their most basic differences, such as whether reform should raise more revenue than the current system or not.

But like North Carolina, it's a fair bet if they do get around to passing tax reform, the end product may not be as much of a one-eighty as reformers had hoped."

USA TODAY

House bill offered by Republican leader doubled the cuts approved by the Agriculture Committee

Democrats%2C including President Obama%2C are strongly opposed to the bill

Bill must be reconciled with Senate bill that cuts %244.5 billion from food stamps

The House approved a Republican plan Thursday to cut food stamps by $39 billion during the next decade, setting up a showdown with Democrats over the program used by nearly 48 million low-income Americans.

The House voted 217-210 for the bill that cuts nearly twice as much from food stamps as a bill the House rejected in June. It is also far more than a Senate measure passed earlier this year that would trim about $4.5 billion in spending. The bill failed to draw the support of a single Democrat, many of whom have said the steep cuts would erode a key safety net depended upon by families with children, seniors, veterans and people looking for work.

Fifteen Republicans also voted against the bill.

Republicans argued that the bill would restore the program's original eligibility limits and preserve the safety net for the truly needy.

The bill would cause 3 million people to lose benefits while another 850,000 would see their benefits cut, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The White House threatened Wednesday to veto the bill, calling food stamps one of the ""nation's strongest defenses against hunger and poverty.""

The battle over food stamps has left in limbo the future of farm policy, and slowed efforts to write a new five-year, $500 billion farm bill. The current law expires on Sept. 30.

In June, the House rejected the farm bill in a floor vote that was seen as a major setback to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Democrats argued that the cuts in the bill were too severe, and Republicans opposed the bill because of costs they said were still too high.

A few weeks later, the House broke the farm bill into two separate chunks, narrowly approving the subsidy and conservation section but reserving the food stamp portion for later.

The cost of food stamps — officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — has exploded over the past decade, according to the Department of Agriculture. In 2001, the program served 17 million people at a cost of just over $15 billion. By June of this year, there were 47.8 million people enrolled in the program, and annual costs were about $75 billion.

Republicans argue that the growth has been fueled by allowing states to waive eligibility requirements, allowing more people to enroll in the program than the law originally intended.

The bill originally passed by the House Agriculture Committee would have cut $20 billion from the program over 10 years, in large part by limiting the ability of states to automatically qualify people who are already enrolled in other anti-poverty programs. Earlier this week, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., introduced a new version of the bill that boosts the cuts to nearly $40 billion by adding stiffer requirements for many able-bodied recipients to be working or looking for work or in a job-training program. The bill does not include new funding for job training.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, ""spending for SNAP would total $764 billion over the 2014-2023 period."" Passage of the House bill would reduce those costs by $39 billion or about a 5%.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, told USA TODAY's Capital Download on Thursday that Democrats are not opposed to food stamp cuts.

""I'm certain that we could embrace as House Democrats some measure of cuts,"" she said. ""I mean, every program can benefit from some savings. But the first go-round the Republicans' proposed cut was $20 billion. Then they passed an amendment that was $31.4 billion. And now that still isn't good enough for the Tea Partiers. Now we're at $40 billion. What they're saying is that in America it's OK for people to go hungry.""

But Agriculture Committee member Mike Conaway, R-Texas, said Thursday ""we are not talking about eliminating the SNAP program."" The goal of the bill, he said, is to ""limit the public assistance program to those who qualify and close loopholes that have allowed people to game the system."" The changes will help ""keep the safety net intact for qualified families,"" he said.

Despite the divide between Republicans and Democrats over food stamps, lawmakers in the House and the Senate are expected to move quickly to try to write a farm bill that includes both food stamps and agricultural programs.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, said Thursday, """"House Republicans' vote to deny nutrition assistance to hungry, low-income Americans is shameful. The Senate will never pass such hateful, punitive legislation.""

If Congress cannot pass a bill, the food stamp program would continue in its present state, with no cuts."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress are playing pingpong over funding the government and President Obama's health care law. The first government shutdown since 1996 will occur if lawmakers and the White House don't work things out.

Here are the five things to know about the pending shutdown for Monday, Sept. 30:

The state of play: The new fiscal year starts Tuesday, Oct. 1, so a bill to fund the government must be passed by both chambers in Congress and signed by Obama by midnight tonight.

Who's got the ball? The Senate, because the House passed a spending bill early Sunday that would also delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act for one year. The House also voted to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices to help pay for the health care law. Both policy provisions are non-starters for the Democratic majority in the Senate and the White House — so expect the Senate to send the spending bill back to the House without those items. The Senate convenes at 2 p.m. ET.

What about the House? The lawmakers will gavel into session at 10 a.m. ET, but their legislative agenda is unclear. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., says votes could start as early as 11 a.m. ET depending on any Senate action.

Where is Obama? He's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then the Cabinet.So far, the president hasn't been negotiating with Congress to resolve the budget impasse. As for the health care law, the state-run health exchanges to help people buy insurance are set to begin Tuesday.

Will I feel the shutdown? Yes and no. Social Security recipients will receive benefits, mail service will continue and taxes will still be collected. But if you wanted to visit a national park, historic site or a Smithsonian museum, those gates and doors will shut Tuesday without funding. For more detail, USA TODAY's Gregory Korte provides answers to 66 questions about the government shutdown.

The jurist will be asked to decide whether city and state officials acted in good faith and did all that they could to avoid filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. Depending on the answer, the judge can determine who will bear the pain of lost revenue, income and public employee pensions.

“There’s nothing left to do here. There is no revenue solution. … Chapter 9 is more needed here than any other possible scenario you could think of,” attorney Bruce Bennett said in his opening remarks. Witnesses “will present a mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city,” Bennett said, according to the Associated Press. “This is one of those cases where the data speaks very clearly and persuasively on its own. It needs no gloss.”

But in her opening statement, Jennifer Green, an attorney for Detroit’s pension funds, stressed the creditor position that months of official correspondence indicates officials were preparing for a bankruptcy filing and not taking time to negotiate with creditors, especially unions.

“It really was a forgone conclusion,” she said, according to reports from the courtroom.

The unions argue that the city’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, who was appointed to effectively take control of the broken city, never wanted to bargain with the pension funds and just wanted to slash benefits. Orr has said the pension funds are $3.5 billion short and he also wants to cuts health benefits negotiated in the past.

The trial is expected to last several days -- possibly spilling into the first week of November -- with top officials, including Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, expected to be among the witnesses.

The outcome could also have an impact on other possible municipal bankruptcies as the nation slowly comes out of the preceding years of economic pain.

Bankruptcy law was designed to protect those who were in financial trouble by giving them some breathing room to reorganize their operations. It also allows judges to eventually decide who gets a financial haircut. For example, will pensioners lose benefits? Or will bondholders have to settle for repayment of pennies on the dollar?

At least 100 creditors, including those holding city bonds, are among those opposing the city’s request for bankruptcy protection.

While unions argue that their members and retirees should not be penalized, other creditors argue that a cut to municipal bond value would fall like a rock onto the entire municipal market. It would send ripples of pain across the country as funding for government projects begin to dry up or become more expensive because of higher interest rates.

There are some general criteria that have to be decided for Detroit to win bankruptcy protection.

It needs to show it is insolvent -- not a big problem given that everyone agrees it is $18 billion in debt. But it must also show that it negotiated with creditors in good faith and is not just trying to use this crisis to slip in the kind of cuts it has long wanted to do.

If Rhodes grants protection, the city would likely propose a reorganization plan shortly.

If he says no, Detroit would have to bargain with its creditors, a process that would likely set records for litigation.

North Dakota retains claim to lowest jobless rate%3B Nevada still has the highest

17 states had unemployment rates significantly below the national average in October

Texas leads U.S. in job gains year over year

Unemployment rates fell in 28 states in October while non-farm payroll employment increased in 34 states, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

Illustrating the generally better trend compared with September, the states that have long held the highest and lowest jobless rates in the country each saw improvement last month.

Nevada, which has led the nation in unemployment nearly every month since early 2010, had a rate of 9.3%. That's a tenth of a percentage point below September's and a full percentage point lower than October 2012.

The Silver State is recovering slowly from the housing bust and recession. Construction jobs are still more than 60% off their pre-recession highs and even the much stronger leisure and hospitality sector remains 5.5% below its 2007 jobs peak.

North Dakota, its fortunes lifted by an energy boom, has enjoyed the nation's lowest unemployment rate since late 2008 and kept that distinction in October. At 2.7%, its jobless rate was a tenth of a point lower than September's and half a point lower than a year earlier.

The national jobless rate last month was 7.3%, up from 7.2% in September.

Friday's report showed 17 states had rates significantly below the U.S. average in October while nine states plus the District of Columbia had measurably higher rates. The district's unemployment rate jumped 0.3 percentage points to 8.9% in October, a month that included the federal government's partial shutdown for 16 days.

Florida led the U.S. with the largest monthly increase in employment, gaining 44,600 jobs. California followed with a gain of 39,800 jobs and North Carolina was third with 22,200.

The states with the most significant decreases in employment over the month were Kentucky, down 12,600; Washington, 8,100; and South Dakota, 2,600.

Over the year, Texas has led the nation in job gains with 267,400. California ranks second with 207,300 and Florida is third with 182,200."

Previously']",Obama budget would cut entitlements in exchange for tax increases,"President Obama will propose a budget next week that embraces a risky strategy of courting Republicans for a grand bargain on the debt while angering Democratic allies with cuts to the nation’s entitlement programs.

White House officials said Friday that Obama’s budget would cut Medicare and Social Security and ask for less tax revenue than he has previously sought. The budget, to be released Wednesday, will fully incorporate the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) during December’s “fiscal cliff” talks — which included $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction through spending cuts and tax increases.

On Friday, liberals expressed outrage that a freshly reelected president would concede so much. Some of Obama’s allies said they were concerned that he was making a strategic mistake. Yet the president’s aides said he was intent on showing that he was not backing away from the compromise he had offered.

“The budget reflects his priorities within a budget world that is not ideal,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “It requires compromise, negotiation and a willingness to accept that you won’t get 100 percent of what you want.”

The budget will break with the president’s tradition of providing a sweeping vision of his ideal spending priorities, untethered from political realities. But the spirit of compromise did not win Obama much immediate support, as Republicans and Democrats questioned whether it would lead to an agreement.

View Graphic The battle over the 2014 budget

Boehner accused Obama of holding entitlement cuts “hostage” in an effort to win support for more tax increases, despite warnings from congressional Republicans not to do so.

“That’s no way to lead and move the country forward,” Boehner said.

But some of the most heated commentary came from the left, which was furious that the president was enshrining cuts to Social Security as official administration policy. Obama proposed changing the cost-of-living calculation for Social Security in a way that will reduce benefits for most recipients, a key Republican request that he had earlier embraced only as part of a compromise.

“I am terribly disappointed and will do everything in my power to block President Obama’s proposal to cut benefits for Social Security recipients,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats. “I remember when Obama said he was concerned about retirees struggling to get by and was unequivocal in his opposition to cutting cost-of-living adjustments.”

Overall, the budget request reflects Obama’s stark shift in strategy over the past month, as he has adopted a far more congenial posture toward the opposition. He has begun a charm offensive, reaching out to rank-and-file House and Senate Republicans, dining and speaking privately with them. Obama is set to have dinner with a group of Republicans on Wednesday night, just hours after his budget is released.

Obama’s aides have not been overly optimistic about the prospects for a deal. But they now argue that a strategy of private outreach, coupled with public events, offers the best path for progress not only on the deficit but also on other issues, including immigration and gun control. The White House says the concessions in Obama’s budget should not be viewed as a list of options but rather as a cohesive package.

Obama decided to incorporate the approach he had offered Boehner after a debate among his advisers and allies on Capitol Hill, according to people familiar with the discussions. Some worried that the White House was giving away concessions before Republicans agreed to make some of their own.

“I have some tactical concerns about the White House approach and some substantive concerns,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a White House ally in pursuit of a broad budget deal.

“The president has essentially said this is his end point and this is a compromise proposal,” Van Hollen said. “Republicans have rejected this as a compromise. From the Republican perspective, the president’s budget is the starting point for negotiation.”

White House officials say Obama felt that, as president, it was important he stand by his original offer and include it in his budget proposal.

“We want to make clear that it’s something that we’re willing to do. To not put it in [the budget] would be a conversation disconnected with reality,” a senior White House official said. Failing to do so, the official said, would have provoked howls from Republicans that “you moved the goal posts.”

Officials also pointed out that the president’s budget goes beyond the Boehner offer. Obama’s budget would fund several new priorities, including the creation of a program offering preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income backgrounds.

Officials proposed an increase in tobacco taxes to pay for the early childhood education initiative and would also seek to generate revenue by limiting how much wealthy individuals can accrue in their tax-protected retirement accounts. Such accounts would be capped at $3 million in 2013 dollars — which officials say is enough to finance a $205,000-a-year income. The president would also seek to scrap a loophole in the law that lets people collect both unemployment insurance and disability payments — so called double-dipping.

The budget request comes on top of a deal struck at the start of the year to raise taxes on the wealthy by more than $600 billion over a decade.

Through that pact and earlier agreements, Congress and Obama have agreed to reduce the annual budget deficit — how much more the government spends than it collects — by $2.5 trillion over the next decade. If left in place, the deep spending cuts that took effect March 1, known as sequestration, would reduce the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion over the same period. That would be just about enough to keep deficits from rising and to stabilize the debt, as measured as a percentage of the overall economy.

But Obama’s budget proposal would eliminate sequestration and replace it with a variety of other deficit-reduction measures, together worth $1.8 trillion, according to White House estimates.

The deficit, which is projected this year to be equal to 5.5 percent of the size of the economy, would shrink to 1.7 percent of the economy by 2023. By comparison, the House Republican budget — which would curtail spending on dozens of programs for the poor, repeal Obama’s health-care law and partially privatize Medicare for people now younger than 55 — aims to eliminate the deficit by 2023. A more liberal plan passed by Senate Democrats would make the deficit 2.2 percent of the size of the economy by that point.

The budget is more conservative than Obama’s earlier proposals, which called for $1.6 trillion in new taxes and fewer cuts to health and domestic spending programs. Obama is seeking to raise $580 billion in tax revenue by limiting deductions for the wealthy and closing loopholes for certain industries such as oil and gas.

The budget proposal slices $200 billion from already- tight defense and domestic budgets. It would cut $400 billion from Medicare and other health programs by negotiating better prescription drug prices and asking wealthy seniors to pay more, among other policies. It would also generate $200 billion in savings by scaling back farm subsidies and federal retiree programs, among other proposals.

The proposal to change the formula to calculate Social Security payments, also originally part of the offer to Boehner, would generate $130 billion in savings and $100 billion in revenue, a result of the impact of the change on other government programs.

Obama is submitting his budget two months late, after aides scrambled to deal with the end-of-year “fiscal cliff” and then the March 1 deadline for sequestration. With the House and the Senate having passed dueling budget proposals, both sides will see whether they can find a compromise.

Two upcoming debates will provide opportunities. This summer, Congress will once again be forced to raise the federal debt ceiling or risk a default on the national debt. Republicans in February decided not to mount a fight over the debt ceiling, as they had in 2011, and it is not yet clear whether they will oppose an increase this time. In addition, Congress and the White House will have to agree to a new budget plan at the end of September.

Corporate America worked hard to build massive loopholes into the tax code for itself, and by golly it is working just as hard to keep them.

U.S. companies, along with their lobbyists and trade groups, are treating Washington, D.C., like a big, swampy strip club, showering it with cash in an effort to fight tax reform laws that might put hundreds of billions of dollars back into government coffers. The seamy details of this lobbying effort are found in a new study by the reform advocacy group Public Citizen. It is arguably one of the least-surprising studies in the history of studies, right up there with research confirming that popes tend to wear large hats. But it makes for depressing, eye-opening reading nonetheless.

For one thing, there is the chart that leads off the study, showing how corporate profits have soared to all-time highs as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, while corporate taxes are near record lows. (Story continues after Chart Of Anger, courtesy of Public Citizen.)

This state of affairs exists largely because the biggest U.S. corporations have for years lobbied Congress for loopholes that allow them to keep much of their profits out of the clutches of the IRS, including an estimated $1.7 trillion in cash held offshore.

Apple Inc. has been public face of this issue lately, with its CEO Tim Cook hauled before a Senate panel to explain why his company is keeping more than $100 billion offshore. Apple spent $2 million on lobbying last year and could double that this year, Reuters reported recently. The company has managed to avoid paying taxes, in perfectly legal ways, on $74 billion in profits since 2009, according to a recent Senate investigation.

As you may have heard, the U.S. government has found itself in a bit of a fiscal pickle recently and could use some of this cash. That has led some lawmakers to try to find ways to close some of these loopholes. Two bills, the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act and the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, have aimed to do just that. A third bill, the Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act, would slap taxes on some financial transactions -- not a loophole-closing bill, exactly, but one that would help address the fact that the U.S. financial sector currently makes up 30 percent of total corporate profits, but only coughs up 18 percent of total corporate tax revenues to the government.

Some reform-minded groups are lobbying in favor of these bills, notes Public Citizen. But they are being drowned out by the lobbying in the other direction.

Of the 383 lobbyists working over lawmakers on these bills, 331 were from companies or corporate trade groups opposed to them, by Public Citizen's count.

Meanwhile, the companies and groups lobbying on these bills are represented by 46 different political action committees that donated money to lawmakers in the 2012 election cycle, according to Public Citizen. Of that group, 40 PACs represented corporate America and spent $20 million on their favorite candidates. The top three money-donating PACs in this group were the National Association of Realtors, the Credit Union National Association and the American Bankers Association. Individual corporate PACs included AT&T, General Electric, Pfizer and Microsoft.

It's a free country, of course, and companies, like people, have the right to free speech in the form of campaign donations. But all that free speech is expensive, and these companies have a lot more money to make their case than the rest of us taxpayers -- who will almost certainly keep ending up paying the cost."

Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?

It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.

It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/congress-eyes-milk-prices-politics-farm-talks-072625221--finance.html,,[],"Congress eyes milk prices, politics in farm talks","WASHINGTON (AP) — The fight over renewing the nation's farm bill has centered on cuts to the $80 billion-a-year food stamp program. But there could be unintended consequences if no agreement is reached: higher milk prices.

Members of the House and Senate are scheduled to begin long-awaited negotiations on the five-year, roughly $500 billion bill this week. If they don't finish it, dairy supports could expire at the end of the year and send the price of a gallon of milk skyward.

There could be political ramifications, too. The House and Senate are far apart on the sensitive issue of how much money to cut from food stamps, and lawmakers are hoping to resolve that debate before election-year politics set in.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who is one of the negotiators on the bill, says the legislation could also be a rare opportunity for the two chambers to show they can get along.

""In the middle of the chaos of the last month comes opportunity,"" Klobuchar says of the farm legislation. ""This will really be a test of the House of whether they are willing to work with us.""

The farm bill, which sets policy for farm subsidies, the food stamps and other rural development projects, has moved slowly through Congress in the last two years as lawmakers have focused on higher-profile priorities, like budget negotiations, health care and immigration legislation.

But farm-state lawmakers are appealing to their colleagues to harken back to more bipartisan times and do something Congress hasn't done very much lately — pass a major piece of legislation.

Even President Barack Obama, who has been largely silent on the farm bill as it has wound through Congress, said as the government reopened earlier this month that the farm bill ""would make a huge difference in our economy right now.""

""What are we waiting for?"" Obama said. ""Let's get this done.""

The main challenge in getting the bill done will be the differences on food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The House has passed legislation to cut around $4 billion annually, or around 5 percent, including changes in eligibility and work requirements. The Senate has proposed a cut of around a tenth of that amount.

Story continues

""I think there are very different world views clashing on food stamps and those are always more difficult to resolve,"" says Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union.

Johnson says coming together on the farm issues, while there are differences, will be easier because the mostly farm-state lawmakers negotiating the bill have common goals.

Passing a farm bill could help farm-state lawmakers in both parties in next year's elections, though some Republicans are wary of debating domestic food aid in campaign season. Republican House leaders put the bill on hold during the 2012 election year.

One way to pass the bill quickly could be to wrap it into budget negotiations that will be going on at the same time. The farm bill is expected to save tens of billions of dollars through food stamp cuts and eliminating some subsidy programs, and ""that savings has become more key as we go into budget negotiations,"" Klobuchar said.

If that doesn't work, lawmakers could extend current law, as they did at the end of last year when the dairy threat loomed. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has said he wants to finish the bill and won't support another extension.

One of the reasons the bill's progress has moved slowly is that most of farm country is enjoying a good agricultural economy, and farmers have not clamored for changes in policy. But with deadlines looming, many say they need more government certainty to make planting decisions. Most of the current law expired in September, though effects largely won't be felt until next year when the dairy supports expire.

Some farmers are feeling the effects of the expired bill now, however. An early blizzard in South Dakota earlier this month killed thousands of cattle, and a federal disaster program that could have helped cover losses has expired.

Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., also a negotiator on the conference committee, says her constituents aren't concerned with the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, but they just want to see a bill pass.

""Maybe the biggest question is can we put together a bill that can pass on the House and Senate floor,"" she said.

The plan calls for $975 billion in new tax revenue through closing loopholes and ending deductions and credits benefiting corporations and the country’s highest wage earners.

It also calls for $100 billion in new stimulus spending while cutting $1.85 trillion from the deficit over 10 years. The rest of the savings would come through spending cuts.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray said the budget takes a balanced, “pro-middle-class” approach and argued the country’s economic problems started long before fellow Democrats entered the White House in 2009.

“Despite some of the rhetoric you may hear from my Republican colleagues, the Great Recession didn’t start the day President Obama was elected,” said Murray, D-Wash.

More On This...

The plan also calls for replacing the recent, $85 billion in spending cuts with more measured cuts.

Committee members will begin voting and submitting amendments Thursday, with a full Senate vote expected by next week.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Session, the committee’s ranking Republican, immediately criticized the proposal.

“It’s anything but balanced,” he said. “Raising taxes and spending is anything but balanced.”

The budget was presented one day after the Republican-controlled House rolled out its fiscal 2014 budget -- a plan to balance the budget in 10 years largely by slowing the rate of spending and adding in the roughly $600 billion in tax increases Democrats got in January.

The upper chamber announced the details as President Obama met with House Republicans.

Obama said after the meeting that it was ""good” and “useful.""

However, the recent optimism about Democrats and Republicans perhaps agreeing on a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to craft a single budget – or a so-called “grand bargain” – appears to be fading.

""Ultimately, it may be that the differences are just too wide,"" the president told ABC before going to Capitol Hill."

Pat Quinn and lawmakers to fix the state’s hemorrhaging pension system during this month’s lame-duck session.

Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service downgraded Illinois in what is the latest fallout over the $96.8 billion debt to five state pension systems. The New York rating firm’s ranking signaled taxpayers may pay tens of millions of dollars more in interest when the state borrows money for roads and other projects.

“It’s absolutely bad news for taxpayers,” said Dan Rutherford, the Republican state treasurer.

Illinois received its bottom-of-the-pack ranking when it fell from an “A” rating to “A-minus.”

That’s the same rating as California, but California has a positive outlook. Illinois’ fragile overall financial status netted it a negative outlook, putting it behind California overall. The ratings came out now because Illinois plans to issue $500 million in bonds within days.

Exactly how much Illinois’ credit-rating slide ultimately will cost taxpayers is unknown until the demand for the state’s bonds is measured in the markets. But Rutherford estimated the state will pay $95 million more in interest than if Illinois had a AAA rating, which is much higher.

Even before the downgrade was revealed, Quinn said in Chicago the “pressure is higher than ever” to solve the pension problem because “credit rating agencies are screaming at the top of their voice” for final action.

The Democratic governor and lawmakers couldn’t cut a pension deal despite his deadline forthe outgoing legislature to act before the new General Assembly was sworn in Jan. 9.

On Friday, Quinn called for lawmakers to take up legislation sponsored by Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, that combines two rival pension plans emerging from the House and Senate. Both rein in costs by reducing benefits, an action unions have argued is unconstitutional.

Cullerton spokeswoman Rikeesha Phelon said the rating agencies are “confirming what we all recognize. It’s time for action on pensions.”

House Republican leader Tom Cross of Oswego maintained Friday’s downgrade underscores the “gravity of Illinois’ fiscal crisis.” Moody’s already ranks Illinois 50th among the states, and Fitch ranks the state 49th but warns of a negative watch, Rutherford said.

One other ominous point in the Standard & Poor’s report is that inaction could lead to downgrading Illinois to “BBB,” an “unusual” low rating for any state. The agency noted a “lack of action on pension reform and upcoming budget challenges could result in further credit deterioration.”

“Most states will build reserves when the economy is performing well, and that typically provides a cushion when the revenues deteriorate,” said Robin Prunty, the S&P; analyst who heads the agency’s state ratings group. “But Illinois has never really carried or accumulated any kind of budgetary reserves.”

On top of the pension meltdown, Illinois faces more grim budget duties. The state already has made major cuts in school funding in two straight budgets, and the Quinn administration predicted more cuts are on the way. In addition, a 67 percent increase in the income tax rate lawmakers imposed in 2011 starts to decline in 2015. And the state has billions of dollars in unpaid bills.

Surprise%3A D.C. is not most affected by the impasse

But the state in the top spot is nearby

With America two weeks into the government shutdown temper tantrum, politicians have mostly acted like spoiled children — retreating to their rooms of incompetence and only coming out to collect their allowances. The standoff is costing taxpayers millions of dollars per day, with some states feeling the effects more than others.

In order to gauge which parts of the nation are taking the biggest financial hits from the shutdown, WalletHub conducted a study by using several key data sources, including federal workers and contract dollars per capita, small business lending per capita, social security payments per capita, and number of veterans per capita. Interestingly, the report finds that states won by the Republican Party in the 2012 presidential election could feel the most pain with a prolonged government shutdown, as 15 Red States ranked in the top 25.

""There will be plenty of angry constituents for politicians to answer to,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub and CardHub CEO. ""Let's just hope they get the message before we set the economic recovery back too far or allow partisan politics to ruin America's good name with investors worldwide."" Here's a look at the top 10 states or regions affected by the government shutdown, or areas that will be affected in the case of a prolonged shutdown, according to WalletHub.

10. Hawaii

Hawaii is the tenth most affected state. It ranks number one in the real estate category due to the large role housing plays in the local economy. Staffing shortages at the Federal Housing Administration and the inability of lenders to verify income via tax returns could deliver a blow to loan closings during the government shutdown period.

9. Idaho

Idaho is the ninth most affected state. It also ranks ninth for the state with the most federal contracting dollars per capita, and eighth for Small Business Administration loans. During the furlough period, non-excepted employees at the SBA will no longer be permitted to utilize SBA email or other federal resources — delaying the loan process.

8. Colorado

Colorado is the eighth most affected state. It has heavy exposure to federal contracting dollars and Small Business Administration loans.

7. New Mexico

New Mexico is the seventh most affected state. It ranks sixth in states with the most federal employees per capita, and fourth in states with the most federal contractors.

6. Maryland

Maryland is the sixth most affected state. It has the second highest amount of federal employees per capita, and the fourth most federal contract dollars per capita. Furthermore, Maryland is the third state most heavily exposed to the real estate market.

5. Maine

Maine is the fifth most affected state. It has heavy exposure to SBA loans, social security funding, and real estate. Maine is also the fifth state with the most veterans per capita.

4. District of Columbia

The capital of the United States is not a state, but still worth mentioning since it's at the epicenter of the political temper tantrum. It ranks fourth overall, and is the most affected area of the nation when it comes to federal employees per capita.

3. Alabama

Alabama is the third most affected state. It ranks fourth in states with the most Social Security funding, and eight for the most FAFSA applications per capita. While the shutdown hasn't affected social security payments, benefits could be interrupted if the shutdown drama bleeds into the debt ceiling debacle and Congress fails to raise the debt limit.

2. Alaska

Alaska is the second most affected state. It ranks third in states with the most federal employees per capita and federal contracting dollars per capita. It's also the fourth most affected state by disruption of SBA loans, and contains the most veterans per capita of any state. Veteran Affairs estimates that 3.8 million veterans will not receive their disability payments next month if the government shutdown extends into late October.

1. Virginia

Virginia is considered to be the state most affected by the government shutdown. It has heavy exposure to federal employees and federal contracting dollars. Virginia also has the second most veterans per capita."

Detroit Free Press

The city%27s unemployment rate has nearly tripled since 2000

Roughly 78%2C000 city structures have been abandoned

Bankruptcy filing more than 100%2C000 creditors%2C more than %241B in estimated liabilities

DETROIT — Detroit, the once-thriving Midwest metropolis that gave birth to the nation's auto industry, is now the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy.

Kevyn Orr, the city's appointed emergency manager, formally sought federal bankruptcy court protection on Thursday after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, approved the filing, deeming the decision necessary ""as a last resort to return this great city to financial and civic health for its residents and taxpayers.""

""I know many will see this as a low point in the city's history,"" Snyder wrote in a letter authorizing the bankruptcy filing. ""If so, I think it will also be the foundation of the city's future — a statement I cannot make in confidence absent giving the city a chance for a fresh start, without burdens of debt it cannot hope to fully pay.""

In the letter, Snyder explained his decision by citing statistics that have hobbled the city's operations:

• The city's unemployment rate has nearly tripled since 2000 and is more than double the national average.

• The homicide rate is at historically high levels, and the city has been named among America's most dangerous for more than 20 years.

• Detroiters wait an average of 58 minutes for police to respond, compared with the national average of 11 minutes.

• An estimated 40% of the city's street lights didn't work in the first quarter of 2013.

• Roughly 78,000 city structures have been abandoned.

The combination of lost auto industry jobs and rising crime rates prompted many middle-class whites and African Americans to flee Detroit over the past few decades. That exodus left behind an overwhelmingly poor and nearly 83% African-American population, making Detroit the nation's largest black-majority city.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing represents perhaps the biggest body blow yet to a faded city that's now home to barely 700,000 — down from a peak of 1.8 million during the auto industry boom years of the 1950s — and struggles to cope with the abandoned buildings and decaying municipal services.

The filing listed more than 100,000 creditors and more than $1 billion in estimated liabilities, but Orr has said Detroit's total financial responsibilities could be as high as $20 billion.

Because of the stakes involved, and the impact on residents statewide, as well as 30,000 current and retired city workers and Detroit's ability to stay in business, the case could be precedent setting in the federal judiciary. It could also set an important trajectory for the way troubled cities deal with shrinking populations, dwindling tax bases and large debts from municipal pension systems and government services.

""I think you're looking at a very long and protracted bankruptcy,"" said Brad Coulter, a managing director at O'Keefe LLC, a turnaround consultancy in the Detroit area. ""The fight that's taking place in Detroit is the fight that's going to take place around the country as other struggling cities and municipalities come to grips with major financial issues.""

The bankruptcy isn't likely to spur many similar filings by other U.S. cities because state and local laws in most cases don't allow localities to turn to the federal court system for protection, said Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Cleveland defaulted on its debt during the 1970s but didn't go bankrupt. New York City teetered at bankruptcy's edge in 1975 after President Gerald Ford rejected its emergency aid request in a famous ""Drop Dead"" speech, but a last-minute bailout arrived via a $150 million investment in municipal securities from the city teacher union's pension fund.

In April, Stockton became California's fourth city to seek bankruptcy protection since the national recession's start five years ago. There have been 36 municipal bankruptcy filings since January 2010, according to Governing Magazine. Two proceedings, in Harrisburg, Pa., and Boise County, Idaho, were dismissed.

Orr, a turnaround specialist, spent recent months in tense, but unsuccessful negotiations attempting to get Detroit's creditors to settle for a fraction of what they're owed and persuade municipal unions to accept cuts in benefits.

The city's two pension funds, which collectively have claims to $9.2 billion in unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities, filed state lawsuits this week in a bid to prevent Orr from slashing retiree benefits as part of a bankruptcy restructuring.

Ambac Assurance Guaranty, which insures some of Detroit's general obligation bonds, has also objected to Orr's plan to treat those bonds as ""unsecured,"" which would mean they're not tied directly to a dedicated city revenue stream and would be worth pennies on the dollar in value. Ambac and other city creditors have threatened to sue.

The filing starts a 30- to 90-day period that will determine whether the city is eligible for federal Chapter 9 protection and define how many claimants might compete for Detroit's dwindling settlement resources.

Coulter said city unions and other creditors are likely to argue that Detroit in fact is not insolvent and could pay its bills if forced to sell city resources and further cut services to raise money.

""A lot of issues like this have never been tried before in bankruptcy court,"" Coulter said.

The Detroit that ultimately emerges from bankruptcy ""is going to emerge a very different city than when it went in,"" said Pagano. ""It's going to have to have a tough conversation and decision about what are the core critical services the city has to provide, and at what level.""

""About half"" of the 19 Fed ""participants"" expect the economy will improve enough to warrant an end to QE3 later this year.

But only 12 Fed officials get to vote on monetary policy at each meeting, and of those key ""members,"" ""many"" said they need to see further improvement in the job market before they'd be willing to start gradually winding down the stimulus program.

""Many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.""

Related: Fed officials in damage control mode

Investors welcomed that news and stocks rose shortly after the minutes were released.

In Fed-speak, ""participants"" refer to the 19 people who debate monetary policy at the central bank's meetings, but the word ""members"" refers to the 12 voters, who actually set policy. That distinction was key in how investors interpreted the minutes Wednesday.

At a press conference last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke laid out a scenario in which the Fed would start cutting its monthly asset purchases gradually this year, but not end them until mid-2014, as long as the economy improves and the unemployment rate falls to around 7%.

That announcement initially sent stocks plunging and interest rates climbing, until Bernanke's colleagues took to the speaking circuit in full force, to calm investors' nerves.

The Fed's controversial stimulus program includes buying $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month, in an effort to lower long-term interest rates. It marks the third round of so-called quantitative easing, which is why it's nicknamed QE3.

The Fed has also been holding short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and has plainly stated that, regardless of what happens with QE3, it plans to keep short-term rates near historic lows until 2015."
http://news.yahoo.com/house-gop-unveils-bill-counter-senate-debt-plan-142903804--finance.html,,[],House GOP unveils bill to counter Senate debt plan,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House GOP leaders Tuesday pitched a plan to fellow Republicans to counter an emerging Senate deal to reopen the government and forestall an economy-rattling default on U.S. obligations. But they stopped short of promising a vote later in the day after the plan got mixed reviews from the rank and file.

Top Republicans unveiled a plan that would suspend a new tax on medical devices for two years and take away the federal government's contributions to lawmakers' health care and top administration officials, in addition to funding the government through Jan. 15 and giving Treasury the ability to borrow normally through Feb. 7.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he's ""trying to find a path forward"" but that ""there have been no decisions about exactly what we will do."" He told a news conference ""there are a lot of opinions about what direction to go.""

The move came as a partial shutdown entered its third week and less than two days before the Treasury Department says it will be unable to borrow and will rely on a this cash cushion to pay the country's bills.

The House GOP plan wouldn't win nearly as many concessions from President Barack Obama as Republicans had sought but it would set up another battle with the White House early next year.

""The jury is still out,"" said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas.

Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., said he was not sure he could vote for the plan because it did not address the debt. ""I have to know a lot more than I know now,"" he said.

The House move comes after conservative lawmakers rebelled at the outlines of an emerging Senate plan by Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Those two hoped to seal an agreement on Tuesday, just two days before the Treasury Department says it will run out of borrowing capacity.

The White House and Democrats quickly came out against the Republican plan. Obama planned to meet with House Democratic leaders Tuesday afternoon as negotiations continue.

Story continues

""The latest proposal from House Republicans does just that in a partisan attempt to appease a small group of tea party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have been working in a bipartisan, good-faith effort .... With only a couple days remaining until the United States exhausts its borrowing authority, it's time for the House to do the same.""

""GOP's latest plan is designed to torpedo the bipartisan Sen solution,"" tweeted Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""Plan is not only reckless, it's tantamount to default.""

Political pressure is building on Republicans to reopen the government and GOP leaders are clearly fearful of failing to act to avert a default on U.S. obligations.

Republicans are in a difficult spot, relinquishing many of their core demands as they take a beating in the polls. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., led GOP lawmakers in several verses of ""Amazing Grace.""

""We have to stick together now,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.

Like the House GOP bill, the emerging Senate measure — though not finalized — would reopen the government through Jan. 15 and permit the Treasury to borrow normally until early to mid-February, easing dual crises that have sapped confidence in the economy and taken a sledgehammer to the GOP's poll numbers.

""There are productive negotiations going on with the Republican leader,"" Reid said as he opened the Senate Tuesday. ""I'm confident we'll be able to reach a comprehensive agreement this week in time to avert a catastrophic default.""

On Wall Street, stocks were mixed early Tuesday, with investors somewhat optimistic over a potential deal.

""We're willing to get the government open. We want to get the government open,"" Scalise said. ""Hopefully they get something done that addresses the spending issue.""

The competing House and Senate plans are a far cry from the assault on ""Obamacare"" that tea party Republicans originally demanded as a condition for a short-term funding bill to keep the government fully operational. It lacks the budget cuts demanded by Republicans in exchange for increasing the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap.

Nor do either the House or Senate frameworks contain any of a secondary set of House GOP demands, like a one-year delay in the health law's mandate that individuals buy insurance.

Another difference between the Democrats and Republicans involves a Democratic move to repeal a $63 fee that companies must pay for each person they cover under the big health care overhaul beginning in 2014. Unions oppose the fee and Senate Democrats are pressing to repeal it, but House Republicans are positioning to block them and Senate Republicans are adamantly opposed as well.

Democrats were standing against a GOP-backed proposal to suspend a medical device tax that was enacted as part of the health care law, but might not be able to win a floor vote since many Democrats oppose the tax too.

Democratic and Republican aides described the outlines of the potential agreement on condition of anonymity because the discussions were ongoing.

But with GOP poll numbers plummeting and the country growing weary of a shutdown entering its third week, Senate Republicans in particular were eager to end the shutdown — and avoid an even greater crisis if the government were to default later this month.

Any legislation backed by both Reid and McConnell can be expected to sail through the Senate, though any individual senators could delay it.

But it's another story in the House. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, signaled that conservative members of the House were deeply skeptical. He said any bill had to have serious spending cuts for him to vote to raise the debt ceiling and said he thought Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had more flexibility than they had said publicly.

""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Barton said.

Asked whether the emerging package contained any victories for Republicans, Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., a member of the House GOP leadership, said, ""Not that I've seen so far, no.""

In addition to approving legislation to fund the government until late this year and avert a possible debt crisis later this week or month, the potential pact would set up broader budget negotiations between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. One goal of those talks would be to ease automatic spending cuts that began in March and could deepen in January, when about $20 billion in further cuts are set to slam the Pentagon.

Democrats also were seeking to preserve the Treasury Department's ability to use extraordinary accounting measures to buy additional time after the government reaches any extended debt ceiling. Such measures have permitted Treasury to avert a default for almost five months since the government officially hit the debt limit in mid-May, but wouldn't buy anywhere near that kind of time next year, experts said.

The House GOP plan would repeal the extraordinary measures, which would make the Feb 7 date a hard deadline to revisit the fight.

Economists were expecting a gain of 180,000 jobs in July, according to a survey by CNNMoney. And the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.6% in June, fell more than expected.

U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors digested the news, including revisions to data from prior months.

The response in the bond market was more pronounced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank from about 2.74% before the report to 2.61%.

The Federal Reserve has said that improvement in the job market could be a trigger for the central bank to begin removing the liquidity it has been pumping into the market.

But the latest job data may have caused investors to reconsider the assumption that the Fed will begin tapering its bond buying program as soon as September.

The U.S. dollar was also under pressure following the jobs data. The greenback was down 0.7% versus the U.K. pound and 0.4% versus the euro.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/17/news/economy/federal-worker-furloughs/,2013-02-17 00:00:00,['Jennifer Liberto'],Nearly 2 million federal workers could be subject to furloughs,"Federal workers could start facing furloughs as early as April, according to federal agencies trying to prepare for the worst.

Unless Congress steps in, some $85 billion in massive spending reductions will hit the federal government, doling out furloughs to much of the nation's 2.1 million federal workforce, experts say.

The cuts coming as a part of the forced spending cuts that will carve out some 9% from non-defense programs and 13% from defense programs. They're part of a larger effort to trim $1.2 trillion from federal deficits over 10 years.

Daniel Werfel, a controller for the Office of Management and Budget, told a Senate panel Thursday that furloughs won't happen until after agencies negotiate with unions, and that's not expected to be finished until after March 1.

After union bargaining, the agencies still need to give employees their official 30 days notice of impending furloughs, realistically pushing most furloughs off until April. However, some non-union employees could face furloughs in March.

Unions usually have the final say on how the furloughs will be implemented, said Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). She said they get to bargain with federal agencies on issues such as how the furloughed days will be spread out.

The unions will also work with agencies to ensure that things such as performance reviews don't reflect work left incomplete due to furloughs.

""We believe that one furlough day is one too many for employees,"" said Kelley, whose group is among those pushing Congress to come up with an alternative to federal budget cuts.

Neither NTEU nor National Federation of Federal Employees have been approached to officially begin the bargaining process over furloughs, both confirmed.

Related: How Washington politics threatens my job

At Thursday's hearing, Werfel said agencies might not be able to avoid furloughs that would reduce essential services. At the Agriculture Department, for example, it's not possible to avoid furloughs that would result in fewer food inspections, because most of the agency's expenses are the salaries and benefits of people who perform those tasks.

""So it becomes a math issue, ultimately,"" he said. ""This is one of the very tangible and clear and significant impacts of sequester: This division within USDA will not be able to make its core mission of sending the inspectors to these locations.""

The exact number of total furloughs planned is still unavailable, since agencies are still deciding how to spread the cuts. It's possible some agencies may yet be able to spare some employees from furloughs or at least minimize days of unpaid leave.

Generally, workers would keep benefits such as health insurance, according to recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management. But some workers may have to give up more from their paychecks when they return to work after a furlough, if their salary for the pay period wasn't enough to cover health insurance premiums.

The sequester -- a series of blunt, automatic funding cuts across much of the federal budget set to begin March 1 -- was never supposed to go into effect. Instead, the threat that it might was supposed to spur lawmakers to find a smarter way to reduce deficits over the next decade.

The only group that could escape furloughs are some 1,500 presidential appointees, including Cabinet positions, deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries. That's because those jobs are considered 24-hour-a-day positions, said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that advocates for a more efficient federal workforce.

Most of those workers are at the top of the federal pay scale, Stier said.

""It's just craziness,"" he said. ""You're telling the vast bulk of federal employees 'Guess what, you don't know how much money you're going to make.' And in all likelihood, these hard-working people will have to do the same amount of work."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/what-is-the-sequester_n_2783917.html,2013-03-01 00:00:00,"['Associate Editor', 'Huffpost Travel']",What Is The Sequester?,"The sequester is what everyone, at least in Washington, seems to be talking about. But what is sequestration exactly?

Set to begin March 1 at 11:59 p.m., the sequester is a set of automatic spending cuts put into law by the Budget Control Act. Signed by President Barack Obama in August 2011, that legislation raised the debt ceiling and sought to apply pressure on Congress to come up with a longer term plan for deficit reduction.

The $1.2 trillion in budget cuts would be spread over nine years and are equally divided between domestic and defense-related spending. During the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, $85 billion worth of cuts are set to go into effect. The budget cuts would end in 2021.

Why is the sequester happening?

When the debt limit was raised in 2011, Republicans demanded that budget cuts be included in the legislation. The Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- or the ""super committee"" put in charge of figuring out how to implement the cuts called for in the Budget Control Act -- ultimately proved unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on cutting $1.2 trillion from the deficit. With the threat of automatic sequestration still looming, Congress was tasked with finding those cuts. No luck so far. So, while sequestration was never intended to actually go into effect, it now most likely will.

What funding will the sequester affect?

The sequester will affect government spending across the board. The military will see $550 billion in cuts, drawing funds away from national security and military operations. On the domestic side, cuts will affect health care, education, law enforcement, disaster relief, unemployment benefits, non-profit organization funds, scientific research and more.

Will any funding not be affected?

The sequester stipulates certain areas of government spending that will see no cuts. No money will be drawn from spending on wars and military personnel. Funding allocated for Medicaid, Social Security, Pell grants, veterans' benefits and some low-income programs will not be affected, either.

Have lawmakers tried to stop the sequester?

Both Democrats and Republicans are trying to figure out how to stop the sequester from going into effect, but the two parties can't agree on a plan. Senate Democrats introduced a plan titled the American Family Economic Protection Act, which identified $120 billion in savings that would replace sequester cuts until the end of December 2013. Republicans weren't in agreement on their own solution, but eventually came forward with a counterproposal that would have kept the sequester in place, but given Obama control in implementing the cuts. Both plans were ultimately voted down.

Sen. Patty Murray presented herself in that ordinary way when she first ran as a Democrat to represent Washington state, and skeptics questioned her political savvy — and footwear. In the two decades since that long-shot campaign, the petite, no-nonsense lawmaker has quietly ascended to the top levels of Senate power.

As chairwoman of the Budget Committee, Murray negotiated a breakthrough $85-billion accord in one-on-one talks with Rep. Paul D. Ryan, the former GOP vice presidential contender from Wisconsin who is known for his austere approach to the federal budget.

FOR THE RECORD:

Patty Murray: In the Dec. 15 Section A, an article profiling Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and her leading role in negotiating a budget accord in Congress said that she had previously led the Senate’s Democratic majority to approve the chamber’s first budget without dissenting votes in four years. Four Democrats voted no. —



The deal she and Ryan sealed with a private handshake — after President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and others all failed — adds a significant achievement to what has become a formidable political career. The House resoundingly approved it Thursday, and the Senate is expected to pass it in the coming week, greatly reducing the risk of a federal government shutdown next year.

Her role also provides a reminder of the growing clout of women in the Senate, who numbered three when she first ran for office. There are now 20. Murray is the first woman to head the Senate Budget Committee, and almost half of the chamber’s committee chairmen are, in fact, now women.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

“She is now 9 feet tall, not 5 feet tall,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who is inclined to support the package. “She never lost her cool through all of it — pretty amazing.”

Murray’s success in crafting the budget deal was not without early stumbles.

She was tapped by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) two years ago to head a “supercommittee” of senators and representatives to forge a budget accord, but her team was unable to do so. Republicans refused to raise taxes; Democrats resisted cuts to safety net programs.

Drawing on those lessons, Murray, a determined politician, pushed on. She earned the trust of skeptical Democrats who were wary of dealing with the new class of tea party Republicans. Her history of taking jobs no one wanted helped. She headed her party’s Senate campaign committee in 2012, when Reid couldn’t find anyone else to do the work, and Democrats bolstered their majority against long odds.

This year, Murray corralled the Senate’s Democratic majority to approve the chamber’s first budget in four years without dissenting votes, setting the stage for her deal with Ryan.

Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), the dean among the Senate’s women, has watched what she called Murray’s “unique negotiating style” of sticking to her goals but building consensus among her peers.

“She carried the football from one first down after another to get it across the goal,” Mikulski said.

Murray and Ryan met for breakfast with other budget committee lawmakers in the Capitol the morning after the government reopened in October following the 16-day shutdown.

Over pastries and coffee, the two agreed not to seek the kind of far-reaching deal that had eluded Obama and Boehner. Instead, they would focus on reversing some automatic cuts under the so-called sequester. GOP defense hawks wanted to preserve Pentagon spending and Democratic champions of social programs sought to protect them.

For seven weeks, Murray and Ryan tangled, almost always amicably. They made an early bond, largely by building trust. In initial meetings they agreed not to publicly air what they were negotiating behind closed doors, as often happens in politics, where information has a currency of its own and can undermine deal-making.

They also put their most partisan views aside and focused on reaching a pragmatic solution.

Late last Tuesday, Ryan and Murray met one final time in her private office off the Capitol Rotunda. There, they shook hands and sealed the deal. Moments later, the two stood side by side to announce the accord.

“He and I do have some major differences,” Murray said. “We cheer for a different football team, clearly. We catch different fish. We have some differences on policies. But we agree that our country needs some certainty.”

Ryan, towering over Murray, said, “She’s a tough and honest negotiator.”

Reid said later that they were an “unconventional pair.”

“I have such faith in her integrity, her temperament, her wisdom and her ability to get things done,” he said.

Murray never appears too far removed from that mom who bundled her kids in the car and drove to Washington’s statehouse two decades ago to protest a reduction in funds that would close their preschool.

“I thought if I just explained to them how important this was — and told them about all the kids it helped — they would certainly change their minds,” she recalled in a speech years ago.

“But when I got there, the legislators told me there was nothing someone like me could do to save our preschool program — that I was just a mom in tennis shoes. Well, I heard what they had to say, but I didn’t listen.”

In Seattle, political observers are not surprised by her accomplishment.

“In the old show-horse-and-workhorse model, she’s been a workhorse,” said Stuart Elway, a pollster in Seattle, who said that even after Murray won that first election, “a lot of people were underestimating her: ‘This isn’t going to last.’ Here we are and she’s one of the leaders in the Senate.”

Some Democrats see Murray as a possible heir to the majority leader spot after Reid retires. But that’s the kind of conversation she shuns. A lawmaker who wears sensible suits and shoes and favors a low-maintenance pageboy haircut, she isn’t prone to such airy chatter.

After the House approved the deal late Thursday, Murray was on a plane back to her home state — the 2,300-plus-mile trip she makes most weekends.

""To even entertain the idea of the United States of America not paying our bills is irresponsible. It's absurd,"" Obama said in a press conference.

The president also responded directly to Republicans who continue to argue that increasing the nation's borrowing limit only contributes to Washington's spending problem. He repeatedly emphasized that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize any new spending but simply allows the government to continue to pay for obligations to which Congress has already agreed.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Saturday said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in ""financial disaster,"" but reiterated demands that the president agree to spending cuts before a vote.

On Monday, Obama maintained that increasing the debt limit would not represent a concession by Republicans to Democrats, and said he simply would not give in to any demands in exchange for an extension.

""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy,"" Obama said. ""The full faith and credit of the United States economy is not a bargaining chip. And they better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our AAA credit rating was down for the first time in our history.""

The president highlighted some of the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling: a delay in Social Security checks and veterans' benefits and the inability to pay U.S. troops or honor contracts for small business owners, air traffic controllers and food inspectors. If the country failed to meet these obligations, Obama argued, investors around the world would question the credibility of the United States.

""We are not a deadbeat nation,"" Obama said. ""So there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.""

Republican leaders responded immediately to the president's press conference, signaling they will not relent on demands for spending cuts as part of debt ceiling talks.

""The President and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a statement. ""I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the President with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.""

Boehner issued a similar statement, calling on Obama to reduce government spending.

""The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same,"" Boehner said.

Last week, Senate Democratic leaders urged Obama to bypass Congress on raising the debt ceiling in the event of political gridlock. But the White House has been reluctant to consider a unilateral action, maintaining that the 14th Amendment -- one such proposed option -- does not give the president the authority to ignore the debt ceiling."

He Joined The Washington Post In']","Pentagon to recall most furloughed workers, Hagel says","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel speaks during an April briefing on the Defense Department's FY 2014 budget at the Pentagon. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

The Pentagon will recall almost all of its 350,000 furloughed civilian workers in the coming days, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Saturday, in a move that could substantially ease the impact of the government shutdown on the federal workforce.

Hagel’s decision is based on a liberal interpretation of a bill passed by Congress last week and signed by President Obama that ensures uniformed members of the military will not have their paychecks delayed by the shutdown. The law, titled the Pay Our Military Act, includes broad language exempting Defense Department civilians from furlough if they provide direct support to the military.

Robert F. Hale, the Pentagon comptroller, estimated that more than 90 percent of about 350,000 furloughed Defense Department employees would return to work, many of them as soon as Monday. “We hope to move very quickly,” Hale told reporters.

The Defense Department directly employs about 750,000 civilians. Pentagon officials had previously said about 400,000 of them had been furloughed because of the government shutdown. Hale revised that number Saturday, saying that 350,000 was a more accurate figure.

He said he could not precisely say how many people would be able to return to work because officials were still determining which employees qualified under the new law. He said he hoped that “no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough,” and maybe even fewer than that.

“Although we’re very happy we’re getting most of our people back,” Hale added, “we haven’t solved all the problems.”

Regardless, the Pentagon announcement will dramatically scale back the government shutdown. Defense Department civilian employees had represented nearly half of the estimated 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed for the past week.

After consulting with Pentagon lawyers and other Obama administration officials in recent days, Hagel decided that he could justify recalling almost of the Pentagon’s furloughed workforce based on provisions in the Pay Our Military Act.

In a statement, Hagel said the Justice Department advised that the law would not permit a blanket recall of all civilians working for the Pentagon. But he added that attorneys for the Justice and Defense departments agreed that the law does permit the Pentagon to eliminate furloughs “for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.”

Hagel said he has directed the armed services and defense agencies to determine exactly how many employees can come back to work. Workers, he said, can expect to hear from their managers starting this weekend whether they can return to their jobs.

“I expect us to significantly reduce – but not eliminate – civilian furloughs under this process,” he said. “We will continue to try to bring all civilian employees back to work as soon as possible. Ultimately, the surest way to end these damaging and irresponsible furloughs, and to enable us to fulfill our mission as a Department, is for Congress to pass a budget and restore funds for the entire federal government.”

Paradoxically, however, the Pentagon’s announcement could actually relieve political pressure on lawmakers to end the shutdown by cancelling furloughs for at least 300,000 federal employees.

Moreover, Hagel’s decision could bring some relief to thousands of private contractors who work for the Defense Department but had faced the threat of layoffs because of the government shutdown. On Friday, for example, Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin said it would furlough about 3,000 employees next week and expects that number to grow if the budget standoff doesn’t end soon.

“I am very pleased to see so many of our national security workforce will be able to return to work,” Rep. Howard P. McKeon (R-Calif.), Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Congress gave the Executive Branch broad authority to keep our Armed Forces and dedicated defense civilians working throughout the government shutdown. Though I do not believe the law required these hundreds of thousands of workers to be furloughed in the first place, it is welcome news.”

In a memo, Hagel noted that the Pay Our Military Act appropriates funds “as are necessary to provide pay and allowances to contractors” working for the Pentagon. He said that government lawyers are still “analyzing what authority is provided by this provision.”

Hagel’s memo offers some general guidance for which furloughed Defense Department employees can expect to return to work.

Those who will likely receive a green light include people who provide health care to troops and their families; buy, repair or maintain weapons systems; work at commissaries or acquire other supplies for the military.

Those who might not be covered include auditors, employees who work in public affairs or legislative affairs, or civilian employees of the Army Corps of Engineers, according to the memo.

The Pentagon’s announcement will affect a vast global workforce. Hale said that 86 percent of the department’s civilian employees work outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

http://news.yahoo.com/rising-tax-revenue-eases-pressure-budget-cuts-181420241.html,,[],Rising tax revenue eases pressure for budget cuts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rising tax receipts are shrinking the federal deficit, and that will shape the budget debate when Congress returns from vacation next month. The big question for lawmakers: Should they renew, end or modify the tens of billions of dollars in ""sequester"" cuts in government spending that took effect earlier this year?

Tax revenue through June was up 14 percent from a year earlier, and that trend is expected to continue. New figures for July are due out next week, and for August on Sept. 12. That's just three days after lawmakers return to face threats by some conservatives of a government shutdown on Oct. 1 or an economy-threatening default on the national debt weeks later.

With revenue rising, what's the fight about?

Now that the government is taking in more money, Republicans in Congress are more opposed than ever to tax increases sought by President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies.

""This year the federal government will bring more revenue in than in any year in our history,"" says House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. ""We have a spending problem in Washington. It has to be addressed.""

But Obama and the Democrats want to do away with some of the existing spending cuts, and they say they won't accept significant further reductions — unless there's also action to bring in still more revenue.

""Democrats know we must do more to reduce the deficit,"" says Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""We believe in a balanced approach that pairs spending cuts with having those that can afford it pay more.""

At the same time, some economists worry that currently rising revenue numbers will reduce the pressure to address the nation's long-term debt problems.

""I don't think political leaders feel that they have a gun to their head the way they did a couple years ago,"" said William Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush and now co-director of the Tax Policy Center. ""There's a desire on some sides to declare 'mission accomplished' and ignore the long-term deficits and move on to other issues.""

Story continues

Several factors are contributing to the increase in revenue. Congress increased income tax rates on high-income families in January. The Congressional Budget Office says some of those taxpayers probably cashed in investments ahead of the tax hike, boosting capital gains taxes. Congress also let a temporary payroll tax cut expire at the end of 2012, increasing Social Security taxes.

CBO also said a rise in personal income is adding to tax revenue, even though economic growth has been sluggish.

To see how important the economy is to federal tax receipts, look at what happened in 2009, after the nation plunged into the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Income tax receipts dropped by 20 percent from the year before, and corporate tax receipts dropped by 55 percent. Social Security tax receipts dropped for the first time since 1946.

The budget deficit, which topped $1 trillion for four straight years, is projected to fall to $642 billion in the budget year that ends in September, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The spending cuts enacted over the past several years are combining with higher tax receipts to reduce government borrowing.

Under current law, the budget office projects that the federal deficit will shrink even further in the next several years before starting to grow again at the end of the decade. But with the national debt approaching $17 trillion, the long-term financial problems aren't exactly solved, Gale said.

""It's kind of like somebody carrying an extra 15 pounds around their waist,"" he said. ""Over the long term it kind of hurts your health, wears you out, reduces your mobility.""

Congress is headed toward two potential budget showdowns this fall, one when funding for the government runs out at the end of September and another when the U.S. reaches the limit of its borrowing authority later in the fall.

Republicans are demanding spending cuts in exchange for a debt limit increase, which will be needed to prevent an unprecedented default on U.S. obligations. But Obama says he won't negotiate over raising the debt limit.

That debate could provide an opportunity to address the nation's long-term finances. But there doesn't seem to be much appetite in Washington for the kind of ""grand bargain"" deficit reduction package that Obama and Boehner tried to negotiate in 2011. That package would have cut spending and increased revenues, but Obama and Boehner were never able to agree on the details.

If not a grand bargain, a ""somewhat"" bargain evolved over the following 17 months.

Republicans willing to trigger a default on the government's debt forced Democrats and Obama in August 2011 to agree to cutting government spending by $2.1 trillion over the following decade, including $1.2 trillion in the automatic spending cuts — taken equally from military and domestic programs — that began in earnest this March.

Democrats and some moderate Republicans now want to undo those automatic cuts. Most Republicans want to keep them but switch more of the reductions from defense to domestic programs.

Then this past January, two months after his re-election, Obama finally won a tax increase, nearly $620 billion over 10 years, most of it from people with annual incomes above $400,000.

With this year's projected deficit less than half what it was from 2009 through 2011, economist Gale questions whether there's an overwhelming will to do more on either the tax or spending side of the ledger.

""I think people are kind of like, well, it's not as bad as it was in 2009, so there's kind of a fatigue in dealing with debt stuff,"" Gale said.

USA TODAY

Obama tells veterans he is working to reduce backlog of VA claims

The backlog is down%2C but not as much as he would like%2C Obama says

President spoke to a convention of disabled veterans

Calling it his ""mission"" to help veterans ""recover from the wounds of war,"" President Obama said Saturday his team is working to reduce the backlog of compensation claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

""I'm going to be honest with you, it has not moved as fast as I wanted,"" Obama told a convention of disabled veterans in Orlando. ""We are not where we need to be, but we are making progress.""

The president also outlined plans to spend more than $100 million on new research into mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder and what he called ""this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops.""

Obama also said he is enlisting colleges to help train veterans for ""the high-skilled jobs of tomorrow.""

Speaking to some 3,400 people at the Disabled American Veterans' convention, Obama praised the ""9/11 generation"" of warriors who have fought wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and again pledged to help them transition back to civilian life.

One major complaint from veterans has been the backlog of claims for compensation from the VA.

As the president noted in his speech, the number of claims has increased in recent years, in part because the Obama administration offered benefits to veterans suffering from PTSD as well as Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the jungle defoliant Agent Orange.

According to the White House, the VA backlog — which includes claims that have been in the system for 125 days or more — has decreased from 611,000 to about 496,000 in recent months, a 20% reduction.

""After years of military service,"" Obama said, ""you shouldn't have to wait for years for the benefits you've earned.""

The quality of care at VA hospitals has also been criticized.

Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, listed the VA's shortcomings in an op-ed for the Orlando Sentinel, writing that ""in addition to the department's massive disability-benefits backlog, a disturbing pattern of preventable veteran deaths and other patient-safety issues has emerged at VA hospitals around the country.""

Miller added: ""Sadly, the department's widespread and systemic lack of accountability may be encouraging more veteran suffering instead of preventing it.""

Derek Bennett, chief of staff for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said the organization supports Obama's efforts to reduce the VA backlog, which ""poses a financial and emotional roadblock to transitioning from military to civilian life.""

Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., said some veterans in Illinois have to wait more than 500 days to have disability claims processed. ""While I am pleased the president recognizes the seriousness of this issue,"" Kirk said, ""the time to act is long overdue.""

During his speech, Obama listed a series of ""priorities"" for veterans, including sufficient funding, improving the health care system, addressing homelessness among former troops and providing job training for returning service members.

With U.S. involvement in Iraq over and the war in Afghanistan coming to an end, Obama said ""the job of caring for our veterans goes on, and our work caring for our newest veterans has only just begun.""

After the speech, the president and first lady Michelle Obama flew to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., to begin a week-long vacation."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-09/news/ct-met-immigrant-drivers-licenses-20130109_1_illegal-immigrants-federal-immigration-temporary-visitor-driver-s-licenses,2013-01-09 00:00:00,"['Rafael Guerrero', 'Antonio Olivo', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']",Illegal immigrants cleared to hit the roads,"The simple act of driving his 7-year-old daughter to school creates anxiety every morning for Juan Vicente Urbina, who has no driver's license and knows getting behind the wheel could lead to being deported.

""It's scary,"" said Urbina, 29, who has been in the country illegally since 2001 and sees driving as a necessary risk. ""If they stop us and we get arrested, we could lose everything, you know?""

On Tuesday, Urbina was among many who expressed joy and relief upon learning that Illinois is poised to join a handful of states that offer legal driving privileges to those in the country illegally.

After failing by just two votes in 2007, legislation to provide driver's licenses to illegal immigrants passed the Illinois House by a vote of 65-46. Gov. Pat Quinn's office issued a statement shortly afterward saying he plans to sign the bill, which cleared the state Senate in December.

The vote came after a lengthy debate that reflected the passions over illegal immigration nationwide. Supporters had mounted a monthslong campaign citing the dangers of allowing the estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants of legal age in Illinois to drive without passing tests to show they are qualified — and most likely without automobile insurance.

""Whatever your position on immigrant issues, what we can all agree on is there are millions and millions of undocumented people in this country living with us, working for us, driving for us,"" said state Rep. Edward Acevedo, D-Chicago, who sponsored the measure in the House. ""We have failed because some of these individuals cannot be trained to drive the roads of Illinois.""

Opponents voiced concerns that the licenses could lead to fraud and abuse and had said the measure should require fingerprints from applicants. Backers argued that such a requirement would cost too much money and deter people who are fearful of having their fingerprints recorded in a federal database.

""One has to wonder whether people are going to feel comfortable submitting to fingerprinting knowing that their fingerprints could wind up going to federal immigration authorities if all they're applying for is a driving document,"" said Fred Tsao, policy director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which spearheaded support for the measure.

""All this is good for is driving,"" Tsao said. ""It's not even a valid ID.""

Under the legislation, Temporary Visitor Driver's Licenses, already available for foreigners here legally, would also be available for illegal immigrants, Illinois secretary of state spokesman Dave Druker said. Those licenses, renewable every three years, could not be used for other identification purposes, such as boarding a plane, buying a gun or voting, Druker said.

To be eligible for a license, a person would have to live in Illinois for at least a year, a provision that would require applicants to provide a copy of a lease, utility bills or other proof that they've been in the state.

While cast primarily as a safety issue, the bill's passage quickly took on the political overtones of broader efforts to pass federal immigration reforms in Congress, with advocacy groups on both sides of that debate either celebrating or sounding warning bells.

Within an hour, the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform sent out an email alert that urged constituents nationwide to phone Quinn's office immediately with a list of reasons that it should not be signed into law.

""It all relies on less-than-reliable documentation to establish who they (license applicants) are,"" said FAIR spokesman Ira Mehlman, listing among his agency's concerns a potential for would-be terrorists to get an Illinois license.

""The state of Illinois should not be in the business to make it easier for people to violate federal immigration law,"" Mehlman said.

At an early evening rally in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood attended by about 100 people, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the bill's passage should advance the argument for comprehensive federal immigration reform.

""We have been clear in setting a national pattern,"" said Emanuel, who reflected on his grandfather's passage to Chicago from Eastern Europe. ""This will be noticed around the country.

""This is a great accomplishment to allow people on a very practical basis to take their kids to school, places of worship and get themselves to work,"" the mayor said. ""I want to take this victory, savor what it is and use it as the energy to move and bring comprehensive immigration reform.""

Yuridia Diaz, 29, originally from Mexico, stopped driving three years ago when she was pulled over by police. Fearing deportation, she chooses to take an hourlong bus ride to work instead.

With legal driving imminent, she said ""a weight has been lifted off"" her shoulders.

""Now my dreams are growing,"" said Diaz, who lives in Little Village.

Ashley Moy-Wooten, an organizer at the Southwest Organizing Project, an immigrant advocacy group, said scores of people have phoned her office inquiring about the licenses after the measure cleared the Senate last month.

Martha Estrella, 47, of west suburban Stone Park, is among those eager to apply for a driver's license. About six months ago, she was arrested for driving without one after she got into an accident with, of all vehicles, a police squad car, Estrella said.

Though the infraction only resulted in a fine, it scared Estrella enough to swear off driving until it's legal, she said.

""I've lost a lot of jobs (as a temporary factory worker) because I can't drive,"" said Estrella, who has been in the country illegally for more than 20 years.

Before the accident, ""I had 23 years driving and never had I been arrested,"" including a few years in Washington state, where a state law there allowed her to drive legally.

Now, she said, ""I'm going to start looking for a car.""

http://news.yahoo.com/why-harry-reid-sidelined-joe-biden-185717368--politics.html,,[],Why Harry Reid Was Sidelined for Joe Biden,"The critical conversation between the offices of Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell came early Sunday afternoon, about 36 hours before Congress was set to teeter over the fiscal cliff.

Reid, the majority leader, had been negotiating and trading ideas with McConnell, his minority counterpart, since Friday evening. But the soft-spoken Nevada Democrat drew a bold line in the sand midday Sunday: He had no more counteroffers to give.

Suddenly and irreversibly, the talks veered into a new direction. Within minutes, the Kentucky Republican was dialing up Vice President Joe Biden, elevating his old colleague to the Democrats' new negotiator-in-chief. It was the fateful decision that put the Senate and White House on the pathway to the deal eventually approved by the Senate and the House, ending weeks of drama over the fiscal cliff. It also left Reid standing on the sideline stewing.

“We know that when McConnell has hit a wall with Reid, he calls Joe Biden to get some more candy,” said a senior Senate Democratic aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the vice president.

It was a good-cop, bad-cop routine that Reid wanted no part of. “We thought it was unnecessary,” the aide said of Biden’s involvement. “We had a lot of leverage.”

Reid and McConnell had been bargaining about how to avert the cliff ever since a White House summit on Friday, when they agreed to take charge of negotiating an accord. Talks between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner had collapsed by then. The president and congressional leaders had agreed that a last-minute compromise, if there was to be one, had to be forged in the Senate.

The opening Senate GOP offer from McConnell to Reid came at 9:30 p.m. on Friday night, only hours after the White House meeting, according to congressional officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Reid’s team sent back its first counteroffer at around 3 p.m. on Saturday. A flurry of activity followed as McConnell was cloistered in his office on Capitol Hill. Aides shuttled between the leaders’ offices, as a GOP counterproposal was drafted by 4 p.m. A Democratic reply to that arrived only an hour and a half later, according to the sources. At 7:10 p.m. on Saturday, McConnell said he sent yet another offer to Reid and the Democrats.

Story continues

Then, radio silence.

Reid’s office had suggested that another counteroffer would come in the morning, but the clock ticked to afternoon without one.Instead, Reid’s office told McConnell’s at about 1 p.m. that the majority leader was done with the back and forth.“At this stage, we are not able to make a counteroffer,” Reid announced soon after on the Senate floor.

Reid was playing hardball. With polls showing that the public was far more likely to blame congressional Republicans than the president if the nation jumped off the fiscal cliff – and billions in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts went into effect – Reid rightfully knew that McConnell wanted a deal – and badly.

Reid felt that he’d compromised enough, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide with knowledge of the discussions and the senator’s thinking. Besides, if no accord was reached, Obama and Reid had said they would push the president’s plan to stop tax hikes for those earning below $250,000 and extend unemployment insurance to the floor. Republicans could block that and be responsible for everyone’s taxes spiking at their own peril.

About the same time on Sunday, a story popped about a “major setback” in talks – that McConnell had demanded that a reduction in the Social Security benefits formula, known as “chained CPI,” be included in a deal. True, that had been part of the 7 p.m. Saturday GOP offer. But Reid was now using it as political cover to withdraw from talks. “We are not going to have any Social Security cuts. At this stage, that just doesn't seem appropriate,” the Democratic leader announced later Sunday on the floor.

McConnell’s negotiating options with Reid had narrowed. He could either let Congress veer off the cliff, take Reid’s latest offer, or accept the president’s tax-hike package for those earning more than $250,000. Instead, McConnell sought a familiar and friendlier face across the negotiating table – his old colleague Joe Biden. He called and left a message to open talks with the vice president.

“We have yet to receive a response to our good-faith offer. I am concerned about the lack of urgency here. I think we all know we are running out of time,” McConnell said on Sunday of his talks with Reid. Then he revealed on the floor that he’d called Biden “to see if he could help jump-start the negotiations on his side.”

“I need a dance partner,” McConnell said.

Those words appeared to be a swipe at Reid, echoing Reid’s comments the day after the election when he had said, “It's better to dance than to fight. It's better to work together.” McConnell was saying that Reid wasn’t willing to dance, after all.

In his negotiating two-step, McConnell had found a willing partner in Biden. The call to Biden set off a fresh round of offers, counteroffers, and concessions. They spoke as late as 12:45 a.m. on Monday, retreated for a few hours of sleep, before another call that began before 7 a.m. Within about 24 hours, Biden and McConnell had settled on what amounted to the framework for an agreement – although they never engaged face to face.

At 9:15 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, Biden trekked to the Hill to huddle with Senate Democrats to pitch the compromise he had reached with McConnell. The plan would make permanent the Bush tax cuts for those earning less than $450,000, expand certain tax credits for low-income Americans, set the estate tax at 40 percent, and revise the Alternative Minimum Tax.

Reid didn’t plan to do the heavy lifting of selling the deal that he didn’t cut. That job was left to Biden. “I suspect he’s doing most of the talking,” Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said of the vice president as the meeting was underway.

The final package, which cleared the Senate in the early hours of 2013, also included concessions that Reid had refused, including a delay of the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, for only two months instead of at least a year.

“We gave too much away,” the Senate Democratic aide said of the accord. It passed in an 89-8 landslide, including Reid’s aye vote, anyway.

For Biden, it was a triumphant moment. It was his latest major compromise crafted with McConnell, following the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010 and the debt-limit deal in the summer of 2011. Biden has earned the nickname the “McConnell whisperer” across Washington.

“McConnell is far more comfortable cutting deals with the vice president than he is with Senator Reid,” said Jim Manley, a former top Reid adviser.

Biden is considered a possible 2016 presidential candidate, and the episode amounted to a presidential moment: He was called to swoop in at the last minute to save taxes from rising on nearly all Americans, and he succeeded. “No doubt about it, this could be very helpful to him if he decides to run in 2016,” Manley said.

But just beneath the surface, there is some quiet grumbling among some Senate Democrats and the Left that Biden was as interested in striking a deal as its details.

Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, one of the eight no votes, has been one of the few to speak out publicly against the concessions that Democrats made to strike a compromise. He complained that the administration traded permanent GOP-friendly tax policy– the extension of tax rates for those below $450,000 – for temporary Democratic priorities. “In essence, this agreement locks in a tax structure that is grossly unfair to middle-class Americans,” Harkin said in a statement after the vote.

But with Obama’s and Biden’s imprimatur, it passed the Senate with ease. Asked on New Year’s Eve what he was telling Democratic senators to win their support, Biden told reporters, “I said, ‘This is Joe Biden, and I’m your buddy.’ ” He was back the next morning doing the same with House Democrats."

Some of the hardest hit would be 2.1 million federal workers who could be spending up to 22 business days at home without pay on a furlough.

The impact of federal food inspectors, park rangers, airport traffic controllers and security personnel staying away from work would be felt by many more Americans.

An important caveat: Congress still may avert the spending cuts, and they aren't expected to bite right away. Experts expect agencies to do all they can to delay the start of furloughs, in some cases by several months.

But these seven cuts would be really felt by many Americans.

1. Shrinking unemployment benefits. Some 3.8 million Americans estimated to collect unemployment checks between March and September will feel the pain the most. That's because unemployment benefit checks are being pared by 9.4%. On average, it would mean a cut of $400 over that period.

2. Beef and chicken to cost more and even face a shortage. A $51 million dollar cut to food safety programs means food inspectors will be furloughed and lead to closures of meat and poultry plants for up to 15 days. Americans will have to pay more and deal with shortages of chicken, eggs, pork and beef, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""Food safety could be compromised,"" he said in a letter. There will be less food available -- by as much as 2 billion pounds of meat, 3 billion pounds of chicken, 200 million pounds of eggs.

3. Granny won't get her lunch. More than 4 million home-bound and disabled seniors may have to go without supper this year because of cuts to Meals on Wheels programs. Just in Erie County, New York, it could mean 36,000 fewer meals will be delivered, according to the Meals On Wheels Association of America.

4. Your preschooler could be stuck at home. Some 70,000 children from lower income families will not be able to enroll for pre-schools and daycare centers run by Head Start programs this fall, thanks to at least $400 million in cuts.

5. National parks will close campgrounds or open late. The National Park Service will lose $110 million from its annual budget. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee plans to close five campgrounds and picnic areas affecting over 54,000 visitors. Two of the main thoroughfares into the Grand Canyon will remain closed until later this year, including the popular West Rim Drive, known for its breathtaking beauty. The delays will affect about 250,000 visitors.

6. Longer lines at the airport. Domestic travelers can add an extra hour to airport security lines, while international travelers may have to wait four hours to clear customs. That's because federal agencies that handle airport security and customs are warning that worker furloughs will increase the time it takes to check passengers.

7. Roofs blown off by Hurricane Sandy won't get repaired. About $3 billion has been cut from a supplemental bill for Hurricane Sandy victims. The cut includes ""crucial funding"" for repair and recovery of some 10,000 homes and small businesses, said HUD Secretary Shaun Donavan last week."

I staggered to the door to discover a big box from Amazon deposited on the stoop, and a U.S. Postal Service truck just rounding the corner on its way to make another Sunday delivery. “What the --?” I asked.

The delivery, as I was presently to learn, was the harbinger of the Postal Service’s new deal with Amazon for Sunday delivery of the online retailer’s packages in big cities. It’s a brilliant move that serves both the partners and customers too. It builds on the Postal Service’s reach in parcel delivery -- the USPS performs the same last-mile service in many communities for UPS and FedEx -- and provides it with a new source of revenue.

But it doesn’t solve the service’s most significant problems, which contributed to its $5-billion loss in the latest fiscal year, reported late last week. One problem is the secular decline in first-class mail, which is unlikely to recover its bygone volume.

But the bigger problem is the enduring hostility to the USPS shown by many conservatives in Congress. It’s because of them that the USPS has maxed out its statutory borrowing authority and faces an annual payment of $5.5 billion into a health fund for its future retirees. The service defaulted on that obligation last year and this year, but it shows up as a liability on its balance sheet and destroys its financial flexibility.

In real terms it’s an obnoxious fiction imposed by a cynical Congress in 2006. Barring the unnecessary healthcare payments, the postal service’s deficit would be manageable -- $5 billion is a bit more than one-tenth of 1% of the federal budget.

We examined the reasons for this congressional hostility last year. As we wrote at the time: “What could explain conservative hostility toward the U.S. Postal Service? After all, most members of Congress, Republican or Democrat, will defend to the death the smallest one-room post office in their district.

“But what about the characteristics of the workforce? It’s heavily and effectively unionized, for one thing. For another, over a long period, the post office has been a reliable steppingstone to the middle class for African American families. (Black workers make up about 11% of the USPS payroll, about twice their representation in the overall workforce.) Maybe some people just think these workers are expendable.”

Things haven’t changed since then. This year’s loss is an improvement over last year’s, when the red ink came to $16 billion, but it’s folly to think that the USPS should turn a profit or even break even.

Congressional conservatives in particular like to argue that the USPS should operate like a business -- if it can’t make money delivering mail to the far-flung corners of the country, it should stop trying. This is the sort of idea that could only be hatched by smug, comfortable politicos and pundits with offices in downtown Washington, D.C., who couldn’t find, say, Supai, Arizona, with a road map. Remote as it is, Supai is entitled to postal delivery at the same flat rate as you pay to deliver to Dupont Circle.

That’s why the post office was written in to the U.S. Constitution -- at the time it was seen as a crucial governmental function binding the nation together. It still is. Treating universal mail service as something that should compete profitably with commercial carriers or die is not only foolhardy, it’s probably unconstitutional. Congress should get over the idea. The Postal Service still covers the whole country, and if it can’t do so without running a deficit, the country should pony up."
http://news.yahoo.com/federal-workers-brace-furloughs-193020586.html,,[],Federal workers brace for furloughs,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- First there was a two-year pay freeze. Now furloughs loom, as federal agencies make personnel costs a prime target for across-the-board budget cuts that went into effect last week. The result: anxiety and low morale in a workforce often envied for its job security.

""It would certainly put a strain on things,"" said Jonathan Schweizer, 61, an environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago who could be forced to take up to 13 days of unpaid leave this year. ""I'd probably have to run up some credit card debt or defer maintenance on my home that I'd otherwise consider important.""

Government agencies vary widely in how they are dealing with the ""sequester,"" as the automatic cuts are called, according to labor unions that represent federal workers. Federal workers could face seven days of furloughs at the Housing and Urban Development Department, while Homeland Security personnel might see twice that number.

More than half of the nation's 2.1 million federal workers could be furloughed over the next six months. The federal government is the country's single largest employer, with its employees making up about 1.2 percent of the nation's work force.

""A lot of people think federal employees are fat-cat bureaucrats in Washington, but they don't realize more than 85 percent of these workers live outside of D.C.,"" said Tim Kauffman, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees. ""A lot of them are not highly paid folks, like VA nurses and emergency response workers.""

AFGE, which represents more than 600,000 federal workers, is trying to keep track of all the different furlough plans as their members face the prospect of lost wages during mandatory time off without pay and growing frustration about getting work done.

It seems the federal workforce is under constant attack these days, particularly from Republican lawmakers who want to shrink government and contend federal employees are overpaid with more generous benefits compared to the private sector. Even President Barack Obama supported the pay freeze, though he has issued an executive order that will give workers a 0.5 percent cost-of-living raise set for April. Still, Congress could take action that prevents the raise from happening.

Story continues

The latest unemployment numbers offered even more bad news for government workers as federal employment, excluding the U.S. Postal Service, shrank by 4,200 jobs last month. That's the fifth straight month of cuts, which may reflect a trend towards greater belt-tightening.

Schweizer conceded that working for the federal government remains a lot more stable than other industries, but he said the comfort level has changed.

""We've definitely been squeezed financially,"" he said. ""People have left and haven't been replaced. That puts more pressure on us as far as getting the job done and it certainly hurts morale in my office.""

Some agencies, including the Justice Department, already have sent out formal furlough notices to workers indicating furloughs of up to 14 days could begin as soon as April. All furloughs are subject to 30-day notices and to bargaining with unions representing government workers.

While the unions can't stop the furloughs, they can try to ease the pain for employees by negotiating different times, allowing employees to swap days, or other changes. Unions are also trying to persuade agencies to make other cuts that don't affect worker pay, such as cutting government contracts with private companies.

The Social Security Administration, for example, says it hopes to avoid furloughs altogether, instead saving money by terminating more than 1,500 temporary and other workers and losing more than 5,000 other positions through attrition.

""In some cases, the agencies can figure out ways to slow down federal contracts instead of taking it out of federal personnel,"" said Patrick Lester, director of fiscal policy for the Center for Effective Government.

But there are limits on flexibility. ""If they are largely personnel-driven, there's no way to avoid personnel-related cuts,"" Lester said.

Meat and poultry inspectors at the Agriculture Department initially were told they might be furloughed for 11 consecutive days between June and July, possibly leading to a meat supply shortage and higher prices. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack backed away from that at a House hearing this week, telling lawmakers that the furloughs would not be consecutive after all.

""Furloughs are going to cause disruption,"" department spokeswoman Courtney Rowe said Wednesday. ""We're looking to do it in ways that cause the minimum impact.""

At the EPA, officials are planning up to 13 furlough days, with the first four coming between April and June 1, said John O'Grady, president of AFGE local 704. There also would be mandatory furlough days on May 24, July 5 and Aug. 30 — coming around the Memorial Day, July Fourth and Labor Day holidays — that would shut the agency entirely, he said.

Some of the longest furloughs are expected at the Defense Department, where about 800,000 civilian employees face up to 22 unpaid days off over the next several months. The agency has not yet specified when those will happen, but some agencies may try to put off furloughs for several months in hopes that Congress will come up with a budget fix.

More flexibility could be coming soon. A House measure passed Wednesday that prevents a shutdown of federal agencies on March 27 also would grant the Pentagon greater latitude in implementing its share of short-term spending cuts. Senate Democrats could try to expand that flexibility to other agencies, potentially reducing the number of workers who are furloughed.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he plans to introduce legislation that would allow the Obama administration to exempt from furloughs essential federal employees, such as those who perform food inspections and other urgent functions, so the consequences of the budget cuts would not harm the economy or public safety.

Border Patrol agents at the Homeland Security Department, for example, face up to 14 days of furloughs and a moratorium on regular overtime pay, which could mean a 35 percent decline in wages for the rest of the fiscal year. Union officials warn that could mean trouble for border security, as agents aren't used to stopping work just because their shifts end, especially if they are chasing drug or gun smugglers.

In September, the Fair Share Housing Center, an advocacy group, sued the state, alleging that it was withholding public information that would show whether low-income and minority citizens were being discriminated against.

The center now says it has evidence showing that black and Hispanic citizens who seek assistance are being turned away in disproportionate numbers. Its data show that 38.1 percent of African-Americans and 20.4 percent of Hispanics who applied for resettlement grants were rejected, against only 14.5 percent of whites. The group says that it found a similar outcome among people who applied for reconstruction or rehabilitation grants: 35.1 percent of African-Americans and 18.1 percent of Latinos were rejected, compared with 13.6 percent of whites.

The center says that its data show low application rates by minority citizens, which might suggest problems with either the state’s outreach efforts or with the application process itself. Gov. Chris Christie has dismissed the center as a “hack group” that deserves no response. His Department of Community Affairs, which oversees the housing recovery effort, says the charge of discrimination is “outrageously false.”

The numbers by themselves do not prove discrimination. But the Christie administration has a poor record when it comes to supporting housing for the poor. Mr. Christie has tried to undermine the state’s affordable housing laws since he took office and would have dismantled the independent agency that promotes affordable housing had the New Jersey Supreme Court not barred him from doing so earlier this year."
